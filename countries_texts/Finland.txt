Based upon linguistic evidence, Finland seems to have been primarily inhabited by speakers of [[Paleo-European languages|Paleo-European]] languages prior to the migration of the Finno-Ugric peoples, which influenced the [[Sámi languages]] who were the first Finno-Ugric peoples to move towards Finland.

In the [[Iron Age]], population grew. [[Finland Proper]] was the most densely populated area. Commercial contacts in the [[Baltic Sea]] region grew and extended during the eighth and ninth centuries. Main exports from Finland were furs, slaves, [[castoreum]], and falcons to European courts. Imports included silk and other fabrics, jewelry, [[Ulfberht swords]], and, in lesser extent, glass. Production of iron started approximately in 500 BC.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Muinaisuutemme jäljet|first1=Georg|last1=Haggren|first2=Petri|last2=Halinen|first3=Mika|last3=Lavento|first4=Sami|last4=Raninen|first5=Anna|last5=Wessman|publisher=Gaudeamus |year=2015 |location=Helsinki |pages=332, 364–365}}</ref> At the end of the ninth century, indigenous artefact culture, especially weapons and women's jewelry, had more common local features than ever before.

An early form of [[Finnic languages]] spread to the Baltic Sea region approximately 1900 BC. Common Finnic language was spoken around [[Gulf of Finland]] 2000 years ago.

===Grand Duchy of Finland===

The Swedish era ended with the [[Finnish War]] of 1809.

Although Swedish was still widely spoken, the Finnish language began to gain recognition during this period. From the 1860s, a strong Finnish [[Ethnic nationalism|nationalist movement]], known as the [[Fennoman movement]], grew. One of the movement's most prominent leaders was the philosopher and politician [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman|J.V.

From 1869 to 1917, the Russian Empire pursued [[Russification of Finland|a policy of Russification]], which was suspended between 1905 and 1908. In 1906, [[universal suffrage]] was introduced in the Grand Duchy of Finland. However, relations between the Grand Duchy of Finland and the Russian Empire soured when the Russian government began to take steps to restrict Finland's special status and autonomy. For example, universal suffrage was virtually meaningless in practice, as the [[tsar]] did not have to approve any of the laws passed by the Finnish parliament. The desire for independence gained ground, first among radical [[Liberalism|liberals]]<ref>Mickelsson, Rauli (2007). ''Suomen puolueet—Historia, muutos ja nykypäivä''. Vastapaino. {{in lang|fi}}</ref> and [[Socialism|socialists]], partly driven by a declaration called the'' [[February Manifesto]]'' by the last tsar of the Russian Empire, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], on 15 February 1899.<ref>Alenius, Kari.

===Civil war and early independence===
{{Main|Independence of Finland|Finnish Civil War}}
After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, Finland's position as a Grand Duchy under the rule of the Russian Empire was questioned. The [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish parliament]], controlled by the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]], passed the so-called [[Independence of Finland#Power act|Power Act]] to give the parliament supreme authority. This was rejected by the [[Russian Provisional Government]], which decided to dissolve the parliament.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/finland/15.htm The Finnish Civil War, Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228235436/http://countrystudies.us/finland/15.htm |date=28 December 2016 }}.

Some social democrats refused to accept the result, claiming that the dissolution of parliament and the subsequent elections were extra-legal. The two almost equally powerful political blocs, the right-wing parties and the Social Democratic Party, were deeply divided.

The [[October Revolution]] in Russia changed the geopolitical situation once again. Suddenly the right-wing parties in Finland began to reconsider their decision to block the transfer of supreme executive power from the Russian government to Finland when the [[Bolsheviks]] came to power in Russia. The right-wing government, led by Prime Minister [[P. E.

This partial Soviet success led to a stalemate and later an [[Moscow Armistice|armistice]]. This was followed by the [[Lapland War]] of 1944–1945, when Finland fought retreating German forces in northern Finland. 

The [[Moscow Armistice|Armistice]] and [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|treaty]] signed with the Soviet Union in 1944 and 1948 included Finnish obligations, restraints, and reparations, as well as further territorial concessions. As a result of the two wars, Finland lost 12% of its land area, 20% of its industrial capacity, its second largest city, [[Vyborg]] ({{langx|fi|Viipuri}}), and the ice-free port of [[Liinakhamari]] ({{langx|fi|Liinahamari}}).<ref name=":4" /> The Finns lost around 97,000 soldiers and were forced to pay war reparations initially set at $300 million in 1938 prices, later adjusted to $226.5 million.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gamla hamn i Jakobstad |url=https://www.gamla-hamn.fi/en/vega/bordan_vi_fick_bara |access-date=9 April 2025 |website=www.gamla-hamn.fi}}</ref> However, the country avoided occupation by Soviet forces and managed to retain its independence.

In the decades following World War II, the [[Communist Party of Finland|Communists]] were a strong political party. Furthermore, the Soviet Union persuaded Finland to refuse [[Marshall Plan]] aid.

===After the war===
[[File:Urho-Kekkonen-1975b (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Urho Kekkonen]] was Finland's longest-serving president in 1956–1982.]]
The development of trade with the Western powers, such as the United Kingdom, and the payment of reparations to the Soviet Union led to Finland's transformation from a primarily [[agrarian society]] to an industrialised one. [[Valmet]], originally a shipyard and then several metal workshops, was established to produce materials for war reparations. After the reparations were paid, Finland continued to trade with the Soviet Union as part of [[bilateral trade]].

In 1950, 46% of Finnish workers were employed in agriculture and a third lived in urban areas, but new jobs in manufacturing, services and trade quickly attracted people to the cities.<ref name="populationdevelopment">{{cite web |url=https://stat.fi/tup/suomi90/joulukuu_en.html |title=Population development in independent Finland—greying Baby Boomers |date=5 December 2007 |website= |publisher=Statistics Finland |access-date=13 May 2024 |quote=Finland 1917–2007 |archive-date=13 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240513192149/https://stat.fi/tup/suomi90/joulukuu_en.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The average number of births per woman fell from a [[baby boom]] peak of 3.5 in 1947 to 1.5 in 1973. As the baby boomers entered the workforce, the economy failed to create jobs fast enough and hundreds of thousands emigrated to more industrialised Sweden, with emigration peaking in 1969 and 1970.<ref name="populationdevelopment" /> Finland participated in trade liberalisation in the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]].

During the [[Cold War]], Finland officially embraced a policy of [[Neutral country|neutrality]]. The [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|YYA Treaty]] (Finno-Soviet Pact of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance) recognized Finland's desire to remain outside great-power conflicts. From 1956 president [[Urho Kekkonen]] had a virtual monopoly on relations with the Soviet Union, which was crucial to his continued popularity. In politics, there was a tendency to avoid any policy or statement that could be interpreted as anti-Soviet. This phenomenon was dubbed "[[Finlandisation]]" by the West German press.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ford|first=Hal|title=ESAU -LVI – ''FINLANDIZATION'' IN ACTION: HELSINKI'S EXPERIENCE WITH MOSCOW|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/esau-55.pdf|series=DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE|date=August 1972|access-date=16 August 2020|archive-date=1 December 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201201214712/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/esau-55.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A [[market economy]] was maintained in Finland. Various industries benefited from trade privileges with the Soviets. Economic growth was rapid in the post-war period, and by 1975 Finland's GDP per capita was the 15th highest in the world. During the 1970s and 1980s, Finland built one of the most extensive [[welfare state]]s in the world. In 1973, Finland negotiated a treaty with the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) that reduced tariffs, enhancing trade relations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Finland GDP Per Capita 1960-2025 |url=https://macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/FIN/finland/gdp-per-capita |access-date=10 April 2025 |website=macrotrends.net}}</ref>
