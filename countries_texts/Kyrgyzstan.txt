===Early history===
[[File:Sary_-_Kamysh,_Kyrgyz_Republic_petroglyphs.jpg|thumb|Petroglyphs of local [[Urial|sheep]], Sary Kamysh]]
The [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] state reached its greatest expansion after defeating the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] in 840 AD.<ref name="Kyrgyzstan timeline">{{Cite news |date=12 June 2010 |title=Kyrgyzstan timeline |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16185772}}</ref> From the tenth century, the Kyrgyz migrated as far as the Tian Shan range and maintained their dominance over this territory for about 200 years.

There is a storytelling tradition of the ''[[Epic of Manas]]'', which involves a warrior who unified all of the scattered tribes into a single nation in the 9th century. The trilogy, an element of the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List]], expresses the memory of the nomadic Kyrgyz people.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Browse the Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage and the Register of good safeguarding practices |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/lists |access-date=2025-04-01 |website=unesco.org}}</ref>

In the 12th century, the Kyrgyz dominion had shrunk to the [[Altay Mountains|Altay]] Range and [[Sayan Mountains]] as a result of the [[Mongols before Genghis Khan|Mongol expansion]]. With the rise of the [[Mongol Empire]] in the thirteenth century, the Kyrgyz migrated south. The Kyrgyz peacefully became a part of the Mongol Empire in 1207.

[[Issyk Kul Lake]] was a stopover on the Silk Road, a land route for traders, merchants, and other travelers from the Far East to Europe.
Kyrgyz tribes were overrun in the 17th century by the Mongols, in the mid-18th century by the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and in the early 19th century by the Uzbek [[Khanate of Kokand]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kyrgyzstan – Mongol Domination |url=https://countrystudies.us/kyrgyzstan/2.htm |access-date=2025-05-19 |website=countrystudies.us}}</ref> In 1842, the Kyrgyz tribes broke away from Kokand and united into the [[Kara-Kyrgyz Khanate]], led by [[Ormon Khan]]. Following Ormon's death in 1854, the khanate disintegrated.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Osmonov |first=Oskon Dzhusupbekovich |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KWqAQAACAAJ |title=A History of Kyrgyzstan: From Stone Age to the Present |publisher=Sarybaev TT |year=2016 |isbn=978-9967-04-680-1 |edition=2 |location=Bishkek |access-date=3 October 2022}}</ref>

===Russian conquest===
In the late nineteenth century, the eastern part of what is today Kyrgyzstan, mainly the [[Issyk-Kul Region]], was ceded to the [[Russian Empire]] by [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] through the [[Treaty of Tarbagatai]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Chinese Empire. |url=https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~29863~1140598:Chinese-Empire- |access-date=2025-05-19 |website=www.davidrumsey.com}}</ref> The territory, then known in Russian as "Kirghizia", was formally incorporated into the Empire in 1876. The Russian takeover was met with numerous revolts, and many of the Kyrgyz opted to relocate to the [[Pamir Mountains]] and Afghanistan.{{Citation needed|date=November 2025}}

In addition, the suppression of the [[Central Asian revolt of 1916|1916 rebellion]] against Russian rule in Central Asia caused many Kyrgyz later to migrate to China.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Uzbekistan – The Jadidists and Basmachis |url=https://countrystudies.us/uzbekistan/10.htm |access-date=2025-05-19 |website=countrystudies.us}}</ref> Since many ethnic groups in the region were, and still are, split between neighboring states at a time when borders were more porous and less regulated, it was common to move back and forth over the mountains, depending on where life was perceived as better; this might mean better rains for pasture or better government during oppression.<sup>&#x5B;''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]''&#x5D;</sup>

===Soviet Kyrgyzstan===
Soviet power was initially established in the region in 1919, and the Kara-Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast was created within the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (SFSR). The phrase Kara-Kirghiz was used until the mid-1920s by the Russians to distinguish them from the [[Kazakhs]], who were also referred to as Kirghiz. On 5 December 1936, the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]] was established as a constituent [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Union Republic]] of the [[Soviet Union]].{{efn|The Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic was initially part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic as the Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic before being elevated to a full Union Republic on 5 December 1936.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kyrgyzstan/Kyrgyzstan-in-the-Soviet-Union |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=2025-06-10}}</ref>}}

After the [[Russian Civil War]], the period of the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), began, which lasted roughly to 1928.<ref name="Thomas 1">{{Cite book |last=Thomas |first=Alun |title=Nomads and Soviet Rule: Central Asia under Lenin and Stalin |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |year=2019 |isbn=978-1350143685 |edition=Paperback}}</ref> The [[Bolsheviks]] made an effort to establish a standardized tax system, with higher taxes for nomads to discourage the wandering livelihood and they divided the Central Asia region into five nation-states.<ref name="Thomas 1" /><ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Stolberg |first=Eva-Maria |url=https://www.hsozkult.de/publicationreview/id/reb-7534 |title=Book review – Edgar, Adrienne Lynn: Tribal Nation.

By the end of the 1920s, the Soviet Union developed a series of [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plans]], centered around [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|industrialization]] and the [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization of agriculture]], including the creation of huge "[[kolkhoz]]" [[collective farming]] systems, needed to feed the new workers in the industries.<ref>{{Cite news |date=17 June 2015 |title=1929 |work=Seventeen Moments in Soviet History |url=http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1929-2/ |access-date=2018-03-25}}</ref> Because of the plan's reliance on rapidity, major economic and cultural changes had to occur, which led to conflicts. In Kyrgyzstan, Russian settlers acquired the best pasture land, creating much hardship for most of its original inhabitants, [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]], Kyrgyz and [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] nomads, who were also forced to settle down on soil that hadn't enough agricultural potential.<ref name="Edgar 2004 296" /><ref name="Britannica 1">{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Kyrgyz people |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Kyrgyz-people |date=2 May 2025 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> The changes caused unrest, and between 1928 and 1932, nomads and peasants made it clear through methods like passive resistance that they did not agree with these policies, in the Kirgiziya area also guerrilla opposition occurred.<ref name="Thomas 1" /><ref name="Edgar 2004 296" /><ref name="Britannica 1" /> The region suffered relatively more deaths from collectivization than any other.<ref name="Thomas 1" />

The early years of [[glasnost]], in the late 1980s, had little effect on the political climate in Kyrgyzstan.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://journals.openedition.org/asiecentrale/3259?lang=en |title="And Our Words Must be Constructive!"

Unofficial political groups were forbidden, but several groups that emerged in 1989 to deal with the acute housing crisis were permitted to function.<sup>&#x5B;''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]''&#x5D;</sup>

According to the last Soviet census in 1989, ethnic Kyrgyz made up only 22% of the residents of the northern city of [[Bishkek|Frunze]] (now Bishkek), while more than 60% were Russians, Ukrainians, and people from other [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] nations. Nearly 10% of the capital's population were Jewish (very unusual in the Soviet Union, the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]] being an exception).

In June 1990, ethnic tensions between [[Uzbeks]] and Kyrgyz surfaced in the [[Osh Region]] (southern Kyrgyzstan), where Uzbeks form a minority of the population.<ref name="conflict">{{Cite news |date=15 February 2006 |title=KYRGYZSTAN: Economic disparities driving inter-ethnic conflict |publisher=[[The New Humanitarian|IRIN]] Asia |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=33728}}</ref> The tensions between Kyrgyzs and Uzbeks in Osis led to 186 deaths.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kyrgyzstan |url=https://communistcrimes.org/en/countries/kyrgyzstan |access-date=2020-11-24 |website=Kyrgyzstan {{!}} Communist Crimes}}</ref> Attempts to appropriate Uzbek collective farms for housing development triggered the [[Osh riots (1990)|Osh Riots]].

By then, the [[Democratic Movement of Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyzstan Democratic Movement]] (KDM) had developed into a significant political force with support in Parliament. On 15 December 1990, the Supreme Soviet voted to change the republic's name to the ''Republic of Kyrgyzstan''. The following January, Akayev introduced new government structures and appointed a new cabinet composed mainly of younger, reform-oriented politicians. In February 1991, the name of the capital, Frunze, was changed back to its pre-revolutionary name of Bishkek.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Refugees |first=United Nations High Commissioner for |title=Refworld {{!}} Chronology for Russians in Kyrgyzstan |url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/469f38b01e.html |access-date=2021-01-05 |website=Refworld}}</ref>

Despite these political moves toward independence, economic realities seemed to work against secession from the Soviet Union. In a referendum on the preservation of the Soviet Union in March 1991, 88.7% of the voters approved the proposal to retain the Soviet Union as a "renewed federation".<ref name="Britannica 1" /> Nevertheless, secessionist forces pushed Kyrgyzstan's independence through in August of that same year.<sup>&#x5B;''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]''&#x5D;</sup>

On 19 August 1991, when the [[State Committee on the State of Emergency|State Emergency Committee]] assumed power in Moscow, there was an attempt to depose Akayev in Kyrgyzstan. After the coup collapsed the following week, Akayev and Vice President [[German Kuznetsov]] announced their resignations from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), and the entire bureau and secretariat resigned. This was followed by the Supreme Soviet vote declaring independence from the Soviet Union on 31 August 1991 as the ''Republic of Kyrgyzstan''.<ref name="Britannica 2">{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Kyrgyzstan |last1=Sinor |first1=Denis |last2=Allworth |first2=Edward|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kyrgyzstan |date=16 August 2025|encyclopedia =Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>

According to a 2013 [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] poll, 62% of Kyrgyz people say that the collapse of the Soviet Union harmed their country, while only 16% said that the collapse benefitted it.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Esipova |first1=Neli |last2=Ray |first2=Julie |date=19 December 2013 |title=Former Soviet Countries See More Harm From Breakup |url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/166538/former-soviet-countries-harm-breakup.aspx |website=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]}}</ref>

===Independence===
In October 1991, Akayev ran unopposed and was elected president of the new independent republic by direct ballot, receiving 95 percent of the votes cast. Together with representatives of seven other Republics that same month, he signed the [[Treaty of the Economic Community]]. The new leaders of three out of four Soviet Union's founding republics, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, on 8 December 1991 signed the [[Belavezha Accords]], denouncing the [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|Union Treaty of 1922]], declaring that the Union would cease to exist and proclaimed the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) in its place.<ref>{{Cite web |first1=Kavitha |last1=Surana |first2=Ruby |last2=Mellen |title=The Last Days of the Soviet Union |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/slideshow/the-last-days-of-the-soviet-union/ |access-date=2022-12-10 |website=Foreign Policy |date=22 December 2016}}</ref>

=== 21st century ===
==== 2000–2009 ====
In February and March 2005, parliamentary elections were held, which the opposition and international observers criticized for alleged irregularities. Widespread protests erupted, leading to the ousting of President Askar Akayev, who fled the country and resigned in April 2005. This series of events became known as the [[Tulip Revolution]]. Subsequently, [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]], a former prime minister and opposition leader, assumed the presidency after winning the July 2005 presidential election with a significant majority.<ref>{{Cite news |title=A tulip revolution |url=https://www.economist.com/unknown/2005/03/24/a-tulip-revolution |access-date=2025-04-01 |newspaper=The Economist |issn=0013-0613}}</ref><ref name=":2">Marat E.

After assuming office, President Bakiyev faced challenges, including political unrest and demands for constitutional reforms. In 2006 and 2007, large-scale protests occurred, with citizens calling for a reduction in presidential powers and increased governmental transparency. In response, Bakiyev implemented constitutional amendments and appointed opposition figures to key positions. Despite these measures, tensions persisted throughout his tenure.<ref name=":2" />

Throughout the decade, Kyrgyzstan grappled with economic difficulties, including energy shortages and rising utility prices. In 2009, the government announced significant increases in electricity and heating tariffs, leading to public discontent. Additionally, the country faced challenges related to corruption and organized crime, which impacted its social and economic development.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Stratfor: The World's Leading Geopolitical Intelligence Platform |url=https://worldview.stratfor.com:443/ |access-date=2025-04-01 |website=worldview.stratfor.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Kyrgyzstan: Utility Price Hike Squeezes Citizens |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav020810.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012062753/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav020810.shtml |archive-date=12 October 2017 |access-date=2025-04-01 |website=EurasiaNet.org |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== 2010–2019 ====
In April 2010, widespread protests erupted against President Kurmanbek Bakiyev's administration, driven by public discontent over corruption and rising energy prices. These demonstrations [[2010 Kyrgyz Revolution|culminated in Bakiyev's ousting]] and the establishment of a provisional government led by [[Roza Otunbayeva]]. Subsequently, in June 2010, violent ethnic clashes occurred in the southern cities of [[Osh]] and [[Jalal-Abad]] between Kyrgyz and Uzbek communities, resulting in over 400 deaths and displacing thousands.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=Kyrgyzstan: Freedom in the World 2019 Country Report |url=https://freedomhouse.org/country/kyrgyzstan/freedom-world/2019 |access-date=2025-04-01 |website=Freedom House}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Society |first=The Oxus |date=13 January 2021 |title=Ten Years Gone: The Legacy of the 2010 Revolution and Ethnic Violence in Kyrgyzstan: A Roundtable – The Oxus Society for Central Asian Affairs |url=https://oxussociety.org/ten-years-gone-the-legacy-of-the-2010-revolution-and-ethnic-violence-in-kyrgyzstan-a-roundtable/ |access-date=2025-04-01}}</ref>

Following these events, a referendum was held in June 2010 to adopt a new constitution aimed at reducing presidential powers and enhancing parliamentary authority. The referendum passed with approximately 90% approval and a 70% voter turnout, despite challenges posed by recent unrest. This constitution introduced a single six-year term for the president without the possibility of re-election and limited any single political party to 65 of the 120 parliamentary seats to prevent power concentration.<ref name=":3" />

Under the new constitutional framework, Kyrgyzstan held its first parliamentary elections in October 2010, which were noted for their peaceful conduct and absence of major voting irregularities. In 2011, [[Almazbek Atambayev]] was elected president, serving until 2017. His tenure focused on stabilizing the country and implementing democratic reforms, including the introduction of biometric registration to enhance electoral transparency. In 2017, [[Sooronbay Jeenbekov]] succeeded Atambayev as president, continuing efforts to strengthen democratic institutions and address ongoing challenges such as corruption and economic development.<ref name="Britannica 2"/>

Significant reforms were undertaken during this period, including the abolition of military courts in December 2016 to streamline the judicial system and enhance civilian oversight. Additionally, the Ministry of Defense was restructured into the State Committee for Defense Affairs, with operational control of the armed forces transferred to the [[Staff (military)|General Staff]] to improve military efficiency and accountability.<sup>&#x5B;''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]''&#x5D;</sup>

In 2016, Kyrgyzstan commemorated the centennial of the 1916 uprising against Tsarist Russia, known as [[Central Asian revolt of 1916|Urkun]], by unveiling a monument at the [[Ata-Beyit|Ata-Beyit memorial]] complex.<sup>&#x5B;''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]''&#x5D;</sup>

==== Since 2020 ====
In October 2020, [[2020 Kyrgyz Revolution|widespread protests]] erupted in response to disputed parliamentary election results, leading to the annulment of the elections and the resignation of President [[Sooronbay Jeenbekov]]. Amid the unrest, [[Sadyr Japarov]], a nationalist politician previously imprisoned, was released and subsequently appointed as interim president and prime minister. His rapid ascent to power was facilitated by parliamentary approval under contentious circumstances. In January 2021, Japarov was elected president in a landslide victory.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite web |last=guillermo |title=Kyrgyzstan: Central Asia's Island of Democracy Sinks Into Authoritarianism – Foreign Policy Research Institute |url=https://www.fpri.org/article/2024/04/kyrgyzstan-central-asias-island-of-democracy-sinks-into-authoritarianism/ |access-date=2025-04-01 |website=www.fpri.org}}</ref><ref name=":6">{{Cite news |date=10 October 2024 |title=Au Kirghizistan, la condamnation de journalistes et militants anticorruption confirme le tournant autoritaire du régime |trans-title=In Kyrgyzstan, the conviction of journalists and anti-corruption activists confirms the authoritarian shift of the regime. |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2024/10/10/au-kirghizistan-la-condamnation-de-journalistes-et-militants-anticorruption-confirme-le-tournant-autoritaire-du-regime_6348415_3210.html |access-date=2025-04-01 |language=fr}}</ref><ref name=turgunbayeva>{{Cite web |title=Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan sign deal to end long-running border dispute|last1=Turgunbayeva |first1=Aigerim |last2=Gordeyeva |first2=Mariya |website=[[Reuters]] |date=13 March 2025 |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/kyrgyzstan-tajikistan-sign-deal-end-long-running-border-dispute-2025-03-13/}}</ref>

Following his election, President Japarov initiated a series of constitutional reforms aimed at shifting the country's governance structure from a parliamentary to a presidential system. A referendum held in January 2021 approved these changes, granting the president expanded powers, including the authority to appoint judges and diminishing the role of parliament. Critics labeled the new constitution the "Khanstitution," expressing concerns over the potential for authoritarian rule.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7">{{Cite web |title=Kyrgyzstan's president dismisses prime minister |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/kyrgyzstans-president-dismisses-prime-minister-ria-reports-2024-12-16/ |access-date=2025-05-19 |website=[[Reuters]]|date=16 December 2024 }}</ref>

Additionally, a "[[foreign agent|foreign representatives]]" law came into effect in April 2024, imposing strict government oversight on NGOs receiving foreign funding.<ref>{{Citation |last=Human Rights Watch |title=Kyrgyzstan: Events of 2024 |date=16 January 2025 |work=Share this via Facebook |url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/kyrgyzstan |access-date=2025-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Pikulicka-Wilczewska |first=Agnieszka |date=28 October 2024 |title='They want to show no one can escape': how the long arm of Russia is reaching out for Putin critics in exile |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/28/long-arm-russia-putin-critics-in-exile |access-date=2025-04-01 |work=The Guardian |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref name=":6" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Kyrgyz court finds four journalists guilty of inciting unrest |website=[[Reuters]] |date=10 October 2024 |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/kyrgyz-court-finds-four-journalists-guilty-inciting-unrest-2024-10-10/}}</ref>

Kyrgyzstan's longstanding border disputes with neighboring Tajikistan escalated into violent clashes, notably around the town of [[Batken]] in 2021 and 2022, culminating in a six-day conflict in September 2022.
