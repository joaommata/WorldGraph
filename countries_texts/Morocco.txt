DNA studies of [[Iberomaurusian]] peoples at [[Taforalt]], Morocco dating to around 15,000 years ago have found them to have a distinctive Maghrebi ancestry formed from a mixture of [[Near East]]ern and African ancestry, which is still found as a part of the genome of modern Northwest Africans.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=van de Loosdrecht |first1=Marieke |last2=Bouzouggar |first2=Abdeljalil |last3=Humphrey |first3=Louise |last4=Posth |first4=Cosimo |last5=Barton |first5=Nick |last6=Aximu-Petri |first6=Ayinuer |last7=Nickel |first7=Birgit |last8=Nagel |first8=Sarah |last9=Talbi |first9=El Hassan |last10=El Hajraoui |first10=Mohammed Abdeljalil |last11=Amzazi |first11=Saaïd |last12=Hublin |first12=Jean-Jacques |last13=Pääbo |first13=Svante |last14=Schiffels |first14=Stephan |last15=Meyer |first15=Matthias |date=2018-05-04 |title=Pleistocene North African genomes link Near Eastern and sub-Saharan African human populations |url=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar8380 |journal=Science |language=en |volume=360 |issue=6388 |pages=548–552 |doi=10.1126/science.aar8380 |pmid=29545507 |bibcode=2018Sci...360..548V |issn=0036-8075}}</ref> Later during the [[Neolithic]], from around 7,500 years ago onwards, there was a migration into Northwest Africa of [[Early European Farmers|European Neolithic Farmers]] from the Iberian Peninsula (who had originated in [[Anatolia]] several thousand years prior), as well as pastoralists from the [[Levant]], both of whom also significantly contributed to the ancestry of modern Northwest Africans.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Simões |first1=Luciana G. |last2=Günther |first2=Torsten |last3=Martínez-Sánchez |first3=Rafael M. |last4=Vera-Rodríguez |first4=Juan Carlos |last5=Iriarte |first5=Eneko |last6=Rodríguez-Varela |first6=Ricardo |last7=Bokbot |first7=Youssef |last8=Valdiosera |first8=Cristina |last9=Jakobsson |first9=Mattias |date=2023-06-15 |title=Northwest African Neolithic initiated by migrants from Iberia and Levant |journal=Nature |language=en |volume=618 |issue=7965 |pages=550–556 |doi=10.1038/s41586-023-06166-6 |issn=0028-0836 |pmc=10266975 |pmid=37286608|bibcode=2023Natur.618..550S }}</ref> The [[Proto-Berber language|proto-Berber]] tribes evolved from these prehistoric communities during the late [[Bronze Age|Bronze]]- and early [[Iron Age|Iron]] ages.<ref>Mário Curtis Giordani, ''História da África.

In the early part of [[Classical Antiquity]], Northwest Africa and Morocco were slowly drawn into the wider emerging [[Mediterranean]] world by the [[Phoenicians]], who established trading colonies and settlements there, the most substantial of which were [[Chellah]], [[Lixus (ancient city)|Lixus]], and [[Mogador]].<ref>{{cite web |author=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17926 |title=C.

Morocco later became a realm of the Northwest African civilisation of [[ancient Carthage]], and part of the Carthaginian empire. The earliest known independent Moroccan state was the [[Mauretania|Berber kingdom of Mauretania]], under King [[Baga (king)|Baga]].<ref>[[Livy]] ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita Libri]]'' 29.30</ref> This ancient kingdom (not to be confused with the modern state of [[Mauritania]]) flourished around 225&nbsp;BC or earlier. [[Mauretania]] became a [[Client state|client]] kingdom of the [[Roman Empire]] in 33 BC. Emperor [[Claudius]] annexed Mauretania directly in 44 AD, making it a [[Roman province]] ruled by an imperial [[governor]] (either a ''procurator Augusti'', or a ''legatus Augusti pro praetore'').

[[Christianity]] in Morocco appeared during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, when it was practiced by [[Berber Christians]] in Roman [[Mauretania Tingitana]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Asiwaju | first=A.I. |date=January 1985 | title=Partitioned Africans: Ethnic Relations Across Africa's International Boundaries | publisher=C. Hurst & Co |isbn=0-905838-91-2 | page=237 }}</ref> During the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], parts of Mauretania were reconquered by Berbers. By the late 3rd century, direct Roman rule had become confined to a few coastal cities, such as Septum ([[Ceuta]]) in [[Mauretania Tingitana]] and [[Cherchell]] in [[Mauretania Caesariensis]]. When, in 429 AD, the area was devastated by the [[Vandals]], the Roman Empire lost its remaining possessions in Mauretania, and local [[Mauro-Roman kingdom|Mauro-Roman kings]] assumed control of them. In the 530s, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], under Byzantine control, re-established direct imperial rule of Septum and [[Tingi]], fortified Tingis and erected a church.

The [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]] that had begun during the mid-7th century was completed under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] by 709. The caliphate introduced both [[Islam]] and the Arabic language to the area; this period also saw the beginning of a trend of [[Arab migration to the Maghreb]] which would last for centuries and effect a demographic shift in the region. While constituting part of the larger empire, Morocco was initially organised as a subsidiary province of [[Ifriqiya]], with the local governors appointed by the Muslim governor in [[Kairouan]].<ref>Abun-Nasr 1987, p.33</ref>

The indigenous Berber tribes adopted Islam, but retained their [[customary law]]s. They also paid taxes and tribute to the new Muslim administration.<ref>Abun-Nasr 1987, pp. 33–34</ref> The first independent Muslim state in the area of modern Morocco was the [[Kingdom of Nekor]], an emirate in the [[Rif Mountains]]. It was founded by [[Salih I ibn Mansur]] in 710, as a client state to the Umayyad Caliphate. After the outbreak of the [[Berber Revolt]] in 739, the Berbers formed other independent states such as the [[Miknasa]] of [[Sijilmasa]] and the [[Barghawata]].

The founder of the [[Idrisid dynasty]] and the great-grandson of [[Hasan ibn Ali]], [[Idris ibn Abdallah]], had fled to Morocco after the massacre of his family by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] in the [[Hejaz]]. He convinced the Awraba Berber tribes to break their allegiance to the distant Abbasid caliphs and he founded the Idrisid dynasty in 788. The Idrisids established [[Fes, Morocco|Fes]] as their capital and Morocco became a centre of Muslim learning and a major [[regional power]]. The Idrisids were ousted in 927 by the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] and their Miknasa allies. After Miknasa broke off relations with the Fatimids in 932, they were removed from power by the [[Maghrawa]] of Sijilmasa in 980.

In 1549, the region fell to successive Arab dynasties claiming descent from the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]: first the [[Saadi dynasty]] who ruled from 1549 to 1659, and then the [[Alawi dynasty]], who have remained in power since the 17th century. Morocco faced aggression from [[Spain]] in the north, and the Ottoman Empire's allies pressing westward.

Under the Saadis, the sultanate [[Portuguese succession crisis of 1580|ended the Portuguese Aviz dynasty]] in 1578 at the [[Battle of Alcácer Quibir]]. The reign of [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] brought new wealth and prestige to the Sultanate, and a [[Saadian invasion of the Songhai Empire|large expedition]] to West Africa inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[Songhay Empire]] in 1591.

As Europe industrialised, Northwest Africa was increasingly prized for its potential for colonisation.

Tens of thousands of colonists entered Morocco. Some bought up large amounts of rich agricultural land, while others organised the exploitation and modernisation of mines and harbours. Interest groups that formed among these elements continually pressured France to increase its control over Morocco – with some Moroccan tribes allying with the French against other competing tribes from early on in its conquest. The French colonial administrator, Governor general Marshal [[Hubert Lyautey]], sincerely admired Moroccan culture and succeeded in imposing a joint Moroccan-French administration, while creating a modern school system. Several divisions of Moroccan soldiers ([[Goumier]]s or regular troops and officers) served in the [[French army]] in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and in the Spanish [[Francoism|Nationalist Army]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and after (''[[Regulares]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url-status=live |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-morocco-spain-war-idUSTRE50E0NT20090115 |title=Morocco tackles painful role in Spain's past |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210817235436/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-morocco-spain-war-idUSTRE50E0NT20090115 |archive-date=17 August 2021 |website=Reuters |date=14 January 2009 |first1=Zakia |last1=Abdennebi }}</ref> The institution of [[slavery in Morocco|slavery]] was abolished in 1925.<ref>{{cite web |url-status=live |publisher=Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada |url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ad6164.html |title=Morocco: Date of the abolishment of slavery in Morocco; whether descendants of ex-slaves are singled out in any way; and fate of the Palace household and grounds staff when King Mohamed V was in exile |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203121733/http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ad6164.html |archive-date=3 February 2014 |date=13 August 1999 |series=MAR32476.E |via=Refworld}}</ref>

In 1943, the [[Istiqlal Party]] (Independence Party) was founded to press for independence, with discreet US support.

A month later Spain forsook its protectorate in Northern Morocco to the new state but kept its two coastal enclaves ([[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]) on the Mediterranean coast which dated from earlier conquests, but over which Morocco still claims [[sovereignty]] to this day.

=== Post-independence ===
Sultan Mohammed became King in 1957. Upon the death of Mohammed V, [[Hassan II of Morocco|Hassan II]] became King of Morocco on 3 March 1961. Morocco held its first [[Moroccan parliamentary election, 1963|general elections in 1963]]. However, Hassan declared a state of emergency and suspended parliament in 1965. In 1971 and 1972, there were two failed attempts to depose the king and establish a republic. A truth commission set up in 2005 to investigate human rights abuses during his reign confirmed nearly 10,000 cases, ranging from death in detention to forced exile. Some 592 people were recorded killed during Hassan's rule according to the truth commission.

In 1963, the [[Sand War]] was fought between Algerian and Moroccan troops over Moroccan claims to parts of Algerian territory. A formal peace agreement was signed in February 1964; however, relations remained strained between the two countries following the conflict.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Farsoun |first1=Karen |last2=Paul |first2=Jim |date=1976 |title=War in the Sahara: 1963 |journal=MERIP Reports |issue=45 |pages=13–16 |doi=10.2307/3011767 |jstor=3011767 |issn=0047-7265 }}</ref> The Spanish [[enclave]] of [[Ifni]] in the south was returned to Morocco in 1969.<ref>{{Cite news |date=1969-01-05 |title=Spanish Return Ifni to Morocco |language=en |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/01/05/archives/spanish-return-ifni-to-morocco.html |access-date=2023-08-13 |archive-date=13 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230813010516/https://www.nytimes.com/1969/01/05/archives/spanish-return-ifni-to-morocco.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Polisario movement]] was formed in 1973, with the aim of establishing an independent state in the Spanish Sahara. On 6 November 1975, King Hassan asked for volunteers to cross into the Spanish Sahara. Some 350,000 civilians were reported as being involved in the "[[Green March]]".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14123260 |title=Morocco profile – Timeline |work=BBC News |date=19 September 2012 |access-date=9 January 2013 |archive-date=23 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223035216/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14123260 |url-status=live }}</ref> A month later, Spain agreed to leave the Spanish Sahara, soon to become Western Sahara, and to transfer it to joint Moroccan-Mauritanian control, despite the objections and threats of military intervention by Algeria.

Moroccan and Algerian troops [[Western Sahara War|soon clashed in Western Sahara]]. Morocco and Mauritania divided up Western Sahara. Fighting between the Moroccan military and Polisario forces continued for many years. The prolonged war was a considerable financial drain on Morocco. In 1983, Hassan cancelled planned elections amid political unrest and economic crisis. In 1984, Morocco left the Organisation of African Unity in protest at the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|SADR]]'s admission to the body.
