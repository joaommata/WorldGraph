In 1964, it was proposed to relocate the population of Nauru to [[Curtis Island (Queensland)|Curtis Island]] off the coast of [[Queensland]], Australia. By that time, Nauru had been extensively mined for phosphate by companies from Australia, Britain, and New Zealand, damaging the landscape so much that it was thought the island would be uninhabitable by the 1990s. Rehabilitating the island was seen as financially impossible. In 1962, [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[Robert Menzies]] said that the three countries involved in the mining had an obligation to provide a solution for the Nauruan people, and proposed finding a new island for them. In 1963, the Australian Government proposed to acquire all the land on Curtis Island (which was considerably larger than Nauru) and then offer the Nauruans freehold title over the island and that the Nauruans would become [[Australians|Australian citizens]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article104291886 |title=Island Purchase For Nauruans |date=6 May 1964 |newspaper=The Canberra Times |accessdate=1 April 2019 |issue=10,840 |volume=38 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia |archive-date=17 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230317192825/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/104291886 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131721012 |title=Nauruans Likely To Settle Curtis Island |date=30 May 1963 |newspaper=The Canberra Times |accessdate=1 April 2019 |issue=10,549 |volume=37 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia |archive-date=1 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210501194425/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/131721012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The cost of resettling the Nauruans on Curtis Island was estimated to be {{Australian pound|10&nbsp;million||}} ([[Australian dollar|A$]]{{Format price|{{#expr:({{Inflation|AU|10000000|1963}}) *2 }}}} in {{Inflation/year|AU}}{{Inflation/fn|AU}}), which included housing and infrastructure and the establishment of [[Pastoralism|pastoral]], [[Agriculture|agricultural]], and [[fishing]] industries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/how-the-entire-nation-of-nauru-almost-moved-to-queensland-63833 |title=How the entire nation of Nauru almost moved to Queensland |last=McAdam |first=Jane |date=15 August 2016 |website=The Conversation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401022237/http://theconversation.com/how-the-entire-nation-of-nauru-almost-moved-to-queensland-63833 |archivedate=1 April 2019 |url-status=live |accessdate=1 April 2019}}</ref> However, the Nauruan people did not wish to become Australian citizens and wanted to be given sovereignty over Curtis Island to establish themselves as an independent nation; Australia would not agree.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131721799 |title=Lack of Sovereignty 'Disappoints' Nauruans |date=5 June 1963 |newspaper=The Canberra Times |accessdate=1 April 2019 |issue=10,554 |volume=37 |page=45 |via=National Library of Australia |archive-date=13 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813213431/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/131721799 |url-status=live }}</ref> Nauru chose instead to become an independent nation operating its own mines in Nauru.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article105839593 |title=Nauru not to take Curtis Is. |date=21 August 1964 |newspaper=The Canberra Times |accessdate=1 April 2019 |issue=10,930 |volume=38 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia |archive-date=13 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813213427/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/105839593 |url-status=live }}</ref>
