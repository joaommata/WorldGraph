After the fall of the state of [[Urartu]] at the beginning of the 6th century BC, the [[Armenian highlands]] were for some time under the hegemony of the [[Medes]], and after that they were part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].

Religion in ancient Armenia was historically related to a set of beliefs that, in Persia, led to the emergence of [[Zoroastrianism]]. It particularly focused on the worship of [[Mithra]] and also included a pantheon of gods such as [[Aramazd]], [[Vahagn]], [[Anahit]], and [[Astghik]]. The country used the solar [[Armenian calendar]], which consisted of 12 months.<ref name="j409">{{cite book | last1=Melton | first1=J.G. | last2=Baumann | first2=M. | title=Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices [6 volumes] | publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-59884-204-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qejaEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA470 | access-date=11 May 2024 | page=470}}</ref>

The Sassanid Empire was conquered by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in the mid 7th century, reuniting Armenian lands previously taken by the Byzantine Empire, and Armenia subsequently emerged as [[Arminiya]], an autonomous principality under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. The principality was ruled by the Prince of Armenia, and recognised by the [[Caliphate|Caliph]] and the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]]. It was part of the administrative division/emirate ''Arminiya'' created by the Arabs, which also included parts of Georgia and [[Caucasian Albania]], and had its centre in the Armenian city [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]]. Arminiya lasted until 884, when it regained its independence from the weakened [[Abbasid Caliphate]] under [[Ashot I of Armenia]].{{Sfn|Canard|Cahen|1960}}

The reemergent Armenian kingdom was ruled by the [[Bagratuni dynasty]] and lasted until 1045. In time, several areas of the [[Bagratid Armenia]] separated as independent kingdoms and principalities such as the Kingdom of [[Vaspurakan]] ruled by the House of [[Artsruni]] in the south, Kingdom of [[Syunik Province|Syunik]] in the east, or [[Kingdom of Artsakh]] on the territory of modern [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], while still recognising the supremacy of the Bagratid kings.{{sfn|Payaslian|2007|p=52}}

In 1045, the Byzantine Empire conquered Bagratid Armenia. Soon, the other Armenian states fell under Byzantine control as well. The Byzantine rule was short-lived, as in 1071 the [[Seljuk Empire]] defeated the Byzantines and conquered Armenia at the [[Battle of Manzikert]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Holt |first1=Peter Malcolm |last2=Lambton |first2=Ann Katharine Swynford |last3=Lewis |first3=Bernard |name-list-style=amp |title=The Cambridge History of Islam |year=1977 |pages=231–32 }}</ref> To escape death or servitude at the hands of those who had assassinated his relative, [[Gagik II of Armenia|Gagik II]], King of [[Ani]], an Armenian named [[Ruben I, Prince of Armenia]], went with some of his countrymen into the gorges of the [[Taurus Mountains]] and then into [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] of [[Cilicia]].

Cilicia was a strong ally of the [[Crusades|European Crusaders]] and saw itself as a bastion of [[Christendom]] in the East.

Most of Western Armenia, however, remained under Ottoman rule. Within the Ottoman ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]'' system, Armenians lived in relative harmony with other groups, including the ruling Turks. However, as Christians under a strict Muslim [[social structure]], Armenians faced pervasive discrimination. In response to the [[1894 Sasun rebellion]], Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] organised state-sponsored massacres against the Armenians between 1894 and 1896, resulting in close to 200,000 deaths.{{sfn|Kévorkian|2011|p=11}} The [[Hamidian massacres]], as they came to be known, gave Abdul Hamid international infamy as the "Bloody Sultan"{{sfn|Suny|1993|p=99}} or the "Red Sultan".{{sfn|Kévorkian|2011|p=67}}

During the 1890s, the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]], commonly known as the ''Dashnaktsutyun'', became active within the Ottoman Empire with the aim of unifying the various small groups in the empire that were advocating for reform and defending Armenian villages from massacres that were widespread in some of the Armenian-populated areas of the empire. Dashnaktsutyun members also formed [[Armenian fedayi]] groups that defended Armenian civilians through armed resistance.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=177}} The Dashnaks also worked for the wider goal of creating a "free, independent and unified" Armenia, although they sometimes set aside this goal in favour of a more realistic approach, such as advocating autonomy.{{sfn|Suny|1993|p=100}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Ter Minassian |first=Anahide |author-link=Anahide Ter Minassian |title=Nationalism and Socialism in the Armenian Revolutionary Movement (1887–1912) |translator=A.

The Ottoman Empire began to collapse, and in 1908, the [[Young Turk Revolution]] overthrew the government of Sultan Hamid. In April 1909, the [[Adana massacre]] occurred in the [[Adana Vilayet]] resulting in the deaths of as many as 20,000–30,000 Armenians. The Armenians living in the empire hoped that the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] would change their second-class status.

===World War I and the Armenian genocide===
[[File:Morgenthau336.jpg|thumb|[[Armenian genocide]] victims in 1915]]
The outbreak of World War I led to confrontation between the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire in the [[Caucasus campaign|Caucasus]] and [[Persian campaign (World War I)|Persian campaign]]s. The new government in [[Istanbul]] began to look on the Armenians with distrust and suspicion because the [[Imperial Russian Army]] contained a contingent of [[Armenian volunteer units|Armenian volunteers]]. On 24 April 1915, [[Deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915|Armenian intellectuals were arrested by Ottoman authorities]] and, with the [[Temporary Law of Deportation|Tehcir Law]] (29 May 1915), eventually a large proportion of Armenians living in [[Anatolia]] perished in what has become known as the [[Armenian genocide]].<ref name="a354">{{cite web | last=Kifner | first=John | title=Armenian Genocide of 1915: An Overview | website=New York Times | date=9 April 2018 | url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/ref/timestopics/topics_armeniangenocide.html?onwardjourney=584162_v1 | access-date=11 May 2024}}</ref><ref name="k407">{{cite book | last=Akçam | first=Taner | title=The Cambridge World History of Genocide | chapter=The Armenian Genocide | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=4 May 2023 | isbn=978-1-108-76711-8 | doi=10.1017/9781108767118.004 | pages=67–92}}</ref>

The genocide was implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly and infirmed on [[death march]]es leading to the [[Syrian desert]]. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre.{{sfn|Walker|1990|pp=200-203}}<ref>{{Citation|first1=Hans-Lukas|last1=Kieser|first2=Dominik J.|last2=Schaller|language=de|title=Der Völkermord an den Armeniern und die Shoah|trans-title=The Armenian genocide and the Shoah|publisher=Chronos|year=2002|isbn=978-3-0340-0561-6|page=114}}</ref> There was local [[Armenian resistance during the Armenian genocide|Armenian resistance]] in the region, developed against the activities of the Ottoman Empire.

The First Republic's short-lived independence was fraught with war, territorial disputes, [[Muslim uprisings in Kars and Sharur–Nakhichevan|ethnic unrest]], [[May Uprising|Bolshevik rebellions]], and a mass influx of refugees from Western Armenia, bringing with them disease and starvation.

At the end of the war, the victorious powers sought to divide up the Ottoman Empire. Signed between the Allied Powers and the Ottoman Empire at [[Sèvres]] on 10 August 1920, the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] promised to maintain the existence of the Armenian republic and to attach the former territories of Western Armenia to it.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|pp=247-248}} Because the new borders of Armenia were to be drawn by United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]], Western Armenia was also referred to as "[[Wilsonian Armenia]]". In addition, just days prior on 5 August, [[Mihran Damadian]] of the Armenian National Union, the de facto Armenian administration in Cilicia, declared the independence of Cilicia as an Armenian autonomous republic under French protectorate.<ref>Hovannisian, Richard, and Simon Payaslian.

In 1920, Turkish nationalist forces [[Turkish invasion of Armenia|invaded]] the fledgling Armenian republic from the east. Under the command of [[Kâzım Karabekir]], they captured the Armenian territories that Imperial Russia had annexed in 1878 and occupied Alexandropol (today [[Gyumri]]). Hostilities finally concluded with the [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] on 2 December 1920. The treaty forced Armenia to disarm most of its military forces and to cede all former Ottoman territory granted to it by the Treaty of Sèvres. Simultaneously, the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|11th Red Army]], led by [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]], invaded Armenia at Karavansarai (today [[Ijevan]]) on 29 November. By early December, Ordzhonikidze's forces entered Yerevan and the short-lived Armenian republic collapsed.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1996b|pp=389–390}}

After the fall of the First Republic, the [[war communism]] policies of the new [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenian government]] led to the [[February Uprising]] of 1921.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1996b|pp=405–406}} Following the defeat of that revolt, Armenian forces under the command of [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] established the [[Republic of Mountainous Armenia]] and continued to fight Soviet forces in the southern region of [[Zangezur]].{{sfn|Saparov|2015|pp=104-106}} To end the rebellion, Soviet authorities pledged to include the [[Syunik Province]] within Armenia's borders.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|p=259}} The Red Army soon took control of the region, driving the leaders of the revolt out of Armenia, across the [[Aras (river)|Araks River]] into Iran on 15 July 1921.{{sfn|Saparov|2015|pp=104-106}}

Following Armenia's [[Soviet invasion of Armenia|Sovietization]], the Treaty of Alexandropol was superseded by the [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Treaty of Moscow]] and the [[Treaty of Kars]]. In these agreements, Turkey renounced its claims on [[Batumi]] to [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Georgia]] in exchange for the provinces of [[Kars oblast|Kars]], [[Ardahan okrug|Ardahan]], and [[Surmalu uezd|Surmalu]], all of which had been under Turkish military control since the Turkish invasion of Armenia in 1920.

Following the [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] era, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms of ''[[glasnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]'' witnessed a major national revival in Armenia with the rise of the [[Karabakh movement]]. Taking advantage of the new political climate, the Armenians of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO) of Soviet Azerbaijan began to demand unification with Soviet Armenia, citing [[Forced assimilation in Azerbaijan|discrimination by Baku]].{{sfn|Suny|1993|pp=192-194}} Peaceful protests in Armenia supporting the Karabakh Armenians became common.

Gorbachev's inability to alleviate any of Armenia's problems created disillusionment among the Armenians and fed a growing hunger for independence. On 23 August 1990, Armenia declared its sovereignty on its territory. On 17 March 1991, Armenia, along with the [[Baltic states]], Georgia and [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldova]], boycotted a nationwide [[1991 Soviet Union referendum|referendum]] in which 78% of all voters voted for the retention of the Soviet Union in a reformed form.<ref name="NewsBrief">{{cite web|url=http://soviethistory.org/index.php?action=L2&SubjectID=1991march&Year=1991 |title=The March Referendum |access-date=10 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015092843/http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?action=L2&SubjectID=1991march&Year=1991 |archive-date=15 October 2006}}</ref>

[[File:NKR war.JPG|thumb|Armenian soldiers in 2008, during the ongoing and unresolved [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]]]]
On 21 September 1991, Armenia officially declared its [[statehood]] after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|failed August coup]] in [[Moscow]] in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]]. [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]], who rose to prominence during the Karabakh movement, was [[1991 Armenian presidential election|popularly elected]] the first president of the newly independent Republic of Armenia in October 1991.{{sfn|Payaslian|2007|p=198}} The Soviet Union formally [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] following the [[Belovezha Accords]] in December 1991 and Armenia's independence was recognised.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sakwa|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Sakwa|date=2021|title=Russian Politics and Society|edition=5th|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-53846-6|pages=77–78}}</ref>

Ter-Petrosyan led Armenia alongside defence minister [[Vazgen Sargsyan]] through the [[First Nagorno-Karabakh War]] with neighbouring Azerbaijan. The initial post-Soviet years were marred by economic difficulties and a [[1990s Armenian energy crisis|severe energy crisis]]. The latter was rooted in the early years of the Karabakh conflict when the [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party|Azerbaijani Popular Front]] managed to pressure the Azerbaijan SSR to instigate a railway and air [[Turkish–Azeri blockade of Armenia|blockade against Armenia]]. This move effectively debilitated Armenia's economy as 85% of its cargo and goods arrived through rail traffic.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Verluise|first1=Pierre|first2=Levon|last2=Chorbajian|date=1995|title=Armenia in Crisis: The 1988 Earthquake|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=Detroit|isbn=0-8143-2527-0|pages=115–116}}</ref> In 1993, Turkey joined the [[Turkish–Azeri blockade of Armenia (1989–ongoing)|blockade]] against Armenia in support of Azerbaijan.<ref name=GHF>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalheritagefund.org/news/GHF_in_the_news/economist_ties_that_divide_june_17_06.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820170846/http://www.globalheritagefund.org/news/GHF_in_the_news/economist_ties_that_divide_june_17_06.asp |archive-date=20 August 2006 |publisher=[[Global Heritage Fund]] |title=The Ties That Divide |date=17 June 2006 |access-date=22 July 2009}}</ref>

The first Karabakh war ended after a Russian-brokered [[ceasefire]] was concluded in 1994. The war was a success for the Karabakh Armenian forces who managed to capture practically the entire territory of the former NKAO as well as most of [[Armenian-occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh|seven adjacent districts of Azerbaijan]].{{sfn|Tsutsiev|2014|p=114}} The Armenian backed forces remained in control of almost all of that territory until 2020. By the time both Azerbaijan and Armenia had finally agreed to a ceasefire in 1994, an estimated 30,000 people had been killed and over a million had been displaced.<ref>[http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/1283/conflict_that_can_be_resolved_in_time.html A Conflict That Can Be Resolved in Time: Nagorno-Karabakh] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001192200/http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/1283/conflict_that_can_be_resolved_in_time.html |date=1 October 2008 }}.

===21st century===
In the 21st century, Armenia continued to face many hardships. The [[2018 Armenian revolution|2018 Armenian Revolution]] was a series of anti-government protests in Armenia from April to May 2018 staged by various political and civil groups led by a member of the Armenian parliament — [[Nikol Pashinyan]] (head of the [[Civil Contract (Armenia)|Civil Contract]] party). Protests and marches took place initially in response to [[Serzh Sargsyan]]'s third consecutive term as President of Armenia and later against the [[Republican Party of Armenia|Republican Party]] controlled government in general. Pashinyan declared the movement, which led to Sargsyan's resignation, a "[[velvet revolution]]".<ref>{{cite news|title="Velvet Revolution" Takes Armenia into the Unknown|url=https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/armenia/velvet-revolution-takes-armenia-unknown|publisher=[[Crisis Group]]|date=20 November 2020|access-date=21 November 2020|archive-date=26 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426124258/https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/armenia/velvet-revolution-takes-armenia-unknown|url-status=live}}</ref>
