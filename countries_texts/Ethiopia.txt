Several important finds have propelled Ethiopia and the surrounding region to the forefront of&nbsp;[[Paleontology|palaeontology]]. The oldest [[Hominidae|hominid]] discovered to date in Ethiopia is the 4.2&nbsp;million-year-old ''[[Ardipithecus|Ardipithecus ramidus]]'' ([[Ardi]]) found by [[Tim D.

Ethiopia is also considered one of the earliest sites of the emergence of [[Early modern human|anatomically modern humans]], ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]''.

In 2019, archaeologists discovered a 30,000-year-old [[Middle Stone Age]] rock shelter at the [[Fincha Habera, Ethiopia|Fincha Habera]] site in [[Bale Mountains]] at an elevation of {{convert|3469|m|abbr=off}} above sea level.

In 980 BC, [[Dʿmt]] was established in present-day [[Eritrea]] and the northern part of Ethiopia in the Tigray region, and is widely believed to be the successor state to [[Land of Punt|Punt]]. This polity's capital was located at [[Yeha]] in what is now northern Ethiopia. Most modern historians consider this civilization to be a native Ethiopian one, although in earlier times many suggested it was [[Sabaeans|Sabaean]]-influenced because of the latter's hegemony of the [[Red Sea]].<ref name="Munro-Hay57">[[#Munro-Hay|Munro-Hay]], p. 57</ref>

Other scholars regard Dʿmt as the result of a union of Afroasiatic-speaking cultures of the Cushitic and Semitic branches; namely, local [[Agaw people]]s and Sabaeans from Southern Arabia. However, [[Geʽez|Ge'ez]], the ancient Semitic language of Ethiopia, is thought to have developed independently from the [[Sabaean language]]. As early as 2000 BC, other Semitic speakers were living in Ethiopia and Eritrea where Ge'ez developed.<ref>Tamrat, Taddesse (1972) ''Church and State in Ethiopia: 1270–1527''. London: Oxford University Press, pp. 5–13.</ref><ref>Uhlig, Siegbert (ed.) (2005) ''[[Encyclopaedia Aethiopica]]'', "Ge'ez". Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, p. 732.</ref> Sabaean influence is now thought to have been minor, limited to a few localities, and disappearing after a few decades or a century. It may have been a trading or military colony in alliance with the Ethiopian civilization of Dʿmt or some other proto-Axumite state.<ref name="Munro-Hay57" />
[[File:The Kingdom of Aksum.png|thumb|The [[Kingdom of Aksum|Empire of Axum]] at its peak in the 6th century]]
After the fall of Dʿmt during the 4th century BC, the Ethiopian plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms. In the 1st century AD, the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] emerged in what is now Tigray Region and Eritrea. According to the medieval ''[[Book of Axum]]'', the kingdom's first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush.<ref name="Agrvt" /> Aksum would later at times extend its rule into Yemen on the other side of the Red Sea.<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillipson |first=David W. |title=Ancient Ethiopia.

Around 316 AD, [[Frumentius]] and his brother Edesius from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] accompanied their uncle on a voyage to Ethiopia. When the vessel stopped at a Red Sea port, the natives killed all the travellers except the two brothers, who were taken to the court as [[Slavery in Ethiopia|slaves]]. They were given positions of trust by the monarch, and they converted members of the royal court to Christianity.

The kingdom adopted the name "Ethiopia" during the reign of [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] in the 4th century. After the conquest of [[Kingdom of Kush]] in 330, the Aksumite territory reached its peak between the 5th and 6th centuries.<ref name="Munro-Hay57" /> This period was interrupted by several incursions into the South Arabian protectorate, including [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Dhu Nuwas]] of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] and the [[Aksumite–Persian wars]].

The Ethiopian Empire initiated territorial expansion under the leadership of [[Amda Seyon I]]. He launched campaigns against his Muslim adversaries to the east, resulting in a significant shift in the balance of power in favor of the Christians for the next two centuries.

In 1632, Emperor [[Fasilides]] halted Roman Catholic state administration, restoring [[Orthodox Tewahedo]] as the state religion.<ref name="Parfitt2019" /> Fasilides' reign solidified imperial power, relocating the capital to [[Gondar]] in 1636, marking the beginning of the "[[Gondarine period]]".<ref>See Solomon Getamun, ''History of the City of Gondar'' (Africa World Press, 2005), pp.1–4</ref> He reclaimed lands, and exiled [[Jesuits]] to [[Fremona]]. During his rule, Fasilides constructed the iconic royal fortress, [[Fasil Ghebbi]], built forty-four churches,<ref>Getamun, ''City of Gondar'', p. 5</ref> and revived [[Ethiopian art]]. He is also credited with building seven stone bridges over the [[Blue Nile River]].<ref>Pankhurst, ''Economic History of Ethiopia'' (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie University Press, 1968), pp. 297f</ref>

Gondar's power declined after the death of [[Iyasu I]] in 1706. Following [[Iyasu II]]'s death in 1755, Empress [[Mentewab]] brought her brother, [[Ras (title)|Ras]] Wolde Leul, to Gondar, making him Ras Bitwaded. This led to regnal conflict between Mentewab's ''Quaregnoch'' and the Wollo group led by Wubit. In 1767, Ras [[Mikael Sehul]], a regent in [[Tigray Province]], seized Gondar, killing the child [[Iyoas I]] in 1769, the reigning emperor, and installed 70-year-old [[Yohannes II]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gondar Period |url=https://ethiopianhistory.com/Gondar_Period/ |access-date=2022-06-05 |website=ethiopianhistory.com}}</ref>

Between 1769 and 1855, Ethiopia witnessed the [[Zemene Mesafint]] or "Age of Princes," a period of isolation. Emperors became figureheads, controlled by regional lords and noblemen like ''Ras'' Mikael Sehul, Ras [[Wolde Selassie]] of Tigray, and by the [[Yejju]] Oromo dynasty of the [[Zemene Mesafint#Wara Sheh rulers (Yejju) (1784–1855)|Wara Sheh]], including Ras [[Gugsa of Yejju]]. Before the Zemene Mesafint, Emperor Iyoas I had introduced the Oromo language (''Afaan Oromo'') at court, replacing Amharic.<ref>{{cite book |author=Pankhurst, Richard |title=The Ethiopian Royal Chronicles |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1967 |location=London |pages=139–143}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=23 April 1996 |title=Political Program of the Oromo People's Congress (OPC) |url=http://gargaaraoromopc.org/OPC_Program.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307213227/http://gargaaraoromopc.org/OPC_Program.aspx |archive-date=7 March 2009 |access-date=16 March 2009 |publisher=Gargaaraoromopc.org}}</ref>

For his leadership, despite opposition from more traditional elements of society, Menelik II was heralded as a national hero. He had signed the [[Treaty of Wuchale]] with Italy in May 1889, by which Italy would recognize Ethiopia's sovereignty so long as Italy could control an area north of Ethiopia (now part of modern Eritrea). In return, Italy was to provide Menelik with weapons and support him as emperor. The Italians used the time between the signing of the treaty and its ratification by the Italian government to expand their territorial claims. This [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]] culminated in the [[Battle of Adwa]] on 1 March 1896, in which Italy's colonial forces were defeated by the Ethiopians.<ref name="igg" /><ref>Negash, Tekeste.
