Evidence exists of human habitation in the area now known as Venezuela from about 15,000 years ago. Tools have been found on the high [[fluvial terrace|riverine terrace]]s of the [[Pedregal River|Rio Pedregal]] in western Venezuela.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|p=91}} [[Late Pleistocene]] hunting artifacts, including spear tips, have been found at a similar series of sites in northwestern Venezuela; according to [[radiocarbon dating]], these date from 13,000 to 7,000 BC.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|p=172}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=Venezuela |url=https://samplecontents.library.ph/wikipedia/wp/v/Venezuela.htm |access-date=21 May 2025 |website=samplecontents.library.ph}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Venezuela History, History of Venezuela, Origins of Venezuela, Incredible Venezuela {{!}} Traveltill.com |url=https://www.traveltill.com/destination/Venezuela/history.php |access-date=21 May 2025 |website=www.traveltill.com}}</ref>

It is unknown how many people lived in Venezuela before the Spanish conquest; it has been estimated at one million.{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}} In addition to Indigenous peoples known today, the population included groups such as the [[Kalina people|Kalina]] (Caribs), [[Auaké people|Auaké]], [[Caquetio]], [[Mariche]], and [[Timoto–Cuica people|Timoto–Cuicas]]. The Timoto–Cuica culture was the most complex society in Pre-Columbian Venezuela, with pre-planned permanent villages, surrounded by irrigated, terraced fields.{{sfn|Mahoney|p=89}} Their houses were made of stone and wood with thatched roofs. They were peaceful and depended on growing crops. Regional crops included potatoes and [[ulluco]]s.<ref name=art>[http://en.amigosprecolombino.es/cultures/central-america-and-intermedia/venezuela "Venezuela".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904200841/http://en.amigosprecolombino.es/cultures/central-america-and-intermedia/venezuela |date=4 September 2011}} ''Friends of the Pre-Columbian Art Museum''.

After the conquest, the population dropped markedly, mainly through the spread of infectious diseases from Europe.{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}} Two main north–south axes of pre-Columbian population were present, who cultivated maize in the west and [[manioc]] in the east.{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}} Large parts of the ''[[llanos]]'' were cultivated through a combination of [[slash and burn]] and permanent settled agriculture.{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}}

==== German colonization ====
In the 16th century, the king of Spain granted a concession to the German [[Welser family]]. [[Klein-Venedig]]{{Refn|"Little Venice"; additionally the etymology of the name "Venezuela"}} became the most extensive initiative in the [[German colonization of the Americas]] from 1528 to 1546. The Welsers were bankers to the Habsburgs and financiers of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]], who was King of Spain and had borrowed heavily from them to pay bribes for his [[Imperial election, 1519|Imperial election]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cachero |first=Montserrat |title=The Court and the Jungle: Integrating Narratives of Privilege |url=https://www.academia.edu/24787883 |access-date=4 November 2022 |archive-date=5 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230405075103/https://www.academia.edu/24787883 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1528, Charles V granted the Welsers the right to explore, rule and colonize the territory, as well as to seek the mythical golden town of [[El Dorado]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ulrich Zwack |first=Bayerischer Rundfunk |date=5 August 2015 |title=Albtraum von Eldorado: Als die Welser über Venezuela herrschten |url=https://www.br.de/radio/bayern2/sendungen/land-und-leute/schwaebisches-eldorado-welser-in-venezuela-zwack100.html |language=de |access-date=4 November 2022 |archive-date=5 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230405031832/https://www.br.de/radio/bayern2/sendungen/land-und-leute/schwaebisches-eldorado-welser-in-venezuela-zwack100.html |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Routledge Library Editions: World Empires (2021).

After the deaths of first Ehinger (1533), then [[Nikolaus Federmann]], and [[Georg von Speyer]] (1540), [[Philipp von Hutten]] persisted in exploring the interior. In absence of von Hutten from the capital of the province, the crown of Spain claimed the right to appoint a governor. 

On Hutten's return to the capital, [[Santa Ana de Coro]], in 1546, the Spanish governor [[Juan de Carvajal]] had Hutten and [[Bartholomeus VI. Welser]] executed. Subsequently, [[Emperor Charles V|Charles V]] revoked Welser's concession. The Welsers transported German miners to the colony, in addition to 4,000 African [[slaves]] to plant [[sugar cane]] plantations. Many German colonists died from tropical diseases, to which they had no [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]], or through wars with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous inhabitants]].

=== Late 15th century to early 17th century ===
Native ''[[cacique]]s'' (leaders) such as [[Guaicaipuro]] ({{circa|1530–1568}}) and [[Tamanaco]] (died 1573) attempted to resist Spanish incursions, but the newcomers ultimately subdued them.<ref name="UNE">{{cite web |publisher=Universidad Nueva Esparta |url=http://www.une.edu.ve/hatillo/historia.htm |title=Alcaldía del Hatillo: Historia |access-date=10 March 2007 |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428111205/http://www.une.edu.ve/hatillo/historia.htm |archive-date=28 April 2006}}</ref>

In the 16th century, during the Spanish colonization, indigenous peoples such as the [[Mariches]], themselves descendants of the Kalina, were converted to [[Roman Catholicism]]. Some resisting tribes or leaders are commemorated in place names, including Caracas, [[Chacao Municipality|Chacao]] and [[Los Teques]]. The early colonial settlements focused on the northern coast,{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}} but in the mid-18th century, the Spanish pushed farther inland along the [[Orinoco River]]. Here, the [[Ye'kuana]] organized resistance in 1775–76.{{sfn|Gott|2005|p=203}}

Spain's eastern Venezuelan settlements were incorporated into [[New Andalusia Province]]. Administered by the [[Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo]] from the early 16th century, most of Venezuela became part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] in the early 18th century, and was then reorganized as an autonomous [[Captaincy General of Venezuela|Captaincy General]] starting in 1777. Caracas, founded in the central coastal region in 1567, was well-placed to become a key location, being near the coastal port of [[La Guaira]] and in a valley, in a mountain range, providing defensive strength against [[pirate]]s and a more fertile and healthy climate.{{sfn|Ewell|1984|p=4}}

=== Independence and 19th century ===
{{Main|Venezuelan War of Independence}}
[[File:Simón Bolívar by Ricardo Acevedo Bernal.jpg|thumb|upright|''El Libertador'', [[Simón Bolívar]]]]

After unsuccessful uprisings, Venezuela, under the leadership of [[Francisco de Miranda]], a Venezuelan marshal who had fought in the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s, [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] as the [[First Republic of Venezuela]] on 5 July 1811.<ref>{{cite web |last=Minster |first=Christopher |url=http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/independenceinvenezuela/p/10april19venezuela.htm |title=April 19, 1810: Venezuela's Declaration of Independence |publisher=About |access-date=30 June 2015 |archive-date=3 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203091911/http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/independenceinvenezuela/p/10april19venezuela.htm }}</ref> This began the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]]. A devastating [[1812 Caracas earthquake]], together with the rebellion of the Venezuelan ''[[llanero]]s'', helped bring down the republic.{{sfn|Chasteen|2001|p=103}} [[Simón Bolívar]], new leader of the independentist forces, launched his [[Admirable Campaign]] in 1813 from [[United Provinces of New Granada|New Granada]], retaking most of the territory and being proclaimed as ''El Libertador'' ("The Liberator"). A [[Second Republic of Venezuela]] was proclaimed on 7 August 1813, but lasted only a few months before being crushed by [[Royalist (Spanish American independence)|royalist]] caudillo [[José Tomás Boves]] and his personal army of ''llaneros''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Left |first=Sarah |title=Simon Bolivar |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/apr/16/netnotes.venezuela |website=The Guardian |date=16 April 2002 |access-date=30 June 2015 |archive-date=16 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016050958/http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/apr/16/netnotes.venezuela |url-status=live}}</ref>

The end of the [[Peninsular War|French invasion]] of homeland Spain in 1814 allowed a large expeditionary force to come under general [[Pablo Morillo]], with the goal to regain the lost territory in Venezuela and New Granada. As the war reached a stalemate on 1817, Bolívar reestablished the [[Third Republic of Venezuela]] on the territory still controlled by the patriots, mainly in the [[Guayana Province|Guayana]] and [[Llanos]] regions. This republic was short-lived as only two years later, during the [[Congress of Angostura]] of 1819, the union of Venezuela with New Granada was decreed to form the Republic of Colombia.{{sfn|Gregory|1992|pp=89–90}} 

The war continued until full victory and sovereignty was attained after the [[Battle of Carabobo]] on 24 June 1821.{{sfn|Gregory|1992|pp=89–90}} On 24 July 1823, [[José Prudencio Padilla]] and [[Rafael Urdaneta]] helped seal Venezuelan independence with their victory in the [[Battle of Lake Maracaibo]].<ref name="ciawfb">{{cite web |title=Venezuela |url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/venezuela/ |publisher=CIA World Factbook |access-date=3 February 2021 |archive-date=31 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210531110017/https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/venezuela/ |url-status=live}}</ref> New Granada's congress gave Bolívar control of the Granadian army; leading it, he liberated several countries and founded the Republic of Colombia ([[Gran Colombia]]).{{sfn|Gregory|1992|pp=89–90}}

[[Slavery]] in Venezuela was abolished in 1854.<ref name="Caudillismo" /> Much of Venezuela's 19th-century history was characterized by political turmoil and dictatorial rule, including the Independence leader José Antonio Páez, who gained the presidency three times and served 11 years between 1830 and 1863. This culminated in the [[Federal War]] (1859–63). In the latter half of the century, [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]], another ''caudillo'', served 13 years, between 1870 and 1887, with three other presidents interspersed.

In 1895, a longstanding dispute with Great Britain about the Essequibo territory, which Britain claimed as part of [[British Guiana]] and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory, erupted into the [[Venezuela Crisis of 1895]]. The dispute became a diplomatic crisis when Venezuela's lobbyist, [[William Lindsay Scruggs|William L. Scruggs]], sought to argue that British behavior over the issue violated the [[United States]]' [[Monroe Doctrine]] of 1823, and used his influence in Washington, D.C., to pursue the matter. Then, U.S. president [[Grover Cleveland]] adopted a broad interpretation of the doctrine that declared an American interest in any matter within the hemisphere.{{sfn|Zakaria|1999|pp=145–146}} Britain ultimately accepted arbitration, but in negotiations over its terms was able to persuade the U.S. on many details. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the issue and in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British Guiana.<ref name="Humphreys">{{cite journal |author-link=Robert Arthur Humphreys |author=Humphreys, R.

In 1899, [[Cipriano Castro]], assisted by his friend [[Juan Vicente Gómez]], seized power in Caracas. Castro defaulted on Venezuela's considerable foreign debts and declined to pay compensation to foreigners caught up in Venezuela's [[Venezuelan civil wars|civil wars]]. This led to the [[Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903]], in which Britain, Germany and Italy imposed a naval blockade before international arbitration at the new [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] was agreed. In 1908, [[Dutch-Venezuela War|another dispute]] broke out with the Netherlands, which was resolved when Castro left for medical treatment in Germany and was promptly overthrown by [[Juan Vicente Gómez]] (1908–35).

It prompted a boom that lasted into the 1980s; by 1935, Venezuela's per capita gross domestic product was Latin America's highest.{{sfn|Crow|1980|pp=616–617}} Gómez benefited handsomely from this, as corruption thrived, but at the same time, the new source of income helped him centralize the state and develop its authority.

Gómez remained the most powerful man in Venezuela until his death in 1935. The ''gomecista'' dictatorship (1935–1945) system largely continued under [[Eleazar López Contreras]], but from 1941, under [[Isaías Medina Angarita]], was relaxed. Angarita granted a range of reforms, including the legalization of all political parties. After World War II, immigration from Southern Europe and poorer Latin American countries markedly diversified Venezuelan society.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc=2931359 | year=2010 |last1=Durand |first1=J. |last2=Massey |first2=D.

The most powerful man in the military ''junta'' (1948–58) was Pérez Jiménez and he was suspected of being behind the death of Chalbaud, who died in a bungled kidnapping in 1950. When the junta unexpectedly lost the [[1952 Venezuelan presidential election|1952 presidential election]], it ignored the results and Jiménez was installed as president.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}} Jiménez was forced out on 23 January 1958.<ref name="ciawfb" /> In an effort to consolidate a young democracy, the three major political parties ([[Acción Democrática]] (AD), [[COPEI]] and [[Unión Republicana Democrática]] (URD), with the notable exception of the [[Communist Party of Venezuela]]), signed the [[Puntofijo Pact]] power-sharing agreement. AD and COPEI dominated the political landscape for four decades.

During the presidencies of [[Rómulo Betancourt]] (1959–64, his second term) and [[Raúl Leoni]] (1964–69), substantial guerilla movements occurred. Most laid down their arms under [[Rafael Caldera]]'s first presidency (1969–74). Caldera had won the [[1968 Venezuelan presidential election|1968 election]] for COPEI, the first time a party other than Democratic Action took the presidency through a democratic election. The new democratic order had its antagonists. Betancourt [[Assassination attempt of Rómulo Betancourt|suffered an attack]] planned by the Dominican dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] in 1960, and the leftists excluded from the Pact initiated an insurgency by organizing themselves into the Armed Forces of National Liberation, sponsored by the Communist Party and [[Fidel Castro]]. In 1962 they tried to destabilize the military corps, with failed revolts. Betancourt promoted a foreign policy, the [[Betancourt Doctrine]], in which he only recognized elected governments by popular vote.{{Request quotation|date=April 2018}}

The [[1973 Venezuelan presidential election]] of [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] coincided with an [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], in which Venezuela's income exploded as [[oil prices]] soared; oil industries were nationalized in 1976. This led to massive increases in public spending, but also increases in external debts, until the collapse of oil prices during the 1980s crippled the economy. As the government started to devalue the currency in 1983 to face its financial obligations, standards of living fell dramatically. Failed economic policies and increasing corruption in government led to rising poverty and crime, worsening social indicators, and increased political instability.<ref name="Schuyler_2001_10">{{cite journal |last=Schuyler |first=George W. |journal=The Policy Studies Organization |title=Health and Neoliberalism: Venezuela and Cuba |year=2001 |page=10}}</ref>

In the 1980s, the Presidential Commission for State Reform (COPRE) emerged as a mechanism of political innovation. Venezuela decentralized its political system and diversified its economy, reducing the size of the state. COPRE operated as an innovation mechanism, also by incorporating issues into the political agenda, that were excluded from public deliberation by the main actors of the democratic system. The most discussed topics were incorporated into the public agenda: decentralization, political participation, municipalization, judicial order reforms and the role of the state in a new economic strategy. The social reality made the changes difficult to apply.<ref name=":32">{{cite journal|last=Conde|first=Edith Mabel Cuñarro|date=2004|title=Venezuela 1984–1999: 15 años de historia (La Comisión Presidencial para la Reforma del Estado (COPRE) como mecanismo de innovación política)|url=http://produccioncientificaluz.org/index.php/cuestiones/article/view/14388|journal=Cuestiones Políticas|language=es|volume=20|issn=0798-1406|access-date=8 April 2018|number=33|archive-date=9 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409043215/http://produccioncientificaluz.org/index.php/cuestiones/article/view/14388|url-status=live}}</ref>

Coup leader Chávez [[Rafael Caldera#Amnesty to the 1992 coup participants|was pardoned in March 1994]] by president Rafael Caldera (1994–1999, his second term), with a clean slate and his political rights reinstated, allowing Chávez to win and maintain the presidency continuously from 1999 until his death in 2013. Chávez won the elections of 1998, 2000, 2006 and 2012 and the presidential referendum of 2004.

[[File:Chavez Kirch Lula141597.jpg|thumb|[[Hugo Chávez]] with fellow leftist South American presidents [[Néstor Kirchner]] of Argentina and [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]] of Brazil]]
A collapse in confidence in the existing parties led to [[Hugo Chávez]] being elected president in 1998 and the subsequent launch of a "Bolivarian Revolution", beginning with a 1999 [[constituent assembly]] to write a new Constitution. The Revolution refers to a [[left-wing populism]] [[social movement]] and political process led by Chávez, who founded the [[Fifth Republic Movement]] in 1997 and the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] in 2007. The "Bolivarian Revolution" is named after [[Simón Bolívar]]. 

According to Chávez and other supporters, the "Bolivarian Revolution" sought to build a mass movement to implement [[Bolivarianism]]—[[popular democracy]], economic independence, equitable distribution of revenues, and an end to political corruption. They interpret Bolívar's ideas from a [[populism|populist]] perspective, using [[Socialism|socialist]] rhetoric. This led to formation of the '''Fifth Republic of Venezuela''', commonly known as the '''Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela''', that continues to the present day. Venezuela has been considered the Bolivarian Republic following the adoption of the new [[Constitution of Venezuela|Constitution of 1999]]. 

Following Chávez's election, Venezuela developed into a [[dominant-party system]], dominated by the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]]. In April 2002, Chávez was briefly ousted from power in the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt]] following popular demonstrations by his opponents,<ref>The coup installed chamber of commerce leader [[Pedro Carmona]].{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1927678.stm |title=Profile: Pedro Carmona |date=27 May 2002 |work=BBC News |access-date=6 February 2009 |archive-date=23 September 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130923162952/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1927678.stm |url-status=live}}</ref> but Chavez returned after two days as a result of demonstrations by poor Chávez supporters and actions by the military.{{sfn|Cannon|2004|p=295}}{{sfn|López Maya|2005|p=16}} Chávez remained in power after an all-out national strike that lasted [[Venezuelan general strike of 2002–2003|from December 2002 to February 2003]], including a strike/lockout in the state oil company [[PDVSA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bnamericas.com/en/news/oilandgas/Minister:_2002-2003_strike_cost_PDVSA_US*12,8bn|title=Minister: 2002–2003 strike cost PDVSA US$12.8bn |work=BNamericas|date=27 July 2005|access-date=3 October 2017|archive-date=4 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004084930/https://www.bnamericas.com/en/news/oilandgas/Minister:_2002-2003_strike_cost_PDVSA_US*12,8bn|url-status=live}}</ref>

Both González and Maduro proclaimed themselves winners of the election. The results of the election were not recognized by the [[Carter Center]] and [[Organization of American States]] due to the lack of granular results, and disputed by the opposition, which claimed a landslide victory and released access to vote tallies collected by [[poll watchers]] from a majority of polling centers as proof.<ref name="OAS_report_VE_pres_elec_DECO">

The opposition said it had collected data from 73% of the country's voting stations on its own and compiled it in a publicly accessible database on Tuesday. Using their national identification, Venezuelans can sign in and review a scanned tally sheet from their voting station showing how many votes went to each candidate. ... 'I found mine, the proof is there,' said Celina Ramirez, an opposition supporter who said she was able to log into the website to locate the tally sheet from her east Caracas voting center, which she said showed González receiving the lion's share of votes. 'There's no way the regime can fool everyone with their tricks,' she added ... The Carter Center, one of the few international organizations invited to monitor the elections, has urged Venezuela's government to release comprehensive polling data at the local level, which is needed to assess the electoral process. ...The opposition hopes the release of the database will increase pressure on Maduro's autocratic regime to make public the detailed results of the election.}} Also available from [https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/venezuela-s-maduro-moves-to-silence-opposition-after-disputed-election/ar-BB1qTSWi MSN] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240823220053/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/venezuela-s-maduro-moves-to-silence-opposition-after-disputed-election/ar-BB1qTSWi |date=23 August 2024 }}.</ref>
