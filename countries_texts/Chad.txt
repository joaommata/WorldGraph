=== Early history ===
In the [[7th millennium BC]], ecological conditions in the northern half of Chadian territory favoured human settlement, and its population increased considerably. Some of the most important [[African archaeology|African archaeological]] sites are found in Chad, mainly in the [[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region]]; some date to earlier than 2000 BC.<ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 44–45</ref><ref name="Collelo">S. Collelo, ''Chad''</ref>

For more than 2,000 years, the Chadian Basin has been inhabited by agricultural and [[sedentism|sedentary]] people. The region became a crossroads of civilisations. The earliest of these was the legendary [[Sao civilisation|Sao]], known from artifacts and oral histories. The Sao fell to the [[Kanem Empire]],<ref name=Lange88>D. Lange 1988</ref><ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], p. 6</ref> the first and longest-lasting of the empires that developed in Chad's [[Sahel]]ian strip by the end of the 1st millennium AD. Two other states in the region, [[Sultanate of Bagirmi]] and [[Wadai Empire]], emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries. The power of Kanem and its successors was based on control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes that passed through the region.<ref name="Collelo"/> These states, at least tacitly [[Islam in Africa|Muslim]], never extended their control to the southern grasslands except to raid for slaves.<ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 7–8</ref> In Kanem, about a third of the population were slaves.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |title=Welcome to Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=29 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006131931/https://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |archive-date=6 October 2014}}</ref>

=== French colonial period (1900–1960) ===
{{Main|French Chad}}

French colonial expansion led to the creation of the {{lang|fr|Territoire Militaire des Pays et Protectorats du Tchad}} in 1900. By 1920, France had secured full control of the colony and incorporated it as part of [[French Equatorial Africa]].<ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 8, 309</ref> [[Colonial Chad|French rule in Chad]] was characterised by an absence of policies to unify the territory and sluggish modernisation compared to other French colonies.<ref name="Decalo, pp. 8–9">[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 8–9</ref>

The French primarily viewed the colony as an unimportant source of untrained labour and raw [[cotton]]; France introduced large-scale cotton production in 1929. The colonial administration in Chad was critically understaffed and had to rely on the dregs of the French civil service. Only the [[Sara people|Sara]] of the south was governed effectively; French presence in the Islamic north and east was nominal. The educational system was affected by this neglect.<ref name="Collelo"/><ref name="Decalo, pp. 8–9"/>

The French administration's focus on cotton led to the formation of a precarious underclass of poorly-paid rural workers, a decrease in food production and even to [[famine]]s in some areas.<ref name="lemarchand">{{cite journal |last=Lemarchand |first=René |author-link=René Lemarchand |date=1980 |title=The Politics of Sara Ethnicity: A Note on the Origins of the Civil War in Chad |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/cea_0008-0055_1980_num_20_80_2328 |journal=[[Cahiers d'Études Africaines|Cahiers d'études africaines]] |volume=20 |issue=80 |pages=455–456 |doi=10.3406/cea.1980.2328 |access-date=25 February 2025}}</ref> Tensions between farmers and elites culminated in the 1952 [[Bébalem massacre]] by colonial authorities.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Debos |first=Marielle |date=2009 |title=Chad 1900-1960 |url=https://shs.hal.science/halshs-01104080/file/Chad-1900-1960.pdf |encyclopedia=[[Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence]] |pages=8–9 |access-date=25 February 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lanne|first=Bernard|title=Histoire politique du Tchad de 1945 à 1958.

After [[World War II]], France granted Chad the status of [[Overseas France|overseas territory]] and its inhabitants the right to elect representatives to the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] and a [[National Assembly (Chad)|Chadian assembly]]. The largest political party was the [[Chadian Progressive Party]] ({{langx|fr|Parti Progressiste Tchadien}}, PPT), based in the southern half of the colony. Chad was granted independence on 11 August 1960 with the PPT's leader, [[François Tombalbaye]], an ethnic [[Sara people|Sara]], as its first [[Heads of state of Chad|president]].<ref name="Collelo"/><ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 248–249</ref><ref>[[#Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], p. 17</ref>

=== Tombalbaye rule (1960–1979) ===
Two years later, Tombalbaye banned opposition parties and established a one-party system. Tombalbaye's autocratic rule and insensitive mismanagement exacerbated inter-ethnic tensions. In 1965, Muslims in the north, led by the [[FROLINAT|National Liberation Front of Chad]] ({{langx|fr|Front de libération nationale du Tchad}}, FRONILAT), began a [[Transitional Government of National Unity (Chad)|civil war]]. Becoming gradually more erratic, Tombalbaye's regime alienated even his southern base of support, notably through the forced introduction of ''yondo'' (ritual scarring) for [[Public service|public servants]] and the 1973 assassination of expatriate dissident [[Outel Bono]] in Paris.<ref>{{cite web |last=Whiteman |first=Kaye |date=September 1988 |title=Chad.

=== Chad's first civil war (1979–1987) ===

=== Dictatorship of Habré (1987–1990) ===

===Déby dynasty and democracy with second Civil War (1990–present)===
[[File:Idriss Déby at the White House in 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Despite internal political opposition, coup attempts, and a civil war, [[Idriss Déby]] continuously ruled Chad from 1990 until his death in 2021]]

Déby attempted to reconcile the rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics. Chadians approved a [[Constitution of Chad|new constitution]] by [[1996 Chadian constitutional referendum|referendum]], and in 1996, Déby easily won a [[Chadian presidential election, 1996|competitive presidential election]]. He won a [[Chadian presidential election, 2001|second term]] five years later.<ref>East, Roger & Richard J. Thomas (2003); ''Profiles of People in Power: The World's Government Leaders''. Routledge. {{ISBN|1-85743-126-X}}, p. 100</ref> [[Petroleum|Oil]] exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it hopes that Chad would, at last, have some chances of peace and prosperity. Instead, internal dissent worsened, and a [[War in Chad (2005–present)|new civil war]] broke out. Déby [[Chadian constitutional referendum, 2005|unilaterally modified the constitution]] to remove the two-term limit on the presidency; this caused an uproar among the civil society and opposition parties.<ref>IPS, "{{lang|fr|Le pétrole au cœur des nouveaux soubresauts au Tchad}}"</ref>

In 2006 Déby won [[Chadian presidential election, 2006|a third mandate]] in elections that the opposition boycotted. Ethnic violence in eastern Chad has increased; the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] has warned that a [[genocide]] like that in [[Darfur conflict|Darfur]] may yet occur in Chad.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6367545.stm Chad may face genocide, UN warns] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220621153807/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6367545.stm |date=21 June 2022 }}.
