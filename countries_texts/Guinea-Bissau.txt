=== Pre-European contact ===

The deep history of what is now Guinea-Bissau is poorly understood by historians. The earliest inhabitants were the [[Jola people|Jola]], [[Papel people|Papel]], [[Manjak people|Manjak]], [[Balanta people|Balanta]], and [[Biafada people|Biafada]] peoples.{{cn|date=September 2024}} Later the [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] and [[Fula people|Fulani]] migrated into the region, in the 13th and 15th centuries, respectively. They pushed the earlier inhabitants towards the coast and onto the [[Bijagos islands]].<ref name = Brit>{{cite web  | title=Early history | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Guinea-Bissau/History| newspaper=Encyclopedia Britannica | access-date=20 August 2023 }}</ref><ref name="Rodney-1966">{{cite web |last=Rodney |first=Walter Anthony |date=May 1966 |title=A History of the Upper Guinea Coast, 1545–1800 |url=https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/31255/1/Rodney_History_Upper_Guinea_Coast.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307115621/https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/31255/1/Rodney_History_Upper_Guinea_Coast.pdf |archive-date=7 March 2020 |url-status=live |access-date=24 November 2022 |website=Eprints}}</ref>{{rp|20}}

The Balanta and Jola had weak or non-existent institutions of kingship but emphasised decentralization, with power invested in heads of villages and families.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|64}} The Mandinka, Fula, Papel, Manjak, and Biafada chiefs were vassals to kings. The customs, rites, and ceremonies varied, but nobles commanded all the major positions, including the judicial system.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|66–67, 73, 227}} Social stratification was seen in the clothing and accessories of the people, in housing materials, and in transportation options.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|77–8}} Trade was widespread between ethnic groups. Items traded included pepper and kola nuts from the southern forests; kola nuts, iron, and iron utensils from the savannah-forest zone; salt and dried fish from the coast; and Mandinka cotton cloth.<ref name="Old Men"/>{{rp|4}}

==== Kingdom of Bissau ====
According to oral tradition, the Kingdom of [[Bissau]] was founded by the son of the king of Quinara (Guinala), who moved to the area with his pregnant sister, six wives, and subjects of his father's kingdom.<ref>{{Cite thesis |last=Nanque |first=Neemias Antonio |title=Revoltas e resistências dos Papéis da Guiné-Bissau contra o Colonialismo Português – 1886–1915 |date=2016 |type=Trabalho de conclusão de curso |publisher=Universidade da Integração Internacional da Lusofonia Afro-Brasileira |url=https://repositorio.unilab.edu.br/jspui/bitstream/123456789/778/3/2016_mono_nnanque.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220920143123/https://repositorio.unilab.edu.br/jspui/bitstream/123456789/778/3/2016_mono_nnanque.pdf |archive-date=20 September 2022 |access-date=24 November 2022}}</ref> Relations between the kingdom and the Portuguese colonisers were initially warm, but deteriorated over time.<ref name=Dictionary/>{{rp|55}} The kingdom strongly defended its sovereignty against the Portuguese 'Pacification Campaigns', defeating them in 1891, 1894, and 1904. However, in 1915 the Portuguese under the command of Officer [[João Teixeira Pinto|Teixeira Pinto]] and warlord [[Abdul Injai]] fully absorbed the kingdom.<ref name="Bowman-2009">{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Joye L. |title=Abdul Njai: Ally and Enemy of the Portuguese in Guinea-Bissau, 1895–1919 |journal=  The Journal of African History|date=22 January 2009 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=463–479 |doi=10.1017/S0021853700023276 |s2cid=162344466 }}</ref>

==== Biafada kingdoms ====
The [[Biafada people]] inhabited the area around the [[Rio Grande de Buba]] in three kingdoms: [[Biguba]], [[Guinala]], and Bissege.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|65}} The former two were important ports with significant [[lançado]] communities.<ref name=Dictionary/>{{rp|63, 211}} They were subjects of the Mandinka mansa of Kaabu.<ref name=Dictionary>{{cite book |first1=Richard Andrew Jr. |last1=Lobban |first2=Peter Karibe |last2=Mendy |title=Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau |edition=4th |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2013 |place=Lanham |isbn=978-0-8108-5310-2|page=}}</ref>{{rp|211}}

==== Bijagos Islands ====
In the [[Bijagos Islands]], people of different ethnic origins tended to settle in separate settlements. Great cultural diversity developed in the archipelago.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|24}}<ref name=Dictionary/>{{rp|52}}

Bijago society was warlike. Men were dedicated to boatbuilding and raiding the mainland, attacking the coastal peoples as well as other islands. They believed that at sea they had no king. Women cultivated the land, constructed houses, and gathered and prepared foods. They could choose their husbands, and warriors with the best reputations ranked at the top of respected status. Successful warriors could have many wives and boats, and were entitled to one third of the spoils gained by warriors who used their boats in any expedition.<ref name="Rodney-1966"/>{{rp|204–205}}

Bijago night raids on coastal settlements had significant effects on the societies attacked. Portuguese traders on the mainland tried to stop the raids, as they hurt the local economy. But the islanders also sold considerable numbers of villagers captured in raids as slaves to the Europeans. With colonisation underway in other parts of Africa and the Americas, demand for workers was high and the Europeans sometimes pushed for more captives to be taken.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|205}}

The Bijagos were mostly safe from enslavement, as they were out of reach of mainland slave raiders. Europeans avoided having them as slaves. Portuguese sources say the children made good slaves but not the adults, who were likely to commit [[suicide]], lead rebellions aboard slave ships, or escape once reaching the [[New World]].<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|218–219}}

==== Kaabu ====
[[File:African slave trade.png|thumbnail|upright=1.2|States in medieval Africa]]
{{Main|Kaabu}}

[[Kaabu]] was established first as a province of [[Mali Empire|Mali]] through the conquest in the 13th century of the [[Senegambia]] by [[Tiramakhan Traore]], a general under [[Sundiata Keita]]. By the 14th century much of Guinea Bissau was under the administration of Mali. It was ruled by a ''farim kaabu'' (commander of Kaabu).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mendy |first1=Peter Karibe |last2=Jr |first2=Richard A. Lobban |title=Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau |date=2013 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-8027-6 |page=160 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbJ8AQAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref>

Mali declined gradually, beginning in the 14th century. By the early 16th century, the expanding power of [[Koli Tenguella]] cut off formerly secure Mali.

Kaabu became an independent federation of kingdoms.<ref name="Wright-1987" />{{rp|13}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Page |first1=Willie F. |editor1-last=Davis |editor1-first=R.

The slave trade dominated the economy, and the warrior classes grew rich with imported cloth, beads, metalware, and firearms.<ref name="Wright-1987" />{{rp|8}} Trade networks with Arabs and others to North Africa were dominant up to the 14th century. In the 15th century, coastal trade with the Europeans began to increase.<ref name="Old Men" />{{rp|3}} In the 17th and 18th centuries an estimated 700 slaves were exported annually from the region, many of them from Kaabu.<ref name="Old Men" />{{rp|5}}

In the late 18th century, the rise of the [[Imamate of Futa Jallon]] to the east posed a powerful challenge to the animist Kaabu. During the first half of the 19th century, civil war erupted as local [[Fula people]] sought independence.<ref name="Old Men" />{{rp|5–6}} This long-running conflict was marked by the 1867 [[Battle of Kansala]]; the [[Fuladu]] effectively defeated the Kaabu and dominated the area thereafter. But some smaller Mandinka kingdoms survived until their absorption into Portuguese colonies.{{cn|date=July 2025}}

=== European contact ===

[[File:Lesser coat of arms of Portuguese Guinea.svg|thumb|Lesser coat of arms of Portuguese Guinea-Bissau]]

==== 15th–16th centuries ====
The first Europeans to reach Guinea-Bissau were the Venetian explorer [[Alvise Cadamosto]] in 1455, Portuguese explorer [[Diogo Gomes]] in 1456, Portuguese explorer [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira|Duarte Pacheco Pareira]] in the 1480s, and Flemish explorer [[Eustache de la Fosse]] in 1479–1480.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hair |first=P.

Although the Portuguese authorities initially discouraged European settlement on the mainland, this prohibition was ignored by ''[[lançados]]'' and ''tangomãos'', who largely assimilated into indigenous culture and customs.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|140}} They ignored Portuguese trade regulations that banned entering the region or trading without a royal licence, shipping out of unauthorised ports, or assimilating into the native community.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|142}}

After 1520 trade and settlements increased on the mainland, populated by Portuguese and native traders, as well as some Spanish, [[Genoa|Genoese]], English, French, and Dutch.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|145, 150}} The main ports were [[Cacheu]], [[Bissau]], and [[Guinala]]. Each river also had such trading centers as [[Farim|Toubaboudougou]] at their fall lines, the furthest navigable point. These posts traded directly with the peoples of the interior for resources such as [[gum arabic]], [[ivory]], hides, [[civet]], dyes, enslaved Africans, and gold.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|153–160}} Local African rulers generally refused to allow Europeans into the interior, to ensure their own control of trade routes and goods.<ref name="historyworld"/>

Disputes became increasingly frequent and serious in the late 1500s as the foreign traders sought to influence the host societies to their benefit.<ref name=Dictionary/>{{rp|74}} Meanwhile, the Portuguese monopoly, always leaky, was being increasingly challenged. In 1580 the [[Iberian Union]] unified the crowns of Portugal and [[Spain]]. Spain's enemies launched attacks on Portuguese possessions in Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde. French, Dutch, and English ships increasingly came to trade with the natives and the independent-minded ''lançados''.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|244–253}}

==== 17th–18th centuries ====

In the early 17th century the government attempted to force all Guinean trade to go through [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]], and to promote trade and settlement on the mainland, while restricting the sale of weapons to the locals. These efforts were largely unsuccessful.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|243–4}}

With the end of the Iberian Union in 1640, King [[John IV of Portugal|João IV]] attempted to restrict the Spanish trade in Guinea that had flourished for the previous 60 years. Afro-Portuguese traders and colonists, however, were not in a position to deny the free trade that the African kings demanded, as they had come to rely on European products and goods as necessities.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|261–3}}

The Portuguese were never able to maintain the monopoly they wanted; the economic interests of the native leaders and Afro-European traders and merchants never aligned with theirs. During this period the power of the [[Mali Empire]] in the region was dissipating. The ''[[farim]]'' of [[Kaabu]], the king of [[Kasa kingdom|Kassa]], and other local rulers began to assert their independence.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|488}}

[[File:Flag of the Casa da Guiné.svg|thumb|left|Flag of the Portuguese [[Company of Guinea]]]]

In the early 1700s the Portuguese abandoned [[Bissau]] and retreated to Cacheu after the captain-major was captured and killed by the local king. They did not return until the 1750s. Meanwhile, the [[Cacheu and Cape Verde Company]] shut down in 1706.<ref name=Dictionary/>{{rp|xliii}}

For a brief period in the 1790s, the British tried to establish a foothold on [[Bolama Island]].<ref>{{cite web |title=British Library – Endangered Archive Programme (EAP) |url=http://www.inep-bissau.org/Arquivos/Projectos/BritishLibraryEndangeredArchivesProgram/tabid/274/Default.aspx |date=18 March 1921 |website=inep-bissau.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105514/http://www.inep-bissau.org/Arquivos/Projectos/BritishLibraryEndangeredArchivesProgram/tabid/274/Default.aspx |archive-date=4 March 2016 |access-date=22 June 2013}}</ref>

==== Slave trade ====

Guinea-Bissau was among the first regions whose people engaged in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. For centuries its warriors had sent captives as slaves to North Africa. While it did not produce the same number of enslaved people to export to the Americas as other regions, the effects were still significant.<ref>Gale Group. (2017). "Guinea-Bissau." In M. S. Hill (Ed.), ''Worldmark encyclopedia of the nations'' (14th ed., Vol. 2, pp. 379–392). Gale.</ref><ref name="historyworld">{{cite web |title=HISTORY OF GUINEA-BISSAU |url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=oxa |website=historyworld.net |access-date=26 January 2021}}</ref>

In Cape Verde, Guinean slaves were instrumental in developing the labor-intensive [[plantation]] economy: they cultivated and processed, growing [[indigo]] and [[cotton]], and also wove the panos cloth that became a standard currency in West Africa.<ref name=Brit/> During the 17th and 18th centuries, thousands of captive Africans were taken from the region every year by Portuguese, French, and British companies. An average of 3000 persons were shipped every year from [[Guinala]] alone.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|278}} Many of these captives were taken during the [[Fula jihads]] and, specifically, the wars between the [[Imamate of Futa Jallon]] and [[Kaabu]].<ref name=Dictionary/>{{rp|377}}

Wars were increasingly waged for the sole purpose of capturing slaves to sell to the Europeans in exchange for imported goods. They resembled man-hunts more than conflicts over territory or political power.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|204, 209}} The nobles and kings benefited, while the common people bore the brunt of the raiding and insecurity. If a noble was captured, they were likely to be released, as the captors, whoever they were, would generally accept a ransom in exchange for freeing them.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|229}} The relationship between kings and European traders was a partnership, with the two regularly making deals on how the trade was to be conducted, defining who could be enslaved and who could not, and the prices of the slaves. Contemporary chroniclers questioned multiple kings on their part in the slave trade, and noted that they recognised the trade as evil but participated because otherwise the Europeans would not buy any other goods from them.<ref name="Rodney-1966" />{{rp|230–4}}

Beginning in the late 18th century, European countries gradually began slowing and/or abolishing the slave trade. Portugal abandoned slavery in 1869 and [[Brazil]] in 1888, but a system of [[contract labor]] replaced it that was only barely better for the workers.<ref name=Dictionary/>{{rp|377}}

===Colonialism===
[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913-v2.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]
Up until the late 1800s, Portuguese control of their 'colony' outside of their forts and trading posts was a fiction. Guinea-Bissau became the scene of increased European colonial competition beginning in the 1860s. The dispute over the status of [[Bolama (town)|Bolama]] was resolved in Portugal's favor through the mediation of U.S. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in 1870, but French encroachment on Portuguese claims continued. In 1886 the [[Casamance]] region of what is now [[Senegal]] was ceded to them.<ref name = Brit/>

===Struggle for independence===
[[File:LG&CD - Guine Barro Jagudis 11.jpg|thumb|[[Portuguese Colonial War]] in [[Portuguese Guinea]], 1968]]

The [[Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde|African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC) was founded in 1956 under the leadership of [[Amílcar Cabral]]. Initially committed to peaceful methods, the 1959 [[Pidjiguiti massacre]] pushed the party towards more militarized tactics, leaning heavily on the political mobilization of the peasantry in the countryside. After years of planning and preparing from their base in [[Conakry]], the PAIGC launched the [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence]] on 23 January 1963.<ref name=Dictionary/>{{rp|289}}

Unlike guerrilla movements in other [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonies]], the PAIGC rapidly extended its control over large portions of the territory. Aided by the jungle-like terrain, it had easy access to borders with neighbouring allies and large quantities of arms from [[Cuba]], [[China]], the [[Soviet Union]], and left-leaning African countries. The PAIGC even managed to acquire a significant anti-aircraft capability in order to defend itself against aerial attack.<ref name=Dictionary/>{{rp|289–90}} By 1973, the PAIGC was in control of many parts of Guinea, although the movement suffered a setback in January 1973 when its founder and leader [[Amilcar Cabral]] was assassinated.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jan/17/lumumba-50th-anniversary-african-leaders-assassinations | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Victoria | last=Brittain | title=Africa: a continent drenched in the blood of revolutionary heroes | date=17 January 2011 | access-date=14 December 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117225438/https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jan/17/lumumba-50th-anniversary-african-leaders-assassinations | archive-date=17 January 2017 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> After Cabral's death, party leadership fell to [[Aristides Pereira]], who would later become the first president of the [[Republic of Cape Verde]].

[[Luís Cabral]], brother of Amílcar and co-founder of PAIGC, was appointed the first [[president of Guinea-Bissau]].<ref name="historyworld"/> Independence had begun under the best of auspices. The Bissau-Guinean diaspora had returned to the country en masse. A system of access to school for all had been created. Books were free and schools seemed to have a sufficient number of teachers.{{cn|date=July 2025}} The education of girls, previously neglected, was encouraged and a new school calendar, more adapted to the rural world, was adopted.

In 1980, economic conditions deteriorated significantly, leading to general discontent with the government in power. On 14 November 1980, [[João Bernardo Vieira]], known as "Nino Vieira", overthrew President Luís Cabral. The constitution was suspended and a nine-member Military Council of the Revolution, chaired by Vieira, was established. Since then, the country has moved toward a liberal economy. Budget cuts have been made at the expense of the social sector and education.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://diplo.org.br/2003-11,a787, |title=Tobias Engel, A sina da instabilidade, biblioteca diplo |access-date=3 March 2022 |archive-date=3 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220303022315/https://diplo.org.br/2003-11,a787, |url-status=dead }}</ref>
