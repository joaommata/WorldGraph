The [[Act of Independence of Central America]] dissolved the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] in September 1821, and Nicaragua soon [[Central America under Mexican rule|became part]] of the [[First Mexican Empire]]. In July 1823, after the overthrow of the Mexican monarchy in March of the same year, Nicaragua joined the newly formed [[Federal Republic of Central America|United Provinces of Central America]], a country later known as the Federal Republic of Central America.

Great Britain, which had claimed the [[Mosquito Coast]] as a [[protectorate]] since 1655, delegated the area to Honduras in 1859 before transferring it to Nicaragua in 1860.

=== United States occupation (1909–1933) ===
{{See also|United States occupation of Nicaragua}}

In 1909, the United States supported the forces rebelling against President Zelaya. U.S. motives included differences over the proposed [[Nicaragua Canal]], Nicaragua's potential to destabilize the region, and Zelaya's attempts to regulate foreign access to Nicaraguan natural resources. On 18&nbsp;November 1909, U.S. warships were sent to the area after 500 revolutionaries (including two Americans) were executed by order of Zelaya. The U.S. justified the intervention by claiming to protect U.S. lives and property. Zelaya resigned later that year.{{cn|date=July 2025}}

In August 1912, the President of Nicaragua, [[Adolfo Díaz]], requested the secretary of war, General [[Luis Mena (Nicaraguan politician)|Luis Mena]], to resign for fear he was leading an insurrection. Mena fled Managua with his brother, the chief of police of Managua, to start an insurrection. After Mena's troops captured steam boats of an American company, the U.S. delegation asked President Díaz to ensure the safety of American citizens and property during the insurrection. He replied he could not, and asked the U.S. to intervene in the conflict.<ref>{{cite book|title=Foreign Relations of the United States|year=1912|page=1032}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Langley|first=Lester D.|title=The Banana Wars: United States Intervention in the Caribbean, 1898–1934|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xc1RBfZd3pcC&pg=PA64|year=2002|publisher=SR Books|location=Wilmington|isbn=978-0-8420-5047-0|page=64|access-date=5 February 2024|archive-date=5 February 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240205140307/https://books.google.com/books?id=Xc1RBfZd3pcC&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref>
