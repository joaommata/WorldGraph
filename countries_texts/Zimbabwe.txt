Societies speaking proto-[[Shona languages]] first emerged in the middle [[Limpopo River]] valley in the 9th century before moving on to the Zimbabwean highlands. The Zimbabwean plateau became the centre of subsequent Shona states, beginning around the 10th century. Around the early 10th century, trade developed with [[Shirazi era|Arab merchants]] on the Indian Ocean coast, helping to develop the [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]] in the 13th century. This was the precursor to the Shona civilisations that dominated the region from the 13th century, evidenced by ruins at [[Great Zimbabwe]], near [[Masvingo]], and by other smaller sites. The main archaeological site used a unique dry stone architecture. The Kingdom of Mapungubwe was the first in a series of trading states which had developed in Zimbabwe by the time the first European explorers arrived from Portugal. These states traded gold, ivory, and copper for cloth and glass.<ref name="autogenerated241">{{cite book|title= Historical Archaeology |last= Hall|first= Martin|author2= Stephen W. Silliman|year= 2005|publisher= Wiley Blackwell|isbn= 978-1-4051-0751-8|pages=241–44}}</ref>

By 1300, the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]] eclipsed Mapungubwe. This Shona state further refined and expanded upon Mapungubwe's stone architecture. From {{circa}} 1450 to 1760, the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]] ruled much of the area of present-day Zimbabwe, plus parts of central Mozambique. It is known by many names including the Mutapa Empire, also known as ''Mwene Mutapa'' or ''Monomotapa'' as well as "Munhumutapa", and was renowned for its strategic trade routes with the Arabs and Portugal. The Portuguese sought to monopolise this influence and began a series of wars which left the empire in near collapse in the early 17th century.<ref name="autogenerated241" />

As a direct response to increased European presence in the interior a new Shona state emerged, known as the [[Rozvi Empire|Rozwi Empire]]. Relying on centuries of military, political and religious development, the Rozwi (meaning "destroyers") expelled the Portuguese from the Zimbabwean plateau in 1683. Around 1821 the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] general [[Mzilikazi]] of the [[Khumalo clan]] successfully rebelled against King [[Shaka]] and established his own clan, the [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]]. The Ndebele fought their way northwards into the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], leaving a trail of destruction in their wake and beginning an era of widespread devastation known as the [[Mfecane]]. When Dutch [[Boers|trekboers]] converged on the Transvaal in 1836, they drove the tribe even further northward, with the assistance of [[Tswana people|Tswana]] [[Barolong]] warriors and [[Griqua people|Griqua]] commandos. By 1838 the Ndebele had conquered the Rozwi Empire, along with the other smaller Shona states, and reduced them to [[vassal]]dom.<ref name="zimstudy">{{cite book|last= Nelson|first= Harold|title= Zimbabwe: A Country Study |pages= 1–317|publisher= The Studies | year= 1983}}</ref>

[[File:Harris - Ndebelekraal.png|thumb|A Matabele [[kraal]], as depicted by [[William Cornwallis Harris]], 1836]]
After losing their remaining South African lands in 1840, Mzilikazi and his tribe permanently settled in the southwest of present-day Zimbabwe in what became known as Matabeleland, establishing [[Bulawayo]] as their capital. Mzilikazi then organised his society into a military system with regimental [[kraal]]s, similar to those of Shaka, which was stable enough to repel further Boer incursions. Mzilikazi died in 1868; following a violent power struggle, his son [[Lobengula]] succeeded him.

In the 1880s, European colonists arrived with [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[British South Africa Company]] (chartered in 1889). In 1888, Rhodes obtained a [[Rudd Concession|concession for mining rights]] from King [[Lobengula]] of the Ndebele peoples.<ref name="mining">

In 1893 and 1894, with the help of their new [[Maxim gun|Maxim]] guns, the BSAP would go on to defeat the Ndebele in the [[First Matabele War]].

The region to the north, administered separately, was later termed [[Northern Rhodesia]] (present-day Zambia). Shortly after the disastrous Rhodes-sponsored [[Jameson Raid]] on the [[South African Republic]], the Ndebele rebelled against white rule, led by their charismatic religious leader, Mlimo. The [[Second Matabele War]] of 1896–1897 lasted in Matabeleland until 1896, when Mlimo was assassinated by American scout [[Frederick Russell Burnham]]. Shona agitators staged unsuccessful revolts (known as ''[[Chimurenga]]'') against company rule during 1896 and 1897.{{citation needed|date= September 2015}} Following these failed insurrections, the Rhodes administration subdued the Ndebele and Shona groups and organised the land with a disproportionate bias favouring Europeans, thus displacing many indigenous peoples.<ref name="sahistory.org.za">{{Cite web|url= https://www.sahistory.org.za/place/zimbabwe|title= Zimbabwe {{!}} South African History Online|website= www.sahistory.org.za|language= en|access-date= 3 February 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190107164147/http://www.sahistory.org.za/place/zimbabwe|archive-date= 7 January 2019|url-status= dead}}</ref>

The [[Land Apportionment Act of 1930|1930 Land Apportionment Act]] restricted black land ownership to certain segments of the country, setting aside large areas solely for the purchase of the white minority.

Following [[Zambia Independence Act 1964|Zambian independence]] (effective from October 1964), [[Ian Smith]]'s [[Rhodesian Front]] government in Salisbury dropped the designation "Southern" in 1964 (once ''Northern Rhodesia'' had changed its name to ''Zambia'', having the word ''Southern'' before the name ''Rhodesia'' became unnecessary and the country simply became known as ''Rhodesia'' afterwards). Intent on effectively repudiating the recently adopted British policy of "[[no independence before majority rule]]", Smith issued a [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] (UDI) from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965. This marked the first such course taken by a rebel British colony since the [[United States Declaration of Independence|American declaration]] of 1776, which Smith and others indeed claimed provided a suitable precedent to their own actions.<ref name="moorcraft">

The United Kingdom deemed the Rhodesian declaration an act of rebellion but did not re-establish control by force. The British government petitioned the United Nations for [[economic sanctions|sanctions]] against Rhodesia pending unsuccessful talks with Smith's administration in 1966 and 1968. In December 1966, the organisation complied, imposing the first mandatory trade embargo on an autonomous state.<ref name="eafp">Hastedt, Glenn P. (2004) ''Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy'', Infobase Publishing, p. 537; {{ISBN|143810989X}}.</ref> These sanctions were expanded again in 1968.<ref name="eafp" />

A civil war ensued when [[Joshua Nkomo]]'s [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) and Robert Mugabe's [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), supported actively by communist powers and neighbouring African nations, initiated [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla operations]] against Rhodesia's predominantly white government. ZAPU was supported by the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Warsaw Pact]] and associated nations such as Cuba, and adopted a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] ideology; ZANU meanwhile aligned itself with [[Maoism]] and the bloc headed by the People's Republic of China. Smith declared Rhodesia a republic in 1970, following the results of a [[1969 Rhodesian constitutional referendum|referendum the previous year]], but this went unrecognised internationally. Meanwhile, Rhodesia's internal conflict intensified, eventually forcing him to open negotiations with the militant communists.

In March 1978, Smith reached an accord with three African leaders, led by Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]], who offered to leave the white population comfortably entrenched in exchange for the establishment of a biracial democracy. As a result of the [[Internal Settlement]], [[1979 Rhodesian general election|elections were held in April 1979]], concluding with the [[United African National Council]] (UANC) carrying a majority of parliamentary seats. On 1 June 1979, Muzorewa, the UANC head, became prime minister and the country's name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The Internal Settlement left control of the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]], civil service, judiciary, and a third of parliament seats to whites.<ref name="endsanctions">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/1/newsid_2492000/2492915.stm|title=On This Day|work=BBC News|access-date=14 December 2008 | date=1 June 1979}}</ref> On 12 June, the [[United States Senate]] voted to lift economic pressure on the former Rhodesia.

Following the [[1979 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|fifth Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]], held in [[Lusaka]], Zambia, from 1 to 7 August in 1979, the British government invited Muzorewa, Mugabe, and Nkomo to participate in a constitutional conference at [[Lancaster House]]. The purpose of the conference was to discuss and reach an agreement on the terms of an independence constitution, and provide for elections supervised under British authority allowing Zimbabwe Rhodesia to proceed to legal independence.<ref name="chair">Chung, Fay (2006).

In December 2017, the website Zimbabwe News, calculating the cost of the Mugabe era using various statistics, said that at the time of independence in 1980, the country was growing economically at about five per cent a year, and had done so for quite a long time. If this rate of growth had been maintained for the next 37 years, Zimbabwe would have, in 2016, a GDP of US$52 billion. Instead it had a formal sector GDP of only US$14 billion, a cost of US$38 billion in lost growth. The population growth in 1980 was among the highest in Africa at about 3.5 per cent per annum, doubling every 21 years. Had this growth been maintained, the population would have been 31 million. Instead, as of 2018, it is about 13 million. The discrepancies were believed to be partly caused by death from starvation and disease, and partly due to decreased fertility. The life expectancy has halved, and deaths from politically motivated violence sponsored by the government exceed 200,000 since 1980. The Mugabe government has directly or indirectly caused the deaths of at least three million Zimbabweans in 37 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newzimbabwe.com/columns-40850-The+costs+of+the+Robert+Mugabe+era/columns.aspx|title=The costs of the Robert Mugabe era|website=newzimbabwe.com|access-date=12 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201005250/http://www.newzimbabwe.com/columns-40850-The+costs+of+the+Robert+Mugabe+era/columns.aspx|archive-date=1 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> According to the [[World Food Programme]], over two million people are facing starvation because of the recent droughts the country is going through.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/07/africa/zimbabwe-millions-starvation-intl/index.html|title=Millions in Zimbabwe facing starvation after severe droughts, UN food agency says|author=Mark Chingono and Bukola Adebayo|website=CNN|date=7 August 2019|access-date=14 August 2019}}</ref>
