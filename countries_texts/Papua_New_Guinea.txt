Archaeological evidence indicates that modern humans first arrived in what became [[Sahul|New Guinea and Australia]], as well as the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], around 42,000 to 45,000 years ago. Bougainville was settled by around 28,000 years ago, and the more distant [[Manus Island]] by around 20,000 years ago. These were part of the [[Early human migrations|earliest migrations of humans]] from Africa, and the resulting populations remained relatively isolated from the rest of the world throughout prehistory.<ref name="Bourke2009">{{cite book |author=R.

Trade became rarer around 300&nbsp;AD, as demand for goods shifted to the [[Maluku Islands]] and [[Timor]]. After European interest in the region grew in the 16th century, Dutch influence grew over the [[Sultanate of Tidore]].

On New Guinea, communities were economically linked through trading networks.

By the 1800s, there was some trade with the [[Dutch East Indies]].

In 1888, the British protectorate was annexed by [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In 1902, Papua was effectively transferred to the authority of the [[Federation of Australia|newly federated]] British [[dominion]] of [[Australia]]. With the passage of the [[Papua Act 1905]], the area was officially renamed the [[Territory of Papua]],<ref name="Gardner2024"/>{{rp|227}} and the Australian administration became formal in 1906,<ref name="BBCTimeline"/> with Papua becoming fully annexed as an Australian territory.<ref name="Gardner2024"/>{{rp|225}}

Under European rule, social relations amongst the New Guinean population changed. Tribal fighting decreased, while in new urban areas there was greater mixing as people moved to partake in the [[cash crop]] economy. The large inequality between colonial administrators and locals led to the emergence of what colonial governments called [[cargo cult]]s.<ref name="May2004chapter4"/>{{rp|52–53}} One of the most significant impacts was to changes in local travel.

During [[World War II]], Japanese forces sought to capture Port Moresby, invading overland in mid-1942 and moving south in the [[Kokoda Track campaign]].

Upon independence, most Australian officials, including agricultural, economic, educational, and medicinal staff, left the territory.

Challenging the State}}</ref>{{rp|257}}

While warfare significantly decreased under Australian governance, tribal fighting in the highland areas increased in the 1970s. These areas had been under outside control for less time, meaning former tribal conflict was still remembered and restarted upon independence. The first state of emergency there was declared in 1979, although it and similar interventions did not quell the violence. Unemployment and imbalanced gender ratios in cities meant tribal fighting morphed into the [[Raskol gangs|emergence of gangs]]. Gang violence led to a state of emergency in Port Moresby in 1984, which led to the intervention of the [[Papua New Guinea Defence Force]] (PNGDF). The effectiveness of this deployment led to further [[Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary|police]] and military interventions elsewhere. Both the police and military became more politicised, and less disciplined. Demand for private security increased as a response, and foreign investment was deterred.<ref name="May2004chapter2"/>{{rp|29, 32}}<ref name="May2004chapter1"/>{{rp|8–9}}<ref name="May2004chapter12"/>{{rp|260–261, 264, 270}}<ref name="May2004chapter10">{{cite book |author=R.J.

Some of their responsibilities were devolved towards local governments, a factor that caused significant controversy due to an expected lack of capacity at this level.

The employment needs of the Bougainville mine decreased after construction was completed, meaning younger individuals received little benefit from the presence of the mine. A renewed [[Bougainville conflict|uprising on Bougainville]] started in 1988, fighting against both the Bougainville government and the national government. After the mine closed in May 1989, the [[Bougainville Revolutionary Army]] (BRA) declared independence, and the national government pulled out in 1990 and blockaded the province, the conflict shifted into a complex internal civil war. National security forces re-entered the island at the end of 1990, and together with local allies slowly gained more control.<ref name="RNZbriefhistory"/><ref name="Phillips2015"/><ref name="May2004chapter12"/>{{rp|266–267}} An agreement between the government and some rebels was reached in October 1994, and in 1995 a transitional Bougainville government was established, although fighting continued with the BRA.<ref name="BBCTimeline"/> In 1997, the [[Sandline affair]] over the hiring of mercenaries to intervene in Bougainville brought down the national government.

The first decade of independence saw slow but steady economic growth. The [[Ok Tedi Mine]] opened in 1982. While Australian contribution to the budget dropped from 40% of government revenue in 1975 to 17% in 1988, improved taxation allowed for government expenditure to be maintained.<ref name="May2004chapter15"/>{{rp|312–313}} The closure of the Bougainville mine led to issues with government finances, however an expansion of exports of oil, minerals, and forestry products led to economic recovery in the early 1990s. This growth did not decrease inequality however, and government services declined.<ref name="May2004chapter12"/>{{rp|263–264}} Increasing government expense and resulting rising debt led to [[1994 Papua New Guinea financial crisis|significant economic trouble]]. The [[Papua New Guinean kina]] was devalued and put on a [[floating exchange rate]] in 1994, and the country obtained an emergency loan from the [[World Bank]] in 1995.<ref name="May2004chapter15"/>{{rp|313–314}}

In the [[1997 Papua New Guinean general election|1997 election]], only 4 candidates won overall majorities, with 95 (87%) of winners receiving less than 30% of the vote. After government changed mid-parliament in 1999, a Constitutional Development Commission was established to bring about political reform. The resulting [[Organic Law on the Integrity of Political Parties and Candidates]] created public funding for registered parties, incentivised the selection of female candidates, and instituted punishments for [[Party switching|party hopping]]. It also barred independent MPs from voting for the prime minister, or from joining coalitions before a prime minister is elected.<ref name="May2004chapter1"/>{{rp|3–7}} Another measure was to begin a shift from first past the post to a Limited Preferential Vote system (LPV), a version of the [[instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]].<ref name="May2022chapter2"/>{{rp|17}}<ref name="May2022chapter1">{{cite book |author=R.J.
