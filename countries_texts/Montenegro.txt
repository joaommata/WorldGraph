Its power started declining at the beginning of the 12th century. After King Bodin's death (in 1101 or 1108), civil wars ensued. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav's son, [[Mihailo I of Duklja|Mihailo]] (1046–1081), and his grandson [[Constantine Bodin]] (1081–1101).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970116032145/http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 January 1997|title=Duklja, the first Montenegrin state|publisher=Montenegro.org|access-date=7 December 2012}}</ref>

As the nobility fought for the throne, the kingdom was weakened, and by 1186, the territory of modern-day Montenegro became part of the state ruled by [[Stefan Nemanja]] and was a part of various state formations ruled by the [[Nemanjić dynasty]] for the next two centuries. After the [[Serbian Empire]] collapsed in the second half of the 14th century, the most powerful Zetan family, the [[Balšić]]s, became sovereigns of Zeta.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://centruldestudiitransilvane.ro/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/3.1.-Premovic-co_-SuplimTR.1.2024.pdf |title=Zeta Under the Balšić Dynasty and the Ottoman Empire (1385–1421) |website=centruldestudiitransilvane.ro |access-date=21 April 2025 }}</ref>

In 1421, Zeta was annexed to the [[Serbian Despotate]], but after 1455, another noble family from Zeta, the [[Crnojević]]s, became sovereign rulers of the country, making it the last free monarchy of the Balkans before it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1496, and got annexed to the ''[[sanjak]]'' of [[Shkodër]]. For a short time, Montenegro existed as a separate autonomous ''sanjak'' in 1514–1528 ([[Sanjak of Montenegro]]). Also, [[Old Herzegovina]] region was part of [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]].{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

From 1392, numerous parts of the territory were controlled by [[Republic of Venice]], including the city of [[Budva]], in that time known as "Budua". 
The Venetian territory was centred on the [[Bay of Kotor]], and the Republic introduced governors who meddled in Montenegrin politics.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Venita Albania |url=https://albanianstudies.weebly.com/venita-albania.html |access-date=20 April 2025 |website=My Albanian studies |language=en}}</ref> Venice controlled territories in present-day Montenegro until [[Fall of the Republic of Venice|its fall]] in 1797.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Schmitt |first=Oliver Jens |title=Das Venezianische Albanien (1392–1479) |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2001 |isbn=978-3-486-56569-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=28 September 2007 |title=News ITALIA PRESS |url=http://www.newsitaliapress.it/interna.asp?sez=245&info=136207 |access-date=8 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928163000/http://www.newsitaliapress.it/interna.asp?sez=245&info=136207 |archive-date=28 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=City ...

Large portions fell under the control of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1496 to 1878. In the 16th century, Montenegro developed a unique form of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire that permitted Montenegrin clans freedom from certain restrictions. Nevertheless, the Montenegrins were disgruntled with Ottoman rule, and in the 17th century, repeatedly rebelled, which culminated in the defeat of the Ottomans in the [[Great Turkish War]] at the end of that century.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

Montenegrin territories were controlled by warlike clans. Most clans had a chieftain (''knez''), who was not permitted to assume the title unless he proved to be as worthy a leader as his predecessor. An assembly of Montenegrin clans (''Zbor'') was held every year on 12 July in Cetinje, and any adult clansman could take part.<ref name="Visit Montenegro">{{cite web| title=The History of Cetinje| website=Visit Montenegro| url=https://www.visit-montenegro.com/destinations/cetinje/info/history| access-date=22 June 2021}}</ref> In 1515, Montenegro became a [[theocracy]] led by the [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral]], which flourished after the [[Petrović-Njegoš]] of Cetinje became the prince-bishop (whose title was "Vladika of Montenegro").{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

=== Principality and Kingdom of Montenegro ===
{{Main|Principality of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro}}

In 1858, one of the major Montenegrin victories over the Ottomans occurred at the [[Battle of Grahovac]]. [[Mirko Petrović Njegoš|Grand Duke Mirko Petrović]], elder brother of [[Knjaz Danilo]], led an army of 7,500 and defeated the numerically superior Ottomans with 15,000 troops at [[Grahovac, Montenegro|Grahovac]] on 1 May 1858. This forced the [[Great Powers]] to officially demarcate the borders between Montenegro and Ottoman Empire, ''de facto'' recognising Montenegro's independence.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

In the [[Battle of Vučji Do]] Montenegrins inflicted a major defeat on the Ottoman Army under Grand Vizier [[Ahmed Muhtar Pasha]]. In the aftermath of the Russian victory against the Ottoman Empire in the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878]], the [[great powers of Europe|major powers]] restructured the map of the Balkan region. The Ottoman Empire recognised the independence of Montenegro in the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hertslet |first=Edward |url=https://dn790008.ca.archive.org/0/items/mapofeuropebytre04hert/mapofeuropebytre04hert.pdf |title=THE MAP OF EUROPE BY TREATYSHOWING THE VARIOUS POLITICAL AND TERRITORIAL CHANGES WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE THE GENERAL PEACE OF 1814.

The first Montenegrin constitution (also known as the Danilo Code) was proclaimed in 1855. Under [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nicholas I]] (ruled 1860–1918), the [[principality]] was enlarged several times in the Montenegro-Turkish Wars and was recognised as independent in 1878.

The political skills of Abdul Hamid II and Nicholas I played a major role in the mutually amicable relations.<ref name="ttk.gov.tr" /> Modernization of the state followed, culminating with the draft of a Constitution in 1905. However, political rifts emerged between the reigning [[People's Party (Montenegro, 1906)|People's Party]], who supported the process of democratisation and union with Serbia, and those of the [[True People's Party]], who were monarchist.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

In 1910, Montenegro became [[Kingdom of Montenegro|a kingdom]], and as a result of the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–1913, a common border with Serbia was established, with [[Shkodër]] being awarded to [[Albania]], though the current capital city of Montenegro, Podgorica, was on the old border of Albania and Yugoslavia. Montenegro became one of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] during World War I (1914–1918). In the [[Battle of Mojkovac]] fought in January 1916 between [[Austria-Hungary]] and the Kingdom of Montenegro, Montenegrins achieved a decisive victory even though they were outnumbered five to one. The Austro-Hungarians accepted military surrender on 25 January 1916.{{sfn|Pope|Wheal|Robbins|2003|p=431}} From 1916 to October 1918 Austria-Hungary occupied Montenegro.

[[File:Locator map Zeta Banovina in Yugoslavia 1929-1939.svg|thumb|right|Locator map of [[Zeta Banovina]] in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]]]

In 1922, Montenegro formally became the [[Zeta Oblast|Oblast of Cetinje]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], with the addition of the coastal areas around [[Budva]] and [[Bay of Kotor]]. In a further restructuring in 1929, it became a part of a larger [[Zeta Banate]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] that reached the [[Neretva]] River.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

Nicholas's grandson, the Serb King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]], dominated the Yugoslav government. [[Zeta Banovina]] was one of nine banovinas that formed the kingdom; it consisted of the present-day Montenegro and parts of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia.<ref>{{Cite web |title=FEATURES OF THE TERRITORIAL STRUCTURE OF YUGOSLAVIA UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OF 1931 {{!}} Yur-VAK |url=https://urvak.org/articles/probe-vypusk-3-osobennosti-politiko-territorialnog/ |access-date=2 September 2025 |website=urvak.org |language=en}}</ref>

In May, the Montenegrin branch of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia started preparations for an uprising planned for mid-July. The Communist Party and its Youth League organised 6,000 of its members into detachments prepared for [[guerrilla warfare]]. According to some historians, the first armed uprising in [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-occupied Europe happened on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2010&mm=07&dd=13&nav_category=167&nav_id=445290|title=Prema oceni istoričara, Trinaestojulski ustanak bio je prvi i najmasovniji oružani otpor u porobljenoj Evropi 1941. godine|date=13 July 2010|publisher=B92.net|language=sr|access-date=7 December 2012}}</ref>

Unexpectedly, the uprising took hold, and by 20 July, 32,000 men and women had joined the fight. Except for the coast and major towns (Podgorica, Cetinje, Pljevlja, and Nikšić), which were besieged, Montenegro was mostly liberated. In a month of fighting, the Italian army suffered 5,000 dead, wounded, and captured. The uprising lasted until mid-August, when it was suppressed by a counter-offensive of 67,000 Italian troops brought in from Albania. Faced with new and overwhelming Italian forces, many of the fighters laid down their arms and returned home. Nevertheless, intense guerrilla fighting lasted until December.

Fighters who remained under arms fractured into two groups. Most of them went on to join the Yugoslav Partisans, consisting of communists and those inclined towards active resistance; these included [[Arso Jovanović]], [[Sava Kovačević]], [[Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo]], [[Milovan Đilas]], [[Peko Dapčević]], [[Vlado Dapčević]], [[Veljko Vlahović]], and [[Blažo Jovanović]]. Those loyal to the [[Karađorđević dynasty]] and opposing communism went on to become [[Chetniks]], and turned to collaboration with Italians against the Partisans.

War broke out between Partisans and Chetniks during the first half of 1942. Pressured by Italians and Chetniks, the core of the Montenegrin Partisans went to Serbia and Bosnia, where they joined with other Yugoslav Partisans. Fighting between Partisans and Chetniks continued through the war. Chetniks with Italian backing controlled most of the country from mid-1942 to April 1943. Montenegrin Chetniks received the status of "anti-communist militia" and received weapons, ammunition, food rations, and money from Italy. Most of them were moved to [[Mostar]], where they fought in the [[Battle of Neretva]] against the Partisans, but were dealt a heavy defeat.

During German operation Schwartz against the Partisans in May and June 1943, Germans disarmed many Chetniks without fighting, as they feared they would turn against them in case of an Allied invasion of the Balkans. After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, Partisans managed to take hold of most of Montenegro for a brief time, but Montenegro was soon [[German occupied territory of Montenegro|occupied by German forces]], and fierce fighting continued during late 1943 and 1944. Montenegro was liberated by the Partisans in December 1944.

Montenegro became one of the six constituent republics of the communist [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY). Its capital became Podgorica, renamed [[Titograd]] in honour of President [[Josip Broz Tito]]. After the war, the infrastructure of Yugoslavia was rebuilt, industrialization began, and the [[University of Montenegro]] was established. Greater autonomy was established until the [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]] ratified a new constitution in 1974.<ref name="Roberts 1978 pp. 136–146">{{cite journal| last=Roberts| first=Adam| title=Yugoslavia: The Constitution and the Succession| journal=The World Today| publisher=Royal Institute of International Affairs| volume=34| issue=4| year=1978| issn=0043-9134| jstor=40395044| pages=136–146| url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40395044| access-date=22 June 2021}}</ref><ref>[http://mojustav.rs/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ustav-SFRJ-iz-1974.pdf Ustav Socijalističke Federativne : Republike Jugoslavije] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210818185853/http://mojustav.rs/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ustav-SFRJ-iz-1974.pdf |date=18 August 2021 }} (1974).

In 1996, [[Milo Đukanović]]'s government severed ties between Montenegro and its partner Serbia, which was led by [[Slobodan Milošević]]. Montenegro formed its own [[economic policy]] and adopted the German [[Deutsche Mark]] as its currency and subsequently [[Montenegro and the euro|adopted the euro]], although not part of the [[Eurozone]].

A total of 419,240 votes were cast, representing 86.5% of the electorate; 230,661 votes (55.5%) were for independence and 185,002 votes (44.5%) were against.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5007364.stm|title=Montenegro vote result confirmed|work=BBC News|date=23 May 2006|access-date=11 September 2010}}</ref> This narrowly surpassed the 55% threshold needed to validate the referendum under the rules set by the European Union. According to the electoral commission, the 55% threshold was passed by only 2,300 votes. Serbia, the member-states of the European Union, and the [[permanent members of the United Nations Security Council]] all [[diplomatic recognition|recognised]] Montenegro's independence.

The 2006 referendum was monitored by five international observer missions, headed by an [[OSCE]]/[[ODIHR]] team, and around 3,000 observers in total (including domestic observers from [[Center for Democracy and Technology|CDT]] (OSCE PA), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe (CLRAE), and the European Parliament (EP) to form an International Referendum Observation Mission (IROM). The IROM—in its preliminary report—"assessed compliance of the referendum process with OSCE commitments, Council of Europe commitments, other international standards for democratic electoral processes, and domestic legislation." Furthermore, the report stated that the competitive pre-referendum environment was marked by an active and generally peaceful campaign and that "there were no reports of restrictions on fundamental civil and political rights".

On 3 June 2006, the Montenegrin Parliament declared the independence of Montenegro,<ref>{{cite news|title=Montenegro declares independence|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5043462.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=4 June 2006|access-date=11 September 2010}}</ref> formally confirming the result of the referendum.

On 28 June 2006, Montenegro joined the [[United Nations]] as its 192nd member state.<ref>{{cite web|title=General Assembly Approves Admission of Montenegro to United Nations, Increasing Number of Member States to 192 {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2006/ga10479.doc.htm|website=www.un.org}}</ref>

Montenegro has been dominated since the breakup of Yugoslavia by [[Milo Đukanović]] (four-time prime minister and twice president), accused of having established an [[authoritarianism]] and [[clientelist]] regime, while maintaining close relations with [[organized crime]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2 June 2009|title=Djukanovic's Montenegro a family business – ICIJ|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/tobacco-underground/djukanovics-montenegro-family-business/|access-date=|language=en-US}}</ref> The massive privatizations of the Đukanović era lead to the enrichment of him and oligarchs close to him. His brother Aleksandar, owner of Montenegro's first private bank, oversaw the privatizations, while his sister, Ana Kolarevic, has long controlled the judiciary. The clientelist networks of the ruling party dominated all segments of social life. A party card was required to start a business or obtain a position in the administration. This policy also contributed to the reinforcement of regional disparities and social inequalities. Unemployment climbs to 36.6 per cent in the northern part of the country, compared to 3.9 per cent in the coastal region, while a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line (2018).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Otašević|first=Ana|date=1 April 2021|title=Montenegro's ragged coalition|url=https://mondediplo.com/2021/04/06montenegro|access-date=|website=|language=en}}</ref>

The [[Law on the Status of the Descendants of the Petrović Njegoš Dynasty]] was passed by the Parliament of Montenegro on 12 July 2011. It rehabilitated the [[House of Petrović-Njegoš|Royal House of Montenegro]] and recognised limited symbolic roles within the constitutional framework of the republic.
