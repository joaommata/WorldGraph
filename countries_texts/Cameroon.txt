[[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese sailors]] reached the coast in 1472. They noted an abundance of the ghost shrimp ''[[Lepidophthalmus turneranus]]'' in the [[Wouri River]] and named it {{lang|pt|Rio dos Camarões}} (''Shrimp River''), which became ''Cameroon'' in English.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pondi |first=J.E. |title=Cameroon and the Commonwealth of nations |journal=The Round Table |volume=86 |issue=344 |pages=563–570 |year=1997 |doi=10.1080/00358539708454389 |issn=0035-8533 }}</ref> Over the following few centuries, European interests regularised trade with the coastal peoples, and Christian [[missionaries]] pushed inland.<ref name=Fanso/>

===German rule===
{{main|Kamerun}}
Germany began to establish roots in Cameroon in 1868 when the Woermann Company of Hamburg built a warehouse. It was built on the estuary of the Wouri River. Later, [[Gustav Nachtigal]] made a treaty with one of the local kings to annex the region for the German emperor.<ref name=historyworld>{{cite web |url=http://historyworld.net |title=historyworld |access-date=17 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190407073336/http://historyworld.net/ |archive-date=7 April 2019 }}</ref> The [[German Empire]] claimed the territory as the colony of [[Kamerun]] in 1884 and began a steady push inland; the natives resisted in the [[Bafut Wars]] and [[Adamawa Wars]]. Under the aegis of Germany, commercial companies were local administrations. These [[Concession (contract)|concession]]s used [[Unfree labour|forced labour]] to run profitable banana, rubber, palm oil, and cocoa plantations.<ref name=historyworld/> Even infrastructure projects relied on a regimen of forced labour. This economic policy was much criticised by the other colonial powers.<ref name="DeLancey 125">[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 125.</ref>

===French and British rule===
{{main|French Cameroon|British Cameroon}}
[[File:UPC-LEADERS.jpg|thumb|right|Leaders of the pro-independence [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon|UPC]]]]
With the defeat of Germany in [[World War I]], Kamerun became a [[League of Nations mandate]] territory and was split into [[French Cameroon]] ({{langx|fr|Cameroun}}) and [[British Cameroon]] in 1919. France integrated the economy of Cameroon with that of France<ref name="DeLancey 5">[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 5.</ref> and improved the infrastructure with capital investments and skilled workers, modifying the colonial system of [[forced labour]].<ref name="DeLancey 125"/> Britain offered German owned plantations to the highest bidder with the intent of paying the proceeds into a [[World War I reparations]] account. But few investors were willing to buy at the London auctions. Eventually Britain sold the majority of German plantations in British Cameroon back to their original German owners and opened up African maritime ports for German trade. The British also encouraged German investment in the [[Tanganyika Territory]]. German companies built warehouses in [[Douala]] but were not allowed to purchase land.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Susan Pedersen |title=The Guardians: The League of Nations and the Crisis of Empire |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780190226398 |pages=234 & 236 |year=2015 }}</ref>

The British administered their territory from neighbouring Nigeria. Natives complained that this made them a neglected "colony of a colony". Nigerian migrant workers flocked to Southern Cameroons, ending forced labour altogether but angering the local natives, who felt swamped.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 4.</ref> The League of Nations mandates were converted into [[United Nations Trusteeship Council|United Nations Trusteeships]] in 1946, and the question of independence became a pressing issue in French Cameroon.<ref name="DeLancey 5"/>

France outlawed the pro-independence political party, the [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon]] ({{langx|fr|Union des Populations du Cameroun}}, UPC), on 13 July 1955.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Terretta |first1=M. |title=Cameroonian Nationalists Go Global: From Forest Maquis to a Pan-African Accra |doi=10.1017/S0021853710000253 |journal=The Journal of African History |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=189–212 |year=2010 |s2cid=154604590 }}</ref> This prompted a [[Bamileke War|long guerrilla war]] waged by the UPC and the assassination of several of the party's leaders, including [[Ruben Um Nyobè]], [[Félix-Roland Moumié]] and [[Ernest Ouandie]]. In the British Cameroons, the question was whether to reunify with French Cameroon or join Nigeria; the British ruled out the option of independence.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Takougang |first1=J. |title=Nationalism, democratisation and political opportunism in Cameroon |doi=10.1080/0258900032000142455 |journal=Journal of Contemporary African Studies |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=427–445 |year=2003 |s2cid=153564848 }}</ref>

===Independence===
On 1 January 1960, French Cameroun gained independence from France under President [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]] as the Republic of Cameroon.{{Citation needed|date=August 2025}}

====Federal Republic of Cameroon====
[[File:Flag of Cameroon (1961–1975).svg|thumb|Flag of the Federal Republic of Cameroon]]
On 1 October 1961, the formerly British [[Southern Cameroons]] gained independence from the United Kingdom by vote of the UN General Assembly and merged into the Republic of Cameroon to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. The federal republic was composed of two federated states, [[East Cameroon]] and [[West Cameroon]], each with its own legislature, government, and prime minister. 1 October is now observed as [[Unification Day (Cameroon)|Unification Day]], a [[Public holidays in Cameroon|public holiday]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Diane Cook |title=Cameroon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jn7TBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT95 |date=2 September 2014 |publisher=Mason Crest |isbn=978-1-4222-9434-5 |page=95 }}</ref> Ahidjo used the ongoing war with the UPC to concentrate power in the presidency, continuing with this even after the suppression of the UPC in 1971.<ref name="DeLancey 6">[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 6.</ref>

====United Republic of Cameroon and Republic of Cameroon====
[[File:Ahmadou Ahidjo.jpg|thumb|Former president [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]] ruled from 1960 until 1982.]]
Ahidjo's political party, the [[Cameroonian National Union|Cameroon National Union]] (CNU), became the sole legal political party on 1 September 1966, and on 20 May 1972, a [[1972 Cameroonian constitutional referendum|referendum]] was passed to abolish the [[Federation|federal system of government]] in favour of a United Republic of Cameroon, headed from [[Yaoundé]].<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 19.</ref> This day is now the country's [[National Day (Cameroon)|National Day]], a public holiday.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.prc.cm/en/multimedia/photo-albums/37-20-may-national-day |title=20 May National Day |website=Presidency of the Republic of Cameroon |access-date=3 May 2019 |archive-date=3 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503164656/https://www.prc.cm/en/multimedia/photo-albums/37-20-may-national-day |url-status=live }}</ref> Ahidjo pursued an economic policy of [[planned liberalism]], prioritising [[cash crops]] and petroleum development. The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects; however, many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 7.</ref> The [[Flag of Cameroon|national flag]] was changed on 20 May 1975 with the two stars removed and replaced with a large central star as a symbol of national unity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2025}}

Ahidjo stepped down on 4 November 1982 and left power to his constitutional successor, [[Paul Biya]]. However, Ahidjo remained in control of the CNU and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning. Biya began his administration by moving toward a more democratic government, but a failed [[Cameroonian Palace Guard Revolt|coup d'état]] nudged him toward the leadership style of his predecessor.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 8.</ref>

In June 2006, talks concerning a territorial dispute over the [[Bakassi]] peninsula were resolved. The talks involved President Paul Biya of Cameroon, then President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] of Nigeria, and then UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], and resulted in Cameroonian control of the oil-rich peninsula. The northern portion of the territory was formally handed over to the Cameroonian government in August 2006, and the remainder of the peninsula was left to Cameroon two years later, in 2008.<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/200606130612.html Cameroon: Presidents Obasanjo And Biya Shake Hands on Disputed Bakassi Peninsula] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217063651/http://allafrica.com/stories/200606130612.html |date=17 February 2017 }}, ''Allafrica'', 13 June 2006</ref> The boundary change triggered a [[Bakassi conflict|local separatist insurgency]], as many Bakassians refused to accept Cameroonian rule.
