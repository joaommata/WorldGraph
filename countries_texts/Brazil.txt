In late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of [[continental Portugal]], causing [[John VI of Portugal|Prince Regent John]], in the name of [[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria I]], to [[Transfer of the Portuguese court to Brazil|move the royal court]] from [[Lisbon]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref name="Boxer, p.&nbsp;213">Boxer, p.&nbsp;213</ref> There they established some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local [[stock exchange]]s<ref>Marta Barcellos & Simone Azevedo; ''Histórias do Mercado de Capitais no Brasil'' ("Financial Markets' Histories in Brazil") (Portuguese) Campus Elsevier 2011 {{ISBN|85-352-3994-4}} Introduction (by Ney Carvalho), Intro. p. xiv</ref> and its [[Banco do Brasil|National Bank]], additionally ending the Portuguese monopoly on Brazilian trade and opening Brazil's ports to other nations.

With the end of the [[Peninsular War]] in 1814, the courts of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent John return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony.

The [[Republic of the Sword|early republican government]] was a military dictatorship, with the army dominating affairs both in Rio de Janeiro and in the states. Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power.{{sfnp|Smallman|2002|loc=end of Chapter 1, from p. 18 "Military rule"}} Not until 1894, following an [[Encilhamento|economic crisis]] and [[Revolta da Armada|a military one]], did civilians take power, remaining there until October 1930.{{sfnp|Smallman|2002|pp=21–26}}<ref>Triner, Gail D.

Little by little, [[Rebellions and revolutions in Brazil#1st Republican period (1889–1930)|a cycle of general instability]] sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent that in the wake of the murder of his running mate, the defeated opposition presidential candidate [[Getúlio Vargas]], supported by most of the military, successfully led the [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930|Revolution of 1930]].<ref>Levine; Robert M. & Crocitti; John J.

In the 1930s, three attempts to remove Vargas and his supporters from power failed. The first was the [[Constitutionalist Revolution]] in 1932, led by São Paulo's oligarchy. The second was a [[Brazilian uprising of 1935|Communist uprising]] in November 1935, and the last one a ''[[Integralist Uprising|putsch]]'' attempt by [[Brazilian Integralist Action|local fascists]] in May 1938.<ref>E.

The [[1937 Brazilian coup d'état|1937 ''coup d'état'']] resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election and formalized Vargas as dictator, beginning the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] era. During this period, government brutality and censorship of the press increased.<ref>Bourne, Richard ''Getulio Vargas of Brazil, 1883–1954'' C. Knight 1974, p. 77</ref>

During [[World War II]], Brazil remained neutral until August 1942, when the country suffered [[Submarine warfare#Atlantic ocean|retaliation]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Italy under fascism|Fascist Italy]] in a strategic dispute over the South Atlantic, and, therefore, [[Brazil in World War II|entered the war]] on the [[Allies of World War II|allied side]].<ref>Scheina, Robert L.

With the Allied victory in 1945 and the end of the fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas' position became untenable, and he was [[1945 Brazilian coup d'état|swiftly overthrown]] in another military coup, with democracy reinstated by the same army that had ended it 15 years earlier.<ref>McCann 2004, p. 441</ref> Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis, after having returned to power by election in 1950.<ref>Roett; Riordan ''Brazil: Politics in a Patrimonial Society'', GreenWood Publishing Group 1999, pp. 106–08 {{ISBN|0-275-95899-X}}</ref><ref>Keen & Haynes 2004, pp.&nbsp;361–62</ref>
