The [[Isthmus of Panama]] was formed about three&nbsp;million years ago when the land bridge between North and South America finally became complete, and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions. The existence of the [[isthmus]] affected the dispersal of people, agriculture and technology throughout the Americas from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities.<ref name="Mayo, J 2004">Mayo, J.

The earliest discovered artifacts of [[Indigenous peoples of Panama|indigenous peoples]] in Panama include [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]] [[projectile point]]s. Later central Panama was home to some of the first [[pottery]]-making in the Americas, for example the cultures at [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]], which date back to 2500–1700 BC. These evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials (dating to c. 500–900 AD) at the [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]] [[archaeological site]], and their [[Gran Coclé]] style [[polychrome pottery]]. The monumental [[monolith]]ic sculptures at the [[Barriles]] (Chiriqui) site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Exhibition |url=https://researchcomputing.si.edu/exhibitions/stri.php?node=Archaeology_si_2774306 |access-date=2025-05-08 |website=researchcomputing.si.edu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Treasures of Sitio Conte and Personal Adornment of the Coclé {{!}} Fashion History Timeline |url=https://fashionhistory.fitnyc.edu/sitio-conte-cocle/ |access-date=2025-05-08 |website=fashionhistory.fitnyc.edu}}</ref>

Before Europeans arrived Panama was widely settled by [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan]], [[Chocoan]], and [[Cueva people|Cueva]] peoples. The largest group were the Cueva (whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented). The size of the [[Indigenous peoples of Panama|indigenous]] population of the isthmus at the time of European colonization is uncertain. Estimates range as high as two million people, but more recent studies place that number closer to 200,000. Archaeological finds and testimonials by early European explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developed{{clarify|date=August 2016|reason=Is this an anthropological term?}} by regular regional routes of commerce. [[Austronesians]] had a trade network to Panama as there is evidence of [[coconuts]] reaching the Pacific coast of Panama from the [[Philippines]] in [[Columbian Exchange|Precolumbian]] times.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Baudouin |first1=Luc |last2=Gunn |first2=Bee |last3=Olsen |first3=Kenneth |date=January 2014 |title=The presence of coconut in southern Panama in pre-Columbian times: clearing up the confusion |journal=Annals of Botany |volume=113 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |doi=10.1093/aob/mct244 |pmid=24227445 |pmc=3864718  | issn=0305-7364 }}</ref>

When Panama was colonized, the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands. Scholars believe that [[Infection|infectious disease]] was the primary cause of the population decline of the natives. The indigenous peoples had no [[Adaptive immune system|acquired immunity]] to diseases such as [[smallpox]] which had been chronic in [[Eurasia]]n populations for centuries.<ref>Hays, J. N. (2005).

Panama was under [[Spanish Empire|Spanish rule]] for almost 300 years (1538–1821), and became part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. From the outset, Panamanian identity was based on a sense of "geographic destiny", and Panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus. The colonial experience spawned Panamanian nationalism and a racially complex and highly stratified society, the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=La inmigración prohibida en Panamá y sus prejuicios raciales|last=Arango Durling |trans-title=Prohibited immigration in Panamá and its racial prejudices |first=Virginia |publisher=Publipan |date=1999 |lccn=2001388757 |location=Panamá  |language=es }}</ref>

Spanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of Panama. Large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until late in the colonial era. Because of this, indigenous people of the area were often referred to as "indios de guerra" (war Indians). However, Panama was important to Spain strategically because it was the easiest way to ship silver mined in Peru to Europe. Silver cargoes were landed on the west coast of Panama and then taken overland to [[Portobelo, Colón|Portobello]] or [[Nombre de Dios, Colón|Nombre de Dios]] on the Caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment. Aside from the European route, there was also an Asian-American route, which led to traders and adventurers carrying silver from [[Peru]] going over land through Panama to reach Acapulco, Mexico before sailing to Manila, Philippines using the famed [[Manila galleon]]s.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/44625493/Connecting_China_with_the_Pacific_World Connecting China with the Pacific World By Angela Schottenhammer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210527045556/https://www.academia.edu/44625493/Connecting_China_with_the_Pacific_World |date=May 27, 2021 }}(2019) (Page 144–145)</ref> In 1579, the royal monopoly that Acapulco, Mexico had on trading with Manila, Philippines was relaxed and Panama was assigned as another port that was able to trade directly with Asia.<ref name="Fisher1997">{{cite book|author=John Robert Fisher|title=The Economic Aspects of Spanish Imperialism in America, 1492-1810|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MRI-LiWuJh4C&pg=PA65|date=1997|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-0-85323-552-1|pages=65–66}}</ref>

Because of incomplete Spanish control, the Panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates (mostly Dutch and English), and from "new world" Africans called [[cimarron people (Panama)|cimarrons]] who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or ''palenques'' around the Camino Real in Panama's Interior, and on some of the islands off Panama's Pacific coast. One such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under [[Bayano]], which emerged in the 1552 to 1558 period. Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s famous raids on Panama in 1572–73 and [[John Oxenham]]'s crossing to the Pacific Ocean were aided by Panama cimarrons, and Spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in 1582.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pike |first= Ruth |title=Black Rebels: Cimarrons in Sixteenth Century Panama|journal=The Americas|volume= 64|issue=2 |date=2007|pages= 243–66|doi=10.1353/tam.2007.0161|s2cid=143773521}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Panama History |url=https://www.soulofamerica.com/international/panama/panama-history/ |access-date=2025-05-08 |website=Soul Of America |language=en-US}}</ref>

The following elements helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within Panama well before the rest of the colonies: the prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries (1540–1740) while contributing to colonial growth; the placing of extensive regional judicial authority (Real Audiencia) as part of its jurisdiction; and the pivotal role it played at the height of the Spanish Empire – the first modern global empire.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Antique Map - Anonymus - Ansichten von der Landenge von Panama |url=https://www.asommer.de/en/karte/ansichten-von-der-landenge-von-panama/ |access-date=2025-05-08 |website=Antique Maps Adina Sommer |language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1671, the [[privateer]] [[Henry Morgan]], licensed by the English government, [[Henry Morgan's Panama expedition|sacked and burned]] the city of [[Panamá Viejo|Panama]] – the second most important city in the Spanish New World at the time. In 1717 the [[viceroyalty of New Granada]] (northern South America) was created in response to other Europeans trying to take Spanish territory in the Caribbean region. The Isthmus of Panama was placed under its jurisdiction. However, the remoteness of New Granada's capital, [[Santa Fe de Bogotá]] (the modern capital of [[Colombia]]) proved a greater obstacle than the Spanish crown anticipated as the authority of New Granada was contested by the seniority, closer proximity, and previous ties to the [[viceroyalty of Peru]] and even by Panama's own initiative. This uneasy relationship between Panama and Bogotá would persist for centuries.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Legendary Captain Morgan Raids Panama |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/captain-morgan-and-sack-of-panama-2136368 |access-date=2025-05-08 |website=ThoughtCo |language=en}}</ref><ref>The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica.

As the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] were heating up all across Latin America, Panama City was preparing for independence; however, their plans were accelerated by the unilateral Grito de La Villa de Los Santos (Cry From the Town of Saints), issued on November 10, 1821, by the residents of [[Azuero Peninsula|Azuero]] without backing from Panama City to declare their separation from the Spanish Empire. In both [[Veraguas]] and the capital this act was met with disdain, although on differing levels. To Veraguas, it was the ultimate act of treason, while to the capital, it was seen as inefficient and irregular, and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans.

Nevertheless, the Grito was a sign, on the part of the residents of Azuero, of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital. Those in the capital region in turn regarded the Azueran movement with contempt, since the separatists in Panama City believed that their counterparts in Azuero were fighting not only for independence from Spain, but also for their right to self-rule apart from Panama City once the Spaniards were gone.

It was seen as a risky move on the part of Azuero, which lived in fear of Colonel [[History of Panama#José de Fábrega|José Pedro Antonio de Fábrega y de las Cuevas]] (1774–1841). The colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus' military supplies in his hands. They feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists.

What they had counted on, however, was the influence of the separatists in the capital. Ever since October 1821, when the former Governor General, [[Juan de la Cruz Mourgeón|Juan de la Cruz Murgeón]], left the isthmus on a campaign in [[Quito]] and left a colonel in charge, the separatists had been slowly converting Fábrega to the separatist side. So, by November 10, Fábrega was now a supporter of the independence movement. Soon after the separatist declaration of Los Santos, Fábrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the city's support for independence. No military repercussions occurred because of skillful bribing of royalist troops.

In the 80 years following independence from Spain, Panama was a [[Subdivisions of Gran Colombia|subdivision of Gran Colombia]], after voluntarily joining the country at the end of 1821. It then became part of the [[Republic of New Granada]] in 1831 and was divided into several [[Provinces of the Republic of New Granada|provinces]]. In 1855, the autonomous [[Panama State|State of Panama]] was created within the Republic out of the New Granada provinces of Panama, Azuero, Chiriquí, and Veraguas. It continued as a state in the [[Granadine Confederation]] (1858–1863) and [[United States of Colombia]] (1863–1886). The [[Colombian Constitution of 1886|1886 constitution]] of the modern Republic of [[Colombia]] created a [[Panama Department (1886)|new Panama Department]].

The people of the isthmus made over 80 attempts to secede from Colombia. They came close to success in 1831, then again during the [[Thousand Days' War]] of 1899–1902, understood among Indigenous Panamanians as a struggle for land rights under the leadership of Victoriano Lorenzo.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Müller-Schwarze|first1=Nina K.|title=The Blood of Victoriano Lorenzo: An Ethnography of the Cholos of Northern Coclé Province.|date=2015|publisher=McFarland Press|location=Jefferson, North Carolina}}</ref>

The US intent to influence the area, especially the Panama Canal's construction and control, led to the [[secession of Panama from Colombia]] in 1903 and its political independence. When the [[Senate of Colombia]] rejected the [[Hay–Herrán Treaty]] on January 22, 1903, the United States decided to support and encourage the Panamanian secessionist movement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/node/86421 |title=Separación de Panamá: la historia desconocida |publisher=banrepcultural.org |access-date=April 9, 2016 |archive-date=January 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116174922/http://www.banrepcultural.org/node/86421 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="countrystudies">{{cite web|date = 2009|url = http://countrystudies.us/panama/8.htm|title = The 1903 Treaty and Qualified Independence|publisher = [[US Library of Congress]]|access-date = May 1, 2009|archive-date = October 11, 2011|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111011225556/http://countrystudies.us/panama/8.htm|url-status = live}}</ref>

In November 1903, Panama, tacitly supported by the United States, proclaimed its independence<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/junio2004/panama%20ultimo.htm |title=Panamá: el último año |publisher=banrepcultural.org |access-date=April 9, 2016 |archive-date=October 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009021454/http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/junio2004/panama%20ultimo.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> and concluded the [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]] with the United States without the presence of a single Panamanian. [[Philippe Bunau-Varilla]], a French engineer and lobbyist represented Panama even though Panama's president and a delegation had arrived in New York to negotiate the treaty. Bunau-Varilla was a shareholder in a French company (the ''Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama''), which had acquired the rights of the original French company which had gone bankrupt in 1889.{{sfn|McCullough|1977|pp=276-282}} The treaty was quickly drafted and signed the night before the Panamanian delegation arrived in Washington. The treaty granted rights to the United States "as if it were sovereign" in a [[Panama Canal Zone|zone]] roughly {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long.

Because of the strategic importance of the canal during [[World War II]], the US extensively fortified access to it.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Security and Defense of the Panama Canal, 1903-2000 |url=https://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00047733/00001 |access-date=2025-01-30 |website=ufdc.ufl.edu |archive-date=January 30, 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250130202844/https://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00047733/00001 |url-status=live }}</ref>

From 1903 to 1968, Panama was a [[constitutional democracy]] dominated by a commercially oriented [[oligarchy]]. During the 1950s, the Panamanian military began to challenge the oligarchy's political hegemony. The early 1960s saw also the beginning of sustained pressure in Panama for the renegotiation of the [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]], including riots that broke out in early 1964, resulting in widespread looting and dozens of deaths, and the evacuation of the American embassy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adst.org/2016/07/panama-riots-1964-beginning-end-canal/|title=The Panama Riots of 1964: The Beginning of the End for the Canal|date=July 19, 2016|access-date=November 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113025549/https://adst.org/2016/07/panama-riots-1964-beginning-end-canal/|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Amid negotiations for the Robles–Johnson treaty, Panama held [[1968 Panamanian general election|elections in 1968]]. The candidates were:<ref name="Pizzurno Gelós 1989">Pizzurno Gelós, Patricia and Celestino Andrés Araúz (1996) ''Estudios sobre el Panamá Republicano (1903–1989)''. Colombia: Manfer S.A.</ref>
* Dr. [[Arnulfo Arias]] Madrid, Unión Nacional (National Union)
* Antonio González Revilla, [[People's Party (Panama)|Democracia Cristiana]] (Christian Democrats)
* Engr. David Samudio, Alianza del Pueblo (People's Alliance), who had the government's support.

Arias Madrid was declared the winner of elections that were marked by violence and accusations of fraud against Alianza del Pueblo. On October 1, 1968, Arias Madrid took office as president of Panama, promising to lead a government of "national union" that would end the reigning corruption and pave the way for a new Panama. A week and a half later, on October 11, 1968, the National Guard (Guardia Nacional) [[1968 Panamanian coup d'état|ousted]] Arias and initiated the downward spiral that would culminate with the United States' invasion in 1989. Arias, who had promised to respect the hierarchy of the National Guard, broke the pact and started a large restructuring of the Guard. To preserve the Guard's and his vested interests, Lieutenant Colonel [[Omar Torrijos]] Herrera and Major Boris Martínez commanded another military coup against the government.<ref name="Pizzurno Gelós 1989"/>

The military justified itself by declaring that Arias Madrid was trying to install a dictatorship, and promised a return to constitutional rule. In the meantime, the Guard began a series of populist measures that would gain support for the coup. Among them were:
* Price freezing on food, medicine and other goods<ref>Pizzurno Gelós, Patricia and Celestino Andrés Araúz (1996) ''Estudios sobre el Panamá Republicano (1903–1989)''. Colombia: Manfer S.A., p. 529.</ref> until January 31, 1969
* rent level freeze
* legalization of the permanence of squatting families in boroughs surrounding the historic site of Panama Viejo<ref name="Pizzurno Gelós 1989"/>
Parallel to this, the military began a policy of repression against the opposition, who were labeled communists. The military appointed a Provisional Government Junta that was to arrange new elections. However, the National Guard would prove to be very reluctant to abandon power and soon began calling itself ''El Gobierno Revolucionario'' (The Revolutionary Government).

====Post-1970====
[[File:Omar Torrijos with Panamanian farmers.jpg|thumb|[[Omar Torrijos]] (right) with farmers in the Panamanian countryside. The Torrijos government was well known for its policies of [[land redistribution]].]]

Under [[Omar Torrijos]]'s control, the military transformed the political and economic structure of the country, initiating massive coverage of social security services and expanding public education.

The constitution was changed in 1972. To reform the constitution, the military created a new organization, the Assembly of Corregimiento Representatives, which replaced the National Assembly. The new assembly, also known as the Poder Popular (Power of the People), was composed of 505 members selected by the military with no participation from political parties, which the military had eliminated. The new constitution proclaimed [[Omar Torrijos]] as the Maximum Leader of the Panamanian Revolution, and conceded him unlimited power for six years, although, to keep a façade of constitutionality, [[Demetrio B. Lakas]] was appointed president for the same period.<ref name="Pizzurno Gelós 1989"/>

In 1981, Torrijos died in a plane crash.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/02/obituaries/panama-leader-killed-in-crash-in-bad-weather.html|title=PANAMA LEADER KILLED IN CRASH IN BAD WEATHER|last=International|first=United Press|work=The New York Times|date=August 2, 1981|access-date=June 1, 2018|language=en|archive-date=August 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817120658/https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/02/obituaries/panama-leader-killed-in-crash-in-bad-weather.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Torrijos' death altered the tone of Panama's political evolution. Despite the [[1983 Panamanian constitutional referendum|1983 constitutional amendments]] which proscribed a political role for the military, the [[Panama Defense Forces|Panama Defense Force]] (PDF), as they were then known, continued to dominate Panamanian political life. By this time, General [[Manuel Noriega|Manuel Antonio Noriega]] was firmly in control of both the PDF and the civilian government.{{when|date=May 2016}}

[[File:Jimmy Carter and General Omar Torrijos signing the Panama Canal Treaty.jpg|thumb|US President [[Jimmy Carter]] shakes hands with General [[Omar Torrijos]] after signing the [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties|Panama Canal Treaties]] (September 7, 1977).]]
In the [[1984 Panamanian general election|1984 elections]], the candidates were:
* [[Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino]], supported by the military in a union called UNADE
* Arnulfo Arias Madrid, for the opposition union ADO
* ex-General [[Rubén Darío Paredes]], who had been forced to an early retirement by Manuel Noriega, running for the Partido Nacionalista Popular (PAP; "Popular Nationalist Party")
* Carlos Iván Zúñiga, running for the Partido Acción Popular (PAPO; Popular Action Party)
Barletta was declared the winner of elections that had been considered to be fraudulent. Barletta inherited a country in economic ruin and hugely indebted to the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]]. Amid the economic crisis and Barletta's efforts to calm the country's creditors, street protests arose, and so did military repression.

Meanwhile, Noriega's regime had fostered a well-hidden criminal economy that operated as a parallel source of income for the military and their allies, providing revenues from drugs and [[money laundering]]. Toward the end of the military dictatorship, a new wave of Chinese migrants arrived on the isthmus in the hope of migrating to the United States. The smuggling of Chinese became an enormous business, with revenues of up to 200 million dollars for Noriega's regime (see Mon 167).<ref>Mon Pinzón, Ramón Arturo (1979). ''Historia de la Migración China Durante la Construcción del Ferrocarril de Panamá''. Masters Thesis. México: El Colegio de México.</ref>

The military dictatorship assassinated or tortured more than one hundred Panamanians and forced at least a hundred more dissidents into exile. (see Zárate 15).<ref>Zárate, Abdiel (November 9, 2003). "Muertos y desaparecidos durante la época militar." Extra-centennial issue of ''La Prensa''.</ref> Noriega's regime was supported by the United States and it began playing a double role in Central America. While the [[Contadora group]], an initiative launched by the foreign ministers of various Latin American nations including Panama's, conducted diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region, Noriega supplied Nicaraguan [[Contras]] and other guerrillas in the region with weapons and ammunition on behalf of the CIA.<ref name="Pizzurno Gelós 1989"/>

On June 6, 1987, the recently retired Colonel Roberto Díaz Herrera, resentful that Noriega had broken the agreed-upon "Torrijos Plan" of succession that would have made him the chief of the military after Noriega, decided to denounce the regime. He revealed details of electoral fraud,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Preston |first=Julia |date=July 6, 1987 |title=PANAMANIAN PRESIDENT CALLS FOR PROBE |language=en-US |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1987/07/06/panamanian-president-calls-for-probe/34559ca5-6139-4669-8ff5-dcd056b9b7ca/ |access-date=March 22, 2022 |issn=0190-8286}}</ref> accused Noriega of planning Torrijos's death and declared that Torrijos had received 12 million dollars from the Shah of Iran for giving the exiled Iranian leader asylum.

On the night of June 9, 1987, the Cruzada Civilista ("Civic Crusade") was created{{where|date=May 2016}} and began organizing actions of civil disobedience. The Crusade called for a general strike. In response, the military suspended constitutional rights and declared a state of emergency in the country. On July 10, the [[Civic Crusade]] called for a massive demonstration that was violently repressed by the "Dobermans", the military's special riot control unit. That day, later known as El Viernes Negro ("Black Friday"), left many people injured and killed.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Becker |first=Meghan |date=March 28, 2010 |title=Panamanians campaign to overthrow dictator (The Civic Crusade), 1987-1989 |url=https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/panamanians-campaign-overthrow-dictator-civic-crusade-1987-1989 |access-date=April 30, 2022 |website=Swarthmore.edu |publisher=Swarthmore |archive-date=May 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210513215929/https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/panamanians-campaign-overthrow-dictator-civic-crusade-1987-1989 |url-status=live }}</ref>

United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] began a series of sanctions against the military regime. The United States froze economic and military assistance to Panama in the middle of 1987 in response to the domestic political crisis in Panama and an attack on the US embassy. The sanctions failed to oust Noriega, but severely hurt Panama's economy. Panama's gross domestic product (GDP) declined almost 25 percent between 1987 and 1989.<ref name="Acosta, Coleen 2008">Acosta, Coleen (October 24, 2008).

On February 5, 1988, General Manuel Antonio Noriega was accused of drug trafficking by federal juries in Tampa and Miami. [[Human Rights Watch]] wrote in its 1989 report: "Washington turned a blind eye to abuses in Panama for many years until concern over drug trafficking prompted indictments of the general [Noriega] by two grand juries in Florida in February 1988".<ref name="Panama">[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1989/WR89/Panama.htm "Panama"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113164637/https://www.hrw.org/reports/1989/WR89/Panama.htm |date=January 13, 2017 }}. ''Human Rights Watch World Report 1989''. hrw.org</ref>

In April 1988, US President Ronald Reagan invoked the [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]], freezing Panamanian government assets in all US organizations. In May 1989 Panamanians voted overwhelmingly for the anti-Noriega candidates. The Noriega regime promptly annulled the election and embarked on a new round of repression.

The United States invaded Panama on December 20, 1989, codenamed [[Operation Just Cause]]. The U.S. stated the operation was "necessary to safeguard the lives of U.S. citizens in Panama, defend democracy and human rights, combat drug trafficking, and secure the neutrality of the Panama Canal as required by the [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties]]".<ref>''New York Times''.

On December 29, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] approved a resolution calling the intervention in Panama a "flagrant violation of international law and of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the States".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/44/a44r240.htm|title=A/RES/44/240.

The conflict ended on January 31, 1990.

The urban population, many living below the poverty level, was greatly affected by the 1989 intervention. As pointed out in 1995 by a UN Technical Assistance Mission to Panama, the fighting displaced 20,000 people. The most heavily affected district was the [[El Chorrillo]] area of Panama City, where several blocks of apartments were completely destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roatan.com/About-Locations/Panama.pdf|title=Panama |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304103819/http://www.roatan.com/About-Locations/Panama.pdf|archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-panama-deception/|title=The Panama Deception|via=topdocumentaryfilms.com|access-date=May 5, 2019|archive-date=May 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190505070320/https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-panama-deception/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Blum, William.

===Post-intervention era===
Panama's Electoral Tribunal moved quickly to restore civilian constitutional government, reinstated the results of the May 1989 election on December 27, 1989, and confirmed the victory of President [[Guillermo Endara]] and Vice Presidents [[Guillermo Ford]] and [[Ricardo Arias Calderón]].

During its five-year term, the often-fractious government struggled to meet the public's high expectations. Its new police force was a major improvement over its predecessor but was not fully able to deter crime. [[Ernesto Pérez Balladares]] was sworn in as president on September 1, 1994, after an internationally monitored election campaign.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=Panama (02/07) |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/panama/80437.htm |access-date=2023-11-15 |website=U.S. Department of State |archive-date=November 15, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231115023048/https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/panama/80437.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

He formed a National Anti-Corruption Council whose members represented the highest levels of government and civil society, labor organizations, and religious leadership.
