The coastal plain of Libya was inhabited by [[Neolithic]] peoples from as early as 8000 BC. The [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] ancestors of the [[Berber people]] are assumed to have spread into the area by the [[Late Bronze Age]]. The earliest known name of such a tribe was the [[Garamantes]], based in [[Germa]]. The [[Phoenicia]]ns were the first to establish trading posts in Libya.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/herod-libya1.html |title=The Histories', Book IV.42–43 |publisher=Fordham University |date=August 1998 |author=Halsall, Paul |access-date=5 February 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409023843/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/herod-libya1.html |archive-date=9 April 2013  }}</ref> By the 5th century BC, the greatest of the Phoenician colonies, [[Carthage]], had extended its [[hegemony]] across much of North Africa, where a distinctive civilisation, known as [[Punic]], came into being.

In 630 BC, the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] colonised the area around [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]] in Eastern Libya and founded the city of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ly0015) |title=Cyrenaica and the Greeks |publisher=Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress |access-date=5 February 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120922002705/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ly0015) |archive-date=22 September 2012  }}</ref> Within 200 years, four more important Greek cities were established in the area that became known as [[Cyrenaica]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsAfrica/AfricaLibya.htm |title=History of Libya |publisher=The History Files |date=20 October 2011 |access-date=5 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128173621/http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsAfrica/AfricaLibya.htm |archive-date=28 January 2013 }}</ref> The area was home to the renowned philosophy school of the [[Cyrenaics]]. In 525 BC the [[Persian people|Persian]] army of [[Cambyses II]] overran Cyrenaica, which for the next two centuries remained under Persian or Egyptian rule. [[Alexander the Great]] ended Persian rule in 331 BC and received tribute from Cyrenaica. Eastern Libya again fell under the control of the Greeks, this time as part of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]].

After the fall of [[Carthage]] the Romans did not immediately occupy [[Tripolitania]] (the region around Tripoli), but left it instead under control of the kings of [[Numidia]], until the coastal cities asked and obtained its protection.<ref name="be202">[[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 202.</ref> [[Ptolemy Apion]], the last Greek ruler, bequeathed Cyrenaica to Rome, which formally annexed the region in 74 BC and joined it to Crete as [[Creta et Cyrenaica|a Roman province]]. As part of the [[Africa Nova]] province, Tripolitania was prosperous,<ref name="be202" /> and reached a golden age in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, when the city of [[Leptis Magna]], home to the [[Severan dynasty]], was at its height.<ref name="be202" />

On the eastern side, Cyrenaica's first Christian communities were established by the time of the Emperor [[Claudius]].<ref name="be417">[[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 417.</ref> It was heavily devastated during the [[Kitos War]]<ref name="ro364">{{cite book |ref=Rostovtzeff|last=Rostovtzeff|first=Michael|title=Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire|location=Oxford|year=1957|edition=2|publisher=Clarendon|page=364}}</ref> and almost depopulated of Greeks and Jews alike.<ref>[[Cassius Dio]], lxviii. 32</ref> Although repopulated by [[Trajan]] with military colonies,<ref name="ro364" /> from then started its decline.<ref name="be417" /> Libya was early to convert to [[Nicene Christianity]] and was the home of [[Pope Victor I]]; however, Libya was also home to many non-Nicene varieties of early Christianity, such as [[Arianism]] and [[Donatism]].

=== Islamic Libya: 647–1556 ===

[[File:Awjila (Libia) - The Mosque of Atiq.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Atiq Mosque, Awjila|Atiq Mosque]] in [[Awjila]] is the oldest mosque in the [[Sahara]].]]
Under the command of [[Amr ibn al-As]], the [[Rashidun army]] conquered [[Cyrenaica]].<ref name="be278">[[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 278.</ref> In 647 an army led by [[Abdullah ibn Saad]] took Tripoli from the Byzantines definitively.<ref name="be278" /> The [[Fezzan]] was conquered by [[Uqba ibn Nafi]] in 663. The Berber tribes of the hinterland accepted Islam, however they resisted Arab political rule.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Hourani, Albert|year=2002|title=A History of the Arab Peoples|publisher=Faber & Faber|isbn=978-0-571-21591-1|page=198}}</ref> For the next several decades, Libya was under the purview of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Caliph of Damascus]] until the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] overthrew the Umayyads in 750, and Libya came under the rule of Baghdad. When Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] appointed [[Ibrahim I ibn al-Aghlab|Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab]] as his governor of [[Ifriqiya]] in 800, Libya enjoyed considerable local autonomy under the [[Aghlabid]] dynasty. By the 10th century, the Shiite [[Fatimids]] controlled Western Libya, and ruled the entire region in 972 and appointed [[Bologhine ibn Ziri]] as governor.<ref name="be202" />

Ibn Ziri's Berber [[Zirid dynasty]] ultimately broke away from the Shiite Fatimids, and recognised the Sunni Abbasids of Baghdad as rightful Caliphs. In retaliation, the Fatimids brought about the migration of thousands from mainly two Arab Qaisi tribes, the [[Banu Sulaym]] and [[Banu Hilal]] to [[North Africa]]. This act drastically altered the fabric of the Libyan countryside, and cemented the cultural and linguistic Arabisation of the region.<ref name="be202" />

Zirid rule in Tripolitania was short-lived though, and already in 1001 the Berbers of the [[Banu Khazrun]] broke away. Tripolitania remained under their control until 1146, when the region was overtaken by the [[Normans of Sicily]].<ref name="be203">[[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 203.</ref> For the next 50 years, Tripolitania was the scene of numerous battles among [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]], the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] rulers and insurgents of the [[Banu Ghaniya]]. Later, a general of the Almohads, Muhammad ibn Abu Hafs, ruled Libya from 1207 to 1221 before the later establishment of the Tunisian [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsid Kingdom]]<ref name="be203" /> independent from the Almohads. In the 14th century, the [[Banu Thabit]] dynasty ruled Tripolitania before reverting to direct Hafsid control. By the 16th century, the Hafsids became increasingly caught up in the power struggle between Spain and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

After Abbasid control was weakened, Cyrenaica was under Egypt-based states such as the [[Tulunids]], [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshidids]], Ayyubids, and [[Mamluk Sultanate|Mamluks]] before Ottoman conquest in 1517. [[Fezzan]] acquired independence under Awlad Muhammad dynasty after [[Kanem–Bornu Empire|Kanem]] rule. Ottomans finally conquered Fezzan between 1556 and 1577.

=== Ottoman Tripolitania: 1556–1911 ===
{{Main|Ottoman Tripolitania}}
[[File:Capture of Tripoli by the Ottomans 1551.jpg|thumb|The [[Siege of Tripoli (1551)|siege of Tripoli]] in 1551 allowed the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottomans]] to capture the city from the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John]].]]

After a successful invasion of Tripoli by [[Habsburg Spain]] in 1510,<ref name="be203" /> and its handover to the [[Knights Hospitaller]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] admiral [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] took control of Libya in 1551.<ref name="be203" /> His successor [[Turgut Reis]] was named the [[Bey]] of Tripoli and later [[Pasha of Tripoli]] in 1556. By 1565, administrative authority as regent in Tripoli was vested in a ''[[pasha]]'' appointed directly by the ''[[sultan]]'' in [[Constantinople]]/[[Istanbul]]. In the 1580s, the rulers of [[Fezzan]] gave their allegiance to the sultan, and although Ottoman authority was absent in [[Cyrenaica]], a ''bey'' was stationed in Benghazi late in the next century to act as agent of the government in Tripoli.<ref name="be417" /> European [[Barbary slave trade|slaves]] and large numbers of enslaved Blacks transported from Sudan were also a feature of everyday life in Tripoli. In 1551, [[Turgut Reis]] enslaved almost the entire population of the Maltese island of [[Gozo]], some 5,000 people, sending them to Libya.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hoppen |first1=Alison |title=The fortification of Malta by the Order of St. John, 1530–1798 |date=1979 |publisher=Scottish Academic Press |page=25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Robert C.

In time, real power came to rest with the pasha's corps of [[janissaries]].<ref name="be203" /> In 1611 the ''[[dey]]s'' staged a coup against the pasha, and Dey Sulayman Safar was appointed as head of government. For the next hundred years, a series of ''deys'' effectively ruled Tripolitania. The two most important Deys were [[Mehmed Saqizli]] (r. 1631–49) and [[Osman Saqizli]] (r. 1649–72), both also Pasha, who ruled effectively the region.<ref name="be204">[[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 204.</ref> The latter conquered also Cyrenaica.<ref name="be204" />

Lacking direction from the Ottoman government, Tripoli lapsed into a period of military anarchy during which coup followed coup and few deys survived in office more than a year. One such coup was led by Turkish officer [[Ahmed Karamanli]].<ref name="be204" /> The [[Karamanli dynasty|Karamanlis]] ruled from 1711 until 1835 mainly in Tripolitania, and had influence in Cyrenaica and Fezzan as well by the mid-18th century. Ahmed's successors proved to be less capable than himself, however, the region's delicate balance of power allowed the Karamanli. The [[1793–95 Tripolitanian civil war]] occurred in those years. In 1793, Turkish officer [[Trabluslu Ali Pasha|Ali Pasha]] deposed Hamet Karamanli and briefly restored Tripolitania to Ottoman rule. Hamet's brother [[Yusuf Karamanli|Yusuf]] (r. 1795–1832) re-established Tripolitania's independence. In 1816, Yusuf ordered the [[Al-Jawazi massacre|massacre of the al-Jawazi tribe]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=5 October 2016 |title=Libyan tribe demands to prosecute Turkey for the massacres committed against its people, similar to that of the Armenians |url=https://horizonweekly.ca/en/93451-2/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221233911/https://horizonweekly.ca/en/93451-2/ |archive-date=2019-12-21 |website=Horizon}}</ref> 
[[File:Decatur Boarding the Tripolitan Gunboat.jpg|thumb|U.S. naval officer [[Stephen Decatur]] boarding a Tripolitan gunboat during the [[First Barbary War]], 1804]]
In the early 19th century war broke out between the United States and Tripolitania, and a series of battles ensued in what came to be known as the [[First Barbary War]] and the [[Second Barbary War]]. By 1819, the various treaties of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] had forced the Barbary states to give up piracy almost entirely, and Tripolitania's economy began to crumble. As Yusuf weakened, factions sprung up around his three sons. Civil war soon resulted.<ref name="be205">[[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 205.</ref>

Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]] sent in troops ostensibly to restore order, marking the end of both the Karamanli dynasty and an independent Tripolitania.<ref name="be205"/> Order was not recovered easily, and the revolt of the Libyan under Abd-El-Gelil and Gûma ben Khalifa lasted until the death of the latter in 1858.<ref name="be205" /> The second period of direct Ottoman rule saw administrative changes, and greater order in the governance of the three provinces of Libya. Ottoman rule finally reasserted to Fezzan between 1850 and 1875 for earning income from Saharan commerce.

From 1927 to 1934, the territory was split into two colonies, [[Italian Cyrenaica]] and [[Italian Tripolitania]], run by Italian governors. Some 150,000 Italians settled in Libya, constituting roughly 20% of the total population.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-46562/Libya |title=Libya |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=5 February 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430102144/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/339574/Libya |archive-date=30 April 2013  }}</ref>

[[Omar Mukhtar]] rose to prominence as a [[Libyan resistance movement|resistance leader]] against Italian colonisation and became a national hero despite his capture and execution on 16 September 1931.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13755445 Libya profile – Timeline] , ''[[BBC News]]'' Africa, 1 November 2011</ref> His face is currently printed on the Libyan ten dinar note in memory and recognition of his patriotism. Another prominent resistance leader, Idris al-Mahdi as-Senussi (later [[Idris of Libya|King Idris I]]), Emir of Cyrenaica, continued to lead the Libyan resistance until the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]].

The so-called "[[pacification of Libya]]" by the Italians resulted in mass deaths of the indigenous people in Cyrenaica, killing approximately one quarter of Cyrenaica's population of 225,000.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGHGPgj1_tIC&pg=PA309|title=The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing|last=Mann|first=Michael|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521538541|page=309|access-date=1 July 2019|archive-date=16 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416132840/https://books.google.com/books?id=cGHGPgj1_tIC&pg=PA309|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Ilan Pappé]] estimates that between 1928 and 1932 the Italian military "killed half the Bedouin population (directly or through disease and starvation in [[Italian concentration camps in Libya]])."<ref>[[Ilan Pappé]], ''The Modern Middle East''.

In 1934, Italy combined [[Cyrenaica]], [[Tripolitania]] and [[Fezzan]] and adopted the name "Libya" (used by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] for all of [[North Africa]] except [[Egypt]]) for the unified colony, with [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]] as its [[Capital city|capital]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nanjira |first1=Daniel Don |title=African Foreign Policy and Diplomacy from Antiquity to the 21st Century |date=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-37982-6 |page=207 |language=en}}</ref> The Italians emphasised infrastructure improvements and public works. In particular, they greatly expanded Libyan railway and road networks from 1934 to 1940, building hundreds of kilometres of new roads and railways and encouraging the establishment of new industries and dozens of new agricultural villages.

In June 1940, [[Military history of Italy during World War II|Italy entered World War II]]. Libya became the setting for the hard-fought [[North African Campaign]] that ultimately ended in defeat for Italy and its [[Afrika Korps|German ally]] in 1943. From 1943 to 1951, Libya was under [[Allied occupation of Libya|Allied occupation]]. The British military [[British Military Administration (Libya)|administered]] the two former Italian Libyan provinces of Tripolitana and Cyrenaïca, while the French [[French Fezzan|administered]] the province of Fezzan. In 1944, Idris returned from exile in [[Cairo]] but declined to resume permanent residence in Cyrenaica until the removal of some aspects of foreign control in 1947. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|1947 peace treaty]] with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], Italy relinquished all claims to Libya.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tecola W.
