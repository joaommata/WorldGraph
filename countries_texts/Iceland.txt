===Iceland as a possession===
====Middle Ages====
{{see also|Age of the Sturlungs}}
The [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], established in the 10th century, faced internal strife during the [[Age of the Sturlungs]] (c. 1220–1264). This period was marked by violent conflicts among chieftains, notably the Sturlung family, leading to the weakening of the Commonwealth's political structure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dannyreviews.com/h/Iceland.html |title=The History of Iceland (Gunnar Karlsson)&nbsp;– book review |publisher=Dannyreviews.com |access-date=10 February 2010 |archive-date=28 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728002528/http://dannyreviews.com/h/Iceland.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The culmination of the struggles resulted in the signing of the Old Covenant ([[Old Covenant (Iceland)|Gamli sáttmáli]]) in 1262–1264, bringing [[History of Iceland|Iceland under Norwegian rule]].<ref>Coroban, Costel (2018).

However, extensive deforestation occurred as forests were cleared for timber, firewood, and to create grazing land for livestock. This led to significant soil erosion and a decline in arable land, exacerbating the difficulties of sustaining agriculture in Iceland's harsh climate.<ref>{{Cite web |last=developer |first=M.

In 1380, [[Olaf II of Denmark]] became King of Norway on his father's death. Denmark and Norway were thus united in personal union and ruled from Denmark; this was further solidified with the formation of the [[Kalmar Union]] in 1397. Through it Iceland, as a Norwegian possession, came to be ruled by Denmark.

====Reformation and the Early Modern period====

Around the middle of the 16th century, as part of the [[Protestant Reformation]], King [[Christian III of Denmark]] began to impose [[Lutheranism]] on all his subjects. [[Jón Arason]], the last Icelandic Catholic bishop, and two of his sons were beheaded in 1550. Iceland then became officially Lutheran, and Lutheranism has since remained the dominant religion.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, Denmark imposed [[Danish–Icelandic Trade Monopoly|harsh trade restrictions]] on Iceland. Natural disasters, including volcanic eruptions and disease, contributed to a decreasing population. In the summer of 1627, [[Barbary Pirates]] committed the events known locally as the [[Turkish Abductions]], in which hundreds of residents were taken into slavery in North Africa and dozens killed; this was the only invasion in Icelandic history to have casualties.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Þorsteinn |first1=Helgason |title=Hvaða heimildir eru til um Tyrkjaránið? |trans-title=What are the sources of the Turkish Abductions? |url=https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=5738 |access-date=9 March 2021 |publisher=University of Iceland |date=28 March 2006 |language=Icelandic |archive-date=17 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417185140/https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=5738 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Davis |first=Robert C. |title=Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy, 1500–1800 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5q9zcB3JS40C&pg=PA7 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2003 |pages=7ff |isbn=978-0-333-71966-4 |access-date=27 June 2015 |archive-date=10 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240610032722/https://books.google.com/books?id=5q9zcB3JS40C&pg=PA7 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[1707–08 Iceland smallpox epidemic]] is estimated to have killed a quarter to a third of the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iceland.vefur.is/iceland_history/history.htm |title=Iceland: Milestones in Icelandic History |publisher=Iceland.vefur.is |access-date=10 February 2010 |archive-date=29 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929074613/http://iceland.vefur.is/iceland_history/history.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Crosby |first=Alfred W. |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Phtqa_3tNykC&pg=PA52 |title=Ecological imperialism: the biological expansion of Europe, 900–1900 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=52 |isbn=0-521-54618-4 |access-date=27 June 2015 |archive-date=10 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240610032722/https://books.google.com/books?id=Phtqa_3tNykC&pg=PA52#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1783 the [[Laki]] volcano erupted, with devastating effects.<ref>"{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6276291.stm |title=When a killer cloud hit Britain |work=BBC News |date=January 2007 |access-date=18 April 2010 |archive-date=7 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107034754/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6276291.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> In the years following the eruption, known as the [[Mist Hardships]] ({{langx|is|Móðuharðindin}}), over half of all livestock in the country died.

====1814–1918: independence movement====
{{see also|Icelandic independence movement|Fjölnir (journal)}}
After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1814, Denmark-Norway broke up into two separate kingdoms via the [[Treaty of Kiel]], but Iceland remained a Danish dependency. Throughout the 19th century, the country's climate continued to grow colder, resulting in mass emigration to the [[New World]], particularly to the region of [[Gimli, Manitoba]] in Canada, which was sometimes referred to as [[New Iceland]]. About 15,000 people emigrated out of a total population of 70,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/05/business/iceland.php |title=For Iceland, an exodus of workers |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 December 2008 |access-date=10 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211074725/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/05/business/iceland.php |archive-date=11 December 2008}}</ref>

A national consciousness arose in the first half of the 19th century, inspired by [[Romanticism|romantic]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] ideas from mainland Europe. An Icelandic independence movement took shape in the 1850s under the leadership of [[Jón Sigurðsson]], based on the burgeoning Icelandic nationalism inspired by the ''[[Fjölnismenn]]'' and other Danish-educated Icelandic intellectuals. In 1874, poet and clergyman [[Matthías Jochumsson]] wrote the lyrics of "[[Lofsöngur]]," which became the Icelandic [[national anthem]]. Composer [[Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson]] wrote the music.

In 1874, Denmark granted Iceland a constitution and limited home rule. That was expanded in 1904, and [[Hannes Hafstein]] served as the first [[Minister for Iceland]] in the Danish cabinet.

===1918–1944: independence and the Kingdom of Iceland===
{{see also|Kingdom of Iceland|Invasion of Iceland|Iceland in World War II}}
[[File:HMS Berwick (65).jpg|left|thumb|{{HMS|Berwick|65|6}} led the British [[invasion of Iceland]].]]

The [[Danish–Icelandic Act of Union]], an agreement with Denmark signed on 1 December 1918 and valid for 25&nbsp;years, recognized Iceland as a fully sovereign and independent state in a [[personal union]] with Denmark. The Government of Iceland established an embassy in Copenhagen and requested that Denmark carry out on its behalf certain defence and foreign affairs matters, subject to consultation with the Althing. Danish embassies around the world displayed two coats of arms and two flags: those of the Kingdom of Denmark and those of the [[Kingdom of Iceland]]. Iceland's legal position became comparable to those of countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Nations, such as Canada, whose sovereign is King [[Charles III]].

During World War II, Iceland joined Denmark in asserting neutrality. After the [[German occupation of Denmark]] on 9 April 1940, the Althing replaced the King with a regent and declared that the Icelandic government would take control of its own defence and foreign affairs.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=https://www.icelandicroots.com/post/2014/11/11/the-occupation-of-iceland-during-world-war-ii |title=Icelandic Roots {{!}} Post |website=Icelandic Roots {{!}} Genealogy Ancestry |date=11 November 2014 |access-date=5 April 2019 |archive-date=18 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220318033638/https://www.icelandicroots.com/post/2014/11/11/the-occupation-of-iceland-during-world-war-ii |url-status=live }}</ref> A month later, British armed forces conducted [[Operation Fork]], the invasion and occupation of the country, violating Icelandic [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2015/05/12/history_british_forces_occupy_iceland/ |title=History: British forces occupy Iceland |website=Iceland Monitor |access-date=5 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191203172541/https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2015/05/12/history_british_forces_occupy_iceland/ |archive-date=3 December 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1941, the Government of Iceland, friendly to Britain, invited the then-neutral United States to take over its defence so that Britain could use its troops elsewhere.<ref name=":0" />

On 31 December 1943, the [[Danish–Icelandic Act of Union]] expired after 25 years. Beginning on 20 May 1944, Icelanders voted in a four-day plebiscite on whether to terminate the personal union with Denmark, abolish the monarchy, and establish a republic. The vote was 97% to end the union, and 95% in favor of the new republican constitution.<ref>{{cite video |title=Allies Study Post-War Security Etc. |year=1944 |url=https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.39024 |publisher=[[Universal Newsreel]] |access-date=21 February 2012}}</ref> Iceland formally became a republic on 17 June 1944, with [[Sveinn Björnsson]] as its first president.

In 1946, the U.S. Defense Force left Iceland. The nation formally became a member of [[NATO]] on 30 March 1949, amid [[1949 anti-NATO riot in Iceland|domestic controversy and riots]]. On 5 May 1951, a defense agreement was signed with the United States. American troops returned to Iceland as the [[Iceland Defence Force]] and remained throughout the [[Cold War]]. The U.S. withdrew the last of its forces on 30 September 2006.

Iceland prospered during the Second World War. The immediate post-war period was followed by substantial [[economic growth]], driven by the industrialization of the fishing industry and the U.S. [[Marshall Plan]] program, through which Icelanders received the most aid per capita of any European country (at US$209, with war-ravaged [[Netherlands]] a distant second at US$109).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://visindavefur.hi.is/svar.asp?id=3411 |title=Hversu há var Marshallaðstoðin sem Ísland fékk eftir seinni heimsstyrjöld? |language=is |date=13 May 2003 |work=Vísindavefurinn |access-date=27 October 2014 |archive-date=25 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525113749/http://visindavefur.hi.is/svar.asp?id=3411 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Müller |first1=Margrit |last2=Myllyntaus |first2=Timo |title=Pathbreakers: Small European Countries Responding to Globalisation and Deglobalisation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zdXTV8xO3xQC&pg=PA385 |publisher=Peter Lang |year=2007 |pages=385– |isbn=978-3-03911-214-2 |access-date=27 June 2015 |archive-date=10 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240610032723/https://books.google.com/books?id=zdXTV8xO3xQC&pg=PA385#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Vigdís Finnbogadóttir]] assumed Iceland's presidency on 1 August 1980, making her the first elected female head of state in the world.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vigdis Finnbogadottir, the world's first elected female president |url=https://www.france24.com/en/20200731-vigdis-finnbogadottir-the-world-s-first-elected-female-president |work=France 24 |date=31 July 2020 |language=en |access-date=14 December 2021 |archive-date=8 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220408182639/https://www.france24.com/en/20200731-vigdis-finnbogadottir-the-world-s-first-elected-female-president |url-status=live }}</ref>

The 1970s were marked by the [[Cod Wars]], which were several disputes with the United Kingdom over Iceland's extension of its fishing limits to {{convert|200|nmi|km|abbr=on}} offshore. Iceland hosted a [[Reykjavík Summit|summit in Reykjavík in 1986]] between United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] and Soviet Premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], during which they took significant steps towards [[nuclear disarmament]]. A few years later, Iceland became the first country to recognize the independence of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] as they [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|broke away]] from the [[USSR]]. Throughout the 1990s, the country expanded its international role and developed a foreign policy oriented towards humanitarian and peacekeeping causes.
