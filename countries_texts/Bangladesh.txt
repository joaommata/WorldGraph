{{Main|History of Bangladesh}}

=== Early history ===
The first great indigenous empire to cover the territory was the [[Maurya Empire]] ({{Circa}} 320–185 BC). Following its decline, the kingdom of [[Samatata]] arose, which was a tributary state of the [[Gupta Empire]] (ca. 319-ca. 540 AD). [[Harsha]] (606–47 AD) drew Samatata into its loosely administered political structure. The Buddhist [[Pala Empire]] ruled the region from 750 to 1150 AD. It was overthrown by the Hindu [[Sena dynasty]], which ruled the territory until the [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim conquests]] led by [[Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji]] of the [[Ghurid dynasty]] in 1204.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=EARLY HISTORY, 1000 B.C.-A.D. 1202|chapter-url=https://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/4.htm|editor1-last=Heitzman|editor1-first=James|editor2-last=Worden|editor2-first=Robert|title=Bangladesh: A Country Study|url=http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/|publisher=[[Federal Research Division]], [[Library of Congress]]|access-date=13 January 2025}}</ref>
