{{Main|History of Turkmenistan}}
Historically inhabited by [[Indo-Iranians]], Turkmenistan's written history begins with its annexation by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of ancient Iran. After centuries of turmoil, over a thousand years later, in the 8th century AD, [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] tribes moved from [[Mongolia]] into present-day Central Asia. Part of a powerful confederation of tribes, these Oghuz formed the ethnic basis of the modern Turkmen population.<ref name="cs">{{Cite web |date=February 2007 |title=Country Profile: Turkmenistan |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Turkmenistan.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050226190629/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Turkmenistan.pdf |archive-date=26 February 2005 |access-date=25 November 2013 |publisher=Library of Congress Federal Research Division}}</ref> In the 10th century, the name "Turkmen" was first applied to Oghuz groups that accepted [[Islam]] and began to occupy present-day Turkmenistan.<ref name="cs" /> There they were under the dominion of the [[Seljuk Empire]], which was composed of Oghuz groups living in present-day [[Iran]] and Turkmenistan.<ref name="cs" /> Oghuz groups in the service of the empire played an important role in the spreading of Turkic culture when they migrated westward into present-day [[Azerbaijan]] and eastern [[Turkey]].<ref name="cs" />

In the 12th century, [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] and other tribes overthrew the Seljuk Empire.<ref name="cs" /> In the next century, the [[Mongols]] took over the more northern lands where the Turkmens had settled, scattering the Turkmens southward and contributing to the formation of new tribal groups.<ref name="cs" /> The sixteenth and eighteenth centuries saw a series of splits and confederations among the [[nomad]]ic Turkmen tribes, who remained staunchly independent and inspired fear in their neighbors.<ref name="cs" /> By the 16th century, most of those tribes were under the nominal control of two sedentary [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] [[khanate]]s, [[Khanate of Khiva|Khiva]] and [[Khanate of Bukhara|Bukhoro]].<ref name="cs" /> Turkmen soldiers were an important element of the Uzbek militaries of this period.<ref name="cs" /> In the 19th century, raids and rebellions by the [[Yomud]] Turkmen group resulted in that group's dispersal by the Uzbek rulers.<ref name="cs" /> In 1855 the [[Turkmen tribes|Turkmen tribe]] of [[Teke (Turkmen tribe)|Teke]] led by Gowshut-Khan defeated the invading army of the [[Khanate of Khiva|Khan of Khiva]] Muhammad Amin Khan<ref>{{Cite web |last=Аннанепесов (Annanepesov) |first=М.

Russian forces began occupying Turkmen territory late in the 19th century.<ref name="cs" /> From their [[Caspian Sea]] base at Krasnovodsk (now [[Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan|Türkmenbaşy]]), the Russians eventually overcame the Uzbek khanates.<ref name="cs" /> In 1879, the Russian forces were defeated by the [[Teke (Turkmen tribe)|Teke Turkmens]] during the [[Battle of Geok Tepe (1879)|first attempt to conquer the Ahal area of Turkmenistan]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Аннанепесов (Annanepesov) |first=М.

During the next half-century, Turkmenistan played its designated economic role within the Soviet Union and remained outside the course of major world events.<ref name="cs" /> Even the major [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–1991)|liberalization movement]] that shook Russia in the late 1980s had little impact.<ref name="cs" /> However, in 1990, the Supreme Soviet of Turkmenistan declared sovereignty as a [[nationalist]] response to perceived exploitation by [[Moscow]].<ref name="cs" /> Although Turkmenistan was ill-prepared for independence and then-[[communist]] leader [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] preferred to preserve the Soviet Union, in October 1991, the fragmentation of that entity forced him to call a national referendum that approved independence.<ref name="cs" /> On 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Niyazov continued as Turkmenistan's chief of state, replacing communism with a unique brand of independent nationalism reinforced by a pervasive [[cult of personality]].<ref name="cs" /> A 1994 referendum and legislation in 1999 abolished further requirements for the president to stand for re-election (although in 1992 he completely dominated the only [[Turkmenistani presidential election, 1992|presidential election]] in which he ran, as he was the only candidate and no one else was allowed to run for the office), making him effectively [[president for life]].<ref name="cs" /> During his tenure, Niyazov conducted frequent purges of public officials and abolished organizations deemed threatening.<ref name="cs" /> Throughout the post-Soviet era, Turkmenistan has taken a neutral position on almost all international issues.<ref name="cs" /> Niyazov eschewed membership in regional organizations such as the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]], and in the late 1990s he maintained relations with the [[Taliban]] and its chief opponent in [[Afghanistan]], the [[Northern Alliance]].<ref name="cs" /> He offered limited support to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|military campaign against the Taliban]] following the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]].<ref name="cs" /> In 2002 an alleged assassination attempt against Niyazov led to a new wave of security restrictions, dismissals of government officials, and restrictions placed on the media.<ref name="cs" /> Niyazov accused exiled former foreign minister [[Boris Shikhmuradov]] of having planned the attack.<ref name="cs" />

Between 2002 and 2004, serious tension arose between Turkmenistan and [[Uzbekistan]] because of bilateral disputes and Niyazov's implication that Uzbekistan had a role in the 2002 assassination attempt.<ref name="cs" /> In 2004, a series of bilateral treaties restored friendly relations.<ref name="cs" /> In the [[Turkmenistani parliamentary election, 2004|parliamentary elections of December 2004 and January 2005]], only Niyazov's party was represented, and no [[Election monitoring|international monitors]] participated.<ref name="cs" /> In 2005, Niyazov exercised his dictatorial power by closing all hospitals outside [[Ashgabat]] and all rural libraries.<ref name="cs" /> The year 2006 saw intensification of the trends of arbitrary policy changes, shuffling of top officials, diminishing economic output outside the oil and gas sector, and isolation from regional and world organizations.<ref name="cs" /> China was among a very few nations to whom Turkmenistan made significant overtures.<ref name="cs" /> The sudden death of Niyazov at the end of 2006 left a complete vacuum of power, as [[List of cults of personality#Turkmenistan|his cult of personality]], comparable to the [[Kim Il-sung's cult of personality|one]] of eternal president [[Kim Il Sung]] of [[North Korea]], had precluded the naming of a successor.<ref name="cs" /> Deputy Prime Minister [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]], who was named interim head of government, won a non-democratic [[Turkmen presidential election, 2007|special presidential election]] held in early February 2007.<ref name="cs" /> His appointment as interim president and subsequent run for president violated the constitution.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Horák |first1=Slavomír |url=https://www.silkroadstudies.org/resources/pdf/SilkRoadPapers/2009_03_SRP_Horak-Sir_Turkmenistan-Berdimuhamedov.pdf |title=Dismantling Totalitarianism?
