[[File:El Altar de la Patria.png|thumb|[[National personification]] of Uruguay by [[Juan Manuel Blanes]]]]
In 1811, [[José Gervasio Artigas]], who became Uruguay's national hero, launched a successful revolt against the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Spanish authorities]], defeating them on 18 May at the [[Battle of Las Piedras (1811)|Battle of Las Piedras]].<ref name="dept-state"/> In 1813, the new government in Buenos Aires convened a constituent assembly where Artigas emerged as a champion of federalism, demanding political and economic autonomy for each area and the [[Banda Oriental]] in particular.<ref name="loc-3" /> The assembly refused to seat the delegates from the Banda Oriental; however, Buenos Aires pursued a system based on unitary centralism.<ref name="loc-3">{{csref |country=uruguay|section=The Struggle for Independence 1811–30|last1=Jacob |first1=Raúl |last2=Weinstein |first2=Martin |pd=no}} pp. [https://countrystudies.us/uruguay/7.htm 8]–[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31822015230782&seq=48 11]</ref>

As a result, Artigas broke with Buenos Aires and besieged Montevideo, taking the city in early 1815.<ref name="loc-3"/> Once the troops from Buenos Aires had withdrawn, the Banda Oriental appointed its first autonomous government.<ref name="loc-3"/> Artigas organized the [[Liga Federal|Federal League]] under his protection, consisting of six provinces, five of which later became part of Argentina.<ref name="loc-3"/>

In 1816, 10,000 Portuguese troops invaded the Banda Oriental from Brazil; they took Montevideo in January 1817.<ref name="loc-3"/> After nearly four more years of struggle, the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Portuguese Kingdom of Brazil]] annexed the ''Banda Oriental'' as a province under the name of "[[Cisplatina]]".<ref name="loc-3"/> The [[Empire of Brazil|Brazilian Empire]] became independent of Portugal in 1822. In response to the annexation, the [[Thirty-Three Orientals]], led by [[Juan Antonio Lavalleja]], declared independence on 25 August 1825, supported by the [[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]] (present-day Argentina).<ref name="dept-state"/> This led to the 500-day-long [[Cisplatine War]]. Neither side gained the upper hand, and in 1828, the [[Treaty of Montevideo (1828)|Treaty of Montevideo]], fostered by the United Kingdom through the diplomatic efforts of [[John Ponsonby, 1st Viscount Ponsonby|Viscount John Ponsonby]], gave birth to Uruguay as an independent state. 25 August is celebrated as Independence Day, a [[Public holidays in Uruguay|national holiday]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.elobservador.com.uy/google-homenajea-uruguay-el-dia-la-independencia-n231109 |title=Google homenajea a Uruguay |date=25 August 2012 |work=[[El Observador (Uruguay)|El Observador]] |access-date=23 August 2018 |language=es-uy |archive-date=23 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823210735/https://www.elobservador.com.uy/google-homenajea-uruguay-el-dia-la-independencia-n231109 |url-status=live }}</ref> The nation's [[Constitution of Uruguay|first constitution]] was adopted on 18 July 1830.<ref name="dept-state"/>

At the time of independence, Uruguay had an estimated population of just under 75,000.<ref name="loc-5"/> The political scene in Uruguay became split between two parties: the conservative ''[[National Party (Uruguay)|Blancos]]'' (Whites), headed by the second President [[Manuel Oribe]], representing the agricultural interests of the countryside, and the liberal ''[[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorados]]'' (Reds), led by the first President [[Fructuoso Rivera]], representing the business interests of Montevideo. The Uruguayan parties received support from warring political factions in neighboring [[Argentina]], which became involved in Uruguayan affairs.

The ''Colorados'' favored the exiled Argentine liberal [[Unitarian Party|Unitarios]], many of whom had taken refuge in Montevideo, while the Blanco president Manuel Oribe was a close friend of the Argentine ruler [[Manuel de Rosas]]. On 15 June 1838, an army led by the Colorado leader Rivera overthrew President Oribe, who fled to Argentina.<ref name="loc-5"/> Rivera declared war on Rosas in 1839. The conflict would last 13 years and become known as the [[Uruguayan Civil War|Guerra Grande]] (the Great War).<ref name="loc-5">{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/5.htm |title=BEGINNINGS OF INDEPENDENT LIFE, 1830–52&nbsp;– Uruguay |publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies |access-date=2011-02-23 |archive-date=2011-04-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430025513/http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/5.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> In 1843, an Argentine army overran Uruguay on Oribe's behalf but failed to take the capital.

In 1845, Britain and France intervened against Rosas to restore commerce to normal levels in the region. Their efforts proved ineffective, and by 1849, tired of the war, both withdrew after signing a treaty favorable to Rosas.<ref name="loc-6"/> It appeared that Montevideo would finally fall when an uprising against Rosas, led by [[Justo José de Urquiza]], governor of Argentina's [[Entre Ríos Province]], began. The Brazilian intervention in May 1851 on behalf of the ''Colorados'', combined with the uprising, changed the situation, and Oribe was defeated. The siege of Montevideo was lifted, and the ''Guerra Grande'' finally came to an end.<ref name="loc-6"/> Montevideo rewarded Brazil's support by signing treaties that confirmed Brazil's right to intervene in Uruguay's internal affairs.<ref name="loc-6"/>

In accordance with the 1851 treaties, Brazil intervened militarily in Uruguay as often as it deemed necessary.<ref name="loc-7"/> In 1865, the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] was formed by the [[emperor of Brazil]], the [[president of Argentina]], and the Colorado general [[Venancio Flores]], the Uruguayan head of government whom they both had helped to gain power. The Triple Alliance declared war on the Paraguayan leader [[Francisco Solano López]].<ref name="loc-7"/> The resulting [[Paraguayan War]] ended with the invasion of Paraguay and its defeat by the armies of the three countries.

The constitutional government of General [[Lorenzo Batlle y Grau]] (1868–72) suppressed the [[Revolution of the Lances]] by the [[National Party (Uruguay)|Blancos]].<ref name="loc-9"/> After two years of struggle, a peace agreement was signed in 1872 that gave the Blancos a share in the emoluments and functions of government through control of four of the [[departments of Uruguay]].<ref name="loc-9">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/9.htm|title=Caudillos and Political Stability – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|access-date=23 February 2011|archive-date=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430025503/http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/9.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> This establishment of the policy of co-participation represented the search for a new formula of compromise based on the coexistence of the party in power and the opposition party.<ref name="loc-9" /> Despite this agreement, the Colorado rule was threatened by the failed [[Tricolor Revolution]] in 1875 and the Revolution of the [[Quebracho, Uruguay|Quebracho]] in 1886.

The Colorado effort to reduce Blancos to only three departments caused a Blanco uprising of 1897, which ended with creating 16 departments, of which the Blancos now had control over six. Blancos were given ⅓ seats in Congress.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Paul H. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LAvw-YXm4TsC&q=co-participation+uruguay&pg=PA85 |title=Authoritarian Regimes in Latin America: Dictators, Despots, and Tyrants |date=1 January 2006 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=9780742537392 |via=Google Books}}</ref> This division of power lasted until President [[Jose Batlle y Ordonez]] instituted his political reforms, which caused the last uprising by Blancos in 1904 that ended with the [[Battle of Masoller]] and the death of Blanco leader [[Aparicio Saravia]].

However, the economy did not improve and deteriorated after 1980; the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) fell by 20%, and unemployment rose to 17%.
