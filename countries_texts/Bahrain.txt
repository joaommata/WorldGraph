=== Antiquity ===
Bahrain was home to [[Dilmun]], an important [[Bronze Age]] trade centre linking [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1192|title=Qal'at al-Bahrain – Ancient Harbour and Capital of Dilmun|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=5 October 2012|archive-date=5 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405042527/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1192|url-status=live}}</ref> Bahrain was later ruled by the [[Sumer|Sumerians]] and [[Babylonia]]ns.<ref>{{cite book|title=Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarchaeology of an Ancient Society|last=Larsen|first=Curtis E.|year=1984|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-46906-5|pages=52–55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q65mRSPPU6UC&pg=PA52}}</ref> From the 6th to 3rd century BC, Bahrain was part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].

During the [[classical era]], Bahrain was referred to by the [[ancient Greek]]s as ''[[Tylos]]'', the centre of pearl trading, when the Greek admiral [[Nearchus]] serving under [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] landed on Bahrain.{{sfn|Larsen|1983|p=13}} Nearchus is believed to have been the first of Alexander's commanders to visit the island, and he found a verdant land that was part of a wide trading network; he recorded: "That on the island of Tylos, situated in the Persian Gulf, are large plantations of cotton trees, from which are manufactured clothes called ''sindones'', of strongly differing degrees of value, some being costly, others less expensive. The use of these is not confined to India, but extends to Arabia."<ref>Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren, Historical Researches into the Politics, Intercourse, and Trade of the Principal Nations of Antiquity, Henry Bohn, 1854 p38</ref> The Greek historian [[Theophrastus]] states that much of Bahrain was covered by these cotton trees and that Bahrain was famous for exporting walking canes engraved with emblems that were customarily carried in Babylon.<ref>Arnold Heeren, ibid, p441</ref> Alexander had planned to settle Greek colonists in Bahrain, and although it is not clear that this happened on the scale he envisaged, Bahrain became very much part of the [[Hellenization|Hellenised]] world: the language of the upper classes was Greek (although [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] was in everyday use).

Bahrain was the site of worship of an ox deity called [[Awal]] ({{Langx|ar|اوال|links=no|engvar=gb}}) Worshipers built a large statue to Awal in [[Muharraq]], although it has now been lost. For many centuries after ''Tylos'', Bahrain was known as ''Awal''. By the 5th century, Bahrain became a centre for [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christianity]], with the village [[Samahij]]<ref>From Persian sa-mahij (سه ماهی) meaning Three Fish.</ref> as the seat of bishops.

According to historian [[Al-Juwayni]], the stone was returned 22 years later in 951 under mysterious circumstances. Wrapped in a sack, it was thrown into the [[Great Mosque of Kufa]] in Iraq, accompanied by a note saying "By command we took it, and by command, we have brought it back."

In 1802 it was governed by a 12-year-old child, when the Omani ruler Sayyid Sultan installed his son, Salim, as governor in the [[Arad Fort]].<ref>Onley, James.

In 1860, the Al Khalifas used the same tactic when the British tried to overpower Bahrain. Writing letters to the Persians and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], Al Khalifas agreed to place Bahrain under the latter's protection in March due to offering better conditions. Eventually, the [[British Raj|Government of British India]] overpowered Bahrain when the Persians refused to protect it. Colonel [[Lewis Pelly|Pelly]] signed a new treaty with Al Khalifas placing Bahrain under British rule and protection.<ref name=NAS />

Following the [[Qatari–Bahraini War]] in 1868, British representatives signed another agreement with the Al Khalifas. It specified that the ruler could not dispose of any of his territories except to the United Kingdom and could not enter into relationships with any foreign government without British consent.<ref>{{Cite book|last2=University of Exeter.

Unrest amongst the people of Bahrain began when Britain officially established complete dominance over the territory in 1892. The first revolt and widespread uprising took place in March 1895 against Sheikh Issa bin Ali, then ruler of Bahrain.{{sfn | Mojtahed-Zadeh | 1999 | p=130}} Sheikh Issa was the first of the Al Khalifa to rule without Persian relations. [[Arnold Wilson|Sir Arnold Wilson]], Britain's representative in the Persian Gulf and author of ''The Persian Gulf'', arrived in Bahrain from Muscat at this time.{{sfn | Mojtahed-Zadeh | 1999 | p=130}} The uprising developed further with some protesters killed by British forces.{{sfn | Mojtahed-Zadeh | 1999 | p=130}}

Before the development of the petroleum industry, the island was largely devoted to [[Pearl hunting|pearl fisheries]] and, as late as the 19th century, was considered to be the finest in the world.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} In 1903, German explorer [[Hermann Burchardt]] visited Bahrain and took many photographs of historical sites, including the old ''Qaṣr es-Sheikh'', photos now stored at the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]].<ref>[http://www.smb-digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=625685&bt=europeanaapi The old Qaṣr es-Sheikh] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813114115/http://www.smb-digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=625685&bt=europeanaapi |date=13 August 2021 }} (click on photo to enlarge).</ref> Before the [[World War I|First World War]], there were about 400 vessels hunting pearls and an annual export of more than £30,000.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}

In 1911, a group of Bahraini merchants demanded restrictions on the British influence in the country. The group's leaders were subsequently arrested and exiled to India. In 1923, the British introduced [[Bahrain administrative reforms of the 1920s|administrative reforms]] and replaced Sheikh Issa bin Ali with his son. Some clerical opponents and families, such as [[Dawasir|Al Dosari]], left or were exiled to Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bahrain's Re-Reform Movement|first=Jane|last=Kinninmont|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67553/jane-kinninmont/bahrains-re-reform-movement|newspaper=Foreign Affairs|date=28 February 2011|access-date=7 July 2012|archive-date=5 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105084741/http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67553/jane-kinninmont/bahrains-re-reform-movement|url-status=live}}</ref> Three years later the British placed the country under the ''de facto'' rule of [[Charles Belgrave]] who operated as an adviser to the ruler until 1957.<ref name="All at sea over 'the Gulf'">{{cite news|title=All at sea over 'the Gulf'|first=Mahan|last=Abedin|url=http://atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FL09Ak03.html|work=Asia Times|date=9 December 2004|access-date=7 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625054007/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FL09Ak03.html|archive-date=25 June 2012|url-status=unfit}}</ref><ref name="archiveeditions">{{cite web|url=http://www.archiveeditions.co.uk/titledetails.asp?tid=8|title=Near & Middle East Titles: Bahrain Government Annual Reports 1924–1970|publisher=Cambridge Archives Editions|archive-date=17 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117000023/http://www.archiveeditions.co.uk/titledetails.asp?tid=8|access-date=2 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Belgrave brought a number of reforms such as establishment of the country's first modern school in 1919 and the abolition of [[Arab slave trade|slavery]] in 1937.<ref>"[http://gulfnews.com/opinions/columnists/treasure-troves-of-history-and-diversity-1.1137150 Treasure troves of history and diversity] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127215535/http://gulfnews.com/opinions/columnists/treasure-troves-of-history-and-diversity-1.1137150 |date=27 November 2014 }}".
