Grenada is thought to have been first populated by peoples from South America during the Caribbean [[Ortoiroid people|Archaic Age]], although definitive evidence is lacking.

The French named their [[French colonial empires|new colony]] La Grenade, and the economy was initially based on [[sugar cane]] and [[indigo]], worked by African slaves via the transatlantic slave trade.{{sfn|Steele|2003|p=59}} According to records, during the French colonial period (circa 1659–1762), the enslaved population on Grenada rose from about 222 in 1669 to roughly 15,200 by 1763'''.''' The French established a capital known as Fort Royal (later St. George's). To shelter from hurricanes, the French navy would often take refuge in the capital's natural harbour, as no nearby French islands had a natural harbour to compare with that of Fort Royal. The British captured Grenada in the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1762.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Grenada"/>

As Grenada's economy grew, more and more enslaved Africans transported to the island. In 1785, Grenada had 23,926 enslaved Africans and 1,115 free people of colour, with around 996 European settlers. According to the Voyages Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, by 1807 Britain had brought 114,000 slaves to Grenada'''.''' Britain eventually outlawed the slave trade within the British Empire in 1807, after transporting approximately 3.1 million Africans, between 1640 and 1807, with roughly 2.7 million surviving the Middle Passage and arriving in the Americas. Slavery was completely outlawed in 1833, leading to the emancipation of all enslaved Africans by 1838.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Grenada"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – Anguilla |access-date=12 July 2019 |archive-date=7 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220807102108/https://www.britannica.com/place/Anguilla-island-West-Indies |url-status=live }}</ref> To ease the subsequent labour shortage, migrants from India were brought to Grenada in 1857.{{sfn|Steele|2003|pp=35–36}}<ref name="About Grenada: Historical Events"/>

==== Later colonial period after slavery ====
In 1877, Grenada was made a [[Crown colony]]. [[Theophilus A. Marryshow]] founded the Representative Government Association (RGA) in 1918 to agitate for a new and participative constitutional dispensation for the Grenadian people.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Marryshow |url=https://global.uwi.edu/sites/default/files/bnccde/grenada/centre/tam.htm |access-date=11 June 2024 |website=University of West Indies |archive-date=11 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240611112221/https://global.uwi.edu/sites/default/files/bnccde/grenada/centre/tam.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Due to Marryshow's lobbying, the Wood Commission of 1921–22 concluded that Grenada was ready for constitutional reform in the form of a modified Crown colony government. This modification granted Grenadians the right to elect five of the 15 Legislative Council members on a restricted property franchise, enabling the wealthiest 4% of adult Grenadians to vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bigdrumnation.org/comments/crowncolony.html |title=From Old Representative System to Crown Colony |publisher=Bigdrumnation.org |date=1 July 2008 |access-date=19 March 2012 |archive-date=1 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801080545/http://www.bigdrumnation.org/comments/crowncolony.html |url-status=usurped }}</ref> Marryshow was named a [[1943 Birthday Honours#Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE)|Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1943]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CAfAQAAMAAJ |title=Year Book of the Bermudas, the Bahamas, British Guiana, British Honduras and the British West Indies |date=1944 |publisher=T.

In 1950, [[Eric Gairy]] founded the [[Grenada United Labour Party]] (GULP), initially as a trade union, which led to the 1951 [[general strike]] for better working conditions.{{sfn|Steele|2003|pp=35–36}}<ref name="About Grenada: Historical Events"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://caribbean.halloffame.tripod.com/Eric_Gairy.html |title=Eric Gairy - Caribbean Hall of Fame |website=caribbean.halloffame.tripod.com |access-date=12 July 2019 |archive-date=3 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603023059/http://caribbean.halloffame.tripod.com/Eric_Gairy.html |url-status=live }}</ref> This sparked great unrest, and so many buildings were set ablaze that the disturbances became known as the "sky red" days.

On 13 March 1979, whilst Gairy was out of the country, the NJM launched a [[bloodless coup]] which removed Gairy, suspended the constitution, and established a [[People's Revolutionary Government]] (PRG), headed by [[Maurice Bishop]], who declared himself prime minister.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Grenada"/> His [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] government established close ties with [[Cuba]], [[Nicaragua]], and other [[communist bloc]] countries.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Grenada"/> All political parties except for the New Jewel Movement were banned and no elections were held during the four years of PRG rule.

==== Coup and execution of Maurice Bishop ====
Some years later,{{when|date=August 2021}} a dispute developed between Bishop and certain high-ranking members of the NJM. Though Bishop cooperated with Cuba and the [[USSR]] on various trade and foreign policy issues, he sought to maintain a [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned status]]. Hardline [[Marxist]] party members, including [[communist]] Deputy Prime Minister [[Bernard Coard]], deemed Bishop insufficiently revolutionary and demanded that he either step down or enter into a power-sharing arrangement.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

On 16 October 1983, Bernard Coard and his wife, Phyllis, backed by the Grenadian Army, led a coup against the government of Maurice Bishop and placed Bishop under [[house arrest]].<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Grenada"/> These actions led to street demonstrations in various parts of the island because Bishop had widespread support from the population. Because Bishop was a widely popular leader, he was freed by impassioned supporters who marched en masse to his guarded residence from a rally in the capital's central square. Bishop then led the crowd to the island's military headquarters to reassert his power. Grenadian soldiers were dispatched in armoured vehicles by the Coard faction to retake the fort. A confrontation between soldiers and civilians at the fort ended in gunfire and panic. Three soldiers and at least eight civilians died in the tumult that also injured 100 others, a school-sponsored study later found in 2000.<ref name=LA /> When the initial shooting ended with Bishop's surrender, he and a group of seven of his closest supporters were taken prisoner and executed by firing squad. Besides Bishop, the group included three of his cabinet ministers, a trade union leader, and three service-industry workers.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The U.S. Invasion of Grenada: legacy of a flawed victory |last=Kukielski |first=Philip |publisher=McFarland & Company |year=2019 |isbn=978-1-4766-7879-5 |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |pages=183–84 |oclc=1123182247 }}</ref>

After the execution of Bishop, the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (PRA) formed a military Marxist government with General [[Hudson Austin]] as chairman.

The contractors, American and European companies, and the [[European Economic Community|EEC]], which provided partial funding, all claimed the airstrip did not have military capabilities.

==== Post-invasion arrests ====
After the invasion, the pre-revolutionary Grenadian constitution came into operation once again. Eighteen members of the PRG/PRA were arrested on charges related to the murder of Maurice Bishop and seven others. The 18 included the top political leadership of Grenada at the time of the execution, along with the entire military chain of command directly responsible for the operation that led to the executions. Fourteen were [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]], one was found not guilty, and three were sentenced to 45 years in prison. The death sentences were eventually commuted to terms of imprisonment. Those in prison have become known as the "[[Grenada 17]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/104000/amr320012003en.pdf |title=The Grenada 17: the last of the cold war prisoners? |last=Amnesty International |date=October 2003 |access-date=12 July 2019 |archive-date=13 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813025935/https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/104000/amr320012003en.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>
