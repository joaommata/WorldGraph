The [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] region has often been considered a primary crossing point for early hominins following a southern coastal route from [[East Africa]] to [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]].

The Djibouti area has been inhabited since the [[Neolithic]]. According to linguists, the first [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations arrived in the region during this period from the family's proposed [[Afroasiatic Urheimat|urheimat]] ("original homeland") in the [[Nile Valley]],<ref>Zarins, Juris (1990), "Early Pastoral Nomadism and the Settlement of Lower Mesopotamia", (Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research)</ref> or the [[Near East]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Diamond |first1=Jared |last2=Bellwood |first2=Peter |title=Farmers and Their Languages: The First Expansions |journal=Science |date=25 April 2003 |volume=300 |issue=5619 |pages=597–603 |doi=10.1126/science.1078208 |pmid=12714734 |bibcode=2003Sci...300..597D }}</ref> Other scholars propose that the Afroasiatic family developed in situ in the Horn, with its speakers subsequently dispersing from there.<ref name="Blench143144">{{cite book |last1=Blench |first1=R. |title=Archaeology, Language, and the African Past |date=2006 |publisher=Rowman Altamira |isbn=978-0-7591-0466-2 |pages=143–144 }}</ref>

An [[Acheulean]] site (from 800,000 to 400,000 years BCE), where [[stone]] was cut, was excavated in the 1990s, in Gombourta, between [[Damerdjog]] and [[Loyada]], 15&nbsp;km south of [[Djibouti City]]. Finally, in Gobaad, a ''[[Homo erectus]]'' jaw was found, dating from 100,000 BCE. On [[Ghoubbet-el-Kharab|Devil's Island]], tools dating back 6,000 years have been found, which were used to open shells. In the area at the bottom of [[Ghoubbet-el-Kharab|Goubet]] (Dankalélo, not far from Devil's Island), circular stone structures and fragments of painted [[pottery]] have also been discovered. Previous investigators have also reported a fragmentary maxilla, attributed to an older form of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and dated to c. 250 Ka, from the valley of the Dagadlé Wadi.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9060-8_5 |chapter=Early Homo Occupation Near the Gate of Tears: Examining the Paleoanthropological Records of Djibouti and Yemen |title=Interdisciplinary Approaches to the Oldowan |series=Vertebrate Paleobiology and Paleoanthropology |date=2009 |last1=Chauhan |first1=Parth R. |pages=49–59 |isbn=978-1-4020-9059-2 }}</ref>

Pottery predating the mid-2nd millennium has been found at [[Asa Koma]], an inland lake area on the Gobaad Plain. The site's ware is characterized by punctate and incision geometric designs, which bear a similarity to the Sabir culture phase 1 ceramics from Ma'layba in [[Southern Arabia]]. Long-horned humpless cattle bones have likewise been discovered at Asa Koma, suggesting that domesticated cattle were present by around 3,500 years ago. Rock art of what appear to be antelopes and a giraffe are also found at [[Dorra]] and [[Balho]]. [[Handoga]], dated to the fourth millennium BCE, has in turn yielded obsidian microliths and plain ceramics used by early nomadic pastoralists with domesticated cattle.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.4324/9780203821183 |title=The Archaeology of Ethiopia |date=2007 |last1=Finneran |first1=Niall |isbn=978-0-429-23647-1 |page=86 }}</ref><ref name="Ohvah">{{cite book |last1=Raunig |first1=Walter |last2=Wenig |first2=Steffen |title=Afrikas Horn |date=2005 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |isbn=978-3-447-05175-0 |page=439 }}</ref><ref name="Connah">{{cite book |doi=10.4324/9780203511800 |title=Forgotten Africa |date=2004 |last1=Connah |first1=Graham |isbn=978-0-203-51180-0 |page=46 }}</ref><ref name="Amvjaa">{{cite journal |last1=Gutherz |first1=Xavier |last2=Cros |first2=Jean-Paul |last3=Lesur |first3=Joséphine |title=The discovery of new rock paintings in the Horn of Africa: the rockshelters of Las Geel, Republic of Somaliland |journal=Journal of African Archaeology |date=2003 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=227–236 |doi=10.3213/1612-1651-10011 |doi-broken-date=1 July 2025 |id={{HAL|hal-02155252v1}} |jstor=43135323 }}</ref>

The site of Wakrita is a small [[Neolithic]] establishment located on a [[wadi]] in the tectonic depression of Goba'ad in Djibouti in the [[Horn of Africa]]. The 2004 excavations yielded abundant ceramics that enabled us to define one Neolithic cultural facies of this [[region]], which was also identified at the nearby site of [[Asa Koma]]. The faunal remains confirm the importance of fishing in Neolithic settlements close to [[Lake Abbe|Lake Abbé]], but also the importance of bovine husbandry and, for the first time in this area, evidence for caprine herding practices. Radiocarbon dating places this occupation at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE, similar in range to Asa Koma. These two sites represent the oldest evidence of herding in the region, and they provide a better understanding of the development of Neolithic societies in this region.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gutherz |first1=Xavier |last2=Lesur |first2=Joséphine |last3=Cauliez |first3=Jessie |last4=Charpentier |first4=Vincent |last5=Diaz |first5=Amélie |last6=Ismaël |first6=Mohamed Omar |last7=Pène |first7=Jean-Michel |last8=Sordoillet |first8=Dominique |last9=Zazzo |first9=Antoine |title=New insights on the first Neolithic societies in the Horn of Africa: The site of Wakrita, Djibouti |journal=Journal of Field Archaeology |date=February 2015 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=55–68 |doi=10.1179/0093469014Z.000000000110 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Khalidi |first1=Lamya |last2=Mologni |first2=Carlo |last3=Ménard |first3=Clément |last4=Coudert |first4=Lucie |last5=Gabriele |first5=Marzia |last6=Davtian |first6=Gourguen |last7=Cauliez |first7=Jessie |last8=Lesur |first8=Joséphine |last9=Bruxelles |first9=Laurent |last10=Chesnaux |first10=Lorène |last11=Redae |first11=Blade Engda |last12=Hainsworth |first12=Emily |last13=Doubre |first13=Cécile |last14=Revel |first14=Marie |last15=Schuster |first15=Mathieu |last16=Zazzo |first16=Antoine |title=9000 years of human lakeside adaptation in the Ethiopian Afar: Fisher-foragers and the first pastoralists in the Lake Abhe basin during the African Humid Period |journal=Quaternary Science Reviews |date=September 2020 |volume=243 |article-number=106459 |doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2020.106459 |bibcode=2020QSRv..24306459K }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=van Neer |first1=Wim |last2=Lesur |first2=Joséphine |title=The ancient fish fauna from Asa Koma (Djibouti) and modern osteometric data on 3 Tilapiini and 2 Clarias catfish species. |journal=Documenta Archaeobiologiae |date=2004 |volume=2 |pages=141–160 |url=https://hal.science/hal-02155003/ }}</ref>

Up to 4000 years BCE, the region benefited from a climate very different from the one it knows today and probably close to the [[Mediterranean climate]]. The water resources were numerous with lakes in Goba'ad, lakes Assal and Abbé larger and resembling real bodies of water. The humans therefore lived by gathering, fishing and hunting. The region was populated by a very rich fauna: [[Felidae|felines]], [[African Buffalo|buffalo]]es, [[elephant]]s, [[rhino]]s, etc., as evidenced, for example, by the bestiary of cave paintings at [[Balho]]. In the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE, few nomads settled around the lakes and practiced fishing and cattle breeding. The burial of an 18-year-old woman, dating from this period, as well as the bones of hunted animals, bone tools and small [[Gemstone|jewels]] have been unearthed. By about 1500 BCE, the climate was already beginning to change, with sources of fresh water becoming more scarce. Engravings show dromedaries (animal of arid zones), some of which are ridden by armed warriors. The sedentary people now returned to a nomadic life. Stone [[tumuli]] of various shapes and sheltering graves dating from this period have been unearthed all over the territory.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coudert |first1=Lucie |last2=Lesur |first2=Joséphine |last3=Bruxelles |first3=Laurent |last4=Gutherz |first4=Xavier |last5=Cauliez |first5=Jessie |title=New archaeozoological results from Asa Koma (Djibouti): Contributing to the understanding of faunal exploitation during the 3rd millennium BC in the Horn of Africa |journal=Quaternary International |date=March 2018 |volume=471 |pages=219–228 |doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2018.01.016 |bibcode=2018QuInt.471..219C }}</ref>

=== Antiquity ===
{{main|Land of Punt}}
The earliest recorded ancient Egyptian expedition to Punt was organized by [[Sahure]] of the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]] (25th century BC), returning with cargoes of ''antyue'' and Puntites. However, [[gold]] from Punt is recorded as having been in [[Egypt]] as early as the time of Pharaoh [[Khufu]] of the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]].<ref>{{harvnb|Breasted|1906–07|p=161|Ref=none}}, vol. 1.</ref>

Subsequently, there were more expeditions to Punt in the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth]], [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh]], [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth]] and [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth]] dynasties of Egypt. In the Twelfth Dynasty, trade with Punt was celebrated in popular literature in the ''[[Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor]]''.

[[File:Three_Puntites.jpg|thumb|The Hatshepsut Punt Relief depicting three men in Puntite dress bearing gifts]]

In the reign of [[Mentuhotep III]] (11th dynasty, ca. 2000 BC), an officer named [[Hannu]] organized one or more voyages to Punt, but it is uncertain whether he personally traveled on these expeditions.<ref>{{harvnb|Breasted|1906–07|pp=427–433|Ref=none}}, vol. 1.</ref> Trading missions of the 12th dynasty pharaohs [[Senusret I]], [[Amenemhat II]] and [[Amenemhat IV]] had also successfully navigated their way to and from the mysterious land of Punt.<ref name="p145">Joyce Tyldesley, Hatchepsut: The Female Pharaoh, Penguin Books, 1996 hardback, p.145</ref><ref>El-Sayed Mahfouz: ''Amenemhat IV at Wadi Gawasis'', Bulletin de l'Institut français d'archéologie orientale A.

In the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt]], [[Hatshepsut]] built a [[Red Sea]] fleet to facilitate trade between the head of the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] and points south as far as Punt to bring mortuary goods to [[Karnak]] in exchange for Nubian gold. Hatshepsut personally made the most famous ancient Egyptian expedition that sailed to Punt.

I will subjugate and convert the King of the Christians to my religion, I will make him a provincial governor, and if he refuses to be converted I will hand him over to one of the shepherds, called Warjeke [i.e. [[Werji people|Warjih]]], that he may be made a keeper of camels. As for the Queen Jan Mangesha, his wife, I will employ her to grind corn. I will make my residence at Marade [i.e. [[Tegulet]]], the capital of his kingdom."<ref>Pankhurst, Richard K.P. ''The Ethiopian Royal Chronicles.'' Addis Ababa: Oxford University Press, Inc., 1967, p. 15.</ref>

In fact, after his first incursion, Sabr ad-Din appointed governors for nearby and neighboring provinces such as [[Fatagar]] and Alamalé, as well as far-off provinces in the north like [[Damot (historical region)|Damot]], [[Amhara province|Amhara]], [[Angot]], [[Enderta Province|Inderta]], [[Begemder]], and [[Gojjam]]. He also threatened to plant ''[[khat]]'' at the capital, a stimulant used by Muslims but forbidden to [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Christians]].<ref>Pankhurst, ''Borderlands'', p. 42.</ref>

In 1376, Sultan [[Sa'ad ad-Din II|Sa'ad ad-Din Abdul Muhammad]], also called Sa'ad ad-Din II, succeeded his brother and came to power, who continued to attack the Abyssinian Christian army. He attacked regional chiefs such as at Zalan and Hadeya, who supported the Emperor.<ref name="rp51">Richard Pankhurst [https://books.google.com/books?id=zpYBD3bzW1wC&pg=PA50 The Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History from Ancient Times to the End of the 18th Century - Google Books"] The Red Sea Press, 1997. p. 50–52</ref> According to Mordechai Abir, Sa'ad ad-Din II raids against the Ethiopian empire were largely hit-and-run type, which hardened the resolve of the Christian ruler to end the Muslim rule in their east.<ref name="Abir2013p25">{{cite book |author=Mordechai Abir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7fArBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA25 |title=Ethiopia and the Red Sea: The Rise and Decline of the Solomonic Dynasty and Muslim European Rivalry in the Region |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-136-28090-0 |pages=25–27}}</ref> In the early 15th century, the Ethiopian Emperor who was likely [[Dawit I]] collected a large army to respond.<ref name="rp51" /> He branded the Muslims of the surrounding area "enemies of the Lord", and invaded Ifat.

During the period of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]'s domination over the [[Hejaz]] and [[Yemen]] in the early 19th century, the port of [[Zeila]] also fell under the authority of Cairo, depending administratively on [[Mokha]]; its governor, named Mohammed El-Barr, kept command of it in exchange for an annual payment of 50 thalers, which he paid each year to [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], son of Muhammad Ali. Contemporary Egyptian officials, such as Jamali Bey, expressed anticipation for the reintegration of Zeilaʿ into Egypt and even proposed establishing an independent government there that would unite the villages, coastal regions, roads, and mountains stretching from Zeila to Massawa and up to the Ethiopian frontier under the authority of Khedive [[Isma'il Pasha of Egypt|Ismaʿil]]. Abubakr, a key local intermediary, shifted his allegiance from the Ottomans to the Egyptians after failing to secure French support, became an influential figure in Egyptian policy. By the 1870s, he was acting as an indispensable go-between for correspondence between the khedive and regional rulers, including Menelik of Shewa, who relied on Abubakr’s mediation while carefully avoiding provocation of Emperor Yohannes IV. On 12 February 1871, the Egyptian corvette ''Sa'ka'' anchored at Zeila with Mumtaz Pasha on board, who distributed subsidies on behalf of Cairo, raised the Egyptian flag in accordance with prior agreements, and extended Egyptian influence to Berbera and Tadjoura. Local rulers, such as the Afar chief Hummad, welcomed these overtures, requesting additional arms and supplies while signalling willingness to establish closer ties with Egypt. This period marked the beginning of a short-lived “honeymoon” between Egypt and the East African coast, though Cairo's ambitions faced diplomatic resistance from both Britain and the Ottoman Empire, particularly concerning the still-independent Somali ports of Berbera and Bulhar.<ref>{{Cite book |last=d'Héricourt |first=Charles Xavier Rochet |url=https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Voyage_sur_la_c%C3%B4te_orientale_de_la_Mer/nGcOAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1 |title=Voyage sur la côte orientale de la Mer Rouge, dans le pays d'Adel et le royaume de Choa |date=1841 |publisher=A.

In the 1870s, Egyptian authorities portrayed their collaboration with prominent regional figures, including two influential slave traders Abubakr Pasha and [[Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur]], as part of their anti-slavery stance, despite the ongoing slave trade occurring openly. Abubakr, being governor of Zeila, was recognised more for his political influence than his role in the slave trade. After receiving the title of pasha from Cairo, he and al-Zubayr visited the city. In 1875, Zeila became Egypt's strategic base for the planned conquest of Harar. In August of that year, [[Muhammad Rauf Pasha|Muhammad Ra'uf Pasha]] arrived in Zeila with a firman from the khedive, instructing Abubakr to support a "[[Egyptian invasion of Harar|geographic scientific voyage]]" to Harar which was a diplomatic facade intended to conceal military intentions from the British and maintain regional strategic balance.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ben-Dror |first=Avishai |url=https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Emirate_Egyptian_Ethiopian/p3N0DwAAQBAJ?hl=en |title=Emirate, Egyptian, Ethiopian: Colonial Experiences in Late Nineteenth-Century Harar |date=2018-08-23 |publisher=Syracuse University Press |isbn=978-0-8156-5431-5 |pages=33–34 |language=en}}</ref> By the early 1870s, [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt]] had been gaining power in the region and, in 1873, the Egyptians occupied Sagallo and other sites such as Tadjoura, but their hold didn't last long.<ref>{{cite book |author=Leila Tarazi Fawaz |title=Modernity and Culture from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, 1890--1920 |date=2002 |isbn= |page=65}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Caulk |first=Richard |url=https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Between_the_Jaws_of_Hyenas_A_Diplomatic/ZJLCZT7MW08C?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=tajura+egypt&pg=PA19&printsec=frontcover |title=Between the Jaws of Hyenas - A Diplomatic History of Ethiopia (1876-1896) |date=2002 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |isbn=978-3-447-04558-2 |pages=19 |language=en}}</ref>

On October 16 1884, [[Léonce Lagarde]] informed the commander of the cruiser ''Seignelay'' that the evacuation of Tadjourah and Sagallo by the Egyptians was imminent and advised immediate action. On October 18, as the Egyptians left Sagallo, the ''Seignelay''’s steam launch slipped ashore, allowing Legras to seize the site without resistance and install a garrison of 14 men. Over the following days, small posts were set up at Raïssali and Rood-Ali, though 35 Egyptian soldiers remained in Tadjourah. The ''Seignelay''’s commander proposed military intervention, believing resistance unlikely, but Lagarde hesitated at the last moment. On November 17, aboard the ''Brandon'', Lagarde entered Tadjoura after the Egyptian withdrawal, raised the French flag, and departed without establishing a permanent post. The positions created in October were soon abandoned, leaving only a symbolic occupation maintained by occasionally hoisting the French flag and sending a ship from time to time.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Simon |first=IMBERT-VIER |url=https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Tracer_des_fronti%C3%A8res_%C3%A0_Djibouti_des_t/ebEjbfy13-0C?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=seignelay+sagallo&pg=PA67&printsec=frontcover |title=Tracer des frontières à Djibouti, des territoires et des hommes au XIXe et XXe siècles |date=2011-04-20 |publisher=KARTHALA Editions |isbn=978-2-8111-3361-0 |pages=67-68 |language=fr}}</ref>

The boundaries of the present-day Djibouti state were established as the first French establishment in the [[Horn of Africa]] during the [[Scramble for Africa]]. The March 11, 1862, agreement the [[Afar people|Afar]] sultan, Raieta Dini Ahmet, signed in [[Paris]] was a treaty where the Afars sold lands surrounding in [[Obock]]. The French were interested in having a [[coaling station]] for [[steamship]]s, which would become especially important upon the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869. (Up to that time French ships had to buy coal at the British port of [[Aden]] across the gulf, an unwise dependency in case of war.) Later on, that treaty was used by the captain of the Fleuriot de Langle to colonize the south of the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Histoire Africaine|last=Henri|first=Brunschwig|journal=Cahiers d'Études africaines|year=1968|volume=8|issue=29|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/cea_0008-0055_1968_num_8_29_3123|pages=32–47|doi=10.3406/cea.1968.3123|access-date=17 May 2020|archive-date=28 September 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220928224417/https://www.persee.fr/doc/cea_0008-0055_1968_num_8_29_3123|url-status=live}}</ref> On March 26, 1885, the French signed another treaty with the Issas where the latter would become a protectorate under the French.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://djibouti.frontafrique.org/?doc31|title=Tracer des frontières à Djibouti|website=djibouti.frontafrique.org|access-date=28 July 2022|archive-date=30 November 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221130140118/https://djibouti.frontafrique.org/?doc31|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Le Regime de Protectorats|last1=Adolphe|first1=Martens|last2=Challamel|first2=Augustin|last3=C|first3=Luzac|publisher=Institut Colonial Internationale|year=1899|location=Bruxelles|page=383}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Trace des frontiere a Djibouti|last=Simon|first=Imbert-Vier|publisher=Khartala|year=2011|location=Paris|page=128}}</ref>[[File:Djibouti-Eid-Celebration.jpg|thumb|Solemn procession of local Muslims using Sudanese lyres to celebrate Eid in 1913]]

For their distinguished role, the battalion's companies were awarded the Croix de Guerre, and the RICM flag received the Legion of Honor. Reorganized as a combat unit by December 1916, the battalion fought at Chemin des Dames in May 1917 and later in significant battles such as Malmaison, the 3rd Battle of the Aisne, and the 2nd Battle of the Marne, earning multiple citations and the right to wear the Croix de Guerre fourragère.

After the Italian [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invasion and occupation of Ethiopia]] in the mid-1930s, constant border skirmishes occurred between French forces in French Somaliland and Italian forces in [[Italian East Africa]]. In June 1940, during the early stages of [[World War II]], [[fall of France|France fell]] and the colony was then ruled by the [[Vichy France|Vichy (French) government]].{{sfn|Imbert-Vier|2008|pp=226–29}} British and Commonwealth forces fought the neighboring Italians during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]]. In 1941, the Italians were defeated and the Vichy forces in French Somaliland were isolated. The Vichy French administration continued to hold out in the colony for over a year after the Italian collapse. In response, the British blockaded the port of [[Djibouti City]] but it could not prevent local French from providing information on the passing ship convoys. In 1942, about 4,000 [[British troops]] occupied the city.{{Sfn|Ebsworth|1953|p=564}} A local [[1st Battalion of Somali Tirailleurs|battalion]] from French Somaliland participated in the [[Liberation of France]] in 1944.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhBJAQAAMAAJ |title=Background Notes, Djibouti |date=1993 |publisher=U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Public Affairs, Office of Public Communication |language=en}}</ref>

In 1958, on the eve of neighboring Somalia's independence in 1960, a [[French Somaliland overseas territory referendum, 1958|referendum]] was held in Djibouti to decide whether to remain with France or to be an independent country. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, partly due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident French.<ref name=Barrington2006>Barrington, Lowell (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pyWpKKlukLcC&pg=PA115 ''After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905080147/https://books.google.com/books?id=pyWpKKlukLcC&pg=PA115 |date=5 September 2015}}.

In 1966, France rejected the [[United Nations]]' recommendation that it should grant French Somaliland independence.

In 1967, a [[French Somaliland independence referendum, 1967|second plebiscite]] was held to determine the fate of the territory. Initial results supported a continued but looser relationship with France. Voting was also divided along ethnic lines, with the resident Somalis generally voting for independence, with the goal of eventual union with Somalia, and the Afars largely opting to remain associated with France.<ref name="Apcoatf" /> The referendum was again marred by reports of vote rigging on the part of the French authorities.<ref name="Aufsnas">American Universities Field Staff (1968) ''Northeast Africa series'', Volume 15, Issue 1, p. 3.</ref> Shortly after the plebiscite was held, the former ''Côte française des Somalis'' (French Somaliland) was renamed to ''Territoire français des Afars et des Issas''.<ref name="Tioipeami" /> Announcement of the plebiscite results sparked civil unrest, including several deaths.

During the 1960s, the struggle for independence was led by the [[Front de Libération de la Côte des Somalis|Front for the Liberation of the Somali Coast]] (FLCS), who waged an armed struggle for independence with much of its violence aimed at French personnel. FLCS used to initiate few mounting cross-border operations into [[French Somaliland]] from [[Somali Democratic Republic|Somalia]] and [[Derg|Ethiopia]] to attacks on French targets. On March 24, 1975, the Front de Libération de la Côte des Somalis kidnapped the French Ambassador to Somalia, Jean Guery, to be exchanged against two activists of FLCS members who were both serving life terms in mainland [[France]]. He was exchanged for the two FLCS members in [[Aden]], [[South Yemen]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/25/archives/french-envoy-in-somalia-held-by-antiparis-group.html|title=French Envoy in Somalia Held by Anti-Paris Group|work=The New York Times|date=25 March 1975|df=dmy-all|access-date=20 May 2020|archive-date=2 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200702014531/https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/25/archives/french-envoy-in-somalia-held-by-antiparis-group.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The FLCS was recognized as a national liberation movement by the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU), which participated in its financing. The FLCS evolved its demands between the request of integration in a possible "[[Greater Somalia]]" influenced by the [[Somali Democratic Republic|Somali government]] or the simple independence of the territory. In 1975 the African People's League for the Independence (LPAI) and FLCS met in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]] with several meeting later they finally opted for independence path, causing tensions with [[Somali Democratic Republic|Somalia]].<ref>Gonidec, Pierre François.

In 1976, members of the [[Front de Libération de la Côte des Somalis]] which sought Djibouti's independence from [[France]], also clashed with the Gendarmerie Nationale Intervention Group over a bus hijacking en route to [[Loyada]]. This event, by showing the difficulties of maintaining the French colonial presence in Djibouti, was an important step in the [[independence]] of the [[territory]]. The likelihood of a third [[referendum]] appearing successful for the French had grown even dimmer. The prohibitive cost of maintaining the [[colony]], France's last outpost on the [[continent]], was another factor that compelled observers to doubt that the [[France|French]] would attempt to hold on to the territory.<ref name="Nwvol"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Légion-Étrangère|year=2000|publisher=Légion-Étrangère|page=2|url=http://2rep.legion-etrangere.com/|access-date=3 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730172224/http://2rep.legion-etrangere.com/|archive-date=30 July 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

During its first year, Djibouti joined the [[Organization of African Unity]] (now the [[African Union]]), the [[Arab League]], and the United Nations. In 1986, the nascent republic was also among the founding members of the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]] regional development organization. During the [[Ogaden War]], influential Issa politicians envisioned a Greater Djibouti or "Issa-land", where Djibouti's borders would extend from the Red Sea to [[Dire Dawa]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Walter S.|title=The 'Esayi Dream: A Footnote to the Ogaden War |date=1991|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43660335|journal=Northeast African Studies|volume=13|issue=1|pages=29–38|jstor=43660335 |issn=0740-9133}}</ref> That dream was dashed towards the end of the war as Somali forces were routed from Ethiopia.<ref name=":0" />
