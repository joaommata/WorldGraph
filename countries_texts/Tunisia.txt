{{main|Capsian culture|Ancient Carthage}}

Farming methods reached the [[Nile|Nile Valley]] from the [[Fertile Crescent]] region about 5000 BC, and spread to the [[Maghreb]] by about 4000 BC. Agricultural communities in the humid coastal plains of central Tunisia then were ancestors of today's [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes.

It was believed in ancient times that Africa was originally populated by [[Gaetuli]]ans and Libyans, both nomadic peoples. According to the Roman historian [[Sallust]], the demigod Hercules died in Spain and his polyglot eastern army was left to settle the land, with some [[Human migration|migrating]] to Africa. Persians went to the West and intermarried with the Gaetulians and became the Numidians. The Medes settled and were known as Mauri, later Moors.<ref>Banjamin Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'', Princeton University Press, 2013 p.147</ref>

The Numidians and Moors belonged to the race from which the Berbers are descended. The translated meaning of Numidian is Nomad and indeed the people were semi-nomadic until the reign of [[Masinissa]] of the Massyli tribe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hannibalbarca.webspace.virginmedia.com/carthage-numidians.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331154523/http://hannibalbarca.webspace.virginmedia.com/carthage-numidians.htm |archive-date=31 March 2012 |title=Carthage and the Numidians |publisher=Hannibalbarca.webspace.virginmedia.com |access-date=28 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://fanaticus.org/DBA/armies/II40-57.html |title=Numidians (DBA II/40) and Moors (DBA II/57) |publisher=Fanaticus.org |date=12 December 2001 |access-date=28 October 2011 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927024947/http://www.fanaticus.org/DBA/armies/II40-57.html |archive-date=27 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/422426/Numidia |title=Numidia (ancient region, Africa) |encyclopedia=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |access-date=28 October 2011}}</ref>

At the beginning of recorded history, Tunisia was inhabited by [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes. Its coast was settled by [[Phoenicia]]ns starting as early as the 12th century BC ([[Bizerte]], [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]]). The city of [[Carthage]] was founded in the 9th century BC by Phoenicians. Legend says that [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] from Tyre, now in modern-day Lebanon, founded the city in 814 BC, as retold by the [[Greeks|Greek]] writer [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus of Tauromenium]]. The settlers of Carthage brought their culture and religion from Phoenicia, now present-day [[Lebanon]] and adjacent areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shca.ed.ac.uk/Administration/Committees/documents/TheCityofCarthage.pdf |title=The City of Carthage: From Dido to the Arab Conquest |access-date=8 January 2013 |archive-date=10 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810075556/http://www.shca.ed.ac.uk/Administration/Committees/documents/TheCityofCarthage.pdf }}</ref>

After the series of wars with Greek city-states of Sicily in the 5th century BC, Carthage rose to power and eventually became the dominant civilization in the Western [[Mediterranean]]. The people of Carthage worshipped a pantheon of Middle Eastern gods including [[Baal]] and [[Tanit]]. Tanit's symbol, a simple female figure with extended arms and long dress, is a popular icon found in ancient sites. The founders of Carthage also established a [[Tophet]], which was altered in Roman times.

A Carthaginian invasion of Italy led by [[Hannibal]] during the [[Second Punic War]],  one of a series of wars with [[Roman Republic|Rome]], nearly crippled the rise of Roman power. From the conclusion of the Second Punic War in 202 BC, Carthage functioned as a client state of the Roman Republic for another 50 years.<ref>[[Appian]].

Following the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]] which began in 149 BC during the [[Third Punic War]], Carthage was conquered by Rome in 146 BC.{{sfn|Steel|2013|p=9–10}} Following its conquest, the Romans renamed Carthage to [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], incorporating it as a province.

During the Roman period, the area of what is now Tunisia enjoyed a huge development. The economy, mainly during the Empire, boomed: the prosperity of the area depended on agriculture. Called the ''Granary of the Empire'', the area of actual Tunisia and coastal [[Tripolitania]], according to one estimate, produced one million tons of cereals each year, one quarter of which was exported to the Empire. Additional crops included beans, figs, grapes, and other fruits.

By the 2nd century, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item. In addition to the cultivations and the capture and transporting of exotic wild animals from the western mountains, the principal production and exports included textiles, marble, wine, timber, livestock, pottery such as [[African Red Slip]], and wool.

There was even a huge production of mosaics and ceramics, exported mainly to Italy, in the central area of [[El Djem]] (where there was the second biggest amphitheater in the Roman Empire).

Berber bishop [[Donatus Magnus]] was the founder of a Christian group known as the [[Donatist]]s.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/169009/Donatist | title = Donatist | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> During the 5th and 6th centuries (from 430 to 533 AD), the Germanic [[Vandals]] invaded and ruled over a kingdom in Northwest Africa that included present-day Tripoli. The region was easily reconquered in 533–534 AD, during the rule of Emperor [[Justinian I]], by the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Romans]] led by General [[Belisarius]],<ref>Bury, John Bagnell (1958) ''History of the Later Roman Empire from the Death of Theodosius I. to the Death of Justinian'', Part 2, Courier Corporation. pp.124–148</ref> preluding a 165-year era of [[Byzantine North Africa|Byzantine rule]].

Sometime between the second half of the 7th century and the early part of the 8th century, [[Arab]] [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Muslim conquest occurred in the region]]. They founded the first Islamic city in Northwest Africa, [[Kairouan]]. It was there in 670 AD that the [[Mosque of Uqba]], or the Great Mosque of Kairouan, was constructed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davidson |first1=Linda Kay |last2=Gitlitz |first2=David Martin |title=Pilgrimage: From the Ganges to Graceland: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YVYkrNhPMQkC&pg=PA302|date=2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-004-8|page=302}}</ref> This mosque is the oldest and most prestigious sanctuary in the Muslim West with the oldest standing [[minaret]] in the world;<ref>{{cite book|last=Bosworth |first=Clifford Edmund |title=Historic Cities of the Islamic World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UB4uSVt3ulUC&pg=PA264|year=2007|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-15388-2|page=264}}</ref> it is also considered a masterpiece of Islamic art and architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kairouan.org/en/culture/unesco.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422091651/http://www.kairouan.org/en/culture/unesco.htm |archive-date=22 April 2012 |title=Kairouan inscription as World Heritage |publisher=Kairouan.org |access-date=2 May 2010 }}</ref> The [[Arab migration to the Maghreb]] began during this time.

The region in its entirety was taken in 695, retaken by the Byzantine Eastern Romans in 697, but lost permanently in 698. The transition from a Latin-speaking Christian Berber society to a Muslim and mostly Arabic-speaking society took over 400 years (the equivalent process in Egypt and the Fertile Crescent took 600 years) and resulted in the final disappearance of Christianity and Latin in the 12th or 13th century. The majority of the population were not Muslim until quite late in the 9th century; a vast majority were during the 10th. Also, some Tunisian Christians emigrated; some richer members of society did so after the conquest in 698 and others were welcomed by Norman rulers to Sicily or Italy in the 11th and 12th centuries – the logical destination because of the 1200 year close connection between the two regions.<ref>Jonathan Conant (2012).

The main Tunisian cities were conquered by the [[Normans]] of [[Sicily]] under the [[Kingdom of Africa]] in the 12th century, but following [[Almohad conquest of Ifriqiya|the conquest of Tunisia]] in 1159–1160 by the [[Almohads]] the Normans were evacuated to Sicily.

Despite the prestige of the new masters, the country was still unruly, with continuous rioting and fighting between the townsfolk and wandering Arabs and Turks, the latter being subjects of the Muslim Armenian adventurer Karakush. Also, Tunisia was occupied by [[Ayyubids]] between 1182 and 1183 and again between 1184 and 1187.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.3989/alqantara.2013.010|title=Saladin and the Ayyubid Campaigns in the Maghrib|journal=Al-Qanṭara|volume=34|issue=2|pages=267–295|year=2013|last1=Baadj|first1=Amar|doi-access=free | issn = 0211-3589}}</ref>

The greatest threat to Almohad rule in Tunisia was the [[Banu Ghaniya]], relatives of the [[Almoravids]], who from their base in [[Mallorca]] tried to restore Almoravid rule over the Maghreb. Around 1200 they succeeded in extending their rule over the whole of Tunisia until they were crushed by Almohad troops in 1207. After this success, the Almohads installed Walid Abu Hafs as the governor of Tunisia. Tunisia remained part of the Almohad state, until 1230 when the son of Abu Hafs declared himself independent.

During the reign of the [[Hafsid dynasty]] from their capital Tunis, fruitful commercial relationships were established with several Christian Mediterranean states.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bosworth |first= Clifford Edmund |title=The New Islamic Dynasties: A Chronological and Genealogical Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKpz_2CkoWEC&pg=PA46 |year=2004 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-2137-8|page=46}}</ref> In the late 16th century the coast became a [[pirate]] stronghold.

The [[Conquest of Tunis (1534)|first Ottoman conquest of Tunis]] took place in 1534 under the command of [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha]], the younger brother of Oruç Reis, who was the [[Kapudan Pasha]] of the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman Fleet]] during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. However, it was not until the [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|final Ottoman reconquest of Tunis from Spain]] in 1574 under Kapudan Pasha [[Uluç Ali Reis]] that the Ottomans permanently acquired the former [[History of medieval Tunisia#Hafsid dynasty of Tunis|Hafsid Tunisia]], retaining it until the [[French conquest of Tunisia]] in 1881.

Initially under Turkish rule from Algiers, soon the [[Ottoman Porte]] appointed directly for [[Tunis]] a governor called the [[Pasha]] supported by [[janissary]] forces. Before long, however, Tunisia became in effect an autonomous province, under the local [[bey]]. Under its [[Turkish People|Turkish]] governors, the beys, Tunisia attained virtual independence. The [[Husainid Dynasty|Hussein dynasty]] of beys, established in 1705, lasted until 1957.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bosworth |first=Clifford Edmund |title=The New Islamic Dynasties: A Chronological and Genealogical Manual |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKpz_2CkoWEC&pg=PA55|year=2004 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-2137-8 |page=55}}</ref> This evolution of status was from time to time challenged without success by Algiers. During this era, the governing councils controlling Tunisia remained largely composed of a foreign elite who continued to conduct state business in the [[Turkish language]].

In 1869, Tunisia declared itself bankrupt and an international financial commission took control over its economy. In 1881, using the pretext of a Tunisian incursion into [[Algeria]], the French invaded with an army of about 36,000 and forced the Bey of Tunis, [[Muhammad III as-Sadiq]], to agree to the terms of the 1881 [[Treaty of Bardo]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gearon |first= Eamonn |title=The Sahara: A Cultural History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKh_21ZERH4C&pg=PA117 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-986195-8 |page=117}}</ref> With this treaty, Tunisia was officially made a [[French occupation of Tunisia|French protectorate]], over the objections of Italy. European settlements in the country were actively encouraged; the number of [[French people|French]] colonists grew from 34,000 in 1906 to 144,000 in 1945. In 1910 there were also 105,000 [[Italian Tunisians|Italians in Tunisia]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Ion Smeaton Munro|title=Through fascism to world power: a history of the revolution in Italy|year=1933|publisher=A.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the protectorate of Tunisia was controlled by the collaborationist [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government in Metropolitan France. The antisemitic [[Vichy anti-Jewish legislation|Statute on Jews]] enacted by the Vichy government was also implemented in Vichy-controlled Northwest Africa and other overseas French territories. Thus, the persecution and murder of the Jews from 1940 to 1943 was part of [[the Holocaust]] in France.

From November 1942 until May 1943, Vichy-controlled Tunisia was occupied by Germany. [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] Commander [[Walter Rauff]] continued to implement the "Final Solution" there. From 1942 to 1943, Tunisia was the scene of the [[Tunisia Campaign]], a series of battles between the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces. The battle opened with initial success by the German and Italian forces, but the massive supply and numerical superiority of the Allies led to the [[Tunisian Campaign|Axis surrender]] on 13 May 1943.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gordon|last=Williamson|author-link=Gordon Williamson (writer)|title=Afrikakorps 1941–43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h1c44ccxC_sC&pg=PA24|year= 1991|publisher=Osprey |isbn=978-1-85532-130-4|page=24}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Palmer |first=Michael A. |title=The German Wars: A Concise History, 1859–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eHKE9NIwbMC&pg=PA199|year=2010|publisher=Zenith Imprint|isbn=978-0-7603-3780-6|page=199}}</ref> The six-month campaign of Tunisia's liberation from Axis occupation signalled the end of the war in Africa.
