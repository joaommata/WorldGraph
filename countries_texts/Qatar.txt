As punishment for piracy, an [[East India Company]] vessel bombarded [[Doha]] in 1821, destroying the town and forcing hundreds of residents to flee.

Although Qatar was considered a [[dependent territory|dependency]] of Bahrain, the Al Khalifa faced opposition from the local tribes. In 1867, the Al Khalifa, along with the ruler of [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi]], sent a massive naval force to [[Al Wakrah]] in an effort to crush the Qatari rebels. This resulted in the maritime [[Qatari–Bahraini War]] of 1867–68, in which Bahraini and Abu Dhabi forces sacked and looted Doha and Al Wakrah.<ref name="Fromhertz2012">{{cite book |title = Katar'da Osmanlilar 1871–1916 |last1= Kursun|first1= Zekeriya|publisher=Turk Tarih Kurumu|year= 2004}}</ref> The Bahraini hostilities were in violation of the [[Perpetual Truce of Peace and Friendship]] of 1861. The joint incursion, in addition to the Qatari counter-attack, prompted British Political Resident, Colonel [[Lewis Pelly]] to impose a settlement in 1868. His mission to Bahrain and Qatar and the resulting peace treaty were milestones because they implicitly recognised the distinctness of Qatar from Bahrain and explicitly acknowledged the position of Mohammed bin Thani. In addition to censuring Bahrain for its breach of agreement, Pelly negotiated with Qatari sheikhs who were represented by Mohammed bin Thani.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Zahlan |first1=Rosemarie Said |title=The Creation of Qatar |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |page=42}}</ref> The negotiations were the first stage in the development of Qatar as a sheikhdom.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilkinson |first1=John Craven |title=Arabia's Frontiers: The Story of Britain's Boundary Drawing in the Desert |date=1991 |publisher=IB Tauris |pages=46–47}}</ref>

He resigned as kaymakam and stopped paying taxes in August 1892.<ref>Habibur Rahman, pgs.150–151</ref>

In February 1893, Mehmed Hafiz Pasha arrived in Qatar in the interests of seeking unpaid taxes and accosting Jassim bin Mohammed's opposition to proposed Ottoman administrative reforms. Fearing that he would face death or imprisonment, Jassim retreated to Al Wajbah ({{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on|order=flip|disp=or}} west of Doha), accompanied by several tribe members. Mehmed's demand that Jassim disband his troops and pledge his loyalty to the Ottomans was met with refusal. In March, Mehmed imprisoned Jassim's brother and 13 prominent Qatari tribal leaders on the Ottoman [[corvette]] ''Merrikh'' as punishment for his insubordination. After Mehmed declined an offer to release the captives for a fee of 10,000 [[Turkish lira|liras]], he ordered a column of approximately 200 troops to advance towards Jassim's [[Al Wajbah Fort]] under the command of Yusuf Effendi, thus signalling the start of the [[Battle of Al Wajbah]].<ref name="fromherz"/>

Effendi's troops came under heavy gunfire by a sizable troop of Qatari infantry and cavalry shortly after arriving at Al Wajbah. They retreated to Shebaka fortress where they were again forced to draw back from a Qatari incursion. After they withdrew to Al Bidda fortress, Jassim's advancing column besieged the fortress, resulting in the Ottomans' concession of defeat and agreement to relinquish their captives in return for the safe passage of Mehmed Pasha's cavalry to [[Hofuf]] by land.<ref>Habibur Rahman, p. 152</ref> Although Qatar did not gain full independence from the Ottoman Empire, the result of the battle forced a treaty that would later form the basis of Qatar's emerging as an autonomous country within the empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qatarvisitor.com/index.php?cID=439&pID=1701 |title=Battle of Al Wajbah |publisher=Qatar Visitor |date=2 June 2007 |access-date=22 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117024415/http://www.qatarvisitor.com/index.php?cID=439&pID=1701 |archive-date=17 January 2013 }}</ref>

===British period (1916–1971)===
[[File:Zubarah Fort1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zubarah Fort]] built in 1938]]
By the [[Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913]], the Ottomans agreed to renounce their claim to Qatar and withdraw their garrison from Doha. With the outbreak of [[World War I]] however, nothing was done to carry this out, and the garrison remained in the fort at Doha, although its numbers dwindled as men deserted. In 1915, with the presence of British gunboats in the harbour, Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani (who was pro-British) persuaded the remainder to abandon the fort, and when British troops approached the following morning, they found it deserted.<ref name=diwan>{{cite web|title=Amiri Diwan – Shaikh Abdullah Bin Jassim Al Thani |url=http://www.diwan.gov.qa/english/Qatar/AbdullahBinQassim.htm |publisher=Diwan.gov.qa |access-date=28 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210053313/http://www.diwan.gov.qa/english/qatar/AbdullahBinQassim.htm |archive-date=10 February 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Zahlan |first1=Rosemarie Said |title=The Creation of Qatar |date=1979 |publisher=Croom Helm |location=Abingdon |isbn=978-1-138-18167-0 |page=74 |access-date=27 May 2019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVqFCwAAQBAJ |archive-date=19 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230119043503/https://books.google.com/books?id=uVqFCwAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Qatar became a British protectorate on 3 November 1916<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rahman |first1=Habibur |title=The Emergence of Qatar: The Turbulent Years 1627–1916 |date=2005 |publisher=Routledge |page=235}}</ref> when the United Kingdom signed a treaty with Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani to bring Qatar under its [[Trucial States|Trucial System of Administration]]. The treaty reserved foreign affairs and defence to the United Kingdom but allowed internal autonomy. While Abdullah agreed not to enter into any relations with any other power without the prior consent of the British government, the latter guaranteed the protection of Qatar from aggression by sea and provide its 'good offices' in the event of an attack by land. This latter undertaking was left deliberately vague.<ref name="diwan"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Zahlan |first1=Rosemarie Said |title=The Creation of Qatar |date=1979 |publisher=Croom Helm |location=Abingdon |isbn=978-1-138-18167-0 |pages=73–85 |access-date=27 May 2019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVqFCwAAQBAJ |archive-date=19 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230119043503/https://books.google.com/books?id=uVqFCwAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 5 May 1935, while agreeing an oil concession with the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]], Abdullah signed another treaty with the British government which granted Qatar protection against internal and external threats.<ref name="diwan" /> Oil reserves were first discovered in 1939. Exploitation and development were, however, delayed by [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morton |first1=Michael Quentin |title=Empires and Anarchies: A History of Oil in the Middle East |date=2017 |publisher=Reaktion Books |location=London |isbn=978-1-78023-810-4 |pages=139–140 |access-date=27 May 2019|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BGkwDwAAQBAJ&q=empires+and+anarchies+morton}}</ref>

The focus of British interests in Qatar changed after the Second World War with the independence of India, the creation of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, and the development of oil in Qatar. In 1949, the appointment of the first British political officer in Doha, John Wilton, signified a strengthening of Anglo-Qatari relations.<ref>Wilton, John, unpublished memoir, ‘Qatar and Sharjah, 1949–1952’, Special Collections, University of Exeter Library, Exeter.</ref> Oil exports began in 1949, and oil revenues became the country's main source of revenue; the pearl trade had gone into decline. These revenues were used to fund the expansion and modernisation of Qatar's infrastructure.

When Britain officially announced in 1968 that it would withdraw from the Persian Gulf in three years' time, Qatar joined talks with Bahrain and seven other Trucial States to create the [[Federation of Arab Emirates]]. Regional disputes, however, persuaded Qatar and Bahrain to withdraw from the talks and become independent states separate from the Trucial States, which went on to become the [[United Arab Emirates]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/news/latest-news/world-and-societies/2013/november/historian-heard-bey-on-why-the-uae-is-a-federation.html|title=Historian Heard-Bey On Why the UAE is a Federation|publisher=NYU Abu Dhabi|date=29 October 2013|access-date=12 August 2025}}</ref>
