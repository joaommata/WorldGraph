===Pre-colonial period===
[[Saint Vincent (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines)|Saint Vincent]] was first inhabited by the [[Ciboney]] people from [[South America]] around 5000 B.C. They were succeeded by the [[Arawak]]s around the 3rd century A.D., who were later displaced by the [[Kalinago]] in the 14th century.<ref name="thecommonwealth.org"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indigenousreview.blogspot.com.au/#stash.9WFLBXgH.dpuf|title=Review of the Indigenous Caribbean|website=indigenousreview.blogspot.com.au|access-date=7 July 2019|archive-date=7 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307122251/http://indigenousreview.blogspot.com.au/#stash.9WFLBXgH.dpuf|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2008-05-24 |title=St. Vincent |url=https://indigenouscaribbean.wordpress.com/directory/st-vincent/ |access-date=2025-05-14 |website=Indigenous Caribbean Center |language=en}}</ref><ref name="britannica.com" /> The Kalinago named the island Youloumain.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historic Account of Saint Vincent, the Kalinago Youroumayn, the island of the Karaÿbes|author=Frere.

=== French and British colonisation and First Carib War ===

Various attempts by the English and Dutch to claim the island proved unsuccessful, and it was the French who were first able to colonise the island, settling in the town of [[Barrouallie]] on the [[Windward and leeward|leeward]] side of St Vincent in 1719.<ref name="britannica.com"/> The French imported Black slaves to work on plantations producing sugar, coffee, indigo, tobacco, cotton and cocoa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://svgancestry.com/index.php/st-vincent-timeline/|title=St Vincent Genealogy Resources|website=svgancestry.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321165131/http://svgancestry.com/index.php/st-vincent-timeline|archive-date=21 March 2012}}</ref>

The British captured the island and drove out the French from Barrouallie during the [[Seven Years' War]], a claim confirmed by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]].<ref name="britannica.com"/> On taking control of the island in 1763, the British laid the foundations of [[Fort Charlotte, Saint Vincent|Fort Charlotte]] and also continued the importation of slaves to work on the island's plantations. The [[Garifuna]], an Afro-Indigenous creole people on the island, were opposed to the British presence and entered into open conflict against the British, starting the [[First Carib War]], which lasted from 1772 to 1773.<ref name="britannica.com"/><ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-09-01 |title=The First Carib War, 1769-1773 |url=https://legacyofrevolution.wordpress.com/the-first-carib-war-1769-1773/ |access-date=2025-05-14 |website=Water, Fire & Ash |language=en}}</ref>

During the [[Anglo-French War (1778–1783)]], the French [[French capture of Saint Vincent|recaptured St Vincent]] in 1779. However, the British regained control under the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)]].<ref name="britannica.com"/><ref name="thecommonwealth.org"/>

=== British colonial period and Second Carib War ===
{{Main|British Windward Islands}}
The uneasy peace between the British and the Garifuna led to the [[Second Carib War]], which lasted from 1795 to 1797.<ref name="britannica.com"/> The Garifuna were led by paramount chief [[Joseph Chatoyer]] and supported by the French, notably [[Victor Hugues]] who was based on the island of [[Martinique]]. They were eventually defeated in 1797 by British forces under the command Sir [[Ralph Abercromby]]; a peace treaty agreement was made which resulted in almost 5,000 Garifuna being deported to [[Roatán]], an island off the coast of [[Honduras]], and to [[Belize]] and [[Baliceaux]] in the Grenadines.<ref name="thecommonwealth.org"/>

The British [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolished]] slavery in Saint Vincent (as well as in all other [[British West Indies]] colonies) in 1834, and an apprenticeship period followed which ended in 1838.<ref name="thecommonwealth.org"/><ref name="britannica.com"/> After its end, labour shortages on the plantations resulted, and were initially addressed by the immigration of indentured servants; starting from 1845, many [[Catholic Church in Portugal|Portuguese Catholic]] settlers arrived from [[Madeira]], with around 2,100 arrivals from [[Portugal]] recorded from 1845 to 1850.<ref>{{Cite web|title=A BRIEF Historical Overview of the Portuguese in St. Vincent and the Grenadines|url=https://thevincentian.com/a-brief-historical-overview-of-the-portuguese-in-st-vincent-and-the-grenad-p20809-133.htm|access-date=14 June 2024|website=thevincentian.com}}</ref> Between 1861 and 1888, a new wave of immigration occurred, with shiploads of [[Indo-Caribbeans|Indian labourers]] arriving.<ref name="britannica.com"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=Indian Indentured Labour |url=https://www.georgetownsvgrevisited.co.uk/indentees-who-were-they.php |access-date=2025-05-14 |website=www.georgetownsvgrevisited.co.uk}}</ref>

In 1902, the [[La Soufrière (volcano)|La Soufrière]] volcano erupted again, killing 1,500–2,000 people; much farmland was damaged, and the economy deteriorated.<ref name="thecommonwealth.org"/><ref name="britannica.com"/><ref name="Pyle, David"/>

Saint Vincent and the Grenadines passed through various stages of colonial status under the British. A representative assembly was authorised in 1776, Crown Colony government was installed in 1877, a [[legislative council]] was created in 1925 with a limited franchise,<ref name="britannica.com"/> and [[Universal suffrage|universal adult suffrage]] was granted in 1951.<ref name="britannica.com"/> During the period of its control of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Britain made several attempts to unify the island with the other Windward Islands as a single entity, to simplify British control in the sub-region through a single unified administration.<ref name="britannica.com"/> In the 1960s, the British again tried to unify all of its regional islands, including Saint Vincent, into a single politically unified entity under British control. The unification was to be called the [[West Indies Federation]] and was driven by a desire to gain independence from the British government. However, the attempt collapsed in 1962.<ref name="britannica.com"/>

Saint Vincent was granted "associate statehood" status by Britain on 27 October 1969.<ref name="britannica.com"/> This gave Saint Vincent complete control over its internal affairs but fell short of full independence in law.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Legislature Historical Perspectives |url=https://assembly.gov.vc/assembly/index.php/legislature-historical-perspectives#:~:text=Following%20the%20demise%20of%20the,members%20and%204%20nominated%20members. |access-date=2025-10-17 |website=assembly.gov.vc}}</ref>

In April 1979, [[La Soufrière (volcano)|La Soufrière]] erupted once more. Although no one was killed, thousands were evacuated and extensive agricultural damage occurred.<ref name="Pyle, David"/>

===Post-independence era===

[[Milton Cato]] of the centre-left [[Saint Vincent Labour Party]] (SVLP) was the country's first Prime Minister (he had been Premier since 1974), ruling until his defeat in the [[1984 Vincentian general election]] by [[James Fitz-Allen Mitchell]] of the centre-right [[New Democratic Party (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP).<ref name="britannica.com"/> During Cato's time in office, there was a brief rebellion on [[Union Island]] in December 1979 led by Lennox 'Bumba' Charles. Inspired by the recent revolution on Grenada, Charles alleged neglect of the Union by the central government.

In 2000, [[Arnhim Eustace]] became Prime Minister after taking over the leadership of the NDP following Mitchell's retirement; he was [[2001 Vincentian general election|defeated]] a year later by [[Ralph Gonsalves]] of the [[Unity Labour Party]] (successor party to the SVLP).<ref name="caribbeanelections2001">{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeanelections.com/svg/past/results_2001.asp|title=Caribbean Elections &#124; St. Vincent and the Grenadines General Elections 2010|access-date=12 September 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006195247/http://www.caribbeanelections.com/svg/past/results_2001.asp|archive-date=6 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="britannica.com"/> Gonsalves—a left-winger known in the country as "Comrade Ralph"<ref name=BBCLeaders>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-20006737 St Vincent and the Grenadines profile – Leaders] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220816061055/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-20006737 |date=16 August 2022 }}, BBC News (27 November 2014).</ref><ref>Ralph E.
