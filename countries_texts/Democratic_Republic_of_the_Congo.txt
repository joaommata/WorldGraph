The geographical area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo was populated as early as 90,000 years ago, as shown by the 1988 discovery of the [[Semliki harpoon]] at [[Katanda Territory|Katanda]], one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found, believed to have been used to catch [[Bagrus|giant river catfish]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/katanda-bone-harpoon-point |title=Katanda Bone Harpoon Point &#124; The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program |publisher=Humanorigins.si.ed |access-date=10 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302062128/http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/katanda-bone-harpoon-point |archive-date=2 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Barbed Bone Points: Tradition and Continuity in Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa |date=1 September 1998 |doi=10.1023/A:1021659928822 |volume=15 |issue=3 |journal=African Archaeological Review |pages=173–98 |last=Yellen |first=John E. |s2cid=128432105 |issn=0263-0338}}</ref>

[[Bantu peoples]] reached [[Central Africa]] at some point during the first millennium BC, then gradually started to expand southward. Their propagation was accelerated by the adoption of [[pastoralism]] and of [[Iron Age]] techniques. The people living in the south and southwest were foraging groups, whose technology involved only minimal use of metal technologies. The development of metal tools during this time period revolutionized agriculture. This led to the displacement of the [[African pygmies]]. Following the Bantu migrations, a period of state and class formation began circa 700 with three centres in the modern-day territory; one to the west around [[Pool Malebo]], one east around [[Lake Mai-Ndombe]], and a third even further east and south around the [[Upemba Depression]].<ref name=":04">{{Citation |title=The Development of States in West Central Africa to 1540 |date=2020 |work=A History of West Central Africa to 1850 |pages=16–55 |editor-last=Thornton |editor-first=John K. |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/history-of-west-central-africa-to-1850/development-of-states-in-west-central-africa-to-1540/CE71122CF8DFD7B4B188BA34F8F65BFC |access-date=21 September 2024 |series=New Approaches to African History |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-56593-7 |archive-date=8 October 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241008080246/https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/history-of-west-central-africa-to-1850/development-of-states-in-west-central-africa-to-1540/CE71122CF8DFD7B4B188BA34F8F65BFC |url-status=live }}</ref>{{Rp|page=|pages=17–18}}

By the 13th century, there were three main confederations of states in the western Congo Basin around Pool Malebo. In the east were the [[Seven Kingdoms of Kongo dia Nlaza]], considered to be the oldest and most powerful, which likely included [[Nsundi]], [[Mbata Kingdom|Mbata]], [[Mpangu]], and possibly [[Kundi kingdom|Kundi]] and [[Okanga]]. South of these was [[Mpemba]] which stretched from modern-day [[Angola]] to the [[Congo River]]. It included various kingdoms such as [[Mpemba Kasi]] and [[Vunda]]. To its west across the Congo River was a confederation of three small states; [[Vungu]] (its leader), [[Kakongo]], and [[Ngoyo]].<ref name=":04" />{{Rp|pages=24–25}}

The [[Kingdom of Kongo]] was founded in the 14th century and dominated the western region. The empire of [[Mwene Muji]] was founded around Lake Mai-Ndombe.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Thornton |first=John |date=2024 |title=Mwene Muji: A Medieval Empire in Central Africa? |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-african-history/article/mwene-muji-a-medieval-empire-in-central-africa/2F2D9F46069847DC655F171B75636D27 |journal=The Journal of African History |language=en |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=30–46 |doi=10.1017/S0021853724000161 |issn=0021-8537 |url-access=subscription |doi-access=free |archive-date=4 October 2024 |access-date=13 October 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241004042845/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-african-history/article/mwene-muji-a-medieval-empire-in-central-africa/2F2D9F46069847DC655F171B75636D27 |url-status=live }}</ref> From the Upemba Depression the [[Luba Empire]] and [[Lunda Empire]] emerged in the 15th and 17th centuries respectively dominated the eastern region.

[[Congo Free State|Belgian exploration]] and administration took place from the 1870s until the 1920s. It was first led by [[Henry Morton Stanley]], who undertook his explorations under the sponsorship of King [[Leopold II of Belgium]]. The eastern regions of the precolonial Congo were heavily disrupted by constant [[slave raiding]], mainly from Arab–Swahili [[Arab slave trade|slave traders]] such as the infamous [[Tippu Tip]], who was well known to Stanley.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page51.shtml The East African slave trade] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206194052/http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page51.shtml |date=6 December 2013 }}.

In the Congo Free State, colonists coerced the local population into producing rubber to meet the growing international demand driven by the spread of automobiles and the development of rubber tires. Rubber sales made a fortune for Leopold, who built several buildings in [[Brussels]] and [[Ostend]] to honor himself and his country. To enforce the rubber quotas, the ''[[Force Publique]]'' was called in and made the practice of cutting off the limbs of the natives a matter of policy.<ref name="google748">Fage, John D. (1982).

Failure to comply or meet these quotas often resulted in the kidnapping of family members, who were held for ransom until quotas were met or subjected to physical violence. Violence was carried out by "village sentries"—militias led by European officers and composed of African soldiers—tasked with ensuring rubber collection. These sentries operated with full impunity, lacked proper oversight, and were reportedly known to kill and eat underperforming workers<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Lowes |first1=Sara |last2=Montero |first2=Eduardo |date=11 October 2021 |title=Concessions, Violence, and Indirect Rule: Evidence from the Congo Free State |url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/136/4/2047/6289931 |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |language=en |volume=136 |issue=4 |pages=2047–2091 |doi=10.1093/qje/qjab021 |issn=0033-5533 |url-access=subscription |archive-date=30 November 2024 |access-date=16 November 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241130061324/https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/136/4/2047/6289931 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1908, the Belgian parliament, in spite of initial reluctance, bowed to international pressure (especially from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]) and took over the Free State from King Leopold II.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.historytoday.com/tim-stanley/belgiums-heart-darkness |magazine=History Today |author=Tim Stanley |volume=62 |number=10 |date=October 2012 |title=Belgium's Heart of Darkness |access-date=30 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121065836/http://www.historytoday.com/tim-stanley/belgiums-heart-darkness |archive-date=21 November 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> On 18 October 1908, the Belgian parliament voted in favour of annexing the Congo as a Belgian colony. Executive power went to the [[Minister of the Colonies (Belgium)|Belgian minister of colonial affairs]], assisted by a Colonial Council (Conseil Colonial) (both located in Brussels). The Belgian parliament exercised legislative authority over the Belgian Congo.

The Belgian Congo was directly involved in the two world wars. During [[World War I]] (1914–1918), an initial stand-off between the ''Force Publique'' and the German colonial army in [[German East Africa]] turned into open warfare with a joint Anglo-Belgian-Portuguese invasion of German colonial territory in 1916 and 1917 during the [[East African campaign (World War I)|East African campaign]]. The ''Force Publique'' gained a notable victory when it marched into [[Tabora]] in September 1916 under the command of General [[Charles Tombeur]] after heavy fighting.

After 1918, Belgium was rewarded for the participation of the ''Force Publique'' in the East African campaign with a [[League of Nations]] mandate over the previously German colony of [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. During [[World War II]], the Belgian Congo provided a crucial source of income for the [[Belgian government in exile]] in London, and the ''Force Publique'' again participated in [[East African campaign (World War II)|Allied campaigns in Africa]].

In May 1960, a growing nationalist movement, the [[Mouvement National Congolais]] led by [[Patrice Lumumba]], won the [[1960 Belgian Congo general election|parliamentary elections]]. Lumumba became the first [[Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Prime Minister]] of the Republic of the Congo, on 24 June 1960. The parliament elected [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] as [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|president]] of the Alliance des Bakongo ([[ABAKO]]) party. Other parties that emerged included the [[Parti Solidaire Africain]] led by [[Antoine Gizenga]], and the Parti National du Peuple led by Albert Delvaux and [[Laurent Mbariko]].<ref>Congo 1960, dossiers du CRISP, Belgium</ref>

The Belgian Congo achieved independence on 30 June 1960 under the name "République du Congo" ("Republic of Congo" or "Republic of the Congo" in English). Shortly after, on 15 August 1960, the neighboring French colony of [[French Congo|Middle Congo]] also gained independence and adopted the same name, '[[Republic of the Congo|Republic of Congo]].' To avoid confusion between the two, the former Belgian Congo became known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo ('''DR Congo'''), while the former French colony retained the name 'Republic of the Congo' ('''Congo''').

Shortly after independence the ''Force Publique'' mutinied, and on 11 July the [[Katanga Province|province of Katanga]] (led by [[Moïse Tshombe]]) and [[South Kasai]] [[Congo Crisis|engaged in secessionist struggles]] against the new leadership.<ref>"[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826488-4,00.html Jungle Shipwreck] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216231712/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826488-4,00.html |date=16 December 2014 }}", ''Time'', 25 July 1960.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=- HeinOnline.org |url=https://www.heinonline.org/HOL/Welcome?message=Please%20log%20in&url=%2FHOL%2FPage%3Fhandle%3Dhein.cow%2Fcowcs0092%26size%3D2%26collection%3Dcow%26id%3D1 |website=www.heinonline.org |language=en |access-date=16 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116131729/https://www.heinonline.org/HOL/Welcome?message=Please%20log%20in&url=%2FHOL%2FPage%3Fhandle%3Dhein.cow%2Fcowcs0092%26size%3D2%26collection%3Dcow%26id%3D1 |archive-date=16 November 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Most of the 100,000 [[White people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Europeans]] who had remained behind after independence fled the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/united_nations_congo.htm |title=The United Nations and the Congo |publisher=Historylearningsite.co.uk |date=30 March 2007 |access-date=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601233005/http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/united_nations_congo.htm |archive-date=1 June 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> After the United Nations rejected Lumumba's call for help to put down the secessionist movements, Lumumba asked for assistance from the Soviet Union, who accepted and sent military supplies and advisers.

On 18 September 1961, in ongoing negotiations of a ceasefire, a [[1961 Ndola United Nations DC-6 crash|plane crash near Ndola]] resulted in the death of [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], along with all 15 passengers, setting off a succession crisis. Amidst widespread confusion and chaos, a temporary government was led by technicians (the [[College of Commissioners-General|Collège des commissaires généraux]]). Katangan secession ended in January 1963 with the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo|assistance of UN forces]]. Several short-lived governments of [[Joseph Iléo|Joseph Ileo]], [[Cyrille Adoula]], and Moise Kapenda Tshombe took over in quick succession.

Meanwhile, in the east of the country, Soviet and Cuban-backed rebels called the [[Simba rebellion|Simbas]] rose up, taking a significant amount of territory and proclaiming a communist "People's Republic of the Congo" in Stanleyville. The Simbas were pushed out of Stanleyville in November 1964 during [[Operation Dragon Rouge]], a military operation conducted by Belgian and American forces to rescue hundreds of hostages.

===Mobutu autocracy and Zaire (1965–1997)===
{{Main|Zaire}}

[[File:Mobutu Nixon.jpg|thumb|[[Mobutu Sese Seko]] and Richard Nixon in Washington, D.C., 1973]]
Mobutu had the staunch support of the United States because of his [[Anti-communism|opposition to communism]]; the U.S. believed that his administration would serve as an effective counter to communist movements in Africa.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2009/08/13/rape-of-the-congo/ |title=Rape of the Congo |author=Adam Hochschild |date=13 August 2009 |magazine=New York Review of Books |access-date=1 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301164520/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2009/08/13/rape-of-the-congo/ |archive-date=1 March 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> A [[One-party state|single-party system]] was established, and Mobutu declared himself [[List of heads of state of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|head of state]]. He periodically held elections in which he was the only candidate. Although relative peace and stability were achieved, Mobutu's government was guilty of severe [[human rights]] violations, [[political repression]], a [[cult of personality]] and [[Corruption in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|corruption]].

By late 1967, Mobutu had successfully neutralized his political opponents and rivals, either through co-opting them into his regime, arresting them, or rendering them otherwise politically impotent.{{sfn|Young|Turner|2013|p=58}} Throughout the late 1960s, Mobutu continued to shuffle his governments and cycle officials in and out of the office to maintain control. Joseph Kasa-Vubu's death in April 1969 ensured that no person with First Republic credentials could challenge his rule.{{sfn|Young|Turner|2013|pp=61–62}} By the early 1970s, Mobutu was attempting to assert Zaire as a leading African nation. He traveled frequently across the continent while the government became more vocal about African issues, particularly those relating to the southern region. Zaire established semi-clientelist relationships with several smaller African states, especially Burundi, Chad, and Togo.{{sfn|Young|Turner|2013|p=64}}

Corruption became so common the term "''le mal Zairois''" or "Zairian sickness",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cycad.com/cgi-bin/Aida/203/203_zaire.html |title="Zaire: The Hoax of Independence", The Aida Parker Newsletter #203, 4 August 1997 |publisher=cycad.com |access-date=4 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511093917/http://www.cycad.com/cgi-bin/Aida/203/203_zaire.html |archive-date=11 May 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> meaning gross corruption, theft and mismanagement, was coined, reportedly by Mobutu.{{sfn|Young|Turner|2013|p=74}} International aid, most often in the form of loans, enriched Mobutu while he allowed national infrastructure such as roads to deteriorate to as little as one-quarter of what had existed in 1960. Zaire became a [[kleptocracy]] as Mobutu and his associates embezzled government funds.

[[File:Prince Bernhard and Mobutu Sese Seko 1973.jpg|thumb|Mobutu with the Dutch [[Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld|Prince Bernhard]] in Kinshasa in 1973]]
In a campaign to identify himself with African nationalism, starting on 1 June 1966, Mobutu renamed the nation's cities: Léopoldville became Kinshasa (the country was known as Congo-Kinshasa), Stanleyville became [[Kisangani]], Elisabethville became [[Lubumbashi]], and Coquilhatville became [[Mbandaka]]. In 1971, Mobutu renamed the country the ''Republic of Zaire'',<ref name="kisanganibobb"/> its fourth name change in eleven years and its sixth overall. The Congo River was renamed the Zaire River.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Mobutu was invited to visit the United States on several occasions, meeting with U.S. Presidents [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref>Johns, Michael (29 June 1989) {{unfit|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20060721174238/http://www.heritage.org/Research/Africa/upload/91612_1.pdf "Zaire's Mobutu Visits America"]}}, Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum #239.<!-- date?? --></ref> Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] U.S. relations with Mobutu cooled, as he was no longer deemed necessary as a [[Cold War]] ally. Opponents within Zaire stepped up demands for reform. This atmosphere contributed to Mobutu's declaring the Third Republic in 1990, whose constitution was supposed to pave the way for democratic reform. The reforms turned out to be largely cosmetic. Mobutu continued in power until armed forces forced him to flee in 1997. "From 1990 to 1993, the United States facilitated Mobutu's attempts to hijack political change", one academic wrote, and "also assisted the rebellion of Laurent-Desire Kabila that overthrew the Mobutu regime."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icla.up.ac.za/images/country_reports/drc_country_report.pdf |title=The 2006 Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Congo |website=Icla.up.ac.za |access-date=23 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303225109/http://www.icla.up.ac.za/images/country_reports/drc_country_report.pdf |archive-date=3 March 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Continental and civil wars (1996–2007)===
{{Main|First Congo War|Second Congo War}}

[[File:Second Congo War Africa map en.png|thumb|Belligerents of the [[Second Congo War]]]]
By 1996, following the [[Rwandan Civil War]] and [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]] and the ascension of a [[Tutsi]]-led government in Rwanda, Rwandan [[Hutu]] militia forces ([[Interahamwe]]) fled to eastern Zaire and used refugee camps as bases for incursions against Rwanda. They allied with the Zairian Armed Forces to launch a campaign against Congolese ethnic Tutsis in eastern Zaire.<ref>Thom, William G.

A coalition of Rwandan and Ugandan armies invaded Zaire to overthrow the government of Mobutu, launching the First Congo War. The coalition allied with some opposition figures, led by [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], becoming the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]]. In 1997 Mobutu fled and Kabila marched into Kinshasa, naming himself as president and reverting the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.<ref>{{cite web |title=Capture of Zaire's capital complete – May 18, 1997 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9705/18/zaire/index.html |website=CNN |access-date=25 January 2022 |archive-date=8 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220408041331/http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9705/18/zaire/index.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Zaire Chooses Confusing New Name {{!}} The Spokesman-Review |url=https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1997/may/20/zaire-chooses-confusing-new-name/ |website=www.spokesman.com |date=20 May 1997 |access-date=25 January 2022 |archive-date=25 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220125131604/https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1997/may/20/zaire-chooses-confusing-new-name/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

Kabila later requested that foreign military forces return to their own countries. Rwandan troops retreated to [[Goma]] and launched a new Tutsi-led rebel military movement called the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy|Rassemblement Congolais pour la Democratie]] to fight Kabila, while Uganda instigated the creation of a rebel movement called the [[Movement for the Liberation of the Congo]], led by Congolese warlord [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The two rebel movements, along with Rwandan and Ugandan troops, started the Second Congo War by attacking the DRC army in 1998. Angolan, Zimbabwean, and Namibian militaries entered the hostilities on the side of the government.

Kabila was assassinated in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |author=Guardian Staff |title=Revealed: how Africa's dictator died at the hands of his boy soldiers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/11/theobserver |website=the Guardian |language=en |date=11 February 2001 |access-date=25 January 2022 |archive-date=9 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209051620/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/feb/11/theobserver |url-status=live}}</ref> His son [[Joseph Kabila]] succeeded him<ref>{{cite web |title=Kabila's son to be sworn in as president |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/19/4 |website=the Guardian |language=en |date=19 January 2001 |access-date=25 January 2022 |archive-date=25 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220125130720/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/19/4 |url-status=live}}</ref> and called for multilateral peace talks.
