The inter-war period heralded a new era of Polish politics. Whilst Polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until [[World War I]], a new political tradition was established in the country. Many exiled Polish activists, such as [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], who would later become prime minister, returned home. A significant number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures. Tragedy struck in 1922 when [[Gabriel Narutowicz]], inaugural holder of the presidency, was assassinated at the [[Zachęta]] Gallery in Warsaw by a painter and right-wing nationalist [[Eligiusz Niewiadomski]].<ref name="Bitter glory" />

In 1926, the [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]], led by the hero of the Polish independence campaign Marshal [[Józef Piłsudski]], turned rule of the Second Polish Republic over to the nonpartisan [[Sanacja]] (''Healing'') movement to prevent radical political organisations on both the left and the right from destabilising the country.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Robert Machray |date=November 1930 |title=Pilsudski, the Strong Man of Poland |journal=Current History |publisher=University of California Press |volume=33 |pages=195–199 |doi=10.1525/curh.1930.33.2.195 |jstor=45333442 |number=2}}</ref> By the late 1930s, due to increased threats posed by political extremism inside the country, the Polish government became increasingly heavy-handed, banning a number of radical organisations, including communist and ultra-nationalist political parties, which threatened the stability of the country.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Brian Porter-Szücs |title=Poland in the Modern World: Beyond Martyrdom |date=6 January 2014 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1-118-59808-5}}</ref>

World War II began with the [[Nazi German]] [[invasion of Poland]] on 1 September 1939, followed by the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] on 17 September. On 28 September 1939, [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|Warsaw fell]]. As agreed in the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], Poland was split into two zones, [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|one occupied by Nazi Germany]], the other by [[territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]]. In 1939–1941, the Soviets deported hundreds of thousands of Poles. The Soviet [[NKVD]] executed thousands of Polish prisoners of war (among other incidents in the [[Katyn massacre]]) ahead of [[Operation Barbarossa]].<ref name="BBC 2010" /> German planners had in November 1939 called for "the complete destruction of all Poles" and their fate as outlined in the genocidal ''[[Generalplan Ost]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Michael Geyer |url={{GBurl|id=IcB3oASHnkAC|p=152}} |title=Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-521-89796-9 |pages=152–153}}</ref>

At the insistence of [[Joseph Stalin]], the [[Yalta Conference]] sanctioned the formation of a new provisional pro-Communist coalition government in Moscow, which ignored the [[Polish government-in-exile]] based in London. This action angered many Poles who considered it a [[Yalta betrayal|betrayal]] by the Allies.<ref>The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica. "Yalta Conference".

Despite widespread objections, the new Polish government accepted the Soviet annexation of the pre-war eastern regions of Poland<ref name="Lane 1948" /> (in particular the cities of [[Wilno]] and [[Lwów]]) and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of [[Red Army]] units on Poland's territory. Military alignment within the [[Warsaw Pact]] throughout the [[Cold War]] came about as a direct result of this change in Poland's political culture. In the European scene, it came to characterise the full-fledged integration of Poland into the brotherhood of communist nations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Warsaw Pact: Definition, History, and Significance |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/warsaw-pact-4178983 |access-date=6 March 2022 |archive-date=31 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220531072214/https://www.thoughtco.com/warsaw-pact-4178983 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The new communist government took control with the adoption of the [[Small Constitution of 1947|Small Constitution]] on 19 February 1947. The [[Polish People's Republic]] (''Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa'') [[Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland|was officially proclaimed in 1952]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Constitutional history of Poland |url=https://constitutionnet.org/country/poland |access-date=2025-04-21 |website=ConstitutionNet |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite thesis |last=Lasok |first=Dominik |title=The Polish Constitutions of 1947 and 1952: a historical study in constitutional law |date=1954 |degree=phd |publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science |url=https://etheses.lse.ac.uk/112/ |language=en}}</ref> In 1956, after the death of [[Bolesław Bierut]], the régime of [[Władysław Gomułka]] became temporarily more liberal, freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms.

A similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under [[Edward Gierek]], but most of the time persecution of [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944–1989)|anti-communist opposition]] groups persisted.

Labour turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union "[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]" ("''Solidarność''"), which over time became a political force.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Staff |first=TIME |date=2020-03-05 |title=Anna Walentynowicz: 100 Women of the Year |url=https://time.com/5793658/anna-walentynowicz-100-women-of-the-year/ |access-date=2025-04-21 |magazine=TIME |language=en}}</ref> Despite persecution and imposition of [[Martial law in Poland|martial law in 1981]] by General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], it eroded the dominance of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] and by 1989 had triumphed in Poland's first [[Contract Sejm|partially free and democratic parliamentary elections]] since the end of the Second World War.
