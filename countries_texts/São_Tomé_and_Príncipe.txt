The islands making up São Tomé and Príncipe were formed approximately 30 million years ago due to volcanic activity in deep water along the [[Cameroon Line]]. Over time, interactions with seawater and periods of eruption have engendered a wide variety of different igneous and volcanic rocks on the islands with complex assemblages of [[mineral]]s.

=== Arrival of Europeans ===
The islands of São Tomé and Príncipe were uninhabited when the Portuguese arrived sometime around 1470.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Intro – Hapag-Lloyd |url=https://www.hapag-lloyd.com/en/services-information/offices-localinfo/africa/sao-tome/local-info/intro.html |access-date=2025-02-07 |website=www.hapag-lloyd.com}}</ref> The first Europeans to put ashore were [[João de Santarém]] and [[Pêro Escobar]]. Portuguese navigators explored the islands and decided that they would be good locations for bases to trade with the mainland.

The dates of European arrival are sometimes given as 21 December ([[Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas's Day]]) 1471, for São Tomé; and 17 January ([[Anthony the Great|St Antony's Day]]) 1472, for Príncipe, though other sources cite different years around that time. Príncipe was initially named ''Santo Antão'' ("Saint Anthony"), changing its name in 1502 to ''Ilha do Príncipe'' ("Prince's Island"), in reference to the Prince of Portugal to whom duties on the island's sugar crop were paid.

The first successful settlement of São Tomé was established in 1493 by [[Álvaro Caminha]], who received the land as a grant from the crown.<ref name="Bijela pčela">{{cite journal |last=Stojković |first=Dragan |date=November 2020 |title=Najmanje države na svijetu: Sv.

By 1515, São Tomé and Príncipe had become slave depots for the coastal slave trade centered at [[Elmina]].<ref name="Bakewell">{{cite book|author=Ivor Wilks and Akan Wangara|editor=Peter John Bakewell|title=Mines of Silver and Gold in the Americas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oBhmQgAACAAJ|date=January 1997|publisher=Variorum|isbn=978-0-86078-513-2|chapter=Portuguese in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries|location=Aldershot|page=24}}</ref>
The cultivation of sugar was a labour-intensive process and the Portuguese began to enslave large numbers of Africans from the continent. In the sugar boom's early stages, property on the islands had little value, with farming for local consumption while the economy relied mainly on the transit of slaves, though already many foodstuffs were imported.<ref name=":0">Caldeira, Arlindo Manuel.

==== Economic development in the 16th century ====
São Tomé would only become economically noteworthy with the introduction of a water-powered sugar mill in 1515, which soon led to the mass cultivation of sugar:<ref name=":1">Caldeira, Arlindo Manuel. "LEARNING THE ROPES IN THE TROPICS: SLAVERY AND THE PLANTATION SYSTEM ON THE ISLAND OF SÃO TOMÉ."

At this time, only two sugar mills are here and another three are being built, counting the mill of the contractors, which is large.

And the [sugar] canes are the biggest I have ever seen in my life."{{Citation needed|reason=who?|date=December 2022}} Sugar [[plantation]]s were organized with slave labor, and by the mid-16th century, the Portuguese settlers had turned the islands into Africa's foremost exporter of sugar.<ref>"As roças vâo em crescimento e os engenhos de açticaragora somente dois e fazem-se très com o dos tratadores [conassi há grande aparelho, assi de ribeiras como de lenha, par canas, as mais façanhosas que em minha vida vi": Letter from Segura to the monarch, 15 March 1517, in Antonio Brásio, édAfricana (hereinafter referred to as</ref>

The power dynamics of São Tomé in the 16th century were surprisingly diverse with the participation of free [[mulatto]][s] and black citizens in governance. Voluntary colonists shunned São Tomé for its disease and food shortages, so the Portuguese crown deported convicts to the island and encouraged interracial relationships to secure the colony. Slavery was also not permanent, as demonstrated through the 1515 royal decree granting the manumission of African wives of white settlers and their mixed-race children.<ref name=":4">SEIBERT, GERHARD.

At first, slavery in São Tomé was less strict. In the mid-16th century, an anonymous Portuguese pilot noted that the slaves were employed as couples, built their own accommodations, and worked autonomously once a week on the cultivation of their own food supply.<ref>For an English translation, see John William Blake, trans., ed., ''Europeans in West Africa, 1450–1560'' (London, 1942), 145ff.</ref> However, this more relaxed slave system did not last long following the introduction of plantations. Throughout, slaves frequently ran away to the inhospitable mountain forests of the island's interior.<ref name=":5">SEIBERT, GERHARD.

==== Slave rebellions ====
The first signs of slave rebellion began in the 1530s, when the maroon gangs organized to attack plantations, some of which were abandoned.<ref name=":6" /> A formal complaint was lodged by local Portuguese authorities in 1531 lamenting that too many settlers and black citizens were being killed in the attacks, and that the island would be lost if the problem remained unresolved.<ref name=":6" /> In a 1533 'bush war', a 'bush captain' led militia units to suppress the maroons.<ref name=":6" /> A significant event in the maroon fight for freedom occurred in 1549, when two men claiming to be free-born were taken in from the ''macambos ''by a wealthy mulatto planter named Ana de Chaves.<ref name=":6" /> With the support of de Chaves, the two men petitioned the king to be declared free, and the request was approved. The largest population of maroons coincided with the sugar boom of the mid-16th century, as the plantations teemed with slaves.<ref name=":6" /> Between 1587 and 1590, many of the runaway slaves were defeated in another bush war.<ref name=":7">SEIBERT, GERHARD. "São Tomé & Príncipe: The First Plantation Economy in the Tropics." In ''Commercial Agriculture, the Slave Trade and Slavery in Atlantic Africa'', edited by Law Robin, Schwarz Suzanne, and Strickrodt Silke, 65.

The greatest slave revolt occurred in July 1595, when the government was weakened by disputes between the bishop and the governor. A native slave named [[Rei Amador|Amador]] recruited 5,000 slaves to raid and destroy plantations, sugar mills, and settler houses.<ref name=":7" /> Amador's rebellion made three raids on the town and destroyed 60 of the island's 85 sugar mills, but they were defeated by the militia after three weeks.<ref name=":11">{{Cite news |date=2011-07-09 |title=Sao Tome and Principe country profile |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14093493 |access-date=2025-09-16 |work=BBC News |language=en-GB}}</ref> Two hundred slaves were killed in combat, and Amador and the other rebel leaders were executed,<ref name=":11" /> while the rest of the slaves were granted amnesty and returned to their plantation. Smaller slave rebellions followed in the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref name=":11" />

==== 18th, 19th and 20th centuries ====
Eventually, competition from sugar-producing colonies in the [[Western Hemisphere]] began to hurt the islands. The large enslaved population also proved difficult to control, with Portugal unable to invest many resources in the effort.{{citation needed|date=July 2024}} Sugar cultivation thus declined over the next 100 years, and by the mid-17th century, São Tomé had become primarily a transit point for ships engaged in the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] between continental Africa and the Americas.{{citation needed|date=July 2024}}

The ''roças'' system, which gave the plantation managers a high degree of authority, led to abuses against the African farm workers. Although Portugal officially abolished slavery in 1876, the practice of forced paid labour continued. ''[[Scientific American]]'' documented in words and pictures the continued use of slaves in São Tomé in its 13 March 1897 issue.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

Observations of the [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]] in Príncipe by Sir [[Arthur Eddington]] provided one of the first successful tests of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]].

In the early 20th century, an internationally publicized controversy arose over charges that [[Angola]]n contract workers were being subjected to forced labour and unsatisfactory working conditions. Sporadic labor unrest and dissatisfaction continued well into the 20th century, culminating in an outbreak of riots in 1953 in which several hundred African laborers were killed in a clash with their Portuguese rulers. The anniversary of this "[[Batepá Massacre]]" remains officially observed by the government.

By the late 1950s, when other emerging nations across the African continent demanded their independence, a small group of São Toméans formed the [[Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe]] (MLSTP), which eventually established its base in nearby [[Gabon]]. Picking up momentum in the 1960s, events moved quickly after the overthrow of the [[Marcelo Caetano|Caetano]] dictatorship in Portugal in April 1974.<ref>“Sao Tome and Principe Country Profile.” BBC News, BBC, 19 July 2023, www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14093493.</ref>

The new Portuguese regime was committed to the dissolution of its overseas colonies. In November 1974, its representatives met with the MLSTP in Algiers and worked out an agreement for the transfer of sovereignty. After a period of transitional government, São Tomé and Príncipe achieved independence on 12 July 1975, choosing as the first president the MLSTP Secretary General [[Manuel Pinto da Costa]].

In 1990, São Tomé became one of the first African countries to undergo [[Democratization|democratic reform]], and changes to the constitution—including the legalization of opposition political parties—led to elections in 1991 that were non-violent, free, and transparent. [[Miguel Trovoada]], a former prime minister who had been in exile since 1986, returned as an independent candidate and was elected president. Trovoada was re-elected in São Tomé's second multiparty presidential election in 1996.

The [[Democratic Convergence Party – Reflection Group|Party of Democratic Convergence]] won a majority of seats in the [[National Assembly of São Tomé and Príncipe|National Assembly]], with the MLSTP becoming an important and vocal minority party. Municipal elections followed in late 1992, in which the MLSTP won a majority of seats on five of seven regional councils. In early legislative elections in October 1994, the MLSTP won a plurality of seats in the assembly. It regained an outright majority of seats in the November 1998 elections.

===21st century===
In the 2001 presidential elections the candidate backed by the [[Independent Democratic Action]] party, [[Fradique de Menezes]], was elected in the first round and inaugurated on 3 September.<ref>{{cite news |title=stp004 Fradique de Menezes new president on Sao Tomé |url=http://www.afrol.com/News2001/stp004_menezes_pres.htm |work=www.afrol.com |access-date=8 June 2023 |archive-date=30 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930180955/http://www.afrol.com/News2001/stp004_menezes_pres.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Parliamentary elections were held in March 2002.
