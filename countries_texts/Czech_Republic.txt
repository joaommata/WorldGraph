The [[Duchy of Bohemia]] emerged in the late 9th century when it was unified by the [[Přemyslid dynasty]].

After a series of dynastic wars, the [[House of Luxembourg]] gained the Bohemian throne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panovnici.cz/vaclav-II-kral|title=Václav II. český král|work=panovnici.cz|access-date=31 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907142314/http://www.panovnici.cz/vaclav-II-kral|archive-date=7 September 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Efforts for a [[Bohemian Reformation|reform of the church in Bohemia]] started already in the late 14th century. [[Jan Hus]]' followers seceded from some practices of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Church]] and in the [[Hussite Wars]] (1419–1434) defeated five crusades organized against them by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]]. During the next two centuries, 90% of the population in Bohemia and Moravia were considered [[Hussites]]. The pacifist thinker [[Petr Chelčický]] inspired the movement of the [[Unity of the Brethren (Czech Republic)|Moravian Brethren]] (by the middle of the 15th century) that completely separated from the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luther2017.de/en/reformation/and-its-people/jan-hus/|title=Mentor and precursor of the Reformation|access-date=29 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404211907/http://www.luther2017.de/en/reformation/and-its-people/jan-hus/|archive-date=4 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 21 December 1421, [[Jan Žižka]], a successful military commander and mercenary, led his group of forces in the [[Battle of Kutná Hora]], resulting in a victory for the Hussites. He is honoured to this day as a [[Hero (title)|national hero]].

After 1526, Bohemia came increasingly under [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] control as the Habsburgs became first the elected and then in 1627 the hereditary rulers of Bohemia. Between 1583 and 1611 Prague was the official seat of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] and his court.

The [[Defenestrations of Prague|Defenestration of Prague]] and subsequent revolt against the Habsburgs in 1618 marked the start of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. In 1620, the rebellion in Bohemia was crushed at the [[Battle of White Mountain]] and the ties between Bohemia and the Habsburgs' hereditary lands in Austria were strengthened. The leaders of the [[Bohemian Revolt]] were [[Old Town Square execution|executed in 1621]]. The nobility and the middle class Protestants had to either convert to Catholicism or leave the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Protestantism in Bohemia and Moravia (Czech Republic)|url=http://www.museeprotestant.org/en/notice/protestantism-in-the-republic-of-czechoslovakia/|website=Virtual Museum of Protestantism|access-date=25 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015211407/http://www.museeprotestant.org/en/notice/protestantism-in-the-republic-of-czechoslovakia/|archive-date=15 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The following era of 1620 to the late 18th century became known as the "Dark Age". During the Thirty Years' War, the population of the [[Czech lands]] declined by a third through the expulsion of Czech Protestants as well as due to the war, disease and [[Famines in the Czech lands|famine]].<ref>Oskar Krejčí, Martin C.

It seemed that some concessions would be made also to Bohemia, but in the end, the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] affected a compromise with Hungary only. The [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] and the never realized coronation of Franz Joseph as King of Bohemia led to a disappointment of some Czech politicians.<ref name="auto" /> The Bohemian Crown lands became part of the so-called [[Cisleithania]].

In November 1989, Czechoslovakia again became a liberal democracy through the [[Velvet Revolution]]. However, Slovak national aspirations strengthened ([[Hyphen War]]) and on 31 December 1992, the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|country peacefully split]] into the independent [[country|countries]] of the Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]]. Both countries went through economic reforms and [[privatization]]s, with the intention of creating a [[market economy]], as they have been trying to do since 1990, when Czechs and Slovaks still shared the common state. This process was largely successful; in 2006 the Czech Republic was recognized by the World Bank as a "developed country",<ref name="worldbank06">{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/76314|title=World Bank Marks Czech Republic's Graduation to 'Developed' Status|last=Velinger|first=Jan|date=28 February 2006|publisher=Radio Prague|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112081601/http://www.radio.cz/en/article/76314|archive-date=12 January 2008|url-status=live|access-date=22 January 2007}}</ref> and in 2009 the [[Human Development Index]] ranked it as a nation of "Very High Human Development".<ref name="hdi09">{{cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2009_EN_Complete.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2009 |work=UNDP.org |date=January 2009 |access-date=25 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122115116/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2009_EN_Complete.pdf |archive-date=22 November 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>
