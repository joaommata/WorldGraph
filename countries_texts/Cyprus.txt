During the Late [[Bronze Age]], from around 1650 BC Cyprus (identified in whole or part as [[Alashiya]] in contemporary texts) became more connected to the wider Mediterranean world driven by the trade in [[copper]] extracted from the Troodos Mountains, which stimulated the development of urbanised settlements across the island, with records suggesting that Cyprus at this time was ruled by "kings" who corresponded with the leaders of other Mediterranean states (like the [[pharaoh]]s of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], as documented in the [[Amarna letters]]).<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Knapp |first1=A.

When the [[Roman Empire]] was divided into Eastern and Western parts in 286, Cyprus became part of the East Roman Empire (also called the [[Byzantine Empire]]); the island would remain part of the empire for some 900 years. Under Byzantine rule, the Greek orientation that had been prominent since antiquity developed the strong Hellenistic-Christian character that continues to be a hallmark of the Greek Cypriot community.<ref name="Keefe 1993">{{Country study |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress |country=Cyprus |abbr=cy |title=Cyprus: A Country Study |url= https://www.loc.gov/item/92036090/ |edition=Fourth |editor-last=Solsten |editor-first=Eric |year=1993 |isbn=0-8444-0752-6 |last1=Keefe |first1=Eugene K. |last2=Solsten |first2=Eric |chapter=Historical Setting |pages=10–12}}</ref>

Beginning in 649, Cyprus endured repeated attacks and raids launched by [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. Many were quick raids, but others were large-scale attacks in which many Cypriots were killed and great wealth carried off or destroyed.<ref name="Keefe 1993"/> The city of [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]] was destroyed and never rebuilt.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/> Byzantine control remained stronger in the northern coast, the Arabs exerted more influence in the south. In 688, Emperor [[Justinian II|Justinian&nbsp;II]] and Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] signed a treaty whereby Cyprus would be paying an equal amount of tribute to the Caliphate and tax to the Empire, but would remain politically neutral to both while being retained as a province administered by the Empire. There are no Byzantine churches which survive from this period, and the island entered a period of impoverishment.<ref>{{cite book |first=David Michael |author-link=Michael Metcalf |last=Metcalf |title=Byzantine Cyprus, 491–1191 |publisher=Cyprus Research Centre |year=2009|pages=32–33; 427–421}}</ref> Full Byzantine rule was restored in 965, when Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros&nbsp;II Phokas]] scored decisive victories on land and sea.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" />

In 1156 [[Raynald of Châtillon]] and [[Thoros II|Thoros II of Armenia]] brutally sacked Cyprus over a period of three weeks, stealing so much plunder and capturing so many of the leading citizens and their families for ransom, that the island took generations to recover. Several Greek priests were mutilated and sent away to Constantinople.<ref>Norwich, J. J. (1995) ''Byzantium: The Decline and Fall''. London: Viking, p. 121</ref>

In 1185 [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]], a member of the Byzantine imperial family, took over Cyprus and declared it independent of the Empire.

A year later Richard sold the island to the [[Knights Templar]], who, following a bloody revolt, in turn sold it to [[Guy of Lusignan]]. His brother and successor [[Aimery of Cyprus|Aimery]] was recognised as [[Kingdom of Cyprus|King of Cyprus]] by [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]].<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" />

Following the death in 1473 of [[James II of Cyprus|James&nbsp;II]], the last Lusignan king, the [[Republic of Venice]] assumed control of the island, while the late king's Venetian widow, Queen [[Catherine Cornaro]], reigned as figurehead. Venice formally annexed the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] in 1489, following the abdication of Catherine.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /> The Venetians fortified [[Nicosia]] by building the [[Walls of Nicosia]], and used it as an important commercial hub.

Although the Lusignan French aristocracy remained the dominant social class in Cyprus throughout the medieval period, the former assumption that Greeks were treated only as serfs on the island<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /> is no longer considered by academics to be accurate.

In a reversal from the days of Latin rule, the head of the [[Church of Cyprus]] was invested as leader of the Greek Cypriot population and acted as mediator between Christian Greek Cypriots and the Ottoman authorities.

In the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] and the [[Congress of Berlin]], Cyprus was [[Cyprus Convention|leased]] to the [[British Empire]] which de facto took over its administration in 1878 (though, in terms of sovereignty, Cyprus remained a ''[[de jure]]'' Ottoman territory until 5 November 1914, together with [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt and Sudan]])<ref name="Lausanne"/> in exchange for guarantees that Britain would use the island as a base to protect the Ottoman Empire against possible Russian aggression.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" />

[[File:Cypriot demonstration 1930.jpg|thumb|[[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] demonstrations for [[Enosis]] (union with Greece) in 1930]]
The island would serve Britain as a key military base for its colonial routes. By 1906, when the Famagusta harbour was completed, Cyprus was a strategic naval outpost overlooking the [[Suez Canal]], the crucial main route to India which was then Britain's most important overseas possession. Following the outbreak of the [[First World War]] and the decision of the Ottoman Empire to join the war on the side of the [[Central Powers]], on 5 November 1914 the British Empire formally annexed Cyprus and declared the Ottoman ''[[Khedive|Khedivate]]'' of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt and Sudan]] a [[Sultanate of Egypt|''Sultanate'' and British protectorate]].<ref name="Lausanne"/><ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

In October 1915, Britain offered Cyprus to Greece, ruled by King [[Constantine I of Greece]], on the condition that Greece join the war on the side of the British and went to [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]’s assistance, in order to fulfill her Treaty obligations under the [[Greek–Serbian Alliance of 1913|Serbo-Greek pact]] of May 1913.<ref name=Stavridis>Stavridis, Stavros Terry (31 July 1993),

The Greek Cypriot population, meanwhile, had become hopeful that the British administration would lead to ''enosis''. The idea of ''enosis'' was historically part of the ''[[Megali Idea]]'', a greater political ambition of a Greek state encompassing the territories with large Greek populations in the former Ottoman Empire, including Cyprus and [[Asia Minor]] with a capital in [[Constantinople]], and was actively pursued by the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]], which had its members educated in Greece. These religious officials, together with Greek military officers and professionals, some of whom still pursued the ''Megali Idea'', would later found the guerrilla organisation [[EOKA]] ''(Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston'' or National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ker-Lindsay |first1=James |title=The Cyprus Problem: What Everyone Needs to Know |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-975716-9 |pages=14–5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTL382g5sWwC |quote=They hoped that the transfer of administration would pave the way for the island to be united with Greece—an aspiration known as 'enosis.'

Upon realising that the fact that the Turkish Cypriot population was only 20% of the islanders made annexation unfeasible, the national policy was changed to favour partition. The slogan "Partition or Death" was frequently used in Turkish Cypriot and Turkish protests starting in the late 1950s and continuing throughout the 1960s. Although after the Zürich and London conferences Turkey seemed to accept the existence of the Cypriot state and to distance itself from its policy of favouring the partition of the island, the goal of the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot leaders remained that of creating an independent Turkish state in the northern part of the island.<ref>{{cite book |author=Behlul (Behlul) Ozkan (Ozkan) |title=From the Abode of Islam to the Turkish Vatan: The Making of a National Homeland in Turkey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kCArlsRcHUMC&pg=PA199 |date=26 June 2012 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-18351-1 |page=199 |quote=In line with the nationalist rhetoric that "Cyprus is Turkish", Menderes predicated his declaration upon the geographic proximity between Cyprus and Anatolia, thereby defining "Cyprus as an extension of Anatolia".
