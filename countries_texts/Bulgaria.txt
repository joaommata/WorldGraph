Byzantine domestic policies changed after Basil's death and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, [[Bulgarian uprising against the Byzantine Empire (1040–1041)|the largest]] being led by [[Peter Delyan]]. The empire's authority declined after a catastrophic military [[Battle of Manzikert|defeat at Manzikert]] against [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] invaders, and was further disturbed by the [[Crusades]]. This prevented Byzantine attempts at [[Hellenisation]] and created fertile ground for further revolt.
