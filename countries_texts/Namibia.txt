{{Main|History of Namibia}}

===Etymology===
The name of the country is derived from the [[Namib]] desert, the oldest desert in the world.<ref name=at1315>Spriggs, A. (2001) {{WWF ecoregion|name=Africa: Namibia|id=at1315}}</ref> The word ''Namib'' itself is of [[Khoikhoi language|Khoi]] origin and means "vast place". The name was chosen by [[Mburumba Kerina]], who originally proposed "Republic of Namib".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.namibian.com.na/127811/archive-read/The-Man-Who-Named-Namibia--Mburumba-Kerina|title=The Man Who Named Namibia- Mburumba Kerina|work=The Namibian|access-date=15 June 2021|archive-date=15 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210615171358/https://www.namibian.com.na/127811/archive-read/The-Man-Who-Named-Namibia--Mburumba-Kerina|url-status=live}}</ref> Before Namibia became independent in 1990, its territory was known first as [[German South-West Africa]] (''Deutsch-Südwestafrika''), and then as [[South West Africa]], reflecting its colonial occupation by Germans and South Africans, respectively.

===Pre-colonial period===
The dry lands of Namibia have been inhabited since prehistoric times by the [[San people|San]], [[Damara people|Damara]], and [[Nama people|Nama]]. For thousands of years, the [[Khoisan]] peoples of Southern Africa maintained a [[nomad]]ic life, the [[Khoikhoi]] as pastoralists and the San people as [[hunter-gatherer]]s. Around the 14th century, immigrating [[Bantu people]] began to arrive during the [[Bantu expansion]] from central Africa.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Belda|first=Pascal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcsUr8BkqAUC&q=The+dry+lands+of+Namibia+have+been+inhabited+since+early+times+by+San,+Damara,+and+Nama.+Around+the+14th+century,+immigrating+Bantu+people+began+to+arrive+during+the+Bantu+expansion+from+central+Africa.&pg=PA14|title=Namibia|date=May 2007|publisher=MTH Multimedia S.L.|isbn=978-84-935202-1-2|access-date=19 October 2020|archive-date=18 May 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240518174457/https://books.google.com/books?id=NcsUr8BkqAUC&q=The+dry+lands+of+Namibia+have+been+inhabited+since+early+times+by+San,+Damara,+and+Nama.+Around+the+14th+century,+immigrating+Bantu+people+began+to+arrive+during+the+Bantu+expansion+from+central+Africa.&pg=PA14#v=snippet&q=The%20dry%20lands%20of%20Namibia%20have%20been%20inhabited%20since%20early%20times%20by%20San%2C%20Damara%2C%20and%20Nama.%20Around%20the%2014th%20century%2C%20immigrating%20Bantu%20people%20began%20to%20arrive%20during%20the%20Bantu%20expansion%20from%20central%20Africa.&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref>

From the late 18th century onward, [[Oorlam people]] from Cape Colony crossed the [[Orange River]] and moved into the area that today is southern Namibia.<ref name="KDA">{{cite web|url=http://www.klausdierks.com/Biographies/Biographies_A.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015021238/http://www.klausdierks.com/Biographies/Biographies_A.htm|archive-date=15 October 2008|last=Dierks|first=Klaus|author-link=Klaus Dierks|title=Biographies of Namibian Personalities, A|access-date=24 June 2010}}</ref> Their encounters with the nomadic Nama tribes were largely peaceful.

The Nama-Herero War broke out in 1880, with hostilities ebbing only after the [[German Empire]] deployed troops to the contested places and cemented the status quo among the Nama, Oorlam, and Herero.{{sfn|Vedder|1997|p=659}}

In 1878, the [[Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]], then a British colony, annexed the port of Walvis Bay and the offshore [[Penguin Islands]]; these became an integral part of the new [[Union of South Africa]] at its creation in 1910.

The first Europeans to disembark and explore the region were the Portuguese navigators [[Diogo Cão]] in 1485<ref>{{Cite web|last=Observador|title=Padrão português com 500 anos foi roubado da Namíbia no século XIX.

Like most of the interior of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], Namibia was not extensively explored by Europeans until the 19th century. At that time traders and settlers came principally from Germany and Sweden. In 1870, [[Finland|Finnish]] missionaries came to the northern part of Namibia to spread the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran religion]] among the [[Owambo people|Owambo]] and [[Kavango people]].<ref name="finnish-mission"/> In the late 19th century, [[Dorsland Trek]]kers crossed the area on their way from the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] to Angola. Some of them settled in Namibia instead of continuing their journey.

Namibia became a German colony in 1884 under [[Otto von Bismarck]] to forestall perceived British encroachment and was known as [[German South West Africa]] (''Deutsch-Südwestafrika'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=German South West Africa|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9036573/German-South-West-Africa|access-date=15 April 2008|archive-date=11 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411130059/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9036573/German-South-West-Africa|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Palgrave Commission]] by the British governor in [[Cape Town]] determined that only the natural deep-water harbour of Walvis Bay was worth occupying and thus annexed it to the Cape province of British South Africa.

In 1897, a [[1890s African rinderpest epizootic|rinderpest epidemic]] caused massive cattle die-offs of an estimated 95% of cattle in southern and central Namibia.

From 1904 to 1907, the [[Herero people|Herero]] and the [[Nama people|Nama]] [[Herero Wars|took up arms]] against ruthless German settlers. In a calculated punitive action by the German settlers, [[Government of Namibia|government]] officials ordered the extinction of the natives in the OvaHerero and Nama genocide.

The actual number of deaths in the limited number of battles with the German Schutztruppe (expeditionary force) were limited; most of the casualties occurred after the fighting had ended. The German military governor [[Lothar von Trotha]] issued a punitive order. Many Herero died of disease and abuse in detention camps after being expelled. A substantial minority of Herero crossed the Kalahari desert into the British colony of Bechuanaland (modern-day Botswana), where a small community continues to live in western Botswana near to the border with Namibia. ''Let us die fighting'', originally published (1966) under the title ''Südwestafrika unter deutscher Kolonialherrschaft''. Berlin: Akademie-Verlag.</ref><ref name="Adhikari" /> The survivors, when finally released from detention, were subjected to a policy of dispossession, deportation, forced labour, racial segregation, and discrimination in a system that in many ways foreshadowed the [[apartheid]] established by South Africa in 1948. Most Africans were confined to so-called native territories, which under South African rule after 1949 were turned into "homelands" ([[Bantustans]]).

Some historians have speculated that the downfall of the Herero in Namibia was a model for the [[Nazism|Nazi]]s in [[the Holocaust]].<ref name="Madley" /> The memory of what happened under German rule has contributed to shape the ethnic identity in independent Namibia and has kept its significance in today's relations with Germany.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Reinhart|last1=Kößler|first2=Henning|last2=Melber|chapter=Völkermord und Gedenken: Der Genozid an den Herero und Nama in Deutsch-Südwestafrika 1904–1908|language=de|trans-title=Genocide and memory: the genocide of the Herero and Nama in German South-West Africa, 1904–08|title=Jahrbuch zur Geschichte und Wirkung des Holocaust|year=2004|pages=37–75|publisher=Campus Verlag|isbn=978-3-593-37282-2|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_b5iRhydlHUC&pg=PA37|access-date=7 June 2023|archive-date=23 July 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230723080753/https://books.google.com/books?id=_b5iRhydlHUC&pg=PA37|url-status=live}}</ref>

As a result of the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|Conference on International Organization]] in 1945, the League of Nations was formally superseded by the [[United Nations]] (UN) and former League mandates by a trusteeship system.

The Namibian Constitution was adopted in February 1990.

===After independence===
Since independence Namibia has completed the transition from white minority apartheid rule to parliamentary democracy. [[Multiparty democracy]] was introduced and has been maintained, with local, regional and [[Elections in Namibia|national elections]] held regularly. Several registered political parties are active and represented in the National Assembly, although the [[SWAPO]] has won every election since independence.<ref>{{cite web|title=Country report: Spotlight on Namibia|publisher=[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Secretariat|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/news/34580/34581/224187/250510spotlightonnamibia.htm|date=25 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705012456/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/news/34580/34581/224187/250510spotlightonnamibia.htm|archive-date=5 July 2010}}</ref> The transition from the 15-year rule of President [[Sam Nujoma|Nujoma]] to his successor [[Hifikepunye Pohamba]] in 2005 went smoothly.<ref name="IRIN">{{cite news|title=IRIN country profile Namibia|agency=[[The New Humanitarian|IRIN]]|url=http://www.irinnews.org/country.aspx?CountryCode=NA&RegionCode=SAF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217173041/http://www.irinnews.org/country.aspx?CountryCode=NA&RegionCode=SAF|archive-date=17 February 2010|access-date=12 July 2010|date=March 2007}}</ref>

Since independence, the Namibian government has promoted a policy of national reconciliation. It issued an amnesty for those who fought on either side during the liberation war. The civil war in Angola spilled over and adversely affected Namibians living in the north of the country. In 1998, [[Namibia Defence Force]] (NDF) troops were sent to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] as part of a [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) contingent. In 1999, the national government quashed a secessionist attempt in the northeastern [[Caprivi Strip]].<ref name="IRIN"/> The [[Caprivi conflict]] was initiated by the [[Caprivi Liberation Army]] (CLA), a [[Rebellion|rebel]] group led by [[Mishake Muyongo]].
