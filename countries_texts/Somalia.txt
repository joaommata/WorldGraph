In the [[Classical antiquity|classical era]], the [[Macrobians]], who may have been ancestral to Somalis, established a powerful  kingdom that ruled large parts of modern Somalia. They were reputed for their longevity and wealth, and were said to be the "tallest and handsomest of all men".<ref name="Wheeler pg 526">[https://archive.org/stream/geographyofherod00whee/geographyofherod00whee_djvu.txt The Geography of Herodotus: Illustrated from Modern Researches and Discoveries] by James Talboys Wheeler, pg 1xvi, 315, 526</ref> The Macrobians were warrior herders and seafarers. According to Herodotus' account, the [[Persian Emperor]] [[Cambyses II]], upon his [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|conquest of Egypt]] in 525 BC, sent ambassadors to Macrobia, bringing luxury gifts for the Macrobian king to entice his submission. The Macrobian ruler, who was elected based on his stature and beauty, replied instead with a challenge for his Persian counterpart in the form of an unstrung bow: if the Persians could manage to draw it, they would have the right to invade his country; but until then, they should thank the gods that the Macrobians never decided to invade their empire.<ref name="Wheeler pg 526" /><ref name="Kitto2">John Kitto, James Taylor, ''The popular cyclopædia of Biblical literature: condensed from the larger work'', (Gould and Lincoln: 1856), p. 302.</ref> The Macrobians were a regional power reputed for their advanced architecture and [[gold]] wealth, which was so plentiful that they shackled their prisoners in golden chains.<ref name="Kitto2" />

During the classical period, the [[Barbaria (region)|Barbara]] city-states of [[Mosylon]], [[Opone]], [[Heis (town)|Mundus]], [[Bulhar|Isis]], [[Malao]], [[Zeila|Avalites]], [[Essina]], [[Nikon (Somalia)|Nikon]] and [[Sarapion]] developed a lucrative trade network, connecting with merchants from [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian Persia]], [[Sabaeans|Saba]], the [[Nabataean Kingdom]], and the [[Roman Empire]]. They used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as the ''[[beden]]'' to transport their cargo.
[[File:Beden.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Beden]] is a fast, ancient Somali single or double-masted maritime ship.]]
After the [[Nabatea#Roman annexation|Roman conquest of the Nabataean Empire]] and the Roman naval presence at [[Aden]] to curb piracy, Arab and Somali merchants agreed with the Romans to bar Indian ships from trading in the free port cities of the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian peninsula]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Warmington|1995|p=54}}.</ref> to protect the interests of Somali and Arab merchants in the lucrative commerce between the Red and Mediterranean Seas.<ref name="EHW">{{Harvnb|Warmington|1995|p=229}}.</ref> However, Indian merchants continued to trade in the port cities of the Somali peninsula, which was free from Roman interference.<ref>{{Harvnb|Warmington|1995|p=187}}.</ref> For centuries, Indian merchants brought large quantities of cinnamon to Somalia and Arabia from [[Ceylon]] and the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. The source of the cinnamon and other spices is said to have been the best-kept secret of Arab and Somali merchants in their trade with the Roman and Greek world; the Romans and Greeks believed the source to have been the Somali peninsula.<ref>{{Harvnb|Warmington|1995|pp=185–186}}.</ref> The collusive agreement among Somali and Arab traders inflated the price of Indian and Chinese cinnamon in North Africa, the Near East, and Europe, and made the cinnamon trade a very profitable revenue generator, especially for the Somali merchants.<ref name="EHW" />

Sultan [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]], the third Sultan of the House of Gobroon, started the golden age of the Gobroon Dynasty. His army came out victorious during the Bardheere Jihad, which restored stability in the region and revitalised the East African [[ivory trade]]. He also had cordial relations and received gifts from the rulers of neighbouring and distant kingdoms such as the Omani, [[Wituland|Witu]] and Yemeni Sultans.

Sultan Ibrahim's son [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]] succeeded him as one of the most important figures in 19th-century East Africa, receiving tribute from Omani governors and creating alliances with important Muslim families on the East African coast.

The dawn of [[fascism]] in the early 1920s heralded a change of strategy for Italy, as the north-eastern sultanates were soon to be forced within the boundaries of ''La Grande Somalia'' ("''[[Greater Somalia]]''") according to the plan of Fascist Italy. With the arrival of Governor [[Cesare Maria De Vecchi]] on 15 December 1923, things began to change for that part of Somaliland known as [[Italian Somaliland]].

A British force, including troops from several African countries, launched the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|campaign in January 1941]] from Kenya to liberate British Somaliland and Italian-occupied Ethiopia and conquer Italian Somaliland. By February most of Italian Somaliland was captured and, in March, British Somaliland was retaken from the sea. The forces of the British Empire operating in Somaliland comprised the three divisions of South African, West African, and East African troops. They were assisted by Somali forces led by Abdulahi Hassan with Somalis of the [[Isaaq]], [[Dhulbahante]], and [[Warsangali]] clans prominently participating. The number of [[Italian Somalis]] began to decline after World War II, with fewer than 10,000 remaining in 1960.<ref name="Tripodi1999" />

Following World War II, Britain retained control of both [[British Somaliland]] and Italian Somaliland as protectorates. In 1945, during the [[Potsdam Conference]], the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland as the [[Trust Territory of Somaliland]], on the condition first proposed by the Somali Youth League (SYL) and other nascent Somali political organisations, such as Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali (HDMS) and the Somali National League (SNL)—that Somalia achieve independence within ten years.<ref name="Zolberg">{{Harvnb|Zolberg|Suhrke|Aguayo|1989|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B9_yS_ynvzgC&pg=PA106 106]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Kwame Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Africana: the encyclopedia of the African and African American experience: the concise desk reference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cereWkyNJckC|date= 2003|publisher=Running Press|isbn=978-0-7624-1642-4|page=1749|access-date=20 June 2015|archive-date=23 January 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230123105443/https://books.google.com/books?id=cereWkyNJckC|url-status=live}}</ref> British Somaliland remained a protectorate of Britain until 1960.<ref name="Tripodi1999">{{cite book|author=Paolo Tripodi|title=The Colonial Legacy in Somalia: Rome and Mogadishu: From Colonial Administration to Operation Restore Hope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJR3RAAACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan Press|isbn=978-0-312-22393-9|page=68|access-date=20 June 2015|archive-date=23 January 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230123105442/https://books.google.com/books?id=eJR3RAAACAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref>

To the extent that [[Italy]] held the territory by UN mandate, the trusteeship provisions gave the Somalis the opportunity to gain experience in Western political education and self-government. These were advantages that British Somaliland, which was to be incorporated into the new Somali state, did not have. Although in the 1950s British colonial officials attempted, through various administrative development efforts, to make up for past neglect, the protectorate stagnated in political administrative development. The disparity between the two territories in economic development and political experience would later cause serious difficulties integrating the two parts.<ref>[[Helen Chapin Metz]], ed.

A [[French Somaliland overseas territory referendum, 1958|referendum]] was held in neighbouring [[Djibouti]] (then known as [[French Somaliland]]) in 1958, on the eve of Somalia's independence in 1960, to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France.

Alongside Barre, the SRC that assumed power after President Sharmarke's assassination was led by Brigadier General [[Mohamed Ainanshe Guled]], Lieutenant Colonel [[Salaad Gabeyre Kediye]] and Chief of Police [[Jama Ali Korshel|Jama Korshel]].

The revolutionary government established large-scale public works programs and successfully implemented an urban and rural [[literacy]] campaign, which helped dramatically increase the literacy rate. The Somali Democratic Republic achieved a literacy rate of 70%, one of the highest in Africa at the time.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Irving |first=Kaplan |title=Area Handbook for Somalia |volume= 550 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |year=1977 |page=116 |language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Chijioke Njoku |first=Raphael |title=The History of Somalia |date=20 February 2013 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9780313378584 |page=111 |language=English}}</ref>

In addition to a nationalisation program of industry and land, the new regime's foreign policy placed an emphasis on Somalia's traditional and religious links with the [[Arab world]], eventually joining the [[Arab League]] in February 1974.<ref>Benjamin Frankel (1992) ''The Cold War, 1945–1991: Leaders and other important figures in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, and the Third World'', Gale Research, p. 306 {{ISBN|0-8103-8928-2}}.</ref> That same year, Barre also served as chairman of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), the predecessor of the [[African Union]] (AU).<ref>Oihe Yang (2000) ''Africa South of the Sahara 2001'', 30th ed., Taylor and Francis, p. 1025 {{ISBN|1-85743-078-6}}.</ref>

In July 1976, Barre's SRC disbanded itself and established in its place the [[Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party]] (SRSP), a one-party government based on [[scientific socialism]] and Islamic tenets. The SRSP was an attempt to reconcile the official state ideology with the official state religion by [[Revisionism (Marxism)|adapting Marxist precepts]] to local circumstances. Emphasis was placed on the Muslim principles of social progress, equality and justice, which the government argued formed the core of scientific socialism and its own accent on self-sufficiency, public participation and popular control, as well as direct ownership of the means of production. While the SRSP encouraged private investment on a limited scale, the administration's overall direction was essentially [[Communism|communist]].<ref name="Pjdlfw" />

In July 1977, the [[Ogaden War]] broke out after Barre's government used a plea for national unity to justify an [[War of aggression|aggressive]] incorporation of the predominantly Somali-inhabited [[Ogaden]] region of Ethiopia into a Pan-Somali [[Greater Somalia]], along with the rich agricultural lands of south-eastern Ethiopia, infrastructure, and strategically important areas as far north as Djibouti.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gebru Tareke|2009|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dRIfYPTZxJsC&pg=PA182 182–186]}}. The areas concerned amount to about a third of Ethiopia.</ref> In the first week of the conflict, Somali armed forces took southern and central Ogaden and for most of the war, the Somali army scored continuous victories on the Ethiopian army and followed them as far as [[Sidamo Province|Sidamo]]. By September 1977, Somalia controlled 90% of the Ogaden and captured strategic cities such as [[Jijiga]] and put heavy pressure on [[Dire Dawa]], threatening the train route from the latter city to Djibouti. After the siege of Harar, a massive unprecedented Soviet intervention consisting of 20,000 [[Cuba]]n forces and several thousand Soviet experts came to the aid of Ethiopia's communist [[Derg]] regime. By 1978, the Somali troops were ultimately pushed out of the Ogaden. This shift in support by the Soviet Union motivated the Barre government to seek allies elsewhere. It eventually settled on the Soviets' [[Cold War]] arch-rival, the [[United States]], which had been courting the Somali government for some time. Somalia's initial friendship with the Soviet Union and later partnership with the United States enabled it to build the largest army in Africa.<ref name="Ramsbotham 222">{{cite book |author=Oliver Ramsbotham |author2=Tom Woodhouse |year=1999 |title=Encyclopedia of international peacekeeping operations |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofin0000rams |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofin0000rams/page/222 222] |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=0-87436-892-8}}</ref>[[File:Muhammad Siad Barre - 40866X9X9.jpg|thumb|Major General [[Mohamed Siad Barre]], Chairman of the [[Supreme Revolutionary Council (Somalia)|Supreme Revolutionary Council]], meeting with President of Romania [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]]]A new constitution was promulgated in 1979 under which elections for a People's Assembly were held.

Many Somalis had become disillusioned with life under military dictatorship.

The regime was weakened further in the 1980s as the Cold War drew to a close and Somalia's strategic importance was diminished. The government became increasingly [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]], and [[resistance movement]]s, encouraged by Ethiopia, sprang up across the country, eventually leading to the [[Somali Civil War]]. Among the militia groups were the [[Somali Salvation Democratic Front]] (SSDF), [[United Somali Congress]] (USC), [[Somali National Movement]] (SNM) and the [[Somali Patriotic Movement]] (SPM), together with the non-violent political oppositions of the [[Somali Democratic Movement]] (SDM), the [[Factions in the Somali Civil War#Somali Democratic Alliance (SDA)|Somali Democratic Alliance]] (SDA) and the Somali Manifesto Group (SMG).

As the [[moral authority]] of Barre's government was gradually eroded, many Somalis became disillusioned with life under military rule. By the mid-1980s, resistance movements supported by Ethiopia's communist [[Derg]] administration had sprung up across the country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerrillas, especially in the northern regions. The clampdown included bombing of cities, with the northwestern administrative centre of [[Hargeisa]], a [[Somali National Movement]] (SNM) stronghold, among the targeted areas in 1988.<ref name="Locsg">{{cite web|title=Somalia&nbsp;— Government|url=http://countrystudies.us/somalia/65.htm|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=15 February 2014|archive-date=4 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704043353/http://countrystudies.us/somalia/65.htm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sites.tufts.edu/reinventingpeace/2013/10/22/state-sponsored-violence-and-conflict-under-mahamed-siyad-barre-the-emergence-of-path-dependent-patterns-of-violence/ |title=State-sponsored violence and conflict under Mahamed Siyad Barre: the emergence of path dependent patterns of violence |last1=Compagnon |first1=Daniel |date=22 October 2013 |publisher=[[World Peace Foundation]], [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] |access-date=7 October 2014 |archive-date=2 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231002022805/https://sites.tufts.edu/reinventingpeace/2013/10/22/state-sponsored-violence-and-conflict-under-mahamed-siyad-barre-the-emergence-of-path-dependent-patterns-of-violence/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The clampdown initiated by [[Siad Barre|Barre]]'s government extended its reach beyond the initial bombings in the north to encompass various regions across the country. This reproduction of aggressive strategies aimed at stifling descent and retaining authority over the populace was a hallmark of the government's repressive actions in the South. One of the most notable instances occurred in 1991, when Barre's regime initiated a ruthless aerial assault that led to the deaths of numerous innocent individuals in the town of [[Beledweyne|Beledwene]], situated in southern Somalia.<ref>{{Cite web |date=1 November 1992 |title=Somalia: Information on the capture of the town of Belet Uen by the United Somali Congress (USC) at the end of 1990 or early 1991 and on persecution of Darod in Belet Uen by USC soldiers |url=https://webarchive.archive.unhcr.org/20230604082615/https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6acb654.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240424094459/https://webarchive.archive.unhcr.org/20230604082615/https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6acb654.html |website=webarchive.archive.unhcr.org |publisher=Canada: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada |access-date=11 April 2024 |archive-date=24 April 2024 }}</ref> The cruelty and magnitude of this atrocity highlighted the degree to which the government was prepared to go to quash any sort of opposition or resistance, displaying a blatant disregard for human rights and the worth of human life.<ref>{{Cite web |date=1 January 1990 |title=Human Rights Watch World Report 1989 – Somalia |url=https://www.refworld.org/reference/annualreport/hrw/1990/en/35330#:~:text=We%20urge%20the,from%20international%20largesse. |website=Refwolrd |publisher=Human Rights Watch |place=Somalia |publication-date=1 January 1990 |access-date=11 April 2024 |archive-date=24 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240424095942/https://www.refworld.org/reference/annualreport/hrw/1990/en/35330#:~:text=We%20urge%20the,from%20international%20largesse. |url-status=live }}</ref>

During 1990, in the capital city of Mogadishu, the residents were prohibited from gathering publicly in groups greater than three or four. Fuel shortages, inflation, and currency devaluation impacted the economy. A thriving black market existed in the centre of the city as banks experienced shortages of local currency for exchange. Harsh [[exchange control]] regulations were introduced to prevent export of foreign currency. Although no travel restrictions were placed on foreigners, photographing many locations was banned. During daytime in Mogadishu, the appearance of any government military force was extremely rare. Alleged late-night operations by government authorities, however, included "disappearances" of individuals from their homes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Focus on the Horn, Issues 7–9|year=1989|publisher=Horn of Africa Information Committee|page=37}}</ref>

In 1991, the Barre administration was ousted by a coalition of clan-based opposition groups, backed by Ethiopia's then-ruling [[Derg]] regime and [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]].<ref>Columbia University, School of International Affairs, ''Journal of international affairs'', Vol. 40 (1986), p. 165.</ref> Following a meeting of the [[Somali National Movement]] and northern clans' elders, the northern former British portion of the country [[Somaliland Declaration of Independence|declared its independence]] as the [[Somaliland|Republic of Somaliland]] in May 1991.

Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime. In the south, armed factions led by USC commanders General [[Mohamed Farah Aidid]] and [[Ali Mahdi Mohamed]], in particular, clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital.<ref>Library Information and Research Service, ''The Middle East: Abstracts and index'', Vol. 2, (Library Information and Research Service: 1999), p. 327.</ref> In 1991, a multi-phased international conference on Somalia was held in neighbouring Djibouti.<ref name="Paul Fricska">{{cite web|last=Paul Fricska|first=Szilard|title=Harbinger of a New World Order?

The Transitional Federal Government sought to reestablish its authority, and, with the assistance of [[Ethiopian National Defense Force|Ethiopian troops]], [[African Union]] peacekeepers and air support by the United States, drove out the ICU and solidified its rule.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/153/26334.html |title=Ethiopian Invasion of Somalia |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=14 August 2007 |access-date=27 June 2010 |archive-date=10 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910145231/http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/153/26334.html |url-status=live }}</ref> On 8 January 2007, TFG President [[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed]] entered Mogadishu with the Ethiopian military support for the first time since being elected to office.

This marked the first time since the fall of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 that the federal government controlled most of the country.<ref name="Gosppsdott">{{cite web|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/english/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=558:somalia-president-parliament-speaker-dispute-over-tfg-term&catid=55:somalia&Itemid=79|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514131640/http://www.garoweonline.com/english/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=558%3Asomalia-president-parliament-speaker-dispute-over-tfg-term&catid=55%3Asomalia&Itemid=79|archive-date=14 May 2011|title=Somalia President, Parliament Speaker dispute over TFG term|publisher=Garoweonline.com|date=12 January 2011|access-date=12 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Al-Shabaab insurgency ===
{{See also|Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Islamic Emirate of Somalia}}
[[Al-Shabaab (Somalia)|Al-Shabaab]] opposed the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia and continued an insurgency against the TFG. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had forced the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,USCIRF,,,4a4f272bc,0.html |title=USCIRF Annual Report 2009 – The Commission's Watch List: Somalia |date=1 May 2009 |access-date=27 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510005900/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher%2CUSCIRF%2C%2C%2C4a4f272bc%2C0.html |archive-date=10 May 2011}}</ref>

Owing to a lack of funding and human resources, an [[arms embargo]] that made it difficult to reestablish a national security force, and general indifference on the part of the international community, Yusuf found himself obliged to deploy thousands of troops from Puntland to Mogadishu to sustain the battle against insurgent elements in the southern part of the country. Financial support for this effort was provided by the autonomous region's government. This left little revenue for Puntland's own security forces and civil service employees, leaving the territory vulnerable to piracy and terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Guide_to_Puntland_Election_2009_printer.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928150305/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Guide_to_Puntland_Election_2009_printer.shtml|archive-date=28 September 2013 |title=Somalia: Guide to Puntland Election 2009 |publisher=Garoweonline.com |date=25 December 2008 |access-date=12 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2005/ga10386.html |title=Opening Annual General Assembly Debate, Secretary-General Urges Member States to Press in Tackling Poverty, Terrorism, Human Rights Abuses, Conflicts |publisher=Unis.unvienna.org |access-date=12 June 2011 |archive-date=27 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727220517/http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2005/ga10386.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 29 December 2008, Yusuf announced before a united parliament in Baidoa his resignation as President of Somalia. In his speech, which was broadcast on national radio, Yusuf expressed regret at failing to end the country's seventeen-year conflict as his government had been mandated to do.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7802622.stm "Somalia's president quits office"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113170135/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7802622.stm |date=13 November 2017 }}, [[BBC News]], 29 December 2008.</ref> He also blamed the international community for their failure to support the government, and said that the speaker of parliament would succeed him in office per the [[Transitional Federal Charter of the Somali Republic|Charter of the Transitional Federal Government]].<ref>[https://www.ft.com/content/a790e984-d590-11dd-a9cc-000077b07658 "Somali President Yusuf resigns"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231092213/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a790e984-d590-11dd-a9cc-000077b07658.html |date=31 December 2008 }}, Reuters (FT.com), 29 December 2008.</ref>

Between 31 May and 9 June 2008, representatives of Somalia's federal government and the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia (ARS) participated in peace talks in Djibouti brokered by the former United Nations Special Envoy to Somalia, [[Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah]]. The conference ended with a signed agreement calling for the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops in exchange for the cessation of armed confrontation. Parliament was subsequently expanded to 550 seats to accommodate ARS members, which then elected [[Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed]], as president.<ref name="factbook"/>
With the help of a small team of African Union troops, the TFG began a [[Somali Civil War (2009–present)|counteroffensive]] in February 2009 to assume full control of the southern half of the country. To solidify its rule, the TFG formed an alliance with the Islamic Courts Union, other members of the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia, and [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]], a moderate [[Sufism|Sufi]] militia.<ref>{{cite web |author=Kamaal |url=http://horseedmedia.net/2010/05/22/un-boss-urges-support-for-somalia-ahead-of-istanbul-summit/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928234017/http://horseedmedia.net/2010/05/22/un-boss-urges-support-for-somalia-ahead-of-istanbul-summit/ |archive-date=28 September 2013 |title=UN boss urges support for Somalia ahead of Istanbul summit |work=Horseed Media |publisher=Horseedmedia.net |date=22 May 2010 |access-date=27 June 2010}}</ref> Furthermore, Al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam, the two main Islamist groups in opposition, began to fight amongst themselves in mid-2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8318798.stm |title=Islamists break Somali port truce |work=[[BBC News]] |date=21 October 2009 |access-date=27 June 2010 |archive-date=26 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026052416/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8318798.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> As a truce, in March 2009, the TFG announced that it would reimplement Shari'a as the nation's official judicial system.<ref>[http://www.arabnews.com/?page=4&section=0&article=119757&d=1&m=3&y=2009 Shariah in Somalia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727054245/http://www.arabnews.com/?page=4&section=0&article=119757&d=1&m=3&y=2009 |date=27 July 2020 }} – ''[[Arab News]]''</ref> However, conflict continued in the southern and central parts of the country.
