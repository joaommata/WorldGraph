Most of them settled on the coast. The [[Atlantic slave trade]] began in the 16th century, and for the next two hundred years the coastal region was a trading centre for Europeans in search of slaves, earning Togo and the surrounding region the name "The [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Benjamin |first=Thomas |date=2009-02-16 |title=The Atlantic World: Europeans, Africans, Indians and their Shared History, 1400–1900 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/the-atlantic-world/2E35A3BB70FC6B973EE4E1535D885470?chapterId=CBO9780511816604A026#contents |access-date=2025-03-26 |website=Higher Education from Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511816604 |isbn=978-0-511-81660-4 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The transatlantic slave trade |url=https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/history-of-slavery/transatlantic-slave-trade |access-date=2025-03-26 |website=National Museums Liverpool}}</ref>

In 1884, a paper was forcibly signed at [[Togoville]] with King Mlapa III, whereby Germany claimed a [[protectorate]] over a stretch of territory along the coast and gradually extended its control inland.<ref>Laumann, "A Historiography of German Togoland", p. 195</ref><ref>Washausen, ''Hamburg und die Kolonialpolitik'', p. 79</ref> Its borders were defined after the capture of the hinterland by German forces and signing agreements with France and Britain. In 1905, this became the German colony of [[Togoland]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Y |first=Dr |date=2019-04-26 |title=German Colonial Treaties in Africa: Togoland July 5th 1884 |url=https://afrolegends.com/2019/04/26/german-colonial-treaties-in-africa-togoland-july-5th-1884/ |access-date=2025-03-26 |website=African Heritage |language=en}}</ref> The local population was [[Forced labour|forced to work]], cultivate cotton, coffee, and cocoa and pay taxes. A [[Lomé–Aného railway|railway]] and the port of [[Lomé]] were built for export of agricultural products. The Germans introduced techniques of cultivation of [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[coffee]] and [[cotton]] and developed the infrastructure.

During [[World War I]], Togoland was invaded by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and France, proclaiming the Anglo-French condominium, during the [[West African Campaign (World War I)|West African Campaign]]. Following the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] invasion of the colony in August 1914, German forces were defeated, forcing the colony's surrender on 26 August 1914. On 7 December 1916, the condominium collapsed and Togoland was subsequently partitioned into British and French zones, creating the colonies of [[British Togoland]] and [[French Togoland]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Martin |first1=Lawrence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jtyOqiwiDLYC&pg=PR15 |title=The Treaties of Peace, 1919-1923 |last2=Reed |first2=John |date=2007 |publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd. |isbn=978-1-58477-708-3 |language=en}}</ref> On 20 July 1922, Great Britain received the [[League of Nations]] mandate to govern the western part of Togo and France to govern the eastern part. In 1945, the country received the right to send three representatives to the [[French Parliament|French parliament.]]

After [[World War II]], these mandates became [[United Nations Trust Territories|UN Trust Territories]]. The residents of British Togoland [[1956 British Togoland status plebiscite|voted]] to join the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] as part of the independent nation of [[Ghana]] in 1957. French Togoland became an autonomous republic within the [[French Union]] in 1959, while France retained the right to control defence, foreign relations, and finances.{{cn|date=June 2025}}

=== Independence ===
The Togolese Republic was proclaimed on 27 April 1960.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zuber |first=David |date=2022-03-28 |title=Sylvanus Olympio (1902-1963) |url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/people-global-african-history/sylvanus-olympio-1902-1963/ |access-date=2025-03-26 |website=BlackPast.org |language=en-US}}</ref> In the [[Togolese general election, 1961]], [[Sylvanus Olympio]] became the first president, gaining 100 per cent of the vote in elections boycotted by the opposition. On 9 April 1961, the Constitution of the Togolese Republic was adopted, according to which the supreme legislative body was the [[National Assembly of Togo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ujamaalive.africa/encyclomedia/togo/|title=Togo|date=2019-04-26|website=Ujamaa Live|language=en-ZA|access-date=2019-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502190520/https://ujamaalive.africa/encyclomedia/togo/|archive-date=2 May 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> In December 1961, leaders of opposition parties were arrested because they were accused of the preparation of an anti-government conspiracy. A decree was issued on the dissolution of the opposition parties. Olympio tried to reduce dependence on France by establishing cooperation with the United States, United Kingdom, and [[West Germany]]. He rejected the efforts of French soldiers who were demobilized after the [[Algerian War]] and tried to get a position in the Togolese army. These factors eventually led to a military coup on 13 January 1963 during which he was [[assassinate]]d by a group of soldiers under the direction of Sergeant [[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]].<ref name="ellis93">{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Stephen|title=Rumour and Power in Togo|journal=Africa: Journal of the International African Institute|volume =63|issue=4|pages=462–476|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993|doi=10.2307/1161002|jstor=1161002|s2cid=145261033 }}</ref> A state of emergency was declared in Togo. The military handed over power to an interim government led by [[Nicolas Grunitzky]]. In May 1963, Grunitzky was elected President of the Republic. The new leadership pursued a policy of developing relations with France. His main aim was to dampen the divisions between north and south, promulgate a new constitution, and introduce a multiparty system.

On 13 January 1967, Eyadéma overthrew Grunitzky in a bloodless coup and assumed the presidency.<ref name="heritage.org">{{cite web |title=Togo Economy: Population, GDP, Inflation, Business, Trade, FDI, Corruption |url=https://www.heritage.org/index/country/togo |website=www.heritage.org |access-date=27 January 2021 |language=en |archive-date=10 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230510041736/https://www.heritage.org/index/country/togo |url-status=unfit }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Coups in Togo |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/togo.htm |access-date=2025-03-26 |website=www.globalsecurity.org}}</ref> He created the [[Rally of the Togolese People|Rally of the Togolese People Party]], banned activities of other political parties and introduced a [[one-party system]] in November 1969. He was reelected in 1979 and 1986. In 1983, the [[privatization]] program launched and in 1991 other political parties were allowed. In 1993, the [[European Union]] froze the partnership, describing Eyadéma's re-election in 1993, 1998 and 2003, as a seizure of power. In April 2004, in [[Brussels]], talks were held between the EU and Togo on the resumption of cooperation.

The events of 2005 led to questions regarding the government's commitment to [[democracy]] that had been made in an attempt to normalize relations with the EU which cut off [[aid]] in 1993 due to questions about Togo's human rights situation. Up to 400 people were killed in the violence surrounding the presidential elections, according to the UN. Around 40,000 Togolese fled to neighbouring countries. Gnassingbé was reelected in 2010 and 2015.

Togo became the first African nation to win an Olympic medal in canoeing at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]] when [[Benjamin Boukpeti]] won bronze in the [[Canoeing at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's slalom K-1|K-1 slalom]].

In 2017, anti-government protests erupted. [[United Nations|UN]] condemned the resulting crackdown by security forces, and [[The Gambia]]'s foreign minister, [[Ousainou Darboe]], had to issue a correction after saying that Gnassingbé should resign.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-togo/togos-president-gnassingbe-should-resign-immediately-gambian-foreign-minister-idUSKBN1CS1W7|title=Gambian ministry says up to Togo to resolve crisis|last=Farge|first=Emma|date=2017-10-23|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-10-26|publisher=Thomson Reuters|archive-date=26 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026111748/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-togo/togos-president-gnassingbe-should-resign-immediately-gambian-foreign-minister-idUSKBN1CS1W7|url-status=live}}</ref>
