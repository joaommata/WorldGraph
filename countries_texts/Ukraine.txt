From the 6th&nbsp;century BC, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] colonies were established on the north-eastern shore of the [[Black Sea]], such as at [[Tyras]], [[Olbia, Ukraine|Olbia]], and [[Chersonesus]]. These thrived into the 6th&nbsp;century AD. The [[Goths]] stayed in the area, but came under the sway of the [[Huns]] from the 370s. In the 7th&nbsp;century, the territory that is now eastern Ukraine was the centre of [[Old Great Bulgaria]]. At the end of the century, the majority of Bulgar tribes migrated in different directions, and the [[Khazars]] took over much of the land.<ref>{{cite web |title=Khazar &#124; Origin, History, Religion, & Facts |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Khazar |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=12 May 2023}}</ref>

In the 5th and 6th centuries, the [[Antes (people)|Antes]], which some relate as an [[early Slavs|early Slavic]] people, lived in Ukraine. Migrations from the territories of present-day Ukraine throughout the [[Balkans]] established many [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] nations. Northern migrations, reaching almost to [[Lake Ilmen]], led to the emergence of the [[Ilmen Slavs]] and [[Krivichs]]. Following an [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] raid in 602 and the collapse of the Antes Union, most of these peoples survived as separate tribes until the beginning of the second millennium.<ref>{{cite book |last=Magocsi |first=Paul Robert |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t124cP06gg0C&q=antes+avar&pg=PA42 |title=A History of Ukraine |date=16 July 1996 |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |isbn=978-0-8020-7820-9 |pages=39–42 |quote=Whether the Antes created a state structure or existed simply as tribal groupings, their influence was broken after the arrival of the Avars during the second half of the sixth century.

In 1569, the [[Union of Lublin]] established the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and most of the Ukrainian lands were transferred from Lithuania to the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]], becoming ''[[de jure]]'' Polish territory.

In 1654, Khmelnytsky was subject to the [[Pereiaslav Agreement]], forming a military and political alliance with Russia that acknowledged loyalty to the Russian monarch.

After his death, the Hetmanate went through a devastating 30-year war amongst Russia, Poland, the Crimean Khanate, the Ottoman Empire, and [[Cossacks]], known as "[[The Ruin (Ukrainian history)|The Ruin]]" (1657–1686), for control of the Cossack Hetmanate. The [[Treaty of Perpetual Peace (1686)|Treaty of Perpetual Peace]] between Russia and Poland in 1686 divided the lands of the Cossack Hetmanate between them, reducing the portion over which Poland had claimed sovereignty to Ukraine west of the Dnieper river. In 1686, the [[Metropolitanate of Kyiv]] was [[Annexation of the Metropolitanate of Kyiv by the Moscow Patriarchate|annexed by the Moscow Patriarchate]] through a synodal letter of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Dionysius IV of Constantinople|Dionysius IV]], thus placing the [[Metropolitanate of Kyiv#Orthodox Church of Ukraine|Metropolitanate of Kyiv]] under the authority of [[Moscow]]. An attempt to reverse the decline was undertaken by Cossack Hetman [[Ivan Mazepa]] (1639–1709), who ultimately defected to the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721) in a bid to get rid of Russian dependence,<ref name="Magocsi">{{cite book |last=Magocsi |first=Paul Robert |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0mKRsElYNkC&dq=mazepa+poltava&pg=PA262 |title=A History of Ukraine: The Land and Its Peoples, Second Edition |date=2010 |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |isbn=978-1-4426-4085-6 |location=Toronto |pages=255–263}}</ref> but Hetmanate's capital city [[Baturyn]] was [[Sack of Baturyn|sacked]] (1708) and they were crushed in the [[Battle of Poltava]] (1709).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bondar |first1=Andriy |title=Baturyn, a Small Town With a Grand History |url=https://www.kyivpost.com/post/20093 |website=[[Kyiv Post]] |date=7 August 2023}}</ref><ref name="Magocsi"/>

The 19th century saw the rise of Ukrainian nationalism. With growing urbanisation and modernisation and a cultural trend toward [[romantic nationalism]], a Ukrainian [[intelligentsia]] committed to national rebirth and social justice emerged. The serf-turned-national-poet [[Taras Shevchenko]] (1814–1861) and political theorist [[Mykhailo Drahomanov]] (1841–1895) led the growing nationalist movement.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The First Ukrainian Political Program: Mykhailo Drahomanov's ''Introduction'' to Hromadaurl |url=http://www.ditext.com/rudnytsky/history/first.html |access-date=26 March 2021 |website=ditext.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Shevchenko, Taras |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CS%5CH%5CShevchenkoTaras.htm |access-date=1 November 2017 |website=encyclopediaofukraine.com}}</ref> While conditions for its development in Austrian [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]] under the [[Habsburgs]] were relatively lenient,<ref>{{cite book |last=Magocsi |first=Paul Robert |title=The Roots of Ukrainian Nationalism: Galicia as Ukraine's Piedmont |date=16 July 2018 |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |isbn=978-1-4426-8225-2 |doi=10.3138/9781442682252 |s2cid=128063569}}</ref> the Russian part (historically known as "[[Little Russia]]" or "South Russia")<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kravčenko |first=Volodymyr Vasylʹovyč |title=The Ukrainian-Russian borderland: history versus geography |date=2022 |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |isbn=978-0-2280-1199-6 |location=Montreal & Kingston London Chicago |pages=26–35}}</ref> faced severe restrictions, going as far as [[Ems Ukaz|banning virtually all books from being published in Ukrainian]] in 1876.

Ukraine plunged into turmoil with the beginning of [[World War I]], and fighting on Ukrainian soil persisted until late 1921. Initially, the Ukrainians were split between Austria-Hungary, fighting for the [[Central Powers]], though the vast majority served in the [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Imperial Russian Army]], which was part of the [[Triple Entente]], under Russia.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ukraine: A History |last=Subtelny |first=Orest |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8020-8390-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ukrainehistory00subt_0/page/340 340–344] |author-link=Orest Subtelny |url=https://archive.org/details/ukrainehistory00subt_0/page/340}}</ref> As the Russian Empire collapsed, the conflict evolved into the [[Ukrainian War of Independence]], with Ukrainians fighting alongside, or against, the [[Red Army|Red]], [[White Army|White]], [[Makhnovshchina|Black]] and [[Green armies]], with the Poles, Hungarians (in [[Transcarpathian Rus'|Transcarpathia]]), and Germans also intervening at various times.

[[File:Ukrainian national costumes 04.jpg|thumb|Youth in national Ukrainian dress during a ceremony commemorating the 22nd January 1919 "Act of Reunification of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the Western Ukrainian People's Republic", which is honoured yearly across 22 cities of Ukraine]]
An attempt to create an independent state, the left-leaning [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR), was first announced by [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], but the period was plagued by an extremely unstable political and military environment. It was first deposed in a [[coup d'état]] led by [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]], which yielded the [[Ukrainian State]] under the German protectorate, and the attempt to restore the UNR under the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] ultimately failed as the Ukrainian army was regularly overrun by other forces. The short-lived [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] and [[Hutsul Republic]] also failed to join the rest of Ukraine.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nahylo |first=Bohdan |date=1999 |title=The Ukrainian Resurgence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPCPxwubpYUC&dq=West+Ukrainian+People%27s+Republic++austria+hungary+territories&pg=PA8 |location=London |publisher=Hurst |page=8 |isbn=978-1-85065-168-0 |oclc=902410832}}</ref>

The result of the conflict was a partial victory for the [[Second Polish Republic]], which annexed the Western Ukrainian provinces, as well as a larger-scale victory for the pro-Soviet forces, which succeeded in dislodging the remaining factions and eventually established the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Soviet Ukraine). Meanwhile, modern-day [[Bukovina]] was occupied by [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] was admitted to [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] as an autonomous region.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ukraine – World War I and the struggle for independence |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=20 May 2023}}</ref>

The conflict over Ukraine, a part of the broader [[Russian Civil War]], devastated the whole of the former Russian Empire, including eastern and central Ukraine. The fighting left over 1.5 million people dead and hundreds of thousands homeless in the former Russian Empire's territory. [[Russian famine of 1921–1922|Famine in 1921]] further hit the eastern provinces.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Famine of 1920–1924 |url=http://www.volgagermans.net/norka/famine_1920s.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113021645/http://www.volgagermans.net/norka/famine_1920s.html |archive-date=13 January 2015 |access-date=4 March 2015 |website=The Norka – a German Colony in Russia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Famine of 1921–3 |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CF%5CA%5CFamineof1921hD73.htm |access-date=3 March 2015 |publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the recently constituted Soviet Ukraine became one of the founding republics of the [[Soviet Union]]. During the 1920s,<ref>Subtelny, p. 380</ref> under the Ukrainisation policy pursued by the national Communist leadership of [[Mykola Skrypnyk]], Soviet leadership at first encouraged a national renaissance in [[Culture of Ukraine|Ukrainian culture]] and language. [[Ukrainisation]] was part of the Soviet-wide policy of [[Korenisation]] (literally ''indigenisation''), which was intended to promote the advancement of native peoples, their language and culture into the governance of their respective republics.

Around the same time, Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] instituted the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), which introduced a form of [[market socialism]], allowing some private ownership of small and medium-sized productive enterprises, hoping to reconstruct the post-war Soviet Union that had been devastated by both WWI and later the civil war. The NEP was successful at restoring the formerly war-torn nation to pre-WWI levels of production and agricultural output by the mid-1920s, much of the latter based in Ukraine.<ref name="Service">{{cite book |last=Service |first=Robert |title=A History of Twentieth-Century Russia |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-674-40348-7 |location=Cambridge, MA |pages=124–125}}</ref> These policies attracted many prominent former UNR figures, including former UNR leader Hrushevsky, to return to Soviet Ukraine, where they were accepted, and participated in the advancement of Ukrainian science and culture.<ref>Christopher Gilley, 'The "Change of Signposts" in the Ukrainian emigration: Mykhailo Hrushevskyi and the Foreign Delegation of the Ukrainian Party of Socialist Revolutionaries', ''Jahrbücher für Geschichte Osteuropas'', Vol. 54, 2006, No. 3, pp. 345–74</ref> In July 1922, arrests and [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportations]] of Ukrainian intellectuals (e.g. university professors) began in Soviet Ukraine and continued throughout the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Deportations of Ukrainians in the 1920s |url=https://deportation.org.ua/deportations_ofukrainians_in_the_1920s/ |website=Deportation.org.ua|date=10 January 2023 }}</ref>

This period was cut short when [[Joseph Stalin]] became the leader of the USSR following Lenin's death. Stalin did away with the NEP in what became known as the [[Great Break (USSR)|Great Break]]. Starting from the late 1920s and now with a [[planned economy|centrally planned economy]], Soviet Ukraine took part in an [[Industrialization in the USSR|industrialisation scheme]] which quadrupled its industrial output during the 1930s.

Nevertheless, Stalin sought to prevent the Ukrainians aspirations for the independence of Ukraine and took severe measures to eliminate Ukrainian peasantry and elite Ukrainian intellectuals and culturists.<ref>{{cite web |title=Holodomor |url=https://cla.umn.edu/chgs/holocaust-genocide-education/resource-guides/holodomor |website=[[University of Minnesota]]}}</ref><ref name="Kravchenko">{{cite web |last1=Kravchenko |first1=Volodymyr |title=Fighting Soviet Myths: The Ukrainian Experience |url=https://www.husj.harvard.edu/articles/fighting-soviet-myths-the-ukrainian-experience |website=[[Harvard University]]}}</ref> As a consequence of Stalin's new policy, the Ukrainian peasantry suffered from the [[Collectivization in the USSR|programme of collectivisation]] of agricultural crops.

By the end of the protests on 21 February 2014, he fled from Ukraine and was removed by the parliament in what is termed the [[Revolution of Dignity]], but Russia refused to recognise the interim pro-Western government, calling it a ''[[Military junta|junta]]'' and denouncing the events as a coup d'état sponsored by the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-04-25 |title="Хунта" и "террористы": война слов Москвы и Киева |trans-title='Junta' and 'Terrorists': The war of words between Moscow and Kyiv |url=https://www.bbc.com/russian/blogs/2014/04/140425_blog_krechetnikov_harsh_speech |access-date=2022-08-04 |website=BBC News Русская служба |language=ru}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Putin accuses US of orchestrating 2014 'coup' in Ukraine |date=22 June 2021 |access-date=3 March 2022 |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/22/russias-putin-accuses-us-of-orchestrating-2014-coup-in-ukraine |publisher=[[Al Jazeera Media Network|Al Jazeera]]}}</ref><ref name="Partido da imprensa Golpista">{{Cite web |title=The Maidan in 2014 is a coup d'etat: a review of Italian and German pro-Russian media |url=https://voxukraine.org/en/the-maidan-in-2014-is-a-coup-d-etat-a-review-of-italian-and-german-pro-russian-media |access-date=2022-08-04 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Despite the signing of the [[Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances|Budapest memorandum]] in 1994, in which Ukraine agreed to hand over [[Ukraine and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons]] in exchange for guarantees of security and territorial integrity, Russia reacted violently to these developments and [[Russo-Ukrainian War|started a war]] against its western neighbour.

The military conflict with Russia shifted the government's policy towards the West. Shortly after Yanukovych fled Ukraine, the country signed the EU association agreement in June 2014, and its citizens were granted visa-free travel to the European Union three years later. In January 2019, the [[Orthodox Church of Ukraine]] was recognised as independent of Moscow, which reversed the 1686 decision of the patriarch of Constantinople and dealt a further blow to Moscow's influence in Ukraine.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ukraine Country Report |url=https://www.eu-listco.net/publications/ukraine-country-report |access-date=2022-08-04 |website=EU-LISTCO |date=11 December 2019 |language=en-ZA}}</ref> Finally, amid a full-scale war with Russia, Ukraine was granted [[Potential enlargement of the European Union|candidate status]] to the European Union on 23 June 2022.<ref name="BBC News">{{Cite news |date=2022-06-23 |title=EU awards Ukraine and Moldova candidate status |language=en-GB |work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61891467 |access-date=2022-08-04}}</ref> A broad anti-corruption drive began in early 2023 with the resignations of several deputy ministers and regional heads during a reshuffle of the government.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-01-24 |title=Top Ukrainian officials quit in anti-corruption drive |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64383388 |access-date=2023-01-25}}</ref>
