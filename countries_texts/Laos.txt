In 2009, an [[anatomically modern human]] [[skull]] was recovered from the [[Tam Pa Ling Cave]] in the [[Annamite Range|Annamite Mountains]] in northern Laos; the skull is at least 46,000 years old, making it the oldest modern human fossil found to date in [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid = 22908291|pmc = 3437904|year = 2012|last1 = Demeter|first1 = F|display-authors=et al.|title = Anatomically modern human in Southeast Asia (Laos) by 46 ka|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume = 109|issue = 36|pages = 14375–14380|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1208104109|bibcode = 2012PNAS..10914375D|doi-access = free|issn = 0027-8424}}</ref> Stone artifacts including [[Hoabinhian]] types have been found at sites dating to the [[Pleistocene]] in northern Laos.<ref>{{Cite journal|year = 2009|last1 = White|first1 = J.C.|title = Archaeological Investigations in northern Laos: New contributions to Southeast Asian prehistory|journal = Antiquity|volume = 83|issue = 319|last2 = Lewis|first2 = H.|last3 = Bouasisengpaseuth|first3 = B.|last4 = Marwick|first4 = B.|last5 = Arrell|first5 = K|url = http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/white/|access-date = 2016-09-18 |archive-date = 2017-10-10 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171010191403/http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/white/|url-status = live}}</ref>

Laos traces its history to the kingdom of Lan Xang ('million elephants'), which was founded in the 13th century by a Lao prince, [[Fa Ngum]],<ref name="Coedes">{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|author-link= George Coedès|editor= Walter F.

Fa Ngum's eldest son, Oun Heuan, ascended to the throne under the name [[Samsenethai]] and reigned for 43&nbsp;years. Lan Xang became a trade centre during Samsenthai's reign, and after his death in 1421 it collapsed into warring factions for nearly a century.<ref>Sanda Simms, ch. 3, "Through Chaos to a New Order", in ''The Kingdoms of Laos'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 2013). {{ISBN|9781136863370}}</ref>

In 1520, [[Photisarath]] came to the throne and moved the capital from [[Luang Prabang]] to Vientiane to avoid a Burmese invasion. [[Setthathirath]] became king in 1548, after his father was killed, and ordered the construction of [[Pha That Luang|That Luang]]. Settathirath disappeared in the mountains on his way back from a military expedition into [[Cambodia]], and [[Lan Xang]] fell into more than 70 years of "instability", involving Burmese invasion and civil war.<ref>Sanda Simms, ch. 6, "Seventy Years of Anarchy", in ''The Kingdoms of Laos'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 2013). {{ISBN|9781136863370}}; see also P.C.

In 1637, when [[Sourigna Vongsa]] ascended the throne, Lan Xang further expanded its frontiers. When he died without an heir, the kingdom split into three principalities. Between 1763 and 1769, Burmese armies overran northern Laos and annexed [[Luang Prabang]], while [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]] eventually came under Siamese [[suzerainty]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Askew, Marc.|title=Vientiane: transformations of a Lao landscape|year=2010|orig-date= 2007|publisher=Routledge|others=Logan, William Stewart, 1942–, Long, Colin, 1966–|isbn=978-0-415-59662-6|location=London|oclc=68416667}}</ref>

In a time period where the acquisition of humans was a priority over the ownership of land, the warfare of pre-modern Southeast Asia revolved around the seizing of people and resources from its enemies. A Siamese military campaign in Laos in 1876 was described by a British observer as having been "transformed into [[Slavery in Asia|slave-hunting raids]] on a large scale".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-10-12 |title=Slavery in Nineteenth-Century Northern Thailand: Archival Anecdotes and Village Voices |publisher=The New Kyoto Review of South East Asia Website |url=http://kyotoreviewsea.org/slavery3.htm |access-date=2025-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012011239/http://kyotoreviewsea.org/slavery3.htm |archive-date=2010-10-12}}</ref>

As late as 1945, the French drew up a plan to move a number of Vietnamese to three areas (i.e., the Vientiane Plain, [[Savannakhet Province|Savannakhet region]], and the [[Bolaven Plateau]]), which was derailed by the Japanese invasion of Indochina.

The First Indochina War took place across French Indochina and eventually led to French defeat and the signing of a peace accord for Laos at the [[1954 Geneva Conference|Geneva Conference of 1954]]. In 1960, amidst a series of rebellions in the [[Kingdom of Laos]], fighting broke out between the [[Royal Lao Army]] (RLA) and the communist [[North Vietnam]]ese and [[Soviet Union]]-backed Pathet Lao guerillas. A second [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] formed by Prince [[Souvanna Phouma]] in 1962 was unsuccessful, and the situation turned into [[Laotian Civil War|civil war]] between the Royal Laotian government and the Pathet Lao. The Pathet Lao were backed militarily by the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) and the [[Viet Cong]].<ref name="bbc" /><ref name="britannica" />

Laos was a part of the [[Vietnam War]] since parts of Laos were [[North Vietnamese invasion of Laos|invaded and occupied]] by [[North Vietnam]] since 1958 for use as a supply route for its war against [[South Vietnam]]. In response, the [[United States]] initiated a bombing campaign against the PAVN positions, supported regular and irregular anti-communist forces in Laos, and supported [[CIA activities in Laos|incursions into Laos]] by the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]].<ref name=bbc /><ref name=britannica />

Aerial bombardments against the PAVN/[[Pathet Lao]] forces were carried out by the [[United States]] to prevent the collapse of the [[Kingdom of Laos]] central government, and to deny the use of the [[Ho Chi Minh trail|Ho Chi Minh Trail]] to attack US forces in [[South Vietnam]].<ref name=bbc /> Between 1964 and 1973, the US dropped 2 million tons of bombs on Laos, nearly equal to the 2.1&nbsp;million tons of bombs the US dropped on Europe and Asia during all of World War II.

In 1989, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR), with the support of the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]], instituted the [[Comprehensive Plan of Action]], a programme to stem the tide of Indochinese refugees from Laos, [[Vietnam]], and [[Cambodia]]. Under the plan, refugee status was evaluated through a screening process. Recognised asylum seekers were given resettlement opportunities, while the remaining refugees were to be repatriated under guarantee of safety. After talks with the UNHCR and the Thai government, Laos agreed to repatriate the 60,000 Lao refugees living in Thailand, including several thousand [[Hmong people]].
