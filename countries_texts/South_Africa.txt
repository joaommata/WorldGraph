=== Mapungubwe ===
Around 1220, in the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]]-[[Shashe River|Shashe]] Basin, the elite of [[Bambandyanalo|K2]] moved to settle the flat-topped summit of Mapungubwe Hill, with the population settling below. [[Rainmaking (ritual)|Rainmaking]] was crucial to the development of [[sacral kingship]]. By 1250, the capital had a population of 5000 and the state covered 30,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (11,500 square miles), growing wealthy through the [[Indian Ocean trade]]. The events around Mapungubwe's collapse circa 1300 are unknown, however trade routes shifted north from the Limpopo to the [[Zambezi]], precipitating the rise of [[Great Zimbabwe]]. The hill was abandoned and Mapungubwe's population scattered.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Chirikure |first1=Shadreck |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3pa7CgAAQBAJ&dq=kingdom+of+mapungubwe&pg=PT6 |title=Mapungubwe Reconsidered: A Living Legacy: Exploring Beyond the Rise and Decline of the Mapungubwe State |last2=Delius |first2=Peter |last3=Esterhuysen |first3=Amanda |last4=Hall |first4=Simon |last5=Lekgoathi |first5=Sekibakiba |last6=Maulaudzi |first6=Maanda |last7=Neluvhalani |first7=Vele |last8=Ntsoane |first8=Otsile |last9=Pearce |first9=David |date=2015-10-01 |publisher=Real African Publishers Pty Ltd. |isbn=978-1-920655-06-8 |language=en}}</ref>

This was south of the furthest point reached in 1485 by his predecessor, the Portuguese navigator [[Diogo Cão]] ([[Cape Cross]], north of the bay). Dias continued down the western coast of southern Africa. After 8 January 1488, prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast, he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of Africa without seeing it. He reached as far up the eastern coast of Africa as, what he called, {{lang|pt|Rio do Infante}}, probably the present-day [[Groot River (Eastern Cape)|Groot River]], in May 1488. On his return, he saw the cape, which he named {{lang|pt|Cabo das Tormentas}} ('Cape of Storms'). King [[John II of Portugal|John II]] renamed the point {{lang|pt|Cabo da Boa Esperança}}, or [[Cape of Good Hope]], as it led to the riches of the [[East Indies]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mackenzie|first1=W.

In [[1595 in South Africa|1595]], the Dutch made their first contact with the coast of Southern Africa.

During the early 19th century, many Dutch settlers departed from the [[Cape Colony]], where they had been subjected to British control, in a series of migrant groups who came to be known as {{lang|nl|[[Voortrekkers]]}}, meaning "pathfinders" or "pioneers". They migrated to the future [[Natal (province)|Natal]], Free State, and [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]] regions. The Boers founded the [[Boer republics]]: the [[South African Republic]], the [[Natalia Republic]], and the [[Orange Free State]].<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle= Orange Free State |volume=20 |last1= Hillier |first1= Alfred Peter |author-link1= Alfred Hillier |last2= Cana |first2= Frank Richardson |author-link2= |pages=151-160 |short=1}}</ref> In the interior, the [[Cape Colony]] expanded at the expense of the [[Tswana people|Batswana]] and [[Griqua people|Griqua]], and Boer expansion caused great instability in the Middle Orange River region.<ref>Wright, "Turbulent Times," 215.</ref> The [[Matabele kingdom]] came to dominate the eastern interior, and raided the [[Venda people|Venda]] kingdom.<ref>Wright, "Turbulent Times," 235.</ref> The discovery of diamonds in 1867 and gold in 1884 in the interior started the [[Mineral Revolution]] and increased economic growth and immigration.

On 16 May 1876, President [[Thomas François Burgers]] of the South African Republic declared war against the [[Pedi people]]. King [[Sekhukhune]] managed to defeat the army on 1 August 1876. Another attack by the Lydenburg Volunteer Corps was also repulsed. On 16 February 1877, the two parties signed a peace treaty at [[Botshabelo, Mpumalanga|Botshabelo]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=South African Military History Society – Journal- THE SEKUKUNI WARS|url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol025hk.html|access-date=15 August 2020|website=samilitaryhistory.org|archive-date=23 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200723053419/http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol025hk.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The Boers' inability to subdue the Pedi led to the departure of Burgers in favour of [[Paul Kruger]] and the British annexation of the South African Republic. In 1878 and 1879 three British attacks were successfully repelled until [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Garnet Wolseley]] defeated Sekhukhune in November 1879 with an army of 2,000 British soldiers, Boers and 10,000 Swazis.

The [[Anglo-Zulu War]] was fought in 1879 between the British and the [[Zulu Kingdom]]. Following [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]]'s successful introduction of [[Canadian Confederation|federation in Canada]], it was thought that similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might succeed with the African kingdoms, tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa. In 1874, [[Henry Bartle Frere]] was sent to South Africa as the British [[High Commissioner for Southern Africa|High Commissioner]] to bring such plans into being. Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the Boers, and the Zululand army. The Zulu nation defeated the British at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]]. Eventually Zululand lost the war, resulting in the termination of the Zulu nation's independence.<ref>{{cite book

The Boer republics successfully resisted British encroachments during the [[First Boer War]] (1880–1881) using [[guerrilla warfare]] tactics, which were well-suited to local conditions. The British returned with greater numbers, more experience, and new strategy in the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902) and, although suffering heavy casualties due to Boer [[attrition warfare]], they were ultimately successful due in part to [[scorched earth]] tactics and [[Second Boer War concentration camps|concentration camps]], in which 27,000 Boer civilians died due to a combination of disease and neglect.<ref>{{cite news|title=5 of the worst atrocities carried out by the British Empire|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/worst-atrocities-british-empire-amritsar-boer-war-concentration-camp-mau-mau-a6821756.html|work=The Independent|date=19 January 2016|access-date=22 September 2019|archive-date=27 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190927142647/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/worst-atrocities-british-empire-amritsar-boer-war-concentration-camp-mau-mau-a6821756.html|url-status=live }}</ref>

South Africa's urban population grew rapidly from the end of the 19th century onward. After the devastation of the wars, Boer farmers fled into [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] and Orange Free State cities and constituted a white urban poor class.<ref name="Ogura 1996">{{Cite journal|last=Ogura|first=Mitsuo|date=1996|title=Urbanization and Apartheid in South Africa: Influx Controls and Their Abolition|journal=The Developing Economies|language=en|volume=34|issue=4|pages=402–423|doi=10.1111/j.1746-1049.1996.tb01178.x|pmid=12292280|issn=1746-1049|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Anti-British policies among white South Africans focused on independence. During the Dutch and British colonial years, [[racial segregation]] was mostly informal, though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of indigenous people, including the [[Native Location Act of 1879]] and the system of [[pass laws]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bond|first=Patrick|title=Cities of gold, townships of coal: essays on South Africa's new urban crisis|publisher=Africa World Press|year=1999|page=140|isbn=978-0-86543-611-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite report|year=1906|title=Report of the Select Committee on Location Act|publisher=Cape Times Limited|url=https://archive.org/details/reportoftheselec00capeiala|access-date=30 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite report|last1=Godley |first1=Godfrey |first2=Welsh|last2=Archibald|last3=Thomson |first3=William |last4=Hemsworth |first4=H.

Eight years after the end of the Second Boer War and after four years of negotiation, the [[South Africa Act 1909]] granted nominal independence while creating the [[Union of South Africa]] on 31 May 1910. The union was a [[dominion]] that included the former territories of the Cape, Transvaal and Natal colonies, as well as the Orange Free State republic.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|first=Frank Richardson|last=Cana|wstitle=South Africa|volume=25|page=467}}</ref> The [[Natives Land Act, 1913|Natives' Land Act]] of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks; at that stage they controlled only 7% of the country.

In 1931, the union became fully sovereign from the United Kingdom with the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], which abolished the last powers of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] to legislate in the country. Only three other African countries—Liberia, Ethiopia, and Egypt—had been independent prior to that point. In 1934, the [[South African Party]] and [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] merged to form the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]], seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking whites. In 1939, the party split over the entry of the union into World War II, as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which National Party followers opposed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/national-party-np|title=National Party (NP) &#124; South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za|access-date=25 December 2023|archive-date=8 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200508083820/https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/national-party-np|url-status=live}}</ref>

Despite [[Internal resistance to apartheid|opposition to apartheid]] both within and outside the country, the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid.

The [[Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith]], signed by [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] and [[Harry Schwarz]] in 1974, enshrined the principles of [[peaceful transition of power]] and equality for all, the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in South Africa. Ultimately, [[F. W. de Klerk|F.W. de Klerk]] opened bilateral discussions with [[Nelson Mandela]] in 1993 for a transition of policies and government.

In 1990, the National Party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the ANC and other political organisations. It released Nelson Mandela from prison after 27 years of serving a sentence for sabotage. A [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|negotiation process]] followed. With approval from the white electorate in a [[1992 South African apartheid referendum|1992 referendum]], the government continued negotiations to end apartheid. South Africa held its first universal [[1994 South African general election|elections in 1994]], which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since.
