=== Pre-Columbian ===
The first evidence of human habitation in Guatemala dates to 12,000 BC. Archaeological evidence, such as [[obsidian]] [[arrowhead]]s found in various parts of the country, suggests a human presence as early as 18,000 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.authenticmaya.com/ancient_guatemala.htm |title=Ancient Guatemala |publisher=Authentic Maya |author=Mary Esquivel de Villalobos |access-date=29 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523103423/http://www.authenticmaya.com/ancient_guatemala.htm |archive-date=23 May 2007 }}</ref> There is archaeological proof that early Guatemalan settlers were [[hunter-gatherers]].

Archaeologists divide the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] history of Mesoamerica into the Preclassic period (3000 BC to 250 AD), the Classic period (250 to 900 AD), and the Postclassic period (900 to 1500 AD).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weber.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/mexchron.html |title=Chronological Table of Mesoamerican Archaeology |publisher=Regents of the University of California : Division of Social Sciences |access-date=29 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406020436/http://weber.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/mexchron.html |archive-date=6 April 2007 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Until recently, the Preclassic was regarded by researchers as a formative period, in which the peoples typically lived in huts in small villages of farmers, with few permanent buildings. This notion has been challenged since the late 20th century by discoveries of monumental architecture from that period, such as the [[Mirador Basin]] cities of [[Nakbé]], Xulnal, [[El Tintal]], Wakná and [[El Mirador]].

The Classic period of [[Mesoamerican]] civilization corresponds to the height of the [[Maya civilization]]. It is represented by countless sites throughout Guatemala, although the largest concentration is in [[Petén Basin|Petén]]. This period is characterized by urbanization, the emergence of independent city-states, and contact with other Mesoamerican cultures.<ref>

The Post-Classic period is represented by regional kingdoms, such as the [[Itza people|Itza]], [[Kowoj]], [[Yalain]] and [[Kejache]] in Petén, and the [[Mam people|Mam]], [[K'iche' people|Ki'che']], [[Kaqchikel people|Kackchiquel]], [[Chajoma]], [[Tz'utujil people|Tz'utujil]], [[Poqomchi' people|Poqomchi']], [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi']] and [[Ch'orti' people|Ch'orti']] peoples in the highlands. Their cities preserved many aspects of Maya culture.

The Maya civilization shares many features with other Mesoamerican civilizations due to the high degree of interaction and [[cultural diffusion]] that characterized the region. Advances such as writing, [[epigraphy]], and the [[Maya calendar|calendar]] did not originate with the Maya; however, their civilization fully developed them. Maya influence can be detected from [[Honduras]], [[Belize]], Guatemala, and Northern [[El Salvador]] to as far north as central Mexico, more than {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[Geography of Mesoamerica#Maya Region|Maya area]]. Many outside influences are found in [[Maya art]] and architecture, which are thought to have resulted from trade and cultural exchange rather than direct external conquest.

The [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala]] began in the early 16th century, led by conquistador [[Pedro de Alvarado]], who was appointed by [[Hernán Cortés]] to extend Spanish control into [[Central America]]. In 1523–1524, Alvarado launched a military campaign into the [[Guatemalan Highlands|Guatemalan highlands]], initially allying with the [[Kaqchikel language|Kaqchikel Maya]] to defeat their rivals, the [[Kʼicheʼ people|K'iche' (Quiché) Maya]]. However, relations with the Kaqchikel soon deteriorated, leading to further conflict and eventual Spanish dominance over the region.<ref>[http://www.lienzo.ufm.edu/cms/en/home Lienzo de Quauhquechollan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724103204/http://www.lienzo.ufm.edu/cms/en/home |date=24 July 2009 }} digital map exhibition on the History of the conquest of Guatemala.</ref>

On 11 September 1541, a catastrophic [[lahar]] from [[Volcán de Agua]] destroyed [[Ciudad Vieja]], prompting the relocation of the capital to the Panchoy Valley, where it was renamed [[Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala]] (now [[Antigua Guatemala]]). In 1542, the region was formally organized as the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] (Capitanía General de Guatemala), a subdivision of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]].

=== Independence and Central America (1821–1847) ===
[[File:Independenciacentroamerica2.jpg|thumb|left|Guatemalan [[Criollo people|criollos]] rejoice upon learning about the declaration of independence from Spain on 15 September 1821.]]

On 15 September 1821, [[Gabino Gaínza|Gabino Gainza Fernandez de Medrano]] and the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], an administrative region of the Spanish Empire consisting of [[Chiapas]], Guatemala, [[El Salvador]], Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras, officially proclaimed its independence from Spain at a public meeting in Guatemala City. Independence from Spain was gained, and the Captaincy General of Guatemala [[Central America under Mexican rule|joined]] the [[First Mexican Empire]] under [[Agustín de Iturbide]].

[[File:20230915 AI ARRIADA de BANDERA NACIONAL 4.jpg|thumb|right|National flag during the [[Días Patrios (Guatemala)|Independence Day]] ceremony (15 September)]]
Under the First Mexican Empire, Mexico reached its greatest territorial extent, stretching from northern&nbsp;California&nbsp;to the provinces of&nbsp;Central America&nbsp;(excluding&nbsp;Panama, which was then part of&nbsp;[[Gran Colombia]]), which had not initially approved becoming part of the Mexican Empire but joined the Empire shortly after their independence. This region was formally a part of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]] throughout the colonial period, but as a practical matter had been administered separately from Mexico. It was not until 1825 that Guatemala created its own flag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guatemalago.com/en/home/flag |title=Flag |publisher=Guatemala Go |access-date=22 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926191709/http://www.guatemalago.com/en/home/flag |archive-date=26 September 2013 }}</ref>

In 1838, the liberal forces of Honduran leader [[Francisco Morazán]] and Guatemalan [[José Francisco Barrundia]] invaded Guatemala and reached San Sur, where they executed Chúa Alvarez, father-in-law of [[Rafael Carrera]], then a military commander and later the first president of Guatemala. The liberal forces impaled Alvarez's head on a pike as a warning to followers of the Guatemalan [[caudillo]].{{sfn|González Davison|2008|pp=84-85}} Carrera and his wife Petrona – who had come to confront Morazán as soon as they learned of the invasion and were in [[Mataquescuintla]] – swore they would never forgive Morazán even in his grave; they felt it impossible to respect anyone who would not avenge family members.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=85}}

After sending several envoys, whom Carrera would not receive – and especially not Barrundia whom Carrera did not want to murder in cold blood – Morazán began a scorched-earth offensive, destroying villages in his path and stripping them of assets. The Carrera forces had to hide in the mountains.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=86}} Believing Carrera totally defeated, Morazán and Barrundia marched to [[Guatemala City]], and were welcomed as saviors by state governor Pedro Valenzuela and members of the conservative {{Interlanguage link|Aycinena clan|es|Clan Aycinena}}, who proposed to sponsor one of the liberal battalions, while Valenzuela and Barrundia gave Morazán all the Guatemalan resources needed to solve any financial problem he had.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=87}} The [[criollo people|criollos]] of both parties celebrated until dawn that they finally had a criollo caudillo like Morazán, who was able to crush the peasant rebellion.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=88}}
[[File:Federal Republic of Central America (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|The [[Federal Republic of Central America]] (1823–1838) with its capital in Guatemala City]]
Morazán used the proceeds to support Los Altos and then replaced Valenzuela with [[Mariano Rivera Paz]], a member of the Aycinena clan, although he did not return to that clan any property confiscated in 1829. In revenge, [[Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol]] voted to dissolve the [[Central American Federation]] in [[San Salvador]] a little later, forcing Morazán to return to El Salvador to fight for his federal mandate. Along the way, Morazán increased repression in eastern Guatemala, as punishment for helping Carrera.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=89}} Knowing that Morazán had gone to El Salvador, Carrera tried to take [[Salamá]] with the small force that remained, but was defeated, and lost his brother Laureano in combat. With just a few men left, he managed to escape, badly wounded, to [[Sanarate]].{{sfn|González Davison|2008|pp=91-92}} After recovering somewhat, he attacked a detachment in [[Jutiapa]] and got a small amount of booty which he gave to the volunteers who accompanied him. He then prepared to attack [[Petapa]] near Guatemala City, where he was victorious, although with heavy casualties.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=92}}

In September of that year, Carrera attempted an assault on the capital of Guatemala, but the liberal general [[Carlos Salazar Castro]] defeated him in the fields of [[Villa Nueva, Guatemala|Villa Nueva]] and Carrera had to retreat.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959|p=20 April}} After unsuccessfully trying to take [[Quetzaltenango]], Carrera found himself both surrounded and wounded. He had to capitulate to Mexican General [[Agustín Guzmán]], who had been in Quetzaltenango since [[Vicente Filísola]]'s arrival in 1823. Morazán had the opportunity to shoot Carrera, but did not, because he needed the support of the Guatemalan peasants to counter the attacks of [[Francisco Ferrera]] in [[El Salvador]]. Instead, Morazán left Carrera in charge of a small fort in Mita, without any weapons. Knowing that Morazán was going to attack El Salvador, Francisco Ferrera gave arms and ammunition to Carrera and convinced him to attack Guatemala City.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=96}}

Meanwhile, despite insistent advice to definitively crush Carrera and his forces, Salazar tried to negotiate with him diplomatically; he even went as far as to show that he neither feared nor distrusted Carrera by removing the fortifications of the Guatemalan capital, in place since the battle of Villa Nueva.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959|p=20 April}} Taking advantage of Salazar's good faith and Ferrera's weapons, Carrera took Guatemala City by surprise on 13 April 1839; Salazar, [[Mariano Gálvez]] and Barrundia fled before the arrival of Carrera's militiamen. Salazar, in his nightshirt, vaulted roofs of neighboring houses and sought refuge,{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959|p=48}}{{sfn|González Davison|2008|pp=122–127}} reaching the border disguised as a peasant.{{Sfn|Hernández de León|1959|p=48}}{{sfn|González Davison|2008|pp=122–127}} With Salazar gone, Carrera reinstated Rivera Paz as head of state.

Between 1838 and 1840 a [[Los Altos, Central America|secessionist movement]] in the city of [[Quetzaltenango]] founded the breakaway state of [[Los Altos (country)|Los Altos]] and sought independence from Guatemala. The most important members of the Liberal Party of Guatemala and liberal enemies of the conservative régime moved to Los Altos, leaving their exile in El Salvador.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959|p=?{{Page needed|date=April 2021}}}} The liberals in Los Altos began severely criticizing the Conservative government of Rivera Paz.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959|p=?{{Page needed|date=April 2021}}}} Los Altos was the region with the main production and economic activity of the former state of Guatemala. Without Los Altos, conservatives lost many of the resources that had given Guatemala hegemony in Central America.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959|p=?{{Page needed|date=April 2021}}}} The government of Guatemala tried to reach a peaceful solution, but two years of bloody conflict followed.

On 17 April 1839, Guatemala declared itself independent from the [[Federal Republic of Central America|United Provinces of Central America]]. In 1840, Belgium began to act as an external source of support for Carrera's independence movement, in an effort to exert influence in Central America. The ''Compagnie belge de colonisation'' (Belgian Colonization Company), commissioned by Belgian [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], became the administrator of [[Santo Tomas de Castilla]]{{sfn|Compagnie Belge de Colonisation|1844}} replacing the failed British [[Eastern Coast of Central America Commercial and Agricultural Company]].{{sfn|Compagnie Belge de Colonisation|1844}} Even though the colony eventually crumbled, Belgium continued to support Carrera in the mid-19th century, although Britain continued to be the main business and political partner to Carrera.{{sfn|Woodward|1993|p=498}} Rafael Carrera was elected Guatemalan Governor in 1844.

=== Republic ===
On 21 March 1847, Guatemala declared itself an independent republic and Carrera became its first president.

[[File:Guatemala Real 1847 Silver Coin Fonrobert 7236.jpg|thumb|Proclamation Coin 1847 of the independent Republic of Guatemala]]

==== Carrera government (1847–1851) ====
During the first term as president, Carrera brought the country back from extreme conservatism to a traditional moderation; in 1848, the liberals were able to drive him from office, after the country had been in turmoil for several months.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930}}{{sfn|Miceli|1974|p=72}} Carrera resigned of his own free will and left for México. The new liberal regime allied itself with the Aycinena family and swiftly passed a law ordering Carrera's execution if he returned to Guatemalan soil.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930}}

The liberal criollos from [[Quetzaltenango]] were led by general [[Agustín Guzmán]] who occupied the city after Corregidor general [[Mariano Paredes (Guatemala)|Mariano Paredes]] was called to [[Guatemala City]] to take over the presidential office.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=270}} They declared on 26 August 1848 that Los Altos was an independent state once again. The new state had the support of [[Doroteo Vasconcelos]]' régime in [[El Salvador]] and the rebel guerrilla army of Vicente and Serapio Cruz, who were sworn enemies of Carrera.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|pp=270–271}} The interim government was led by Guzmán himself and had Florencio Molina and the priest Fernando Davila as his Cabinet members.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=271}} On 5 September 1848, the criollos altenses chose a formal government led by Fernando Antonio Martínez.

In the meantime, Carrera decided to return to Guatemala and did so, entering at [[Huehuetenango]], where he met with native leaders and told them that they must remain united to prevail; the leaders agreed and slowly the segregated native communities started developing a new Indian identity under Carrera's leadership.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}} In the meantime, in the eastern part of Guatemala, the [[Jalapa]] region became increasingly dangerous; former president [[Mariano Rivera Paz]] and rebel leader Vicente Cruz were both murdered there after trying to take over the Corregidor office in 1849.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}}

When Carrera arrived to [[Chiantla]] in [[Huehuetenango]], he received two altenses emissaries who told him that their soldiers were not going to fight his forces because that would lead to a native revolt, much like that of 1840; their only request from Carrera was to keep the natives under control.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}} The altenses did not comply, and led by Guzmán and his forces, they started chasing Carrera; the caudillo hid, helped by his native allies and remained under their protection when the forces of [[Miguel Garcia Granados]] arrived from [[Guatemala City]] looking for him.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}}

On learning that officer [[José Víctor Zavala]] had been appointed as Corregidor in Suchitepéquez, Carrera and his hundred [[jakaltek people|jacalteco]] bodyguards crossed a dangerous jungle infested with [[jaguar]]s to meet his former friend. Zavala not only did not capture him, he agreed to serve under his orders, thus sending a strong message to both liberal and conservatives in Guatemala City that they would have to negotiate with Carrera or battle on two fronts – Quetzaltenango and Jalapa.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=278}} Carrera went back to the Quetzaltenango area, while Zavala remained in Suchitepéquez as a tactical maneuver.{{sfn|González Davison|2008}} Carrera received a visit from a cabinet member of Paredes and told him that he had control of the native population and that he assured Paredes that he would keep them appeased.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=278}} When the emissary returned to Guatemala City, he told the president everything Carrera said, and added that the native forces were formidable.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=279}}

Guzmán went to [[Antigua, Guatemala|Antigua]] to meet with another group of Paredes emissaries; they agreed that Los Altos would rejoin Guatemala, and that the latter would help Guzmán defeat his enemy and also build a port on the Pacific Ocean.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=279}} Guzmán was sure of victory this time, but his plan evaporated when in his absence Carrera and his native allies occupied Quetzaltenango; Carrera appointed Ignacio Yrigoyen as [[Corregidor (position)|Corregidor]] and convinced him that he should work with the K'iche', Q'anjobal and [[Mam people|Mam]] leaders to keep the region under control.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=280}} On his way out, Yrigoyen murmured to a friend: "Now he is the king of the Indians, indeed!"{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=280}}

Guzmán then left for Jalapa, where he struck a deal with the rebels, while [[Luis Batres Juarros]] convinced President Paredes to deal with Carrera. Back in Guatemala City within a few months, Carrera was commander-in-chief, backed by military and political support of the Indian communities from the densely populated western highlands.{{sfn|Weaver|1999|p=138}} During the first presidency, from 1844 to 1848, he brought the country back from excessive conservatism to a moderate regime, and – with the advice of Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol and [[Pedro de Aycinena]] – restored relations with the Church in Rome with a [[Concordat of 1854|Concordat]] ratified in 1854.{{sfn|Calvert|1985|p=36}}

==== Second Carrera government (1851–1865) ====
[[File:Carrerayturcios 2014-06-22 09-46.jpg|thumb|upright|Captain General [[Rafael Carrera]] after being appointed president for Life in 1854]]

After Carrera returned from exile in 1849 the president of El Salvador, [[Doroteo Vasconcelos]], granted asylum to the Guatemalan liberals, who harassed the Guatemalan government in several different ways. José Francisco Barrundia established a liberal newspaper for that specific purpose. Vasconcelos supported a rebel faction named "La Montaña" in eastern Guatemala, providing and distributing money and weapons. By late 1850, Vasconcelos was getting impatient at the slow progress of the war with Guatemala and decided to plan an open attack. Under that circumstance, the Salvadorean head of state started a campaign against the conservative Guatemalan regime, inviting [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]] to participate in the alliance; only the [[Honduras|Honduran]] government led by [[Juan Lindo]] accepted.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930}} In 1851 Guatemala defeated an Allied army from Honduras and El Salvador at the [[Battle of La Arada]].

In 1854 Carrera was declared "supreme and perpetual leader of the nation" for life, with the power to choose his successor. He held that position until he died on 14 April 1865. While he pursued some measures to set up a foundation for economic prosperity to please the conservative landowners, military challenges at home and a three-year war with Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua dominated his presidency.

His rivalry with Gerardo Barrios, President of El Salvador, resulted in open war in 1863. At [[Coatepeque, Quetzaltenango|Coatepeque]] the Guatemalans suffered a [[Battle of Coatepeque|severe defeat]], which was followed by a truce. Honduras joined with El Salvador, and Nicaragua and Costa Rica with Guatemala. The contest was finally settled in favor of Carrera, who besieged and occupied [[San Salvador]], and dominated Honduras and Nicaragua. He continued to act in concert with the Clerical Party, and tried to maintain friendly relations with European governments. Before he died, Carrera nominated his friend and loyal soldier, Army Marshall [[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]], as his successor.

{{blockquote|A conservative and archaic government, badly organized and with worse intentions, was in charge of the country, centralizing all powers in Vicente Cerna, ambitious military man, who not happy with the general rank, had promoted himself to the Army Marshall rank, even though that rank did not exist and it does not exist in the Guatemalan military. The Marshall called himself President of the Republic, but in reality he was the foreman of oppressed and savaged people, cowardly enough that they had not dared to tell the dictator to leave threatening him with a revolution.}}

The State and Church were a single unit, and the conservative régime was strongly allied to the power of [[regular clergy]] of the [[Catholic Church]], who were then among the largest landowners in Guatemala. The tight relationship between church and state had been ratified by the [[Concordat of 1854|Concordat of 1852]], which was the law until Cerna was deposed in 1871.{{sfn|Aycinena|1854|pp=2–16}} Even liberal generals like {{Interlanguage link|Serapio Cruz|es}} realized that Rafael Carrera's political and military presence made him practically invincible. Thus the generals fought under his command,{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930}} and waited—for a long time—until Carrera's death before beginning their revolt against the tamer Cerna.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=428}} During Cerna's presidency, liberal party members were prosecuted and sent into exile; among them, those who started the Liberal Revolution of 1871.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930}}

In 1871, the merchants guild, Consulado de Comercio, lost their exclusive court privilege. They had major effects on the economics of the time, and therefore land management. From 1839 to 1871, the Consulado held a consistent monopolistic position in the regime.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/804741468045832887/pdf/28989.pdf|title=Inequality in Latin America: Breaking with History?|last=de Ferranti|first=David|publisher=World Bank|year=2004|location=Washington DC, USA|pages=109–122|access-date=10 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818104239/http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/804741468045832887/pdf/28989.pdf|archive-date=18 August 2017|url-status=live|author-link=David de Ferranti}}</ref>

==== Liberal governments (1871–1898) ====
{{Further|Justo Rufino Barrios}}
Guatemala's "Liberal Revolution" came in 1871 under the leadership of [[Justo Rufino Barrios]], who worked to modernize the country, improve trade, and introduce new crops and manufacturing. During this era coffee became an important crop for Guatemala.{{sfn|Foster|2000|pp=173–175}} Barrios had ambitions of reuniting Central America and took the country to war in an unsuccessful attempt to attain it, losing his life on the battlefield in 1885 against forces in El Salvador.

[[Manuel Barillas]] was president from 16 March 1886 to 15 March 1892. Manuel Barillas was unique among liberal presidents of Guatemala between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his successor peacefully. When election time approached, he sent for the three Liberal candidates to ask them what their government plan would be.{{sfn|De los Ríos|1948|p=78}} Happy with what he heard from general [[José María Reyna Barrios|Reyna Barrios]],{{sfn|De los Ríos|1948|p=78}} Barillas made sure that a huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicapán indigenous people came down from the mountains to vote for him. Reyna was elected president.{{Sfn|De los Ríos|1948|p=82}}

[[José María Reina Barrios]] was president between 1892 and 1898. During Barrios's first term in office, the power of the landowners over the rural peasantry increased. He oversaw the rebuilding of parts of [[Guatemala City]] on a grander scale, with wide, Parisian-style avenues. He oversaw Guatemala hosting the first "[[Exposición Centroamericana]]" ("Central American Fair") in 1897. During his second term, Barrios printed [[bond (finance)|bond]]s to fund his ambitious plans, fueling [[monetary inflation]] and the rise of popular opposition to his regime.

His administration also worked on improving the roads, installing national and international telegraphs and introducing electricity to Guatemala City. Completing a transoceanic railway was a main objective of his government, with a goal to attract international investors at a time when the [[Panama Canal]] was not yet built.

==== Manuel Estrada Cabrera regime (1898–1920) ====
{{Main|Manuel Estrada Cabrera}}
[[File:Estrada Cabrera, 16 yrs. Pres. of Guatemala LCCN2016821114 (cropped).tif|thumb|[[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]] governed Guatemala between 1898 and 1920.]]
After the assassination of general [[José María Reina Barrios]] on 8 February 1898, the Guatemalan cabinet called an emergency meeting to appoint a new successor, but declined to invite Estrada Cabrera to the meeting, even though he was the designated successor to the presidency. There are two different descriptions of how Cabrera was able to become president. The first states that Cabrera entered the cabinet meeting "with pistol drawn" to assert his entitlement to the presidency,{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=54}} while the second states that he showed up unarmed to the meeting and demanded the presidency by virtue of being the designated successor.{{sfn|Arévalo Martinez|1945|p=42}}

The first civilian Guatemalan head of state in over 50 years, Estrada Cabrera overcame resistance to his regime by August 1898 and called for elections in September, which he won handily.{{sfn|Arévalo Martinez|1945|p=46}} In 1898 the legislature convened for the election of President Estrada Cabrera, who triumphed thanks to the large number of soldiers and policemen who went to vote in civilian clothes and to the large number of illiterate family that they brought with them to the polls.{{sfn|Torres Espinoza|2007|p=42}}

One of Estrada Cabrera's most famous and most bitter legacies was allowing the entry of the [[United Fruit Company]] (UFCO) into the Guatemalan economic and political arena. As a member of the [[Liberalism in Latin America|Liberal Party]], he sought to encourage development of the nation's infrastructure of [[highway]]s, [[railroad]]s, and [[sea port]]s for the sake of expanding the export economy. By the time Estrada Cabrera assumed the presidency there had been repeated efforts to construct a railroad from the major port of [[Puerto Barrios]] to the capital, Guatemala City. Owing to lack of funding exacerbated by the collapse of the internal coffee trade, the railway fell {{convert|60|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} short of its goal. Estrada Cabrera decided, without consulting the legislature or judiciary, that striking a deal with the UFCO was the only way to finish the railway.{{sfn|Dosal|1993}} Cabrera signed a contract with UFCO's [[Minor Cooper Keith]] in 1904 that gave the company tax exemptions, land grants, and control of all railroads on the Atlantic side.{{sfn|Chapman|2007}}

In 1906 Estrada faced serious revolts against his rule; the rebels were supported by the governments of some of the other [[Central America]]n nations, but Estrada succeeded in putting them down. Elections were held by the people against the will of Estrada Cabrera and thus he had the president-elect murdered in retaliation. In 1907 Estrada narrowly survived an assassination attempt when a bomb exploded near his carriage.{{sfn|de Aerenlund|2006}} It has been suggested that the extreme despotic characteristics of Estrada did not emerge until after an attempt on his life in 1907.{{sfn|Arévalo Martinez|1945|p=146}}

[[Guatemala City]] was badly damaged in the [[1917 Guatemala earthquake]].

Estrada Cabrera continued in power until forced to resign after new revolts in 1920. By that time his power had declined drastically and he was reliant upon the loyalty of a few generals. While the United States threatened intervention if he was removed through revolution, a bipartisan coalition came together to remove him from the presidency. He was removed from office after the national assembly charged that he was mentally incompetent, and appointed [[Carlos Herrera]] in his place on 8 April 1920.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=27}}

Guatemala joined with El Salvador and Honduras in the Federation of Central America from 9 September 1921 until 14 January 1922.

Carlos Herrera served as President of Guatemala from 1920 until 1921. He was succeeded by [[José María Orellana]], who served from 1921 until 1926. [[Lázaro Chacón González]] then served until 1931.

==== Jorge Ubico regime (1931–1944) ====
{{Main|Jorge Ubico}}
[[File:Presidente Jorge Ubico Castañeda.png|thumb|upright|Jorge Ubico in 1931]]
The [[Great Depression]] began in 1929 and badly damaged the Guatemalan economy, causing a rise in [[unemployment]], and leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Afraid of a popular revolt, the Guatemalan landed elite lent their support to [[Jorge Ubico]], who had become well known for "efficiency and cruelty" as a provincial governor. Ubico won the election that followed in 1931, in which he was the only candidate.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=12–15}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=10–11}} After his election his policies quickly became authoritarian. He replaced the system of debt [[peon]]age with a brutally enforced [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] law, requiring all men of working age who did not own land to work a minimum of 100 days of hard labor.{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} His government used unpaid Indian labor to build roads and railways. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property,{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} an action described by historians as legalizing murder.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=13}} He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it into one of the most efficient and ruthless in Latin America.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=17}} He gave them greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. These laws created tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=29–32}} The government became highly militarized; under his rule, every provincial governor was a general in the army.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=14}}

Ubico continued his predecessor's policy of making massive concessions to the United Fruit Company, often at a cost to Guatemala. He granted the company {{convert|200000|ha|acre}} of public land in exchange for a promise to build a port, a promise he later waived.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=22}} Since its entry into Guatemala, the UFCO had expanded its land-holdings by displacing farmers and converting their farmland to [[banana plantation]]s. This process accelerated under Ubico's presidency, with the government doing nothing to stop it.{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=19}} The company received import duty and real estate tax exemptions from the government and controlled more land than any other individual or group. It also controlled the sole railroad in the country, the sole facilities capable of producing electricity, and the port facilities at [[Puerto Barrios]] on the Atlantic coast.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=67–71}}

Ubico saw the United States as an ally against the supposed communist threat of Mexico, and made efforts to gain its support. When the US [[United States declaration of war upon Germany (1941)|declared war]] against Germany in 1941, Ubico acted on American instructions and arrested all people in Guatemala of [[German Guatemalan|German descent]].{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=20}} He also permitted the US to establish an air base in Guatemala, with the stated aim of protecting the [[Panama Canal]].{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=37}} However, Ubico was an admirer of European [[Fascism|fascist]]s, such as [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Benito Mussolini]],{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=19}} and considered himself to be "another [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]".{{sfn|De los Ríos|1948|p=98}} He occasionally compared himself to [[Adolf Hitler]].{{sfn|Shillington|2002|pp=38–39}} He dressed ostentatiously and surrounded himself with statues and paintings of Napoleon, regularly commenting on the similarities between their appearances. He militarized numerous political and social institutions—including the post office, schools, and symphony orchestras—and placed military officers in charge of many government posts.{{sfn|Streeter2000|pp=11–12}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=32}}{{sfn|Grandin|2000|p=195}}{{sfn|Benz|1996|pp=16–17}}{{sfn|Loveman|Davies|1997|pp=118–120}}

==== Guatemalan Revolution (1944–1954) ====
{{Main|Guatemalan Revolution}}
On 1 July 1944 Ubico was forced to resign from the presidency in response to a wave of protests and a [[general strike]] inspired by brutal labor conditions among plantation workers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Forster|first=Cindy|title=The Time of "Freedom": San Marcos Coffee Workers and the Radicalization of the Guatemalan National Revolution, 1944–1954|journal=Radical History Review|year=1994|volume=1994|issue=58|pages=35–78|doi=10.1215/01636545-1994-58-35 |issn=0163-6545 }}</ref> His chosen replacement, General [[Juan Federico Ponce Vaides]], was forced out of office on 20 October 1944 by a [[coup d'état]] led by Major [[Francisco Javier Arana]] and Captain [[Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán]].

==== Coup and civil war (1954–1996) ====
{{Main|1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|Guatemalan Civil War|Guatemalan genocide}}
{{see also|United States involvement in regime change}}
Despite their popularity within the country, the reforms of the Guatemalan Revolution were disliked by the United States government, which was predisposed by the [[Cold War]] to see it as communist, and by the UFCO, whose hugely profitable business had been affected by the end to brutal labor practices.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=15–16}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=48–50}} The attitude of the US government was also influenced by a propaganda campaign carried out by the UFCO.{{sfn|Paterson|2009|p=304}}

US President [[Harry Truman]] authorized [[Operation PBFortune]] to topple Árbenz in 1952, with the support of Nicaraguan dictator [[Anastasio Somoza García]],{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|p=102}} but the operation was aborted when too many details became public.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|p=102}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=228–231}} [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was elected US president in 1952, promising to take a harder line against communism; the close links that his staff members [[John Foster Dulles]] and [[Allen Dulles]] had to the UFCO also predisposed him to act against Árbenz.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=122–127}} Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSuccess in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by [[Carlos Castillo Armas]].{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=161–170}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=171–175}} The force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of [[psychological warfare]], including bombings of [[Guatemala City]] and an anti-Árbenz radio station claiming to be genuine news.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=161–170}} The invasion force fared poorly militarily, but the psychological warfare and the possibility of a US invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army, which refused to fight. Árbenz resigned on 27 June.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=173–178}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=190–204}}

Following negotiations in [[San Salvador]], Carlos Castillo Armas became president on 7 July 1954.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=173–178}} Elections were held in early October, from which all political parties were barred from participating. Castillo Armas was the only candidate and won the election with 99% of the vote.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=173–178}} Castillo Armas reversed [[Decree 900]] and ruled until 26 July 1957, when he was assassinated by Romeo Vásquez, a member of his personal guard. After the rigged<ref name="Chomsky 1985 154–160" /> election that followed, General [[José Miguel Ramón Ydígoras Fuentes|Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes]] assumed power. He is celebrated for challenging the Mexican president to a gentleman's [[duel]] on the bridge on the south border to end a feud on the subject of illegal fishing by Mexican boats on Guatemala's Pacific coast, two of which were sunk by the Guatemalan Air Force. Ydigoras authorized the training of 5,000 anti-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]] [[Cubans]] in Guatemala. He also provided airstrips in the region of [[Petén (department)|Petén]] for what later became the US-sponsored, failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in 1961.

On 13 November 1960, a group of left-wing junior military officers of the ''Escuela Politécnica'' national military academy led a failed revolt against Ydigoras' government. The rebels fled to the mountains of eastern Guatemala and neighboring Honduras and formed MR-13 ([[Revolutionary Movement 13th November|Movimiento Revolucionario 13 Noviembre]]). On 6 February 1962, in Bananera, they attacked the offices of the United Fruit Company. The attack sparked sympathetic strikes and university student [[walkout]]s throughout the country, to which the government responded with a violent crackdown.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael|last=McClintock|title=The American Connection|volume=2|chapter=State Terror and Popular Resistance in Guatemala|page=50|location=London, UK|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QO5qAAAAMAAJ|publisher=Zed|year=1985|isbn=9780862322595}}</ref>

In 1963, Ydígoras, despite the firm opposition of the [[Kennedy administration]], had pledged to allow Arévalo return from exile and run in a free and open election. Arévalo returned on 27 March 1963 to announce his candidacy for the scheduled November presidential elections, however Ydigoras' government was ousted on 31 March 1963, when the Guatemalan Air Force attacked several military bases; the coup was led by his Defense Minister, Colonel [[Enrique Peralta Azurdia]].<ref name=Rabe>{{cite book|last1=Rabe|first1=Stephen G.|author-link=Stephen G.

In 1966, [[Julio César Méndez Montenegro]] was elected president of Guatemala under the banner "Democratic Opening". Mendez Montenegro was the candidate of the Revolutionary Party, a center-left party that had its origins in the post-Ubico era. During this time, rightist [[paramilitary]] organizations, such as the "White Hand" (''[[Mano Blanca]]''), and the Anticommunist Secret Army (''Ejército Secreto Anticomunista'') were formed. Those groups were the forerunners of the infamous "[[Death squad|Death Squads]]". Military advisers from the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Army Special Forces]] (Green Berets) were sent to Guatemala to train Guatemala's armed forces and help transform it into a modern counter-insurgency force, which eventually made it the most sophisticated in Central America.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=Turning the Tide|url=https://archive.org/details/turningtideusint00chom|url-access=registration|year=1985|publisher=South End Press|location=Boston, Massachusetts}}</ref>

In 1970, Colonel [[Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio]] was elected president. By 1972, members of the guerrilla movement entered the country from Mexico and settled in the Western Highlands. In the [[Guatemalan general election, 1974|disputed election of 1974]], General [[Kjell Eugenio Laugerud García|Kjell Laugerud García]] defeated General [[Efraín Ríos Montt]], a candidate of the Christian Democratic Party, who claimed that he had been cheated out of a victory through fraud.

On 4 February 1976, a major earthquake destroyed several cities and caused more than 25,000 deaths, especially among the poor, whose housing was substandard. The government's failure to respond rapidly to the aftermath of the earthquake and to relieve homelessness gave rise to widespread discontent, which contributed to growing popular unrest. General [[Romeo Lucas García]] assumed power in 1978 in a fraudulent election.

The 1970s saw the rise of two new guerrilla organizations, the Guerrilla Army of the Poor (EGP) and the Organization of the People in Arms (ORPA). They began guerrilla attacks that included urban and rural warfare, mainly against the military and some civilian supporters of the army. The army and the paramilitary forces responded with a brutal counter-insurgency campaign that resulted in tens of thousands of civilian deaths.{{sfn|LaFeber|1993|p=165}} In 1979, US President [[Jimmy Carter]], who had until then been providing public support for the government forces, ordered a ban on all military aid to the Guatemalan Army because of its widespread and systematic abuse of human rights.<ref name="Chomsky 1985 154–160" /> However, documents have since come to light that suggest that American aid continued throughout the Carter years, through clandestine channels.<ref>{{cite book

During the first ten years of the civil war, the victims of the state-sponsored terror were primarily students, workers, professionals, and opposition figures, but in the last years they were thousands of mostly rural [[Maya peoples|Maya]] farmers and non-combatants. More than 450 Maya villages were destroyed and over 1 million people became refugees or displaced within Guatemala.

In 1995, the Catholic Archdiocese of Guatemala began the Recovery of Historical Memory (REMHI) project,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ogle |first1=Kathy |title=Guatemala's REMHI Project: Memory Form Below |url=https://nacla.org/article/guatemala%25E2%2580%2599s-remhi-project-memory-form-below |website=nacla Reporting on the Americas since 1967 |publisher=North American Congress on Latin America |access-date=9 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710102422/https://nacla.org/article/guatemala%25E2%2580%2599s-remhi-project-memory-form-below |archive-date=10 July 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref> known in Spanish as "El Proyecto de la Recuperación de la Memoria Histórica", to collect the facts and history of Guatemala's long civil war and confront the truth of those years. On 24 April 1998, REMHI presented the results of its work in the report "Guatemala: Nunca Más!". This report summarized testimony and statements of thousands of witnesses and victims of repression during the Civil War.

According to the report, ''Recuperación de la Memoria Histórica'' (REMHI), some 200,000 people died. More than one million people were forced to flee their homes and hundreds of villages were destroyed. The Historical Clarification Commission attributed more than 93% of all documented violations of human rights to Guatemala's military government, and estimated that Maya Indians accounted for 83% of the victims. It concluded in 1999 that state actions constituted genocide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6216414.stm |title=Gibson film angers Mayan groups |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128225841/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6216414.stm |archive-date=28 November 2009 |work=BBC News |date=8 December 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_guatemala1.html |title=Genocide – Guatemala 1982 |publisher=Peace Pledge Union |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040203052222/http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_guatemala1.html |archive-date=3 February 2004 }}</ref>

==== Since 2000 ====
Since the peace accords Guatemala has had both economic growth and successive democratic elections, most recently in 2023. In the 2023 elections, [[Bernardo Arévalo]] won the presidency. He assumed office in January 2024.

In January 2012 Efrain Rios Montt, the former dictator of Guatemala, appeared in a Guatemalan court on genocide charges. During the hearing, the government presented evidence of over 100 incidents involving at least 1,771 deaths, 1,445 rapes, and the displacement of nearly 30,000 Guatemalans during his 17-month rule from 1982 to 1983. The prosecution wanted him incarcerated because he was viewed as a flight risk but he remained free on bail, under house arrest and guarded by the Guatemalan National Civil Police (PNC). On 10 May 2013, Rios Montt was found guilty and sentenced to 80 years in prison. It marked the first time that a national court had found a former head of state guilty of genocide.<ref>

The Guatemalan government arraigned her, since it had enough evidence to suspect her involvement in the "La Linea" scandal. The prominence of US Ambassador Todd Robinson in the Guatemalan political scene once the scandal broke led to the suspicion that the US government was behind the investigation, perhaps because it needed an honest government in Guatemala to counter the presence of China and Russia in the region.<ref name=porras2015>

Leaders of the political opposition have also been implicated in CICIG investigations: several legislators and members of Libertad Democrática Renovada party (LIDER) were formally accused of bribery-related issues, prompting a large decline in the electoral prospects of its presidential candidate, Manuel Baldizón, who until April had been almost certain to become the next Guatemalan president in the 6 September 2015 presidential elections.

CICIG reported its cases so often on Thursdays that Guatemalans coined the term "CICIG Thursdays". But a Friday press conference brought the crisis to its peak: on Friday 21 August 2015, the CICIG and Attorney General Thelma Aldana presented enough evidence to convince the public that both President Pérez Molina and former vice President Baldetti were the actual leaders of "La Línea". Baldetti was arrested the same day and an impeachment was requested for the president. Several cabinet members resigned and the clamor for the president's resignation grew after Perez Molina defiantly assured the nation in a televised message broadcast on 23 August 2015 that he was not going to resign.<ref name=periodico21a>{{cite news

Thousands of protesters took to the streets again, this time to demand the increasingly isolated president's resignation. Guatemala's Congress named a commission of five legislators to consider whether to remove the president's immunity from prosecution. The Supreme Court approved. A major day of action kicked off early on 27 August, with marches and roadblocks across the country. Urban groups who had spearheaded regular protests since the scandal broke in April, on the 27th sought to unite with the rural and indigenous organizations who orchestrated the road blocks.

The strike in Guatemala City was full of a diverse and peaceful crowd ranging from the indigenous poor to the well-heeled, and it included many students from public and private universities. Hundreds of schools and businesses closed in support of the protests. The ''Comité Coordinador de Asociaciones Agrícolas, Comerciales, Industriales y Financieras'' (CACIF) Guatemala's most powerful business leaders, issued a statement demanding that Pérez Molina step down, and urged Congress to withdraw his immunity from prosecution.<ref name=cacifMolina>

In June 2016 a United Nations-backed prosecutor described the administration of Pérez Molina as a crime syndicate and outlined another corruption case, this one dubbed ''Cooperacha'' (Kick-in). The head of the Social Security Institute and at least five other ministers pooled funds to buy Molina luxurious gifts such as motorboats, spending over $4.7 million in three years.<ref>

===== Jimmy Morales and Alejandro Giammattei in power (2016–2024) =====
In the [[2015 Guatemalan general election|October 2015 presidential election]], former TV comedian [[Jimmy Morales]] was elected as the new president of Guatemala after huge anti-corruption demonstrations. He took office in January 2016.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35320332|title=Jimmy Morales inaugurated as new Guatemala president|work=BBC News|date=15 January 2016|access-date=8 January 2024|archive-date=3 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230403230047/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35320332|url-status=live}}</ref>

In December 2017, President Morales announced that Guatemala will move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, becoming the first nation to follow the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/guatemala-says-it-will-move-its-embassy-from-tel-aviv-to-jerusalem-1.5629570|title=Guatemala says it will move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem|newspaper=Haaretz|access-date=8 January 2024|archive-date=10 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220410053035/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/guatemala-says-it-will-move-its-embassy-from-tel-aviv-to-jerusalem-1.5629570|url-status=live}}</ref>

In January 2020, [[Alejandro Giammattei]] replaced Jimmy Morales as the president of Guatemala.

In August 2023, [[Bernardo Arévalo]], the candidate of the center-left [[Semilla (political party)|Semilla]] (Seed) Movement, had a landslide victory in Guatemala's [[2023 Guatemalan general election|presidential election]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Arevalo wins Guatemala presidency in landslide amid hopes for change |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/21/arevalo-wins-guatemala-presidency-in-landslide-amid-hopes-for-change?traffic_source=KeepReading |work=www.aljazeera.com |language=en |access-date=8 January 2024 |archive-date=31 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231231184044/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/21/arevalo-wins-guatemala-presidency-in-landslide-amid-hopes-for-change?traffic_source=KeepReading |url-status=live }}</ref> The outgoing Giammattei administration attempted to control the outcome of the election by cracking down on journalists, anti-corruption investigators and social movements. After Arévalo's victory, the outgoing government attempted to prevent him from taking power.
