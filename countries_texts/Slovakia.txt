The oldest surviving human artefacts from Slovakia are found near [[Nové Mesto nad Váhom]] and are dated at 270,000&nbsp;BCE, in the [[Lower Paleolithic|Early Paleolithic]] era. These ancient tools, made by the [[Clactonian]] technique, bear witness to the ancient habitation of Slovakia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Neruda |first1=Petr |last2=Kaminská |first2=L.ubomira |title=Neanderthals at Bojnice in the Context of Central Europe |year=2013 |isbn=978-80-7028-407-0 |page=21 |publisher=Moravské Zemské Muzeum |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272944564 |access-date=19 November 2021}}</ref>

Other [[stone tool]]s from the [[Middle Paleolithic]] era (200,000–80,000&nbsp;BCE) come from the Prévôt (Prepoštská) cave in [[Bojnice]] and from other nearby sites.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://muzeumpraveku.sk/ |title=Museum of Prehistoric |last=Museum of Prehistoric Prepoštská Cave |work=muzeumpraveku.sk |year=2011 |access-date=25 November 2011 |archive-date=1 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211201025837/https://muzeumpraveku.sk/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The most important discovery from that era is a [[Neanderthal]] [[human skull|cranium]] (c. 200,000 BCE), discovered near [[Gánovce]], a village in northern Slovakia.

Archaeologists have found prehistoric human skeletons in the region, as well as numerous objects and vestiges of the [[Gravettian]] culture, principally in the river valleys of [[Nitra (river)|Nitra]], [[Hron]], [[Ipeľ]], [[Váh]] and as far as the city of [[Žilina]], and near the foot of the [[Vihorlat Mountains|Vihorlat]], Inovec, and [[Tribeč]] mountains, as well as in the [[Myjava]] Mountains. The most well-known finds include the oldest female statue made of [[mammoth]] bone (22,800&nbsp;BCE), the famous [[Venus of Moravany]]. The statue was found in the 1940s in [[Moravany nad Váhom]] near [[Piešťany]]. Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca thermophile [[gastropoda|gastropods]] of the [[Tertiary (period)|Tertiary]] period have come from the sites of Zákovská, Podkovice, Hubina, and Radošina. These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Central Europe]].

=== Bronze Age ===
During the [[Bronze Age]], the geographical territory of modern-day Slovakia went through three stages of development, stretching from 2000 to 800&nbsp;BCE. <!--I am not sure what the following sentences mean, so I put them into this comment: To this, their period belongs the well-known funeral culture of the [[Little Carpathians|Carpathians]] and that of the middle [[Danube]]. During the later Neolithic Age a considerable growth in cultural regions took place in Slovakia.--> Major cultural, economic, and political development can be attributed to the significant growth in production of copper, especially in central Slovakia (for example in [[Špania Dolina]]) and northwest Slovakia. [[Copper]] became a stable source of prosperity for the local population.

After the disappearance of the [[Čakany]] and [[Velatice]] cultures, the [[Lusatian culture|Lusatian]] people expanded building of strong and complex fortifications, with the large permanent buildings and administrative centres. Excavations of Lusatian [[Hillfort|hill forts]] document the substantial development of trade and agriculture at that period. The richness and diversity of tombs increased considerably. The inhabitants of the area manufactured arms, shields, jewellery, dishes, and statues.

=== Iron Age ===
[[File:Boii Biatec 1st. cen BC 2940416.jpg|thumb|[[Biatec]], presumably a king, who appeared on the Celtic coins minted by the [[Boii]] at the current location of Bratislava, 1st century B.C.]]

==== Hallstatt Period ====
The arrival of tribes from [[Thrace]] disrupted the people of the Kalenderberg culture, who lived in the hamlets located on the plain ([[Sereď]]) and in the hill forts like Molpír, near [[Smolenice]], in the [[Little Carpathians]]. During Hallstatt times, monumental burial mounds were erected in western Slovakia, with princely equipment consisting of richly decorated vessels, ornaments and decorations. The burial rites consisted entirely of cremation. Common people were buried in flat urnfield cemeteries.

A special role was given to weaving and the production of textiles. The local power of the "Princes" of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] disappeared in Slovakia during the century before the middle of first millennium BCE, after strife between the [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Thracian people and locals, resulting in abandonment of the old hill-forts. Relatively depopulated areas soon caught the interest of emerging [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, who advanced from the south towards the north, following the Slovak rivers, peacefully integrating into the remnants of the local population.

==== La Tène Period ====
From around 500&nbsp;BCE, the territory of modern-day Slovakia was settled by [[Celt]]s, who built powerful ''[[oppida]]'' on the sites of modern-day [[Bratislava]] and [[Devín]]. [[Biatec]]s, [[silver coin]]s with inscriptions in the Latin alphabet, represent the first known use of writing in Slovakia. At the northern regions, remnants of the local population of Lusatian origin, together with Celtic and later Dacian influence, gave rise to the unique [[Púchov culture]], with advanced crafts and iron-working, many hill-forts and fortified settlements of central type with the coinage of the "Velkobysterecky" type (no inscriptions, with a horse on one side and a head on the other). This culture is often connected with the Celtic tribe mentioned in Roman sources as [[Cotini]].

==== Roman Period ====
[[File:Trencin-Roman2.JPG|thumb|A Roman inscription at the castle hill of [[Trenčín]] (178–179 AD)]]
From 2&nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]], the expanding [[Roman Empire]] established and maintained a series of outposts around and just south of the [[Danube]], the largest of which were known as [[Carnuntum]] (whose remains are on the main road halfway between [[Vienna]] and [[Bratislava]]) and [[Brigetio]] (present-day [[Szőny]] at the Slovak-Hungarian border). Such Roman border settlements were built on the present area of [[Rusovce]], currently a suburb of [[Bratislava]]. The military fort was surrounded by a civilian [[vicus]] and several farms of the [[villa rustica]] type. The name of this settlement was [[Gerulata]]. The military fort had an auxiliary cavalry unit, approximately 300 horses strong, modelled after the [[Cananefates]]. The remains of Roman buildings have also survived in [[Stupava, Slovakia|Stupava]], [[Devín Castle]], Bratislava Castle Hill, and the Bratislava-[[Dúbravka, Bratislava|Dúbravka]] suburb.

Near the northernmost line of the Roman hinterlands, the [[Limes Romanus]], there existed the winter camp of [[Trenčín|Laugaricio]] (modern-day [[Trenčín]]) where the Auxiliary of Legion&nbsp;II fought and prevailed in a decisive battle over the Germanic [[Quadi]] tribe in 179&nbsp;CE during the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. The Kingdom of [[Vannius]], a kingdom founded by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]] tribes of [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]], as well as several small Germanic and [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribes]], including the Osi and [[Cotini]], existed in western and central Slovakia from 8–6&nbsp;BCE to 179&nbsp;CE.

=== Great invasions from the fourth to seventh centuries ===
In the second and third centuries CE, the [[Huns]] began to leave the [[Eurasian Steppe|Central Asian steppes]]. They crossed the Danube in 377&nbsp;CE and occupied [[Pannonia]], which they used for 75&nbsp;years as their base for launching looting-raids into Western Europe. However, [[Attila]]'s death in 453 brought about the disappearance of the [[Huns|Hunnic empire]]. In 568, a Turko-Mongol tribal confederacy, the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], conducted its invasion into the Middle Danube region. The Avars occupied the lowlands of the [[Pannonian Plain]] and established an empire dominating the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]].

In [[623]], the [[Early Slavs|Slavic population]] living in the western parts of Pannonia seceded from their empire after a revolution led by [[Samo]], a Frankish merchant.<ref name="Történeti Kronológia">{{cite book|last=Benda|first=Kálmán|title=Magyarország történeti kronológiája ''("The Historical Chronology of Hungary")''|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|year=1981|location=Budapest|page=44|isbn=963-05-2661-1}}</ref> After 626, the Avar power started a gradual decline<ref>Kristó, p.30–31</ref> but its reign lasted to 804.

=== Avars ===
In 568, the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], under Khagan [[Bayan I]] established an empire in the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]] that lasted for 250 years.<ref name="Hun Avar Hungarian Genetics 2019">{{Cite journal |last1=Neparáczki |first1=Endre |last2=Maróti |first2=Zoltán |last3=Kalmár |first3=Tibor |last4=Maár |first4=Kitti |last5=Nagy |first5=István |last6=Latinovics |first6=Dóra |last7=Kustár |first7=Ágnes |last8=Pálfi |first8=György |last9=Molnár |first9=Erika |last10=Marcsik |first10=Antónia |last11=Balogh |first11=Csilla |last12=Lőrinczy |first12=Gábor |last13=Gál |first13=Szilárd Sándor |last14=Tomka |first14=Péter |last15=Kovacsóczy |first15=Bernadett |date=12 November 2019 |title=Y-chromosome haplogroups from Hun, Avar and conquering Hungarian period nomadic people of the Carpathian Basin |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=9 |issue=1 |page=16569 |bibcode=2019NatSR...916569N |doi=10.1038/s41598-019-53105-5 |pmc=6851379 |pmid=31719606 |last16=Kovács |first16=László |last17=Raskó |first17=István |last18=Török |first18=Tibor}}</ref> 

=== Slavic states ===
The [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes settled in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the fifth century. Western Slovakia was the centre of [[Samo]]'s empire in the seventh century. A Slavic state known as the [[Principality of Nitra]] arose in the eighth century and its ruler [[Pribina]] had the first known Christian church of the territory of present-day Slovakia consecrated by 828. Together with neighbouring [[Moravia]], the principality formed the core of the [[Great Moravia]]n Empire from 833. The high point of this Slavonic empire came with the arrival of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in 863, during the reign of [[Duke]] [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]], and the territorial expansion under [[King]] [[Svätopluk I]].

Great Moravia arose around 830 when [[Mojmir I of Moravia|Mojmír I]] unified the [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes settled north of the [[Danube]] and extended the Moravian supremacy over them.<ref>'Europe', p.360</ref> When Mojmír I endeavoured to secede from the supremacy of the king of [[East Francia]] in 846, King [[Louis the German]] deposed him and assisted Mojmír's nephew [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]] (846–870) in acquiring the throne.<ref name="Korai Magyar Történeti Lexikon">{{cite book|last=Kristó|first=Gyula|title=Korai Magyar Történeti Lexikon (9–14. század) |trans-title=Encyclopedia of Early Hungarian History – 9th–14th centuries |publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|year=1994|location=Budapest|page=467|isbn=963-05-6722-9}}</ref> The new monarch pursued an independent policy: after stopping a Frankish attack in 855, he also sought to weaken the influence of Frankish priests preaching in his realm.

In 862, Prince [[Rastislav of Moravia]] rebelled against the [[Franks]], and after hiring [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] troops, won his independence; this was the first time that Hungarians expeditionary troops entered the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]].<ref name=":9">{{cite book |last=Bóna |first=István |url= |title=History of Transylvania Volume I.

On Rastislav's request, two brothers, Byzantine officials and missionaries [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] came in 863. Cyril developed the [[Glagolitic alphabet|first Slavic alphabet]] and translated the Gospel into the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language.

During Rastislav's reign, the [[Principality of Nitra]] was given to his nephew [[Svatopluk I of Moravia|Svätopluk]] as an [[appanage]].<ref name="caplovic"/> The rebellious prince allied himself with the Franks and overthrew his uncle in 870. Similarly to his predecessor, Svätopluk I (871–894) assumed the title of the king (''rex''). During his reign, the Great Moravian Empire reached its greatest territorial extent, when not only present-day [[Moravia]] and Slovakia but also present-day northern and [[central Hungary]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Bohemia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lusatia]], southern Poland and [[Vojvodina|northern Serbia]] belonged to the empire, but the exact borders of his domains are still disputed by modern authors.<ref name="Tóth">{{cite book|last=Tóth|first=Sándor László|title=Levediától a Kárpát-medencéig ''("From Levedia to the Carpathian Basin")''|publisher=Szegedi Középkorász Műhely|year=1998|location=Szeged|page=199|isbn=963-482-175-8}}</ref> Svatopluk also withstood attacks of the [[Hungarians|Magyar]] tribes and the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]], although sometimes it was he who hired the Magyars when waging war against [[East Francia]].<ref>page=51</ref>

In 880, [[Pope John&nbsp;VIII]] set up an independent [[ecclesiastical province]] in Great Moravia with Archbishop [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Methodius]] as its head. He also named the German cleric [[Wiching]] the Bishop of [[Nitra]].
[[File:Great Moravia.svg|thumb|left|Certain and disputed borders of Great Moravia under [[Svatopluk I of Moravia|Svatopluk I]] (according to modern historians)]]

After the death of Prince Svatopluk in 894, his sons [[Mojmir II of Moravia|Mojmír&nbsp;II]] (894–906?) and [[Svatopluk&nbsp;II]] succeeded him as the Prince of Great Moravia and the Prince of Nitra respectively.<ref name="caplovic"/> However, they started to quarrel for domination of the whole empire. Weakened by an internal conflict as well as by constant warfare with [[Eastern Francia]], Great Moravia lost most of its peripheral territories.

It is not known what happened with both Mojmír&nbsp;II and Svatopluk&nbsp;II because they are not mentioned in written sources after 906. In [[Battle of Pressburg|three battles]] (4–5&nbsp;July and 9&nbsp;August 907) near [[Bratislava]], the Magyars routed [[Bavaria]]n armies. Some historians put this year as the date of the break-up of the Great Moravian Empire, due to the Hungarian conquest; other historians take the date a little bit earlier (to 902).

Great Moravia left behind a lasting legacy in Central and Eastern Europe. The [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic script]] and its successor [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] were disseminated to other Slavic countries, charting a new path in their [[Sociocultural evolution|sociocultural development]].

=== Grand Principality of Hungary (895–1000) ===
{{Main|Principality of Hungary}}
Foundation of the [[Principality of Hungary|Hungarian state]] is connected to the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Hungarian conquerors]], who arrived from the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe|Pontic steppes]] as a confederation of [[Seven chieftains of the Magyars|seven tribes]]. The [[Hungarians]] arrived in the frame of a strong centralized steppe-empire under the leadership of Grand Prince [[Álmos]] and his son [[Árpád]], they became founders of the [[Árpád dynasty]], the Hungarian ruling dynasty and the Hungarian state.

Just a few decades after the collapse of the [[Pannonian Avars|Avar Khaganate]] in 822, once again a steppe empire, the Hungarian Grand Principality united the Carpathian Basin under its rule. Only the [[East Francia|East Frankish Empire]] had such military power that it could intervent in the formation of the new order. His leadership also wanted to eliminate the new steppe state because the East Frankish Empire lost Pannonia and its Christian Avar taxpayers, and his territory was hit by increasing attacks by the Hungarians, especially Bavaria, which was then the eastern province of the Eastern Frankish Kingdom. In 907, three East Francian armies led by [[Luitpold, Margrave of Bavaria|Luitpold]], Margrave of Bavaria, which entered the Hungarian territory in order to expel the Hungarians from the Carpathian Basin, is annihilated by the Hungarian army at the [[Battle of Pressburg]]. Luitpold, Margrave of Bavaria, Dietmar I, Archbishop of Salzburg, Prince Sieghard, 19 counts, 2 bishops, and 3 abbots are killed in the battle, together with the majority of the soldiers. The Hungarians secured the lands they gained during the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin, and prevented a future German invasion, the Germans did not launch an imperial scale campaign against Hungary for 123 years until 1030.<ref name="Szabados - Battle of Pressburg 2023">{{Cite web |last=Szabados |first=György |date=4 July 2023 |title="Ott az ország nekik adaték" – az "elfeledett" pozsonyi csata |trans-title=There, the country is given to them" - the "forgotten" Battle of Pressburg |url=https://mki.gov.hu/en/hirek-en/evfortulok-en/ott-az-orszag-nekik-adatek-az-elfeledett-pozsonyi-csata |website=Institute of Hungarian Research}}</ref>

[[File:Istvan-ChroniconPictum.jpg|thumb|[[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]], [[King of Hungary]]]]

In 972, the ruling prince [[Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|Géza]] of the [[Árpád dynasty]] officially started to integrate [[Principality of Hungary|Grand Principality of Hungary]] into Christian Western Europe. His son [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen I]] became the first [[King of Hungary]] after defeating his [[Paganism|pagan]] uncle [[Koppány]]. Under Stephen, Hungary was recognised as a Catholic [[Apostolic Majesty|Apostolic Kingdom]]. Applying to [[Pope Sylvester II]], Stephen received the insignia of royalty (including probably a part of the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]]) from the papacy.

In the years 1001–1002 and 1018–1029, Slovakia was part of the [[Kingdom of Poland]], having been conquered by [[Boleslaus I the Brave]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ottov historický atlas Slovensko|year=2012|publisher=Ottovo Nakladatelství|author1=Pavol Kršák|author2=Daniel Gurňák|isbn=978-80-7360-834-7|location=Praha|oclc=827000163}}</ref> After the territory of Slovakia was returned to Hungary, a semi-autonomous polity continued to exist (or was created in 1048 by king [[Andrew I of Hungary|Andrew I]]) called [[Duchy of Nitra]]. Comprising roughly the territory of [[Principality of Nitra]] and [[Bihar County|Bihar principality]], they formed what was called a ''tercia pars regni'', third of a kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Steinhübel|first=Ján|title=Nitrianské kniežatstvo: počiatky stredovekého Slovenska = The duchy of Nitra, the beginnings of the medieval Slovakia|year=2016|isbn=978-80-85501-64-3|edition=Druhé prepracované a doplnené vydanie|publisher=Vydavatel̕stvo Rak|location=Bratislava|oclc=966315215}}</ref>

This polity existed up until 1108/1110, after which it was not restored.

A significant decline in the population resulted from the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|invasion of the Mongols]] in 1241 and the subsequent famine. After the invasion, much of the territory was destroyed, but was recovered largely thanks to Hungarian king [[Béla IV of Hungary|Béla IV]]. However, in medieval times the area of Slovakia was characterised by German and [[Jewish]] immigration, burgeoning towns, construction of numerous stone castles, and the cultivation of the arts.<ref name="tibensky">{{cite book|author=Tibenský, Ján|title=Slovensko: Dejiny|publisher=Obzor|year=1971|location=Bratislava|display-authors=etal}}</ref> The arrival of German element sometimes proved a problem for the autochthonous Slovaks (and even Hungarians in the broader Hungary), since they often quickly gained most power in medieval towns, only to later refuse to share it. Breaking of old customs by Germans often resulted in national quarrels. One of which had to be sorted out by the king [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I.]] with the proclamation [[Privilegium pro Slavis]] (Privilege for Slovaks) in the year 1381. According to this privilege, Slovaks and [[Carpathian Germans|Germans]] were to occupy each half of the seats in the city council of [[Žilina]] and the mayor should be elected each year, alternating between those nationalities. This would not be the last such case.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Žilina v slovenských dejinách : zborník z vedeckej konferencie k 620. výročiu udelenia výsad pre žilinských Slovákov: Žilina 7. mája 2001|year=2002|publisher=Knižné Centrum Vyd|author=Richard Marsina|isbn=80-8064-158-7|location=Žilina|oclc=164889878}}</ref>

Owing to the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s expansion into Hungarian territory, [[Bratislava]] was designated the new capital of Hungary in 1536, ahead of the fall of the old Hungarian capital of [[Buda]] in 1541. It became part of the Austrian Habsburg monarchy, marking the beginning of a new era. The territory comprising modern Slovakia, then known as [[Upper Hungary]], became the place of settlement for nearly two-thirds of the [[Magyar tribes|Magyar]] nobility fleeing the Turks and became far more linguistically and culturally Hungarian than it was before.<ref name="books.google.pl"/> Partly thanks to old [[Hussite]] families and Slovaks studying under [[Martin Luther]], the region then experienced a growth in [[Protestantism]].<ref name="books.google.pl"/> For a short period in the 17th century, most Slovaks were [[Lutherans]].<ref name="books.google.pl"/> They defied the Catholic Habsburgs and sought protection from neighbouring [[Transylvania]], a rival continuation of the [[Magyar tribes|Magyar]] state that practised religious tolerance and normally had Ottoman backing. Upper Hungary, modern Slovakia, became the site of frequent wars between Catholics in the west territory and Protestants in the east, as well as against Turks; the frontier was on a constant state of military alert and heavily fortified by castles and citadels often manned by Catholic German and Slovak troops on the Habsburg side. By 1648, Slovakia was not spared the [[Counter-Reformation]], which brought the majority of its population from Lutheranism back to [[Roman Catholicism]]. In 1655, the printing press at the [[Trnava]] university produced the Jesuit Benedikt Szöllősi's Cantus Catholici, a Catholic hymnal in Slovak that reaffirmed links to the earlier works of Cyril and Methodius.

The [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman wars]], the rivalry between Austria and [[Transylvania]], and the frequent insurrections against the [[Habsburg monarchy]] inflicted a great deal of devastation, especially in the rural areas.<ref>"[http://www.slovakiasite.com/history-hungary.php Part of Hungary, Turkish occupation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230609042837/https://www.slovakiasite.com/history-hungary.php |date=9 June 2023 }}".

During the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolution of 1848–49]], the [[Slovak Volunteer Campaigns|Slovaks started uprising]], supporting the [[Emperor of Austria|Austrian Emperor]], hoping for independence from the Hungarian part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Dual Monarchy]] and greater autonomy within the empire. They failed to achieve their aim, but the conflict resulted in Slovak rights for language in certain administrative and educational areas. 

Thereafter, relations between the nationalities deteriorated (see [[Magyarisation]]), culminating in the secession of Slovakia from Hungary after World War I.<ref>{{cite web|title=Divided Memories: The Image of the First World War in the Historical Memory of Slovaks|publisher=Slovak Sociological Review, Issue 3|year=2003|url=http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=d5aaf7a2-7ccf-4f83-9409-e74d93a37525&articleId=283fe9e3-f8ed-463a-92cd-69ec0cb28b52|access-date=25 November 2012|archive-date=15 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220315170139/https://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=d5aaf7a2-7ccf-4f83-9409-e74d93a37525&articleId=283fe9e3-f8ed-463a-92cd-69ec0cb28b52|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Masaryk Independence Hall2.jpg|thumb|[[Czechoslovak declaration of independence]] by [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] in the United States, 1918]]

On 18 October 1918, [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik]] and [[Edvard Beneš]] declared in [[Washington, D.C.]] the [[Czechoslovak declaration of independence|independence]] for the territories of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Upper Hungary]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] from the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and proclaimed a common state, [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]].

During the chaos following the break-up of Austria-Hungary, Czechoslovakia was formed with numerous [[Czechs]], [[German people|Germans]], [[Slovaks]], [[Hungarians]] and [[Ruthenians]]. The borders were set by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint Germain]] in 1919 and [[Treaty of Trianon]] in 1920. By the treaties following the World War I, Czechoslovakia emerged as a sovereign European state.

During the [[Interwar period]], democratic Czechoslovakia was allied with France, and also with [[Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] ([[Little Entente]]); however, the [[Locarno Treaties]] of 1925 left East European security open. Both Czechs and Slovaks enjoyed a period of relative prosperity. There was progress in not only the development of the country's economy but also culture and educational opportunities. Yet the [[Great Depression]] caused a sharp economic downturn, followed by political disruption and insecurity in Europe.<ref>J.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Polisencky, ''History of Czechoslovakia in Outline'' (Prague: Bohemia International 1947) at 113–114.</ref>

In the 1930s, Czechoslovakia came under continuous pressure from the [[Revanchism|revanchist]] governments of Germany, Hungary and Poland who used the aggrieved minorities in the country as a useful vehicle. Revision of the borders was called for, as Czechs constituted only 43% of the population. Eventually, this pressure led to the [[Munich Agreement]] of September 1938, which allowed the majority ethnic Germans in the [[Sudetenland]], borderlands of Czechoslovakia, to join with Germany. The remaining minorities stepped up their pressures for autonomy and the State became federalised, with Diets in Slovakia and Ruthenia. The remainder of Czechoslovakia was renamed Czecho-Slovakia and promised a greater degree of Slovak political autonomy. This, however, failed to materialise.<ref>''Documents on British Foreign Policy 1919–1939'' edited by Professor E. L. Woodward, Roham Butler, M.A., and [[Margaret Lambert]], PhD., Third Series, vol.iv, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1951, pps:94–99: 'Memorandum on the Present Political Situation in Slovakia'.</ref> Parts of southern and eastern Slovakia were also reclaimed by Hungary at the [[First Vienna Award]] of November 1938.

After the [[Munich Agreement]] and its [[Vienna Award]], [[Nazi Germany]] threatened to annex part of Slovakia and allow the remaining regions to be partitioned by Hungary or Poland unless independence was declared.

A [[one-party state|one-party]] [[Clerical fascism|clerical fascist]] [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]] governed by the far-right [[Slovak People's Party|Hlinka's Slovak People's Party]] was led by President [[Jozef Tiso]] and Prime Minister [[Vojtech Tuka]]. The (First) Slovak Republic is primarily known for its [[collaborationism|collaboration]] with Nazi Germany, which included sending troops to the [[Slovak invasion of Poland|invasion of Poland]] in [[September Campaign|September 1939]] and the [[Operation Barbarossa|Soviet Union]] in 1941. On 24&nbsp;November 1940, Slovakia joined the [[Axis powers|Axis]] when its leaders signed the [[Tripartite Pact]]. The country was strongly influenced by Germany and gradually became a [[puppet state|puppet regime]] in many respects.

Meanwhile, the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] sought to reverse the [[Munich Agreement]] and the subsequent [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]] and to return the Republic to its 1937 boundaries. The government operated from [[London]] and it was ultimately considered, by those countries that recognised it, the legitimate government for [[Czechoslovakia]] throughout the Second World War.

After it became clear that the Soviet [[Red Army]] was going to push the Nazis out of eastern and central Europe, an anti-Nazi [[resistance movement]] launched.

Czechoslovakia was allied with communist regimes worldwide. As one of the first countries in the world acknowledged [[Kim Il-sung]]'s [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]]. After the beginning of the [[Korean War]], Czechoslovakia protested against measures taken by the Security Council.

On 17&nbsp;July 1992, Slovakia, led by Prime Minister [[Vladimír Mečiar]], declared itself a sovereign state, meaning that its laws took precedence over those of the federal government. Throughout the autumn of 1992, Vladimír Mečiar and [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Czech Prime Minister]] [[Václav Klaus]] negotiated the details for disbanding the federation. In November, the federal parliament voted to dissolve the country officially on 31&nbsp;December 1992.
