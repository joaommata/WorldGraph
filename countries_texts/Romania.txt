It is believed that the [[tribes]] responsible for creating the [[Bronze Age]] culture on the territory of modern Romania belonged to the [[Indo-European]] group of [[Thracians]].<ref>[[Vasile Pârvan]], ''Getica'', Chapter I, “Cimmero-Scythian Migrations. 10th–6th century BCE”, p. 25. – Editura Meridiane, Bucharest, 1982.</ref><ref>“Thus, archaeology has demonstrated that the Geto-Dacian people was fully formed at least four or even five centuries before its name appeared in the literary sources of the ancient world.

The Kingdom of Hungary collapsed, and the Ottomans occupied parts of [[Banat]] and [[Crișana]] in 1541.{{sfn|Pop|1999|pp=52–53}} Transylvania and [[Maramureș]], along with the rest of Banat and Crișana developed into a new state under Ottoman suzerainty, the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]].{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=41}} The [[Reformation]], initiated in Germany by [[Martin Luther]] in 1517, encouraged the rise of Protestantism and four denominations—[[Reformed Church in Romania|Calvinism]], [[Evangelical Church of Augustan Confession in Romania|Lutheranism]], [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania|Unitarianism]], and Roman Catholicism—were officially acknowledged in 1568.{{Who|date=March 2025}}{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=69}} The Romanians' Orthodox faith remained only tolerated,{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=69}} although they made up more than one-third of the population, according to 17th-century estimates.{{sfn|Trócsányi|Miskolczy|1994|p=419}}{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=71}}

The princes of Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia joined the [[Holy League (1594)|Holy League]] against the Ottoman Empire in 1594.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=54}} The Wallachian prince, [[Michael the Brave]], united the three principalities under his rule in May&nbsp;1600.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=35}}{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=55–56}} The neighbouring powers forced him to abdicate in September, but he became a symbol of the unification of the Romanian lands in the 19th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=35}} Although the rulers of the three principalities continued to pay tribute to the Ottomans, the most talented princes—[[Gabriel Bethlen]] of Transylvania, [[Matei Basarab]] of Wallachia, and [[Vasile Lupu]] of Moldavia—strengthened their autonomy.{{sfn|Pop|1999|pp=75–76}}

The united armies of the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] expelled the Ottoman troops from Central Europe between 1684 and 1699, and the Principality of Transylvania was integrated into the [[Habsburg monarchy]].{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=79}} The Habsburgs supported the Catholic clergy and persuaded the Orthodox Romanian prelates to accept the [[church union|union with the Roman Catholic Church]] in 1699.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=42}} In the [[18th century]], [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] maintained their internal autonomy, but in [[1711]] and [[1716]], respectively, the period of the [[Phanariots]] began, with rulers appointed directly by the Porte from among the noble families of [[Greeks|Greek]] origin in [[Constantinople]]. With the signing of the [[Ausgleich]] in [[1867]], [[Transylvania]] quickly lost its remaining political autonomy, being politically and administratively incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].<ref>Anton Dörner, “Administrarea Transilvaniei în perioada anilor 1867–1876”, Institutul de Istorie „George Barițiu” din Cluj-Napoca – Accessed 02.05.2009.</ref> The Church Union strengthened the Romanian intellectuals' devotion to their Roman heritage.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=60}} The Orthodox Church was restored in Transylvania only after Orthodox monks stirred up revolts in 1744 and 1759.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=61}} The organisation of the [[Transylvanian Military Frontier]] caused further disturbances, [[Siculicidium|especially among the Székelys in 1764]].{{sfn|Trócsányi|Miskolczy|1994|pp=432–434}}

Princes [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] of Moldavia and [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]] of Wallachia concluded alliances with the Habsburg Monarchy and Russia against the Ottomans, but they were dethroned in 1711 and 1714, respectively.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|pp=44–45}} The sultans lost confidence in the native princes and appointed Orthodox merchants from the [[Fener|Phanar]] district of Istanbul to rule Moldova and Wallachia.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|pp=55–56}}{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=73–74}} The [[Phanariotes|Phanariot]] princes pursued oppressive fiscal policies and dissolved the army.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=74–75, 78}} The neighbouring powers took advantage of the situation: the Habsburg Monarchy annexed the northwestern part of Moldavia, or [[Bukovina]], in 1775, and the [[Russian Empire]] seized the eastern half of Moldavia, or [[Bessarabia]], in 1812.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=92}}{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=75–76}}

A census revealed that the Romanians were more numerous than any other ethnic group in Transylvania in 1733, but legislation continued to use contemptuous adjectives (such as "tolerated" and "admitted") when referring to them.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=87}}{{sfn|Trócsányi|Miskolczy|1994|pp=427–428}} The [[Romanian Greek Catholic Church|Uniate bishop]], [[Inocențiu Micu-Klein]] who demanded recognition of the Romanians as the fourth privileged nation was forced into exile.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=89–90}}{{sfn|Trócsányi|Miskolczy|1994|pp=427–428}} Uniate and Orthodox clerics and laymen jointly signed a [[Supplex Libellus Valachorum|plea for the Transylvanian Romanians' emancipation]] in 1791, but the monarch and the local authorities refused to grant their requests.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|pp=73–74}}{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=87}}

The [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]] authorised the Russian ambassador in Istanbul to defend the autonomy of Moldavia and Wallachia (known as the [[Danubian Principalities]]) in 1774.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=68}} Taking advantage of the [[Greek War of Independence]], a Wallachian lesser nobleman, Tudor Vladimirescu, stirred up a revolt against the Ottomans in January&nbsp;1821, but he was murdered in June by Phanariot Greeks.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=103–104}} After a [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–29)|new Russo-Turkish War]], the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] strengthened the autonomy of the Danubian Principalities in&nbsp;1829, although it also acknowledged the sultan's right to confirm the election of the princes.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=81}}

[[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], [[Nicolae Bălcescu]] and other leaders of the [[Moldavian Revolution of 1848|1848 revolutions in Moldavia]] and [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|Wallachia]] demanded the emancipation of the peasants and the union of the two principalities, but Russian and Ottoman troops crushed their revolt.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=99}}{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|pp=96–97}} The Wallachian revolutionists were the first to adopt the blue, yellow and red [[Tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] as the [[Flag of Romania|national flag]].{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=100}} In Transylvania, most Romanians supported the imperial government against the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian revolutionaries]] after the Diet passed a law concerning the union of Transylvania and Hungary.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=100}} Bishop [[Andrei Șaguna]] proposed the unification of the Romanians of the Habsburg Monarchy in a separate duchy, but the central government refused to change the internal borders.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=99}}

====From the Little Union to the Great War====
The modern Romanian state was created through the [[Unification of the Romanian Principalities|unification of the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia]], accepted as a federative structure by the Great Powers following the [[Paris Convention]] of 1858, and later cemented by the simultaneous election as ruler of both states of the unionist [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]].<ref name="150_2012-07-06">[http://www.jurnalul.ro/special/150-de-ani-de-la-unirea-principatelor-romane-142961.htm 150 de ani de la Unirea Principatelor Române] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527144901/http://www.jurnalul.ro/special/150-de-ani-de-la-unirea-principatelor-romane-142961.htm |date=2012-05-27 }}, 24 January 2009, ''Jurnalul Național'', accessed 6 July 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.mnir.ro/ro/ExpozitiiTemporare/Expozitie.aspx?IDExpozitieTemp=68 National Museum of Romanian History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226155145/http://www.mnir.ro/ro/ExpozitiiTemporare/Expozitie.aspx?IDExpozitieTemp=68 |date=2009-02-26 }} – Unirea Principatelor Române, 150 de ani – Accessed 15 March 2009</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Bobango|first=Gerald J|title=The emergence of the Romanian national State|publisher=Boulder|year=1979|location=New York|isbn=9780914710516}}</ref> After carrying out numerous reforms that laid the foundations for the modernisation of the state, he was forced in 1866 by a broad coalition of the political parties of the time, also known as the "[[Monstrous coalition]]", to abdicate and leave the country.<ref name="FC">Constantiniu, Florin: ''A Sincere History of the Romanian People'', Bucharest, Editura Univers Enciclopedic, 1997 – ISBN 973-9243-07-X</ref>

The union was at one time in peril, but the political leaders of the era succeeded in placing on the princely throne [[Carol I of Romania]], who accepted the Constitution and took the oath on 10 May 1866. Eleven years later, on 10 May 1877, Romania proclaimed its independence—achieved on the battlefield—and in 1881, on the same day of the year, Carol was crowned as [[King of Romania]].

In 1916, Romania entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Entente Powers]].<ref>[http://www.casaromana.org/istoria/r_secolulxx.html Casa Română] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322072343/http://www.casaromana.org/istoria/r_secolulxx.html |date=2009-03-22 }} – The History of the Romanians – Accessed 15 March 2009</ref> Although the Romanian forces did not perform well militarily, by the end of the war the Austrian and Russian Empires had disintegrated; the National Assembly in [[Transylvania]], and the [[Sfatul Țării]] in [[Bessarabia]] and [[Bukovina]] proclaimed their union with Romania, and [[Ferdinand I of Romania|King Ferdinand I]] and [[Queen Maria of Romania|Queen Maria]] were crowned sovereign of all Romanians in [[Alba Iulia]] on 15 October 1922.<ref>[http://www.familiaregala.ro/?lng=&id2=010103 The Romanian Royal Family] – Ferdinand – Accessed 15 March 2009</ref> 

After [[World War I]], the union of [[Bukovina]] with Romania was ratified in 1919 by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint Germain]]. Most of the territories claimed by Romania from the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]—[[Crișana]], [[Transylvania]] and parts of [[Banat]] and [[Maramureș]]—were annexed to the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. This act was ratified in 1920 by the [[Treaty of Trianon]], which defined the new border between Hungary and Romania.

====Interwar period====
After having left the country and renounced his claim to the throne in 1925, [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] returned in 1930 and usurped his son’s throne; influenced by his inner circle—referred to by historians as the "Royal Camarilla"—he gradually undermined the democratic system, and in 1938 he assumed dictatorial powers. Although he was pro-Western (especially Anglophile), Carol attempted to appease extreme centrifugal forces by appointing nationalist governments that adopted anti-Semitic measures, such as the [[Goga cabinet]] and the one led by the Orthodox Patriarch [[Miron Cristea]].

====World War II: Positions and territorial losses====

Unaware of the details of the Soviet–German pact, Carol attempted to secure an alliance with [[Nazi Germany]], and appointed Ion Gigurtu as President of the Council of Ministers, who declared that he would pursue a Nazi pro-Axis (Berlin–Rome) policy that was anti-Semitic and fascist-totalitarian in nature.<ref>''Le Figaro'', 6 July 1940, p. 2.</ref><ref>''Le Figaro'', 9 July 1940, p. 1.</ref><ref>''New York Times'', 5 July 1940; ''New York Times'', 7 July 1940; ''New York Times'', 30 July 1940; ''New York Times'', 9 August 1940.</ref> Between 4 July and 4 September 1940, by accepting [[Second Vienna Award|Hitler's arbitration]] over Transylvania (after Gigurtu declared on radio that Romania must make territorial sacrifices to justify its Nazi orientation and full adherence to the Berlin–Rome Axis), Romania ceded [[Northern Transylvania]]—including the city of [[Cluj]]—to Hungary.<ref>''Le Figaro'', 9 August 1940; ''New York Times'', 9 August 1940.</ref><ref>Constantiniu, Florin: ''Between Hitler and Stalin; Romania and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact'', Bucharest, Editura Danubius, 1991.</ref><ref>Constantiniu, Florin: ''Hitler, Stalin and Romania – Romania and the Genesis of Operation “Barbarossa”'', Bucharest, Editura Univers Enciclopedic, 2002.</ref> The vast territories in Transylvania ceded by Ion Gigurtu to Hungary contained important natural resources, including gold mines.<ref>''Le Figaro'', 4 September 1940.</ref> Ion Gigurtu also initiated negotiations to cede 8,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria,<ref>''Le Figaro'', 23 August 1940.</ref> these negotiations were interrupted by Antonescu's unconditional acceptance of the territorial cession.<ref name="romlib2018-07-04">{{Citation | url=https://romanialibera.ro/special/documentare/75-de-ani-de-la-pierderea-cadrilaterului---mica-bijuterie-a-coroanei-romaniei-391941 | title=PHOTO. 75 Years since the Loss of the Quadrilateral – the Small Jewel of the Romanian Crown | newspaper=România liberă | date=2015-09-07 | first=Mihai | last=Diac | access-date=4 July 2018}}</ref>

In response to the chaotic withdrawal from Bessarabia, the territorial cessions, public discontent, and protests from political leaders, King Carol II suspended the [[1938 Constitution of Romania]] and appointed General [[Ion Antonescu]] as Prime Minister. This measure, supported by the [[Iron Guard]], demanded that the king abdicate in favour of his son, [[Mihai I of Romania|Mihai]]. Subsequently, Antonescu assumed dictatorial powers and became President of the Council of Ministers, as the self-titled "Leader" of the state.<ref name="barba">Constantiniu, Florin: ''Hitler, Stalin and Romania – Romania and the Genesis of Operation “Barbarossa”'', Bucharest, Univers Enciclopedic, 2002</ref><ref name="Encarta">“[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761559516_9/Romania.html History of Romania] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030124558/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761559516_9/Romania.html |date=2009-10-30 }}”.
