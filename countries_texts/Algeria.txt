From their principal center of power at [[Carthage]], the [[Carthaginians]] expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a [[Phoenicia]]n presence existed at [[Tipasa]], east of [[Cherchell]], [[Hippo Regius]] (modern [[Annaba]]) and [[Rusicade]] (modern [[Skikda]]). These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.

As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. Berber civilisation was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organisation supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.

In 146 BC, the city of [[Carthage]] was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay [[Mauretania]], which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in modern-day [[Morocco]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilisation, unequalled until the coming of the [[Almohads]] and [[Almoravids]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC.

After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Masinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].

For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region. Algeria is home to the second-largest number of Roman sites and remains after Italy. Rome, after getting rid of its powerful rival Carthage in the year 146 BC, decided a century later to include Numidia to become the new master of North Africa. They built more than 500 cities.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.penguintravel.com/Offer/RoundtripsandCulturalTours/2062/AlgeriasRomanHeritage.html#:~:text=Algeria%20is%20the%20second%20country,new%20master%20of%20North%20Africa. | title=Algeria's Roman Heritage – Roundtrips and Cultural Tours Penguin Travel | access-date=22 April 2023 | archive-date=22 April 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230422142230/https://www.penguintravel.com/Offer/RoundtripsandCulturalTours/2062/AlgeriasRomanHeritage.html#:~:text=Algeria%20is%20the%20second%20country,new%20master%20of%20North%20Africa. | url-status=live }}</ref> Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products.

It was succeeded by another Kingdom based in Altava, the [[Kingdom of Altava]].

The Christians left in three waves: after the initial conquest, in the 10th century and the 11th.

During the [[Middle Ages]], North Africa was home to the Jewish scholar [[Judah ibn Kuraishi]], the first grammarian to write about Semitic and Berber languages, as well as the  [[Sufism|Sufi]] masters [[Abu Madyan|Sidi Boumediene (Abu Madyan)]] and [[Sidi El Houari]], and the Emirs [[Abd al-Mu'min|Abd Al Mu'min]] and [[Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan|Yāghmūrasen]]. It was during this time that the [[Fatimids]] or children of [[Fatima]], daughter of [[Muhammad]], came to the [[Maghreb]]. These "Fatimids" went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, [[Hejaz]] and the [[Levant]], boasting a secular inner government, as well as a powerful army and navy, made up primarily of [[Arabs]] and [[Levant]]ines extending from Algeria to their capital state of [[Cairo]]. The [[Fatimid caliphate]] began to collapse when its governors the [[Zirids]] seceded. To punish them the Fatimids sent the Arab [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] against them. The resultant war is recounted in the epic [[Taghribat Bani Hilal|Tāghribāt]]. In Al-Tāghrībāt the Amazigh Zirid Hero [[Khalifa al-Zanati|Khālīfā Al-Zānatī]] asks daily, for duels, to defeat the Hilalan hero [[Abu Zayd al-Hilali|Ābu Zayd al-Hilalī]] and many other Arab knights in a string of victories. The [[Zirid]]s, however, were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of Arab customs and culture. The indigenous [[Berber people|Amazigh]] tribes, however, remained largely independent, and depending on tribe, location and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times unifying it (as under the Fatimids). The Fatimid Islamic state, also known as [[Fatimid Caliphate]] made an Islamic empire that included North Africa, Sicily, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], the [[Red Sea]] coast of Africa, Tihamah, [[Hejaz]] and [[Yemen]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202580/Fatimid-Dynasty/2238/Conquest-of-Egypt|title=Fatimid Dynasty (Islamic dynasty)|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=29 August 2013|url-status=live|archive-date=1 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101203234/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202580/Fatimid-Dynasty/2238/Conquest-of-Egypt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_carte.php?carte=carte-05 |title=Qantara |publisher=Qantara-med.org |access-date=13 September 2013 |archive-date=9 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009220925/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_carte.php?carte=carte-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=595 |title=Qantara – Les Almoravides (1056–1147) |publisher=Qantara-med.org |access-date=13 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921185314/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=595 |archive-date=21 September 2013 }}</ref> Caliphates from Northern Africa traded with the other empires of their time, as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the Islamic Era.

The [[Berber people]] historically consisted of several tribes. The two main branches were the Botr and Barnès tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, [[Sanhadja]], [[Houara]], [[Zenata]], [[Masmuda|Masmouda]], [[Kutama]], Awarba, and [[Berghwata]]). All these tribes made independent territorial decisions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&pg=PR2|title=Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale Par Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin Slane|trans-title=History of the Berbers and the Muslim dynasties of northern Africa|language=fr|page=XV|author=Khaldūn, Ibn|year=1852|access-date=22 August 2020|archive-date=28 March 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240328154337/https://books.google.com/books?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&pg=PR2#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Rustamid realm stretched from Tafilalt in Morocco to the Nafusa mountains in Libya including south, central and western Tunisia therefore including territory in all of the modern day Maghreb countries, in the south the Rustamid realm expanded to the modern borders of [[Mali]] and included territory in [[Mauritania]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=MmtBAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT311 The Puffin History of the World: Volume 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326164803/https://books.google.com/books?id=MmtBAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT311 |date=26 March 2023 }},

As the Fatimid state was at the time too weak to attempt a direct invasion, they found another means of revenge. Between the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]] were living [[Bedouin]] nomad tribes expelled from [[Arabia]] for their disruption and turbulency. The [[Banu Hilal]] and the [[Banu Sulaym]] for example, who regularly disrupted farmers in the [[Nile Valley]] since the nomads would often loot their farms. The then [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] vizier decided to destroy what he could not control, and broke a deal with the chiefs of these Bedouin tribes.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Fage|first1=John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXa4AQAAQBAJ&q=1048+banu+hilal&pg=PA166|title=A History of Africa|last2=Tordoff|first2=with William|date=23 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-79727-2}}</ref> The Fatimids even gave them money to leave.

Whole tribes set off with women, children, elders, animals and camping equipment. Some stopped on the way, especially in [[Cyrenaica]], where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in [[Ifriqiya]] by the [[Gabès Governorate|Gabe]]s region, arriving 1051.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RfBAAAAAYAAJ&q=1051+banu+hilal|title=The Maghreb Review: Majallat Al-Maghrib|date=1979}}</ref> The [[Zirid]] ruler tried to stop this rising tide, but with each encounter, the last under the walls of [[Kairouan]], his troops were defeated and the Arabs remained masters of the battlefield.

The invasion kept going, and in 1057 the Arabs spread on the high plains of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] where they encircled the [[Beni Hammad Fort|Qalaa of Banu Hammad]] (capital of the [[Hammadid dynasty|Hammadid Emirate]]), as they had done in Kairouan a few decades ago. From there they gradually gained the upper [[Algiers]] and [[Oran]] plains. Some of these territories were forcibly taken back by the [[Almohads]] in the second half of the 12th century.

In 1516, the Turkish privateer brothers [[Aruj]] and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], who operated successfully under the [[Hafsids]], moved their base of operations to Algiers. They succeeded in conquering Jijel and Algiers from the [[Spain|Spaniards]] with help from the locals who saw them as liberators from the Christians, but the brothers eventually assassinated the local noble Salim al-Tumi and took control over the city and the surrounding regions. Their state is known as the [[Regency of Algiers]]. When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his [[Fall of Tlemcen (1518)|invasion of Tlemcen]], [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Hayreddin]] succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|sultan]] gave him the title of [[beylerbey]] and a contingent of some 2,000 [[janissaries]]. With the aid of this force and native Algerians, Hayreddin conquered the whole area between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1792).<ref name="csa16" /><ref name="Mikaberidze" />

The next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son [[Hasan Pasha (son of Barbarossa)|Hasan]], who assumed the position in 1544.

Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.<ref name="csa16" />

In 1659, the Janissaries stationed in Algiers, known as the [[Odjak of Algiers|Odjak]] of Algiers, joined a company of corsair captains called the Reis in overthrowing the Ottoman [[viceroy]]. A new local leader was installed known as the "Agha"; the position became the "[[Dey]]" in 1671, who would be selected by the [[divan]], a council of some sixty military senior officers. Thus, Algiers became a sovereign military republic. The odjak initially dominated the system, but by the 18th century were the dey's instrument.

The [[dey]] was in effect a constitutional autocrat. Though elected for a life term, over the next 159 years (1671–1830), fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of the Deylikal government was remarkably orderly.

During the late 19th and early 20th century, the [[White Africans of European ancestry|European share]] was almost a fifth of the population. The French government aimed at making Algeria an assimilated part of France, and this included substantial educational investments especially after 1900.

Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, which lacked political and economic status under the colonial system, gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|France]]. In May 1945, the uprising against the occupying French forces was suppressed through what is now known as the [[Sétif and Guelma massacre]]. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the [[Algerian War]] began after the publication of the [[Declaration of 1 November 1954]]. Historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 [[Harki]]s and their dependents were killed by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) or by [[lynching|lynch]] mobs in Algeria.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7130307.stm | work = BBC News | title = French 'Reparation' for Algerians | date = 6 December 2007 | access-date = 16 November 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100420212617/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7130307.stm | archive-date = 20 April 2010 | url-status=live}}</ref> The [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] used hit and run attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war, and the French conducted [[Torture during the Algerian War of Independence|severe reprisals]].

The war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of Algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries. Historians, like [[Alistair Horne]] and [[Raymond Aron]], state that the actual number of Algerian Muslim war dead was far greater than the original FLN and official French estimates but was less than the 1&nbsp;million deaths claimed by the Algerian government after independence. Horne estimated Algerian casualties during the span of eight years to be around 700,000.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alistair|last=Horne|page=[https://archive.org/details/savagewarofpeace00horn/page/538 538]|title=A Savage War of Peace|isbn=978-0-670-61964-1|year=1978|publisher=Viking Press |url=https://archive.org/details/savagewarofpeace00horn/page/538}}</ref> The war uprooted more than 2&nbsp;million Algerians.<ref>{{cite book|first=Martin|last=Windrow|page=13|title=The Algerian War 1954–62|isbn=1-85532-658-2|date=15 November 1997|publisher=Bloomsbury USA }}</ref>

The war against French rule concluded in 1962, when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 [[Evian agreements]] and the July 1962 [[Algerian self-determination referendum, 1962|self-determination referendum]].

Algeria's first president was the Front de Libération Nationale ([[FLN (Algeria)|FLN]]) leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. Morocco's claim to [[Greater Morocco|portions of western Algeria]] led to the [[Sand War]] in 1963. Ben Bella was [[1965 Algerian coup d'état|overthrown in 1965]] by [[Houari Boumédiène]], his former ally and defence minister. Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly [[Socialism|socialist]] and authoritarian; Boumédienne continued this trend. However, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role. He [[collective farming|collectivised]] agriculture and launched a massive industrialisation drive. [[Extraction of petroleum|Oil extraction]] facilities were nationalised. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international [[1973 oil crisis]].

Boumédienne's successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], introduced some liberal economic reforms. He promoted a policy of [[Arabisation]] in Algerian society and public life. Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread conventional Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to Orthodox Islam.<ref name="faco" />

The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the [[1980s oil glut]].<ref name="Prochaska-2013">{{cite web|last=Prochaska|first=David|title=That Was Then, This Is Now: The Battle of Algiers and After.|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhr/summary/v085/85.1prochaska.html|page=141|access-date=10 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725163300/http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhr/summary/v085/85.1prochaska.html|archive-date=25 July 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system. Political parties developed, such as the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS), a broad coalition of Muslim groups.<ref name="faco" />

In December 1991 the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] dominated the first of two rounds of [[Algerian legislative election, 1991|legislative elections]]. Fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992, cancelling the elections. Bendjedid resigned and a [[High Council of State (Algeria)|High Council of State]] was installed to act as the Presidency. It banned the FIS, triggering a civil [[insurgency]] between the Front's armed wing, the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 people are thought to have died. The Islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of [[List of massacres during the Algerian Civil War|civilian massacres]].<ref>"[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/30/world/98-die-in-one-of-algerian-civil-war-s-worst-massacres.html 98 Die in One of Algerian Civil War's Worst Massacres ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623134112/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/30/world/98-die-in-one-of-algerian-civil-war-s-worst-massacres.html |date=23 June 2017 }}".

Algeria held [[Algerian presidential election, 1999|elections in 1999]], considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups<ref>{{cite web|url = http://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/algeria|title = Freedom in the World 2013: Algeria|publisher = Freedom House|author = Freedom House|access-date = 22 January 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140202094239/http://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/algeria|archive-date = 2 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> which were won by President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]]. He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a "Civil Concord" initiative, approved in a [[Algerian Civil Concord referendum, 1999|referendum]], under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000. The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly. The [[Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat]] (GSPC), a splinter group of the Armed Islamic Group, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.<ref name="faco" />

Bouteflika was re-elected in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2004|April 2004 presidential election]] after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation. The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation. It also included a second amnesty initiative, the [[Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation]], which was approved in a [[Algerian national reconciliation referendum, 2005|referendum in September 2005]]. It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.<ref name="faco" />

In November 2008, the [[Algerian Constitution]] was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents. This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]], and he was re-elected in April 2009. During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.<ref name="faco" />

A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010, inspired by similar [[Arab Spring|protests across the Middle East and North Africa]].

In December 2019, [[Abdelmadjid Tebboune]] became Algeria's president, after winning the first round of the [[2019 Algerian presidential election|presidential election]] with a record abstention rate – the highest of all presidential elections since Algeria's democracy in 1989. Tebboune is accused of being close to the military and being loyal to the deposed president. Tebboune rejects these accusations, claiming to be the victim of a witch hunt.
