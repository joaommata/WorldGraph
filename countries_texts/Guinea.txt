The land that is now Guinea either bordered or was situated within a series of historic African empires before the French arrived in the 1890s and claimed the terrain as part of colonial [[French West Africa]]. Guinea declared independence from France on 2 October 1958. From independence until the [[Guinean presidential election, 2010|presidential election]] of 2010, Guinea was governed by multiple [[Autocracy|autocratic]] rulers.<ref>

=== West African empires and kingdoms ===
{{main|Imamate of Futa Jallon|Wassoulou Empire}}

What is now Guinea sat on the fringes of various West African empires. The earliest, the [[Ghana Empire]], grew on trade and ultimately fell after repeated incursions of the [[Almoravids]]. It was in this period that Islam first arrived in the region by way of North African traders. The [[Sosso Empire]] came and stayed from 12th to 13th centuries; later, the [[Mali Empire]] came when [[Sundiata Keita|Soundiata Kéïta]] defeated the Sosso ruler [[Soumaoro Kanté|Soumangourou Kanté]] at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in {{circa|1235}}. The Mali Empire was ruled by [[Mansa (title)|Mansa]] (Emperors), including [[Musa I of Mali|Kankou Moussa]], who made a [[hajj]] to Mecca in 1324. After his reign, the Mali Empire began to decline and was ultimately supplanted by its [[vassal]] states in the 15th century.

The [[Songhai Empire]] expanded its power in about 1460. It continued to prosper until a civil war, over succession, followed the death of [[Askia Daoud]] in 1582. The empire [[Moroccan invasion of the Songhai Empire|fell to invaders]] from [[Morocco]] in 1591, but the kingdom later split into smaller kingdoms. After the fall of some of the West African empires, various kingdoms existed in what is now Guinea. [[Fulani]] Muslims migrated to [[Futa Jallon]] in Central Guinea, and established an Islamic state from 1727 to 1896 with a written constitution and alternate rulers. The [[Wassoulou Empire|Wassoulou or Wassulu Empire]] (1878–1898) was led by [[Samori Ture|Samori Toure]] in the predominantly [[Mandinka people|Malinké]] area of what is now upper Guinea and southwestern [[Mali]] (Wassoulou). It moved to [[Ivory Coast]] before being conquered by the French.

The defeat of the armies of [[Samori Touré]], Mansa (or Emperor) of the [[Ouassoulou]] state and leader of Malinké descent, in 1898 gave France control of what today is Guinea and adjacent areas. The boundaries of the South Rivers were fixed in 1899.<ref name=":2" />

France negotiated Guinea's present boundaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the British for [[Sierra Leone]], the Portuguese for their Guinea colony (now [[Guinea-Bissau]]), and [[Liberia]]. Under the French, the country formed the [[French Guinea|Territory of Guinea]] within [[French West Africa]], administered by a governor general resident in [[Dakar]]. Lieutenant governors administered the individual colonies, including Guinea.

[[File:Ahmed Sékou Touré na obisku v Ljubljani 1961 (3).jpg|thumb|President [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]] was supported by Communist states and, in 1961, visited [[Yugoslavia]].]]
In 1958, the [[French Fourth Republic]] collapsed due to political instability and its failures in dealing with its colonies, especially [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]]. The [[French Fifth Republic]] gave the colonies the choice of [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]] in a new [[French Community]] or immediate independence in the [[1958 Guinean constitutional referendum|referendum]] of 28 September 1958. Guinea voted overwhelmingly for independence. It was led by [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]], whose [[Democratic Party of Guinea-African Democratic Rally]] (PDG) had won 56 of 60 seats in the 1957 territorial elections.

The French later withdrew, and on 2 October 1958, Guinea proclaimed itself a sovereign and independent republic, with Sékou Touré as president. Later, [[Opération Persil]] was planned by [[Jacques Foccart]]; they planned to create large quantities of forged [[Guinean franc]]s to [[Hyperinflation|hyperinflate]] Guinea's economy and to arm Touré's opposition figures.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Gladstein |first1=Alex |last2=Keita |first2=Mohamed |date=2024-10-16 |title=Macron Isn't So Post-Colonial After All |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/08/03/macron-france-cfa-franc-eco-west-central-africa-colonialism-monetary-policy-bitcoin/ |access-date=2024-10-11 |website=Foreign Policy |language=en-US}}</ref> However, the operation was leaked, and soon, the Guinean was issuing a number of official complaints.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Le Gatt |first=Louise |date=2018-12-20 |title=La déstabilisation en Afrique : opérations secrètes pour la préservation du "pré carré" africain francophone |trans-title=Destabilization in Africa: Secret Operations for the Preservation of the French-speaking African "Private Preserve" |url=https://www.isd.sorbonneonu.fr/blog/la-destabilisation-en-afrique-operations-secretes/ |access-date=2024-10-11 |website=Le blog d'ISD |language=fr-FR}}</ref>

==== Under Touré's rule ====
In 1960, Touré declared the [[Democratic Party of Guinea – African Democratic Rally|Democratic Party of Guinea]] the country's only legal political party, and for the next 24 years, the government and PDG were one. Touré was re-elected unopposed to four 7-year terms as president, and every 5 years voters were presented with a single list of PDG candidates for the National Assembly.

On 22 November 1970, Portuguese forces from neighbouring [[Portuguese Guinea]] staged [[Operation Green Sea]], a raid on Conakry by several hundred exiled Guinean opposition forces. Among their goals, the Portuguese military wanted to kill or capture Sekou Touré due to his support of [[PAIGC]], an independence movement and rebel group that had carried out attacks inside Portuguese Guinea from their bases in Guinea.<ref>{{Cite news |date=November 22, 1980 |title=Black revolt |url=https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/1980/11/22/black-revolt |url-access=subscription |access-date=2024-10-11 |newspaper=The Economist |issn=0013-0613}}</ref> After some fighting, the Portuguese-backed forces retreated. Guinea was elected as a non-permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] 1972–73.

In 1977, a declining economy and a ban on all private economic transactions led to the [[Guinean Market Women's Revolt|Market Women's Revolt]], a series of anti-government riots started by women working in Conakry's [[Marché Madina (Conakry)|Madina Market]]. Touré vacillated from supporting the Soviet Union to supporting the United States. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw some economic reforms. After the election of [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] as French president, trade increased and the two countries exchanged diplomatic visits.

==== Under Conté's rule ====
Sékou Touré died on 26 March 1984 after a heart operation in the United States, and was replaced by Prime Minister [[Louis Lansana Beavogui]], who was to serve as interim president, pending new elections. PDG was due to elect a new leader on 3 April 1984. Under the constitution, that person would have been the only candidate for president. Hours before that meeting, Colonels [[Lansana Conté]] and [[Diarra Traoré]] seized power in a [[1984 Guinean coup d'état|bloodless coup]]. Conté assumed the role of president, with Traoré serving as prime minister, until December.
[[File:President Jimmy Carter with President Ahmed Sǩou Tour ̌of Guinea.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] welcoming [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]] outside the White House, Washington, D.C., 1979]]

Conté denounced the previous regime's record on human rights, releasing 250 political prisoners and encouraging approximately 200,000 more to return from exile. He made explicit the turn away from socialism. In 1992, Conté announced a return to civilian rule, with a presidential poll in 1993, followed by elections to parliament in 1995 (in which his party—the [[Unity and Progress Party|Party of Unity and Progress]]—won 71 of 114 seats). In September 2001, the opposition leader [[Alpha Condé]] was imprisoned for endangering state security and pardoned 8 months later. Subsequently, he spent time in exile in France.

In 2001, Conté organized and won a referendum to lengthen the presidential term, and in 2003, began his third term after elections were boycotted by the opposition. In January 2005, Conté survived a suspected assassination attempt while making a public appearance in Conakry. His opponents claimed that he was a "tired dictator",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guinea-forum.org/Analyses/index.asp?ana=28&Lang=A |title=Welcome Guinea Forum: Cornered, General Lansana Conte can only hope |access-date=23 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616165043/http://www.guinea-forum.org/Analyses/index.asp?ana=28&Lang=A |archive-date=16 June 2007 }}</ref> whose departure was inevitable, whereas his supporters believed that he was winning a battle with dissidents.
