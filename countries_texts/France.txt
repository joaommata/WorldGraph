===Early Middle Ages (5th–10th century)===
In [[late antiquity]], Gaul was divided into Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory. [[Celtic Britons]], fleeing the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]], settled in west [[Armorica]]; the Armorican peninsula was renamed [[Brittany]], and [[Celts|Celtic culture]] was revived.

The first leader to unite all Franks was [[Clovis I]], who began his reign as king of the [[Salian Franks]] in 481, routing the last forces of the Roman governors in 486. Clovis said he would be baptised a Christian in the event of victory against the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], which was said to have guaranteed the battle. Clovis [[Franco-Visigothic Wars|regained the southwest from the Visigoths]] and was baptised in 508. Clovis was the first [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] conqueror after the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]] to convert to Catholic Christianity; thus France was given the title "Eldest daughter of the Church" by the papacy,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Faith of the Eldest Daughter&nbsp;– Can France retain her Catholic heritage? |url=http://www.wf-f.org/03-1-France.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722112834/http://www.wf-f.org/03-1-France.html |archive-date=22 July 2011 |access-date=17 July 2011 |publisher=Wf-f.org}}</ref> and French kings were called "the Most Christian Kings of France".

The Franks embraced the Christian [[Gallo-Roman culture]], and Gaul was renamed ''[[Francia]]'' ("Land of the Franks"). The Germanic Franks adopted [[Romance languages|Romanic languages]]. Clovis made [[Paris]] his capital and established the [[Merovingian dynasty]], but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from that of Clovis: Paris, [[Orléans]], [[Soissons]], and [[Reims|Rheims]].

During the 9th and 10th centuries, threatened by [[Viking expansion|Viking invasions]], France became a decentralised state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and so was less effective and challenged by noblemen. Thus was established [[feudalism]] in France. Some king's vassals grew so powerful they posed a threat to the king. After the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] added "King of England" to his titles, becoming vassal and the equal of the king of France, creating recurring tensions.

From the 11th century, the [[House of Plantagenet]], rulers of the [[County of Anjou]], established its dominion over the surrounding provinces of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] and [[Touraine]], then built an "empire" from England to the [[Pyrenees]], covering half of modern France. Tensions between France and the [[Angevin Empire|Plantagenet empire]] would last a hundred years, until [[Philip II of France]] conquered, between 1202 and 1214, most continental possessions of the empire, leaving England and [[Aquitaine]] to the Plantagenets.

The [[French Renaissance]] saw cultural development and standardisation of French, which became the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts|official language of France]] and Europe's aristocracy. France became rivals of the [[House of Habsburg]] during the [[Italian Wars]], which would dictate much of their later foreign policy until the mid-18th century. French explorers claimed lands in the Americas, paving expansion of the [[French colonial empire]].

[[Louis XVI]] [[France in the American Revolutionary War|supported America with money, fleets and armies]], helping them win [[American Revolutionary War|independence from Great Britain]]. France gained revenge but verged on bankruptcy—a factor that contributed to the Revolution. Some of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] occurred in French intellectual circles, and scientific breakthroughs, such as the [[Antoine Lavoisier|naming of oxygen]] and the first [[Montgolfier brothers|hot air balloon carrying passengers]], were achieved by French scientists. French explorers took part in the [[European and American voyages of scientific exploration|voyages of scientific exploration]] through maritime expeditions. Enlightenment philosophy, in which [[Rationalism|reason]] is advocated as the primary source of [[Political legitimacy|legitimacy]], undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and was a factor in the Revolution.

The [[Storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, among them the [[Abolition of feudalism in France|abolition of feudalism]], state control over the [[Catholic Church in France]], and a [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|declaration of rights]].<ref>{{citation |url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jrobinson/files/jr_consequeces_frenchrev.pdf |title=The Consequences of Radical Reform: The French Revolution |last1=Acemoglu |first1=Daron |last2=Caroni |first2=Davide |last3=Johnson |first3=Simon |last4=Robinson |first4=James A. |date=April 2009 |series=NBER Working Paper Series |number=Working Paper 14831 |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |access-date=23 July 2025}}</ref>

The next three years were dominated by struggle for political control, exacerbated by [[economic depression]]. Military defeats following the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in April 1792 resulted in the [[insurrection of 10 August 1792]]. The [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|monarchy was abolished]] and replaced by the [[French First Republic]] in September, while [[execution of Louis XVI|Louis XVI was executed]] in January 1793.<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 11, 2023 |title=The death of Louis XVI |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/11/the-death-of-louis-xvi-france-1793 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230112122827/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/11/the-death-of-louis-xvi-france-1793 |archive-date=January 12, 2023 |access-date=May 17, 2025 |website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

After another [[Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793|revolt in June 1793]], the constitution was suspended and power passed from the [[National Convention]] to the [[Committee of Public Safety]]. About 16,000 people were executed in a [[Reign of Terror]], which [[Thermidorian Reaction|ended in July 1794]]. Weakened by external threats and internal opposition, the Republic was replaced in 1795 by the [[French Directory|Directory]]. Four years later in 1799, the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] seized power in a [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|coup]] led by [[Napoleon]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://oyc.yale.edu/history/hist-202/lecture-24 | title=HIST 202 - Lecture 24 - the Collapse of Communism and Global Challenges &#124; Open Yale Courses }}</ref>

Napoleon became [[French Consulate|First Consul]] in 1799 and later [[Constitution of the Year XII|Emperor]] of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. Changing sets of [[French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars|European coalitions]] declared [[Napoleonic Wars|wars on Napoleon's empire]]. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt|battles of Jena-Auerstadt]] and [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]]. Members of the [[House of Bonaparte|Bonaparte]] family were appointed monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.<ref name="Blanning">{{Cite news |last=Blanning |first=Tim |author-link=T. C. W. Blanning|date=April 1998 |title=Napoleon and German identity |volume=48 |work=[[History Today]] |location=London}}</ref>

These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the [[metric system]], [[Napoleonic Code]] and Declaration of the Rights of Man. In 1812 Napoleon [[French invasion of Russia|attacked Russia]], reaching Moscow. Thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease, Russian attacks, and finally winter. After this catastrophic campaign and the ensuing [[War of the Sixth Coalition|uprising of European monarchies]] against his rule, Napoleon was defeated. About a million Frenchmen [[Napoleonic Wars casualties|died during the Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name="Blanning"/> After his [[Hundred Days|brief return]] from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and the [[Bourbon Restoration in France|Bourbon monarchy was restored]] with new constitutional limitations.

===Colonial empire===

The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the [[July Revolution]] of 1830, which established the constitutional [[July Monarchy]]; French troops began the [[French conquest of Algeria|conquest of Algeria]]. Unrest led to the [[French Revolution of 1848]] and the end of the July Monarchy. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of male universal suffrage was re-enacted in 1848. In 1852, president of the French Republic, [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]], Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], as Napoleon III. He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially in [[Crimean War|Crimea]], [[Second French intervention in Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Second Italian War of Independence|Italy]]. Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, and his regime was replaced by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. By 1875, the French conquest of Algeria was complete, with approximately 825,000 Algerians killed from famine, disease, and violence.<ref name="Kiernan2007">{{Cite book |first=Ben |last=Kiernan |url=https://archive.org/details/bloodan_kie_2007_00_0326 |title=Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-300-10098-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bloodan_kie_2007_00_0326/page/374 374] |url-access=registration}}</ref>

During the [[Cold War]], de Gaulle pursued a policy of "national independence" towards the [[Western Bloc|Western]] and [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern blocs]]. He withdrew from NATO's military-integrated command (while remaining within the alliance), launched a [[Force de dissuasion|nuclear development programme]] and made France the [[France and weapons of mass destruction|fourth nuclear power]].

However, he opposed any development of a [[Supranational union|supranational Europe]], favouring [[Sovereign state|sovereign nations]]. The revolt of [[May 68|May 1968]] had an enormous social impact; it was a watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted to a more liberal moral ideal (secularism, individualism, sexual revolution). Although the revolt was a political failure (the [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] party emerged stronger than before) it announced a split between the French and de Gaulle, who resigned.<ref>Julian Bourg, ''From revolution to ethics: May 1968 and contemporary French thought'' (McGill-Queen's Press-MQUP, 2017).</ref>
