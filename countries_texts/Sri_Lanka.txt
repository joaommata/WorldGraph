According to the ''[[Mahāvaṃsa]]'', a [[Pali|Pāḷi]] chronicle written in the 5th century CE, the original inhabitants of Sri Lanka are said to be the [[Yaksha]]s and [[Naga people (Lanka)|Nagas]]. Sinhalese history traditionally starts in 543 BCE with the arrival of [[Prince Vijaya]], a semi-legendary prince who sailed with 700 followers to Sri Lanka, after being expelled from [[Vanga kingdom]] (present-day [[Bengal]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mahavamsa.org/mahavamsa/original-version/06-coming-vijaya/ |title=The Coming of Vijaya |work=The Mahavamsa |date=8 October 2011 |access-date=16 October 2015 |archive-date=30 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030084837/http://mahavamsa.org/mahavamsa/original-version/06-coming-vijaya/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He established the [[Kingdom of Tambapanni]], near modern-day [[Mannar, Sri Lanka|Mannar]].

Once [[Prakrit]] speakers had attained dominance on the island, the ''[[Mahāvaṃsa]]'' further recounts the later migration of royal brides and service castes from the Tamil [[Pandya kingdom]] to the [[Anuradhapura kingdom]] in the early historic period.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mahavamsa.org/mahavamsa/original-version/07-consecrating-vijaya/ |title=The Consecrating of Vijaya |work=Mahavamsa |date=8 October 2011 |access-date=27 January 2021 |archive-date=20 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230620071000/https://mahavamsa.org/mahavamsa/original-version/07-consecrating-vijaya/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Succeeding kingdoms of Sri Lanka would maintain many [[schools of Buddhism|Buddhist schools]] and monasteries and support the propagation of Buddhism into other countries in Southeast Asia. Sri Lankan Bhikkhus studied in India's famous ancient Buddhist University of [[Nalanda]], which was destroyed by [[Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji|Bakhtiyar Khalji]].

Sri Lanka experienced the first of many foreign invasions during the reign of [[Suratissa of Anuradhapura|Suratissa]], who was defeated by two horse traders named [[Sena and Guttika]] from South India.<ref name="mahav1" /> The next invasion came immediately in 205 BCE by a [[Chola]] named [[Elara (monarch)|Elara]], who overthrew [[Asela of Anuradhapura|Asela]] and ruled the country for 44 years. [[Dutugamunu]], the eldest son of the southern regional sub-king, [[Kavan Tissa, Prince of Ruhuna|Kavan Tissa]], defeated Elara in the [[Battle of Vijithapura]]. During its two and a half millennia of existence, the [[Sinhala kingdom]] was invaded at least eight times by neighbouring South Indian dynasties such as the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]], [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya]], and [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]].{{citation needed|date=April 2023}} There also were incursions by the kingdoms of [[Kalinga (region)|Kalinga]] (modern [[Odisha]]) and from the [[Malay Peninsula]] as well.{{citation needed|date=April 2023}}

The [[Fourth Theravāda Council]] was held at the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya]] in Sri Lanka under the patronage of [[Valagamba]] in 25 BCE. The council was held in response to a year in which the harvests in Sri Lanka were particularly poor and many [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] subsequently died of starvation. Because the [[Pali Canon]] was at that time [[oral literature]] maintained in several recensions by ''dhammabhāṇaka''s ([[dharma]] reciters), the surviving monks recognised the danger of not writing it down so that even if some of the monks whose duty it was to study and remember parts of the Canon for later generations died, the teachings would not be lost.{{sfn | Buswell | Lopez | 2013 | p=200}} After the council, [[palm-leaf manuscript]]s containing the completed Canon were taken to other countries such as [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]].

In 993 CE, the invasion of [[Chola dynasty|Chola emperor]] [[Rajaraja I]] forced the then Sinhalese ruler [[Mahinda V]] to flee to the southern part of Sri Lanka. Taking advantage of this situation, [[Rajendra I]], son of Rajaraja I, launched a large invasion in 1017.

[[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]], the widow of Bandaranaike, took office as prime minister in 1960, and withstood an [[1962 Ceylonese coup d'état attempt|attempted coup d'état]] in 1962. During her second term as prime minister, the government instituted socialist economic policies, strengthening ties with the [[Soviet Union]] and China, while promoting a policy of non-alignment. In 1971, Ceylon experienced a [[1971 JVP insurrection|Marxist insurrection]], which was quickly suppressed. In 1972, the country became a [[republic]] named Sri Lanka, repudiating its dominion status. Prolonged minority grievances and the use of communal emotionalism as an election campaign weapon by both Sinhalese and Tamil leaders abetted a fledgling Tamil militancy in the north during the 1970s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nubin|2002|pp=128–129}}</ref> The [[policy of standardisation]] by the Sirimavo government to rectify disparities created in university enrolment, which was in essence an [[affirmative action]] to assist geographically disadvantaged students to obtain tertiary education,<ref name="affrmact">{{cite web |url=http://www.ices.lk/publications/esr/articles_jul97/Esr-kmdesilva.PDF |pages=248–254 |title=Affirmative Action Policies: The Sri Lankan Experience |author1=De Silva |author2=K.
