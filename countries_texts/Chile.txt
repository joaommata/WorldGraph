Stone tool evidence indicates humans sporadically frequented the [[Monte Verde]] valley area as long as 18,500 years ago. About 10,000 years ago, migrating [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous peoples]] settled in fertile valleys and coastal areas of what is present-day Chile. Settlement sites from very early human habitation include Monte Verde, [[Cueva del Milodón]] and the [[Pali-Aike Crater]]'s [[lava tube]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/people-roamed-tip-south-america-18500-years-ago | title=People roamed tip of South America 18,500 years ago | work=Science News | date=26 December 2015 | access-date=26 December 2015 | author=Bower, Bruce | pages=10 | archive-date=10 May 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200510101040/https://www.sciencenews.org/article/people-roamed-tip-south-america-18500-years-ago | url-status=live }}</ref>

The Incas briefly extended their empire into what is now northern Chile, but the [[Mapuche]] (or Araucanians as they were known by the Spaniards) successfully resisted many attempts by the [[Inca Empire]] to subjugate them, despite their lack of state organization.<ref>{{cite book|title=Insight Guides: Chile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nf8SnJ_ZJbkC&pg=PA27|access-date=14 July 2013|year=2002|publisher=Langenscheidt Publishing Group|isbn=978-981-234-890-6|page=27|archive-date=21 February 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240221111313/https://books.google.com/books?id=Nf8SnJ_ZJbkC&pg=PA27#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref> They fought against the Sapa Inca Tupac Yupanqui and his army.

In 1520, while attempting to circumnavigate the globe, [[Ferdinand Magellan]] discovered the southern passage now named after him (the [[Strait of Magellan]]) thus becoming the first European to set foot on what is now Chile. The next Europeans to reach Chile were Diego de Almagro and his band of [[Conquistador|Spanish conquistadors]], who came from [[Peru]] in 1535 seeking gold. The Spanish encountered various cultures that supported themselves principally through [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture and hunting.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

The conquest of Chile began in earnest in 1540 and was carried out by [[Pedro de Valdivia]], one of [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s lieutenants, who founded the city of Santiago on 12 February 1541. Although the Spanish did not find the extensive gold and silver they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential of Chile's central valley, and Chile became part of the [[Spanish Empire]].<ref name="countrystudies"/>

Conquest took place gradually, and the Europeans suffered repeated setbacks. A massive [[Mapuche]] insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia's death and the destruction of many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of [[slavery]] by the Spanish crown in 1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the Mapuche intensified resistance rather than cowing them into submission. Despite royal prohibitions, relations remained strained from continual colonialist interference.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/storiadellaguer00caivgoog|title=Storia della guerra d'America fra Chilì, il Perù e la Bolivia|first=Tommaso |last=Caivano|date=1 April 1882|place=Torino|publisher =Ermanno Loescher|via=Internet Archive|language=it}}</ref>{{verify source|date=August 2024|reason="page 66" was deleted from this citation by a user of the ReFill script at one point, but page 66 of this source does not seem to support this claim. the reference previously pointed to a djvu of the source, so pagination may have differed, but the djvu is no longer available via archive.org}}

Cut off to the north by desert, to the south by the Mapuche, to the east by the Andes Mountains, and to the west by the ocean, Chile became one of the most centralized, homogeneous territories in Spanish America. Serving as a sort of frontier [[garrison]], the colony found itself with the mission of forestalling encroachment by both the Mapuche and Spain's European enemies, especially the [[Kingdom of England|English]] and the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]]. [[Buccaneer]]s and [[Piracy|pirates]] menaced the colony in addition to the Mapuche, as was shown by [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]]'s 1578 raid on Valparaíso, the colony's principal port. Chile hosted one of the largest standing armies in the Americas, making it one of the most militarized of the Spanish possessions, as well as a [[Real Situado|drain on the treasury of the Viceroyalty of Peru]].<ref name="hudson"/>

The first general census was conducted by the government of [[Agustín de Jáuregui]] between 1777 and 1778; it indicated that the population consisted of 259,646 inhabitants: 73.5% of [[White Latin American|European descent]], 7.9% [[mestizo]]s, 8.6% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and 9.8% blacks. Francisco Hurtado, Governor of the province of [[Chiloé Province|Chiloé]], conducted a census in 1784 and found the population consisted of 26,703 inhabitants, 64.4% of whom were whites and 33.5% of whom were natives. The Diocese of [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] conducted a census in areas south of the [[Maule river]] in 1812, but did not include the indigenous population or the inhabitants of the province of Chiloé. The population was estimated at 210,567, 86.1% of whom were [[Spanish Chilean|Spanish]] or of European descent, 10% of whom were indigenous and 3.7% of whom were mestizos, blacks and [[mulatto]]s.<ref>{{Cite book | url= https://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/602/w3-article-8952.html | page= 370 | via= Biblioteca Nacional de Chile | last= Silva Castro | first= Raúl | title= Censo de 1813 | publisher= Imprenta Chile | place= Santiago | date= 1953 | archive-date= 18 August 2024 | access-date= 18 August 2024 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20240818150256/https://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/602/w3-article-8952.html | url-status= live }}</ref>

A 2021 study by [[Jörg Baten|Baten]] and Llorca-Jaña shows that regions with a relatively high share of North European migrants developed faster in terms of [[numeracy]], even if the overall number of migrants was small. This effect might be related to [[Externality|externalities]]: the surrounding population adopted a similar behavior as the small non-European immigrant group, and new schools were created. Ironically, there might have been positive [[spillover effects]] from the educational investment made by migrants, at the same time numeracy might have been reduced by the greater inequality in these regions. However, the positive effects of immigration were apparently stronger.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Baten|first1=Joerg|last2=Llorca-Jaña|first2=Manuel|date=2021|title=Inequality, Low-Intensity Immigration and Human Capital Formation in the Regions of Chile, 1820–1939|journal=Economics and Human Biology|volume=43|article-number=101030|doi=10.1016/j.ehb.2021.101030|pmid=34171763|s2cid=219382958|url=https://www.cesifo.org/DocDL/cesifo1_wp8177.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.cesifo.org/DocDL/cesifo1_wp8177.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live|issn=1570-677X}}</ref>

===Independence and nation building===
{{see also|Chilean War of Independence|War of the Pacific|Argentine–Chilean naval arms race}}
[[File:Ejercito Libertador cruce de Cordillera de los andes.jpg|thumb|Generals [[José de San Martín]] (left) and [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] (right) during the [[crossing of the Andes]]]]

In 1808, [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]]'s enthronement of his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] as the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish King]] precipitated the drive by Chile for [[Chilean War of Independence|independence from Spain]]. A national [[Junta (governing body)|junta]] in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand]] – heir to the deposed king – was formed on 18 September 1810. The [[Government Junta of Chile (1810)|Government Junta of Chile]] proclaimed an autonomous government for Chile within the Spanish monarchy (in memory of this day, Chile celebrates its [[Fiestas Patrias (Chile)|National Day]] on 18 September each year).

After these events, a movement for total independence, under the command of [[José Miguel Carrera]] (one of the most renowned patriots) and his two brothers Juan José and [[Luis Carrera]], soon gained a wider following. Spanish attempts to re-impose arbitrary rule during what was called the [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]] led to a prolonged struggle, including infighting from [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], who challenged Carrera's leadership.

Intermittent warfare continued until 1817. With Carrera in prison in Argentina, O'Higgins and anti-Carrera cohort [[José de San Martín]], hero of the [[Argentine War of Independence]], led [[Army of the Andes|an army]] that [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes]] into Chile and defeated the royalists. On 12 February 1818, [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|Chile was proclaimed an independent republic]]. The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th-century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful.<ref name="countrystudies"/> Bernardo O'Higgins once planned to expand Chile by liberating the [[Philippines]] from Spain and incorporating the islands. In this regard he tasked the Scottish naval officer, Lord Thomas Cochrane, in a letter dated 12 November 1821, expressing his plan to conquer [[Guayaquil]], the [[Galapagos Islands]], and the [[Chile–Philippines relations|Philippines]]. There were preparations, but the plan did not push through because O'Higgins was exiled.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jg5cEAAAQBAJ Intercolonial Intimacies: Relinking Latin/o America to the Philippines. 1898-1964 By Paula C.

Chile slowly started to expand its influence and to establish its borders. By the Tantauco Treaty, the archipelago of [[Chiloé]] was incorporated in 1826. The economy began to boom due to the discovery of silver ore in Chañarcillo, and the growing trade of the port of Valparaíso, which led to conflict with Peru over maritime supremacy in the Pacific. At the same time, attempts were made to strengthen sovereignty in southern Chile intensifying [[Occupation of Araucanía|penetration into Araucanía]] and [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|colonizing Llanquihue with German immigrants]] in 1848. Through the founding of [[Fort Bulnes]] by the [[Schooner Ancud]] under the command of [[John Williams Wilson]], the [[Magallanes Region]] [[Chilean colonization of the Strait of Magellan|started to be controlled by country in 1843]], while the [[Antofagasta Region]], at the time in [[Atacama Desert border dispute|dispute with Bolivia]], began to fill with people.

After the [[Chilean Civil War of 1829–1830]] in which the conservatives won, under the [[Joaquín Prieto]] Administration, the [[Chilean Constitution of 1833]] was written and put into effect with high influence from the triple minister [[Diego Portales]]. Two other civil wars happened in Chile in the 1850s, one in [[1851 Chilean revolution|1851]] and the other one in [[1859 Chilean revolution|1859]].

Toward the end of the 19th century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by the [[Occupation of Araucanía]]. The [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] confirmed Chilean sovereignty over the [[Strait of Magellan]] but also made the country renounce its claims in the rest of East Patagonia after a [[East Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego and Strait of Magellan Dispute|dispute that started in 1842]].<ref name=PatagoniaAustral>{{cite book|author=Mateo Martinic Beros|title=Presencia de Chile en la Patagonia austral 1843 – 1879|date=1971|publisher=Editorial Andrés Bello|url=https://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/602/w3-article-10386.html|access-date=December 8, 2022|language=es|archive-date=31 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230331010856/https://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/602/w3-article-10386.html|url-status=live}}</ref> As a result of the [[War of the Pacific]] with Peru and Bolivia (1879–83), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating Bolivia's access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable [[Caliche (mineral)#Chilean caliche|nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence. Chile had joined the stand as one of the high-income countries in South America by 1870.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of the Global Economy.

On 9 September 1888, Chile took possession of [[Easter Island]] by the signing of a mutual will agreement with the local king, thanks to the efforts of the Bishop of Tahiti, Monsignor José María Verdier since the island was constantly attacked by slave merchants. The naval officer [[Policarpo Toro]] represented the Chilean Government and [[Atamu Tekena]] was the head of the Council of Rapanui. The Rapa Nui elders ceded sovereignty, without renouncing their titles as chiefs, the ownership of their lands, the validity of their culture and traditions on equal terms. The Rapa Nui sold nothing and were integrated in equal conditions into Chile.<ref name=historia>{{Cite web |url=http://www.soberaniachile.cl/historia_de_la_incorporacion_y_las_controversias_de_la_isla_de_pascua.html |title=Historia de la Isla de Pascua: Su Incorporación y Su Conflicto Con La Williamson & Balfour.

The [[1891 Chilean Civil War]] brought about a redistribution of power between the President and Congress, and Chile established a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] style democracy. However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards which had strong ties to foreign investors. Soon after, the country engaged in a [[Argentine–Chilean naval arms race|vastly expensive naval arms race]] with [[Argentina]] amid escalating geopolitical competition and the [[Puna de Atacama dispute]].

The [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1883) against Peru and Bolivia resulted in Chile annexing resource-rich territory from both countries and further consolidating its status as a regional power. It subsequently emerged as a leading naval power in the Americas, even sending a ship to protest United States involvement in the [[Panama crisis of 1885]]. Chile potentially threatened U.S. hegemony in the Western Hemisphere, with the two countries almost going to war during the [[Baltimore crisis]] in 1891.<ref name="sater">William Sater, ''Chile and the United States: Empires in Conflict'', Athens, GA; University of Georgia Press, {{ISBN|0-8203-1249-5}} p.51</ref>

===20th century===

[[File:Chilean battleship Almirante Latorre.jpg|thumb|left|Chile's ''Almirante Latorre'' [[dreadnought]] in 1921]]

The early 20th century saw Chile fully consolidate its territory and resolve long-running diplomatic and territorial disputes. Its current borders with Argentina were finalized [[1902 Arbitral award of the Andes between Argentina and Chile|through British arbitration]] in 1902 and a bilateral settlement of the [[Puna de Atacama dispute]] the following year. In 1904, Chile and Bolivia signed a [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship (1904)|Treaty of Peace and Friendship]] which clarified the border between both countries.

The Chilean economy partially degenerated into a system protecting the interests of a ruling [[oligarchy]]. By the 1920s, the emerging middle and working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, [[Arturo Alessandri]], whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress. In the 1920s, [[Marxism|Marxist]] groups with strong popular support arose.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

A military coup led by General [[Luis Altamirano]] in 1924 set off a period of political instability that lasted until 1932. Of the ten governments that held power in that period, the longest lasting was that of General [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]], who briefly ruled as [[de facto]] dictator in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931. These authoritarian governments were comparatively less harsh and corrupt than counterparts elsewhere in Latin America.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Authoritarianism in Latin America since independence|last=Fowler|first=Will|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=University of Virginia|isbn=0-313-29843-2|pages=30–96}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Frazier|first=Lessie Jo|title=Salt in the Sand: Memory, Violence, and the Nation-State in Chile, 1890 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQU-GYGeVSEC&pg=PA163|access-date=14 July 2013|date=17 July 2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-4003-4|pages=163–184|archive-date=29 November 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231129020445/https://books.google.com/books?id=gQU-GYGeVSEC&pg=PA163#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref>

By relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor, Ibáñez del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years, in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his ideology. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. During the period of [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]] dominance (1932–52), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ibáñez del Campo to office for another six years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded Ibáñez del Campo in 1958, bringing Chilean conservatism back into power democratically for another term.

The [[1964 Chilean presidential election|1964 presidential election]] of [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] by an [[Majority|absolute majority]] initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan "Revolution in Liberty", the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and [[agrarian reform]], including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.<ref name="countrystudies">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/chile/85.htm|title=Development and Breakdown of Democracy, 1830–1973|work=Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress|date=31 March 1994|access-date=21 April 2009|archive-date=9 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709014719/http://countrystudies.us/chile/85.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>
[[File:Salvador Allende Gossens-.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Salvador Allende]]]]

In the 1970 election, Senator [[Salvador Allende]] of the [[Socialist Party of Chile]] (then part of the "[[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]]" coalition which included the Communists, Radicals, Social-Democrats, dissident Christian Democrats, the Popular Unitary Action Movement, and the Independent Popular Action),<ref name="countrystudies"/> achieved a partial majority in a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in a three-way contest, followed by candidates Radomiro Tomic for the Christian Democrat Party and Jorge Alessandri for the Conservative Party. Allende was not elected with an absolute majority, receiving fewer than 35% of the votes.

The [[National Congress of Chile|Chilean Congress]] conducted a runoff vote between the leading candidates, Allende and former president Jorge Alessandri, and, keeping with tradition, chose Allende by a vote of 153 to 35. Frei refused to form an alliance with Alessandri to oppose Allende, on the grounds that the Christian Democrats were a workers' party and could not make common cause with the right wing.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mares|first=David|author2=Francisco Rojas Aravena|title=The United States and Chile: Coming in from the Cold|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Y3EWkKZsYcC&pg=PA145|access-date=14 July 2013|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-93125-0|page=145|archive-date=29 November 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231129020509/https://books.google.com/books?id=0Y3EWkKZsYcC&pg=PA145|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Trento|first=Joseph J.|title=The Secret History of the CIA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uPBM7z_62gC&pg=PA560|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319065032/http://books.google.com/books?id=3uPBM7z_62gC&pg=PA560|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 March 2015|access-date=14 July 2013|year=2005|publisher=Carroll & Graf Publishers|isbn=978-0-7867-1500-8|page=560}}</ref>

An [[economic depression]] that began in 1972 was exacerbated by [[capital flight]], plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and unemployment rose.
