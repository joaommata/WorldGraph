Iron was worked by about 500 BC, with supporting evidence coming from the [[Khorat Plateau]], in what later is Thailand. In Cambodia, some [[Iron Age]] settlements were found beneath [[Baksei Chamkrong]] and other Angkorian temples while circular earthworks were discovered at the site of [[Lovea]] kilometres north-west of Angkor.

During the 3rd, 4th, and 5th centuries, the [[Indianised kingdom|Indianised states]] of [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] and its successor, [[Chenla]], coalesced in what later is Cambodia and southwestern Vietnam. For more than 2,000 years, what was to become Cambodia absorbed influences from [[India]], passing them on to other Southeast Asian civilisations that later became Thailand and Laos.<ref name="BRIT">{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/90520/Cambodia |title=History of Cambodia |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |access-date=16 March 2013 |archive-date=9 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309103737/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/90520/Cambodia |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Khmer Empire]] grew out of the remnants of Chenla, becoming firmly established in 802 when [[Jayavarman II]] (reigned {{Circa|790}} – {{Circa|835}}) declared independence from [[Java]] and proclaimed themselves a [[Devaraja]].

The Khmer Empire was Southeast Asia's largest empire during the 12th century. The empire's centre of power was [[Angkor]], where a series of capitals were constructed during the empire's zenith.

In 1955, Sihanouk abdicated in favour of his father to participate in politics and was elected prime minister. Upon his father's death in 1960, Sihanouk again became head of state, taking the title of prince. As the [[Vietnam War]] progressed, Sihanouk adopted an official policy of [[neutral country|neutrality]] in the [[Cold War]]. Sihanouk allowed the Vietnamese communists to use Cambodia as a sanctuary and a supply route for their arms and other aid to their armed forces fighting in South Vietnam. In December 1967 ''Washington Post'' journalist Stanley Karnow was told by Sihanouk that if the U.S. wanted to bomb the Vietnamese communist sanctuaries, he would not object unless Cambodians were killed.<ref>Washington Post, 29 December 1967</ref>

Forced repatriation in 1970 and deaths during the Khmer Rouge era reduced the [[Vietnamese Cambodian|Vietnamese]] population in Cambodia from between 250,000 and 300,000 in 1969 to a reported 56,000 in 1984.<ref name="Population" /> Most of the victims of the Khmer Rouge regime were not ethnic minorities but ethnic Khmer.

In 1993, the [[Monarchy of Cambodia|monarchy]] was restored with [[Norodom Sihanouk]] reinstated as King, and the [[1993 Cambodian general election|first post-war election]] was coordinated by [[UNTAC]].
