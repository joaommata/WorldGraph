After the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] on 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder; looting and revenge-killing were widespread. British, Australian, and Indian troops led by Lord [[Louis Mountbatten]] [[Operation Tiderace|returned to Singapore]] to receive the formal surrender of Japanese forces in the region from General [[Seishirō Itagaki]] on behalf of General [[Hisaichi Terauchi]] on 12 September 1945.{{sfn|Bose|2010|pp=18–20}}<ref name="auto1" /> Meanwhile, [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]] was tried by a US military commission for war crimes, but not for crimes committed by his troops in Malaya or Singapore.

Much of the infrastructure in Singapore had been destroyed during the war, including those needed to supply utilities. A shortage of food led to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. A series of strikes in 1947 caused massive stoppages in public transport and other services. However, by late 1947 the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing international demand for tin and rubber.<ref name="uslcAftermathOfWar">{{cite web |title=Singapore – Aftermath of War |url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/9.htm |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |access-date=16 May 2020 |archive-date=14 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514010408/http://countrystudies.us/singapore/9.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> The failure of Britain to successfully defend its colony against the Japanese changed its image in the eyes of Singaporeans.

PAP leaders believed that Singapore's future lay with Malaya, due to strong ties between the two. It was thought that reuniting with Malaya would benefit the economy by creating a common market, alleviating ongoing unemployment woes in Singapore. However, a sizeable left-wing faction of the PAP was strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a loss of influence, and hence formed the [[Barisan Sosialis]], after being kicked out from the PAP.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lee |first=T.

On 27 May 1961, Malaya's prime minister, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], made a surprise proposal for a new Federation called [[Malaysia]], which would unite the current and former [[British possessions]] in the region: the [[Federation of Malaya]], Singapore, [[Brunei]], [[North Borneo (British Crown colony)|North Borneo]], and [[Sarawak (British Crown colony)|Sarawak]].<ref name="Wipe out extremists" /><ref name="Big Unity Plan">{{cite news |title=Big 'Unity' Plan – Tengku on closer ties with S'pore, Borneo and Brunei |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/assets/images/ST175/NewspaperSG/1961-05-28/full.jpg |work=The Straits Times |publisher=[[Singapore Press Holdings]] |date=28 May 1961 |page=1 |access-date=9 March 2022 |archive-date=9 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220309061422/https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/assets/images/ST175/NewspaperSG/1961-05-28/full.jpg |url-status=live}}</ref> UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Bornean territories would balance Singapore's Chinese population.<ref name=countrystudies10 /> The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming a haven for communism.<ref>{{cite news |title=Appeal To Singapore |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19620328-1.2.70.1?ST=1&AT=advanced |newspaper=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |page=10 |date=28 March 1962|access-date=19 August 2017|archive-date=19 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319214737/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19620328-1.2.70.1?ST=1&AT=advanced|url-status=live}}</ref> To obtain a mandate for a merger, the PAP held a [[1962 Merger Referendum of Singapore|referendum on the merger]].

The PAP has remained in power since 1959. Often described as a ''de facto'' one-party state because of its uncommon longevity for a nominal [[liberal democracy]], some activists and opposition politicians view the PAP government's tight regulation of political and media activities, along with its stringent laws, as an infringement on political rights.<ref>{{cite news |title=Singapore elections |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=5 May 2006 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4976536.stm|access-date=28 July 2017|archive-date=15 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115181132/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4976536.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> In response, the PAP introduced several significant political changes, including the creation of the [[Non-constituency Members of Parliament]] (NCMPs) scheme from the [[1984 Singaporean general election|1984 election]], which allowed a limited number of the best performing losing opposition candidates to be appointed as MPs. [[Group representation constituencies]] (GRCs) were subsequently introduced in the [[1988 Singaporean general election|1988 election]] as multi-member electoral divisions intended to guarantee minority representation in parliament, although the opposition has accused the scheme of enabling [[gerrymandering]].<ref>{{Singapore legislation|title=Parliamentary Elections Act|cap=218|titlelink=Parliamentary Elections Act (Singapore)}}</ref> In addition, [[Nominated Members of Parliament]] (NMPs) were introduced in 1990 to allow non-elected and non-partisan representatives from diverse professional fields to serve in parliament.<ref name="HoKhaiLeong">Ho Khai Leong (2003).
