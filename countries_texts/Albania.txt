Mesolithic habitation in Albania has been evidenced in several open air sites which during that period were close to the Adriatic coastline and in cave sites. Mesolithic objects found in a cave near Xarrë include [[flint]] and [[jasper]] objects along with fossilised animal bones, while those discoveries at Mount Dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the [[Aurignacian culture]].<ref name="Prendi">F.

The [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-Europeanisation]] of Albania in the context of the IE-isation of the western Balkans began after 2800 BC. The presence of the Early Bronze Age [[Tumulus|tumuli]] in the vicinity of later [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]] dates to 2679±174 calBC (2852-2505 calBC). These burial mounds belong to the southern expression of the Adriatic-Ljubljana culture (related to later [[Cetina culture]]) which moved southwards along the Adriatic from the northern Balkans. The same community built similar mounds in Montenegro (Rakića Kuće) and northern Albania (Shtoj).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Govedarica |first1=Blagoje |title=The Stratigraphy of Tumulus 6 in Shtoj and the Appearance of the Violin Idols in Burial Complexes of the South Adriatic Region |journal=Godišnjak Centra za balkanološka ispitivanja |date=2016 |issue=45 |pages=22–25 |url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=528608 |access-date=7 January 2023 |issn=0350-0020}}</ref> The first [[Archaeogenetics|archaeogenetic]] find related to the IE-isation of Albania involves a man with predominantly [[Western Steppe Herders|Yamnaya ancestry]] buried in a tumulus of northeastern Albania which dates to 2663–2472 calBC.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lazaridis |first1=Iosif |last2=Alpaslan-Roodenberg |first2=Songül |display-authors=et al. |title=The genetic history of the Southern Arc: A bridge between West Asia and Europe |journal=Science |volume=377 |issue=6609 |date=26 August 2022 |page=29 |quote=: Supplementary Materials |pmid=36007055 |pmc=10064553 |s2cid=251843620 |doi=10.1126/science.abm4247 | issn = 0036-8075 }}</ref> During the Middle Bronze Age, Cetina culture sites and finds appear in Albania.

[[File:The City and the Prokletije from the castle.jpg|thumb|right|Founded in the 4th century BC, the city of [[Scodra]] was the capital of the [[Illyrian kingdom]] of [[Ardiaei]] and [[Labeatae]].]]

The incorporated territory of Albania was historically inhabited by [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European people]]s, amongst them numerous [[Illyrian tribes|Illyrian]] and [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirote]] tribes. There were also several [[Greek colonization|Greek colonies]]. The territory referred to as [[Illyria]] corresponded roughly to the area east of the [[Adriatic Sea]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] extending in the south to the mouth of the [[Vjosë]].<ref>The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-631-19807-9}}, page 92, "Appian's description of the Illyrian territories records a southern boundary with Chaonia and Thesprotia, where ancient Epirus began south of river Aoous (Vjose)" [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Nv6SPRKqs8C&pg=PR20 also map]</ref><ref>Cambridge University Press.

The Illyrian [[Taulantii|Taulanti]] were a powerful Illyrian tribe that were among the earliest recorded tribes in the area. They lived in an area that corresponds much of present-day Albania. Together with the Dardanian ruler [[Cleitus (son of Bardylis)|Cleitus]], [[Glaucias of Taulantii|Glaucias]], the ruler of the Taulantian kingdom, fought against [[Alexander the Great]] at the [[Siege of Pelium|Battle of Pelium]] in 335 BC. As the time passed, the ruler of Ancient Macedonia, [[Cassander|Cassander of Macedon]] captured Apollonia and crossed the river [[Shkumbin|Genusus]] ({{Langx|sq|Shkumbin}}) in 314 BC. A few years later Glaucias laid siege to Apollonia and captured the Greek colony of [[Epidamnos]].<ref>Justin, ''Epitome'', 17.3</ref>

The Illyrian [[Ardiaei]] tribe, centred in Montenegro, ruled over most of the territory of northern Albania. Their [[Ardiaean Kingdom]] reached its greatest extent under [[Agron of Illyria|King Agron]], the son of [[Pleuratus II]]. Agron extended his rule over other neighbouring tribes as well.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Hammond |first1=Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière |last2=Walbank |first2=Frank William |date=1 January 1972 |title=A History of Macedonia: 336–167 B.C. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qpb3JdwuDQIC |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-814815-9}}</ref> Following Agron's death in 230 BC, his wife, [[Teuta]], inherited the&nbsp;Ardiaean kingdom.

[[File:Krujë-KrujaAlbania 2016.jpg|thumb|right|The town of [[Krujë]] was the capital of the [[Principality of Arbanon]] in the Middle Ages.]]

The [[Roman Empire]] was split in 395 upon the death of [[Theodosius I]] into an [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] and [[Western Roman Empire]] in part because of the increasing pressure from threats during the [[Barbarian Invasions]]. From the 6th century into the 7th century, the [[South Slavs|Slavs]] crossed the [[Danube]] and largely absorbed the indigenous Greeks, Illyrians and Thracians in the [[Balkans]]; thus, the Illyrians were mentioned for the last time in historical records in the 7th century.<ref name="BideleuxJeffries2007">{{cite book|last1=Bideleux|first1=Robert|last2=Jeffries|first2=Ian|title=Balkans: A Post-Communist History|url=https://archive.org/details/balkanspostcommu0000bide|url-access=registration |date=24 January 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-58328-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/balkanspostcommu0000bide/page/25 25]|quote=From AD 548 onward, the lands now known as Albania began to be overrun from the north by ever-increasing&nbsp;...}}</ref><ref name="Schaefer2008">{{citation|last=Schaefer|first=Richard T.|title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-2694-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jscZAQAAIAAJ}}</ref>

In the 11th century, the [[Great Schism of 1054|Great Schism]] formalised the break of communion between the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Western Catholic Church]] that is reflected in Albania through the emergence of a Catholic north and Orthodox south.

After the dissolution of Arbanon, [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]] concluded an agreement with the Albanian rulers, promising to protect them and their ancient liberties. In 1272, he established the [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|Kingdom of Albania]] and conquered regions back from the [[Despotate of Epirus]]. The kingdom claimed all of central Albania territory from [[Dyrrhachium]] along the Adriatic Sea coast down to [[Butrint]]. A Catholic political structure was a basis for the papal plans of spreading [[Catholicism]] in the Balkan Peninsula. This plan found also the support of [[Helen of Anjou, Queen of Serbia|Helen of Anjou]]. Around 30 Catholic churches and monasteries were built during her rule mainly in northern Albania.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Regnum Albaniae, the Papal Curia, and the Western Visions of a Borderline Nobility |last=Etleva |first=Lala |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2008 |url=http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2009/mphlae01.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2009/mphlae01.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref> Internal power struggles within the Byzantine Empire in the 14th century enabled Serbs' most powerful medieval ruler, [[Stefan Dusan]], to establish a [[Serbian Empire|short-lived empire]] that included all of Albania except Durrës.<ref name="Barbarian Invasions"/>

In 1367, Albanian rulers established the [[Despotate of Arta]]. During that time, several [[Albanian principalities]] were created, notably the [[Principality of Albania (medieval)|Principality of Albania]], [[Principality of Kastrioti]], [[Lordship of Berat]] and [[Principality of Dukagjini]]. In the first half of the 15th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] invaded most of Albania, and the [[League of Lezhë]] was held under [[Skanderbeg]] as a ruler, who became the national hero of the Albanian medieval history.

With the [[fall of Constantinople]], the Ottoman Empire continued an extended period of conquest and expansion with its borders going deep into [[Ottoman conquest of the Balkans|Southeast Europe]]. They reached the [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast]] in 1385 and erected their garrisons across [[Southern Albania]] in 1415 and then occupied most of Albania in 1431.<ref>{{Cite thesis |last=Licursi |first=Emiddio Pietro|title=Empire of Nations: The Consolidation of Albanian and Turkish National Identities in the Late Ottoman Empire, 1878–1913 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/72122169/7/Pashko-Vasa|year=2011 |publisher=Columbia University |location=New York |page=19 |quote=By 1415, after a chaotic interregnum, Sultan Mehmet I sent the military to erect the first Ottoman garrisons throughout southern Albania, establishing direct military authority in the region&nbsp;... l jurisdiction over most of Albania&nbsp;...|hdl=10022/AC:P:10297}}</ref><ref name="Hupchich110">[https://books.google.com/books?id=sQGIDAAAQBAJ&q=albania+vassal+serbia&pg=PA120 The Balkans: From Constantinople to Communism] by D.

A prosperous and longstanding revolution erupted after the formation of the [[League of Lezhë]] until the [[Siege of Shkodra|fall of Shkodër]] under the leadership of [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg]], who consistently defeated major Ottoman armies led by [[Sultan]]s [[Murad II]] and [[Mehmed II]]. Skanderbeg managed to unite several of the Albanian principalities, amongst them the [[Arianiti family|Arianiti]]s, [[Dukagjini family|Dukagjini]]s, [[Zaharia family|Zaharia]]s and [[Thopia family|Thopia]]s, and establish a centralised authority over most of the non-conquered territories, becoming the [[Skanderbeg|Lord of Albania]].<ref name="League of Lezhë">{{cite book |author1=Rob Pickard |title=Analysis and Reform of Cultural Heritage Policies in South-East Europe |date=2008 |isbn=978-92-871-6265-6 |page=16 |publisher=Council of Europe |edition=Europarat}}</ref> The Ottoman Empire's expansion ground to a halt during the time that Skanderbeg's forces resisted, and he has been credited with being one of the main reasons for the delay of Ottoman expansion into [[Western Europe]], giving the Italian principalities more time to better prepare for the [[Siege of Otranto|Ottoman arrival]].{{sfn|Hodgkinson|2005|p=240}} However, the failure of most European nations, with the exception of Naples, in giving him support, along with the failure of Pope Pius II's plans to organise a promised crusade against the Ottomans meant that none of Skanderbeg's victories permanently hindered the Ottomans from invading the Western Balkans.{{sfn|Hodgkinson|2005|p=xii}}<ref name="Pitcher1968">{{cite book |last=Donald Edgar Pitcher |title=An Historical Geography of the Ottoman Empire: From Earliest Times to the End of the Sixteenth Century |publisher=Brill |year=1968 |page=88}}</ref>

Despite his brilliance as a military leader, Skanderbeg's victories were only delaying the final conquests. The constant Ottoman invasions caused enormous destruction to Albania, greatly reducing the population and destroying flocks of livestock and crops. Besides surrender, there was no possible way Skanderbeg would be able to halt the Ottoman invasions despite his successes against them. His manpower and resources were insufficient, preventing him from expanding the war efforts and driving the Turks from the Albanian borders. Albania was therefore doomed to face an unending series of Ottoman attacks until it eventually fell years after his death.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fine |first=John V.A. |title=The late medieval Balkans: a critical survey from the late twelfth century to the Ottoman conquest |date=1994 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor, MI |isbn=9780472082605 |page=598 |edition=2. print |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvVbRrH1QBgC}}</ref>

When the Ottomans were gaining a firm foothold in the region, Albanian towns were organised into four principal [[sanjaks]]. The government fostered trade by settling a sizeable Jewish colony of refugees fleeing persecution in Spain. The city of [[Vlorë]] saw passing through its ports imported merchandise from Europe such as velvets, cotton goods, mohairs, carpets, spices and leather from [[Bursa]] and [[Constantinople]]. Some citizens of Vlorë even had business associates throughout Europe.<ref name=Arnawutlu/>

The phenomenon of Islamisation among the Albanians became primarily widespread from the 17th century and continued into the 18th century.<ref name="referenceworks.brillonline"/> Islam offered them equal opportunities and advancement within the Ottoman Empire. However, motives for conversion were, according to some scholars, diverse depending on the context though the lack of source material does not help when investigating such issues.<ref name="referenceworks.brillonline"/> Because of increasing suppression of Catholicism, most Catholic Albanians converted in the 17th century, while Orthodox Albanians followed suit mainly in the following century.

Since the Albanians were seen as strategically important, they made up a significant proportion of the [[Ottoman military]] and bureaucracy. Many Muslim Albanians attained important political and military positions and culturally contributed to the broader [[Muslim world]].<ref name="referenceworks.brillonline">Clayer, Nathalie (2012).

The [[Albanian Renaissance]] was a period with its roots in the late 18th century and continuing into the 19th century, during which the Albanian people gathered spiritual and intellectual strength for an independent cultural and political life within an [[Independent Albania|independent nation]]. Modern [[Albanian culture]] flourished too, especially [[Albanian literature]] and [[Albanian art|arts]], and was frequently linked to the influences of the [[Romanticism]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Sarah Amsler |title=Theorising Social Change in Post-Soviet Countries: Critical Approaches |publisher=Peter Lang, 2007 |isbn=9783039103294 |pages=96105 |edition=Balihar Sanghera, Sarah Amsler, Tatiana Yarkova |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MzXP_r6oAxwC&pg=PA96 |year=2007}}</ref> Prior to the [[Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire|rise of nationalism]], Ottoman authorities suppressed any expression of national unity or conscience by the Albanian people.

The victory of Russia over the Ottoman Empire following the [[Russian-Ottoman War]]s resulted the execution of the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] which assigned Albanian-populated lands to their Slavic and Greek neighbours. However, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] consequently blocked the arrangement and caused the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. From this point, Albanians started to organise themselves with the goal to protect and unite the Albanian-populated lands into a unitary nation, leading to the formation of the [[League of Prizren]]. The league had initially the assistance of the Ottoman authorities whose position was based on the religious solidarity of Muslim people and landlords connected with the [[Ottoman Porte|Ottoman administration]]. They favoured and protected the Muslim solidarity and called for defence of Muslim lands simultaneously constituting the reason for titling the league [[League of Prizren#Formation|Committee of the Real Muslims]].<ref>{{Citation |last1=Kopecek |first1=Michal |last2=Ersoy |first2=Ahmed |last3=Gorni |first3=Maciej |last4=Kechriotis |first4=Vangelis |last5=Manchev |first5=Boyan |last6=Trencsenyi |first6=Balazs |last7=Turda |first7=Marius |title=Discourses of collective identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770–1945) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5Vsjg508EYC&pg=PA349 |volume=1 |year=2006 |publisher=Central European University Press |location=Budapest, Hungary |isbn=978-963-7326-52-3 |page=348 |quote=The position of the League in the beginning was based on religious solidarity.

Ottomans authorities cancelled their assistance when the league, under [[Abdyl Frashëri]], became focused on working towards Albanian autonomy and requested merging four [[Ottoman vilayet|vilayet]]s, including [[Kosovo Vilayet|Kosovo]], [[Scutari Vilayet|Shkodër]], [[Monastir Vilayet|Monastir]] and [[Janina Vilayet|Ioannina]], into a unified vilayet, the [[Albanian Vilayet]].

Albania's diplomatic history under Hoxha was characterised by notable conflicts.<ref name="Zickel/Iwaskiw"/> Initially aligned with Yugoslavia as a satellite state, the relationship deteriorated as Yugoslavia aimed to incorporate Albania within its territory.<ref name="Zickel/Iwaskiw"/> Subsequently, Albania established relations with the Soviet Union and engaged trade agreements with other Eastern European countries, but experienced disagreements over Soviet policies, leading to strained ties with Moscow and diplomatic separation in 1961.<ref name="Zickel/Iwaskiw"/> Simultaneously, tensions with the West heightened due to Albania's refusal to hold free elections and allegations of Western support for [[Anti-communism|anti-communist uprisings]]. Albania's enduring partnership was with China; it sided with Beijing during the [[Sino-Soviet split|Sino-Soviet conflict]], resulting in severed ties with the Soviet Union and withdrawal from the [[Warsaw Pact]] in response to the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. But their relations stagnated in 1970, prompting both to reassess their commitment, and Albania actively reduced its dependence on China.<ref name="Zickel/Iwaskiw"/>

Under Hoxha's regime, Albania underwent a widespread campaign targeting religious clergy of various faiths, resulting in public persecution and executions, particularly targeting Muslims, Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox adherents.<ref name="Zickel/Iwaskiw"/> In 1946, religious estates underwent nationalisation, coinciding with the closure or transformation of religious institutions into various other purposes.<ref name="Zickel/Iwaskiw"/> This culminated in 1976, when Albania became the world's first constitutionally atheist state.<ref name="Elsie p27">{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|last=Elsie|first=Robert|publisher=[[The Scarecrow Press]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8108-6188-6|edition=2nd|series=Historical Dictionaries of Europe, No. 75|location=Lanham, MD, and Plymouth|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&pg=PA27 27]}}</ref> Under this regime, citizens were forced to renounce their religious beliefs, adopt a secular way of life, and embrace socialist ideology.<ref name="Zickel/Iwaskiw"/><ref name="Elsie p27"/>

After four decades of communism paired with the [[revolutions of 1989]], Albania witnessed a notable rise in political activism, particularly among students, which led to a transformation in the prevailing order. After the first [[multi-party elections]] of [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1991|1991]], the communist party maintained a stronghold in the parliament until its defeat in the [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1992|parliamentary elections of 1992]] directed by the [[Democratic Party of Albania|Democratic Party]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (CSCE) |title=Report: The Elections in Albania |url=https://www.csce.gov/international-impact/publications/report-elections-albania |access-date=1 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201001110932/https://www.csce.gov/international-impact/publications/report-elections-albania |archive-date=1 October 2020 |date=4 April 1991}}</ref> Considerable economic and financial resources were devoted to [[Pyramid schemes in Albania|pyramid schemes]] that were widely supported by the government. The schemes swept up somewhere between one sixth and one third of the population of the country.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jarvis |first=Christopher |year=2000 |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2000/03/jarvis.htm |title=The Rise and Fall of the Albanian Pyramid Schemes |journal=Finance and Development |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Bezemer |first=Dirk |year=2001 |title=Post-socialist Financial Fragility: The Case of Albania |journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=1–25 |doi=10.1093/cje/25.1.1 |jstor=23599718 |hdl=10419/85494 |hdl-access=free |url=http://papers.tinbergen.nl/99045.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://papers.tinbergen.nl/99045.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref> Despite the [[International Monetary Fund]]'s warnings, [[Sali Berisha]] defended the schemes as large investment firms, leading more people to redirect their remittances and sell their homes and cattle for cash to deposit in the schemes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Musaraj |first=Smoki |year=2011 |title=Tales from Albarado: The Materiality of Pyramid Schemes in Post-socialist Albania |journal=Cultural Anthropology |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=84–110 |doi=10.1111/j.1548-1360.2010.01081.x|doi-access=free }}</ref>

The schemes began to collapse in late 1996, leading many of the investors to join initially peaceful protests against the government, requesting their money back. The protests turned violent in February 1997 as government forces responded by firing on the demonstrators. In March, the Police and Republican Guard deserted, leaving their armories open. These were promptly emptied by militias and criminal gangs. The resulting [[1997 Albanian civil unrest|civil war]] caused a wave of evacuations of foreign nationals and refugees.<ref>For the most part, the [[Albanian diaspora|Albanian refugees]] emigrated to [[Albanians in Italy|Italy]], [[Albanian communities in Greece|Greece]], [[Albanians in Switzerland|Switzerland]], [[Albanians in Germany|Germany]], or North America.</ref>

The crisis led both [[Aleksandër Meksi]] and [[Sali Berisha]] to resign from office in the wake of the general election. In April 1997, [[Operation Alba]], a U.N. peacekeeping force led by Italy, entered Albania with two goals: to assist with the evacuation of expatriates and secure the ground for international organisations. The main international organisation involved was the [[Western European Union]]'s [[Albanian civil war of 1997#International intervention|multinational]] [[Albanian Police]] element, which worked with the government to restructure the [[Judicial system of Albania|judicial system]] and simultaneously the Albanian police.
