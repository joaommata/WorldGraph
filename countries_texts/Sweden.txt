===Viking Age===

[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|upright=1.3|thumb|left|[[Viking]] expeditions (blue lines)]]

The Swedish [[Viking Age]] lasted roughly from the eighth century to the 11th century. It is believed that Swedish Vikings and [[Gutes|Gutar]] mainly travelled east and south, going to Finland, Estonia, the [[Baltic countries]], Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, the [[Black Sea]] and even as far as [[Baghdad]]. Their routes passed [[The Trade Route from the Varangians to the Greeks|through the Dnieper]] south to [[Constantinople]], on which they carried out numerous raids. The [[Byzantine Emperor|Byzantine emperor]] [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] noticed their great skills in war and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard, known as the [[Varangian Guard]]. The Swedish Vikings, called [[Rus (people)|Rus]], are believed to be the founders of [[Kievan Rus']].<ref name="MartinMartin1995">{{cite book|author1=Janet L. B. Martin|author2=John D.

There was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards, which are commemorated on stones such as the [[England runestones]]. The last major Swedish Viking expedition appears to have been the ill-fated expedition of [[Ingvar the Far-Travelled]] to [[Serkland]], the region south-east of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Its members are commemorated on the [[Ingvar runestones]], none of which mentions any survivor.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Robert |title=The Hammer and the Cross: A New History of the Vikings |date=2009 |publisher= Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-192387-1 |language=en}}</ref>

During the early stages of the Viking Age, a centre of trade in [[Northern Europe]] developed at [[Birka]] on the island of [[Björkö, Ekerö|Björkö]], not far from where Stockholm was later constructed, in mid-latitude Sweden. Birka was founded around 750 AD as a trading port by a king or merchants trying to control trade.<ref name=":birka">{{Cite journal|last1=Price|first1=T.

===Kingdom of Sweden===
[[File:Map of Sweden ca 1280.png|thumb|right|A rough map of the extent of Swedish rule, {{circa|1280}}]]
The exact age of the kingdom of Sweden is unknown.<ref name="sh">{{cite book |last1=Hadenius |first1=Stig |last2=Nilsson |first2=Torbjörn |last3=Åselius |first3=Gunnar |title=Sveriges historia: vad varje svensk bör veta |trans-title=History of Sweden: what every Swede should know |year=1996 |publisher=Bonnier Alba |language=sv |isbn=978-91-34-51784-4}}</ref> Determining its age depends mostly on whether Sweden is considered a nation when the {{Lang|sv|[[Svear]]}} (Swedes) ruled Svealand or when the {{Lang|sv|Svear}} and the {{Lang|sv|[[Götar]]}} (Geats) of Götaland were united under a single ruler. Svealand was described by [[Tacitus]] in 98 AD as being under a single ruler, though it is unknown how long this had been the case. The epic poem ''Beowulf'' describes semi-legendary [[Swedish-Geatish wars]] in the sixth century.

However, historians typically start the line of [[Swedish monarchs]] from when Svealand and Götaland were ruled under the same king, namely [[Erik the Victorious]] and his son [[Olof Skötkonung]] in the tenth century. These events are often described as the [[consolidation of Sweden]], although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later. In this context, "Götaland" primarily refers to the provinces of [[Östergötland]] and [[Västergötland]]. [[Småland]] was of little interest at the time due to its deep pine forests, with only the city of [[Kalmar]] and its castle holding any significant importance. There were also Swedish settlements along the southern coastline of [[Norrland]], one of the four [[lands of Sweden]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Peterson |first=Gary Dean |title=Warrior Kings of Sweden: The Rise of an Empire in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries |date=2014 |publisher= McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-0411-4 |language=en}}</ref>

[[Ansgar|Saint Ansgar]] is traditionally credited with introducing Christianity to Sweden in 829, but the new religion did not begin to fully replace [[paganism]] until the 12th century. During that century, Sweden was undergoing dynastic struggles between the [[House of Eric|Erik]] and [[House of Sverker|Sverker]] clans. The conflict ended when a third clan married into the Erik clan, founding the [[House of Bjälbo|Bjälbo]] dynasty, which gradually consolidated Sweden into a stronger state. According to the ''Legend of [[Saint Erik]]'' and the ''[[Erik's Chronicle]]'', Swedish kings conducted [[Swedish Crusades (disambiguation)|a series of Crusades]] to pagan Finland and started conflicts with the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']], who by then had no further connections with Sweden.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bagge |first=Sverre |chapter=The Scandinavian Kingdoms |title=The New Cambridge Medieval History |editor-first=Rosamond |editor-last=McKitterick |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-521-36289-4 |page=724 |quote=Swedish expansion in Finland led to conflicts with Rus', which were temporarily brought to an end by a peace treaty in 1323, dividing the Karelian peninsula and the northern areas between the two countries.}}</ref> As a result of the Crusades, mostly with the Second Swedish Crusade led by [[Birger Jarl]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ruotsin itämaa|last=Tarkiainen|first=Kari|publisher=Svenska litteratursällskapet i Finland |year=2010 |isbn=978-951-583-212-2 |location=Helsinki|pages=104–147}}</ref> Finland gradually became part of the kingdom of Sweden and the sphere of influence of the [[Catholic Church]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ruotsin itämaa|last=Tarkiainen|first=Kari|publisher=Svenska litteratursällskapet i Finland |year=2010 |isbn=978-951-583-212-2 |location=Porvoo |pages=167–170}}</ref> The Swedes built fortresses in [[Häme|Tavastland]] and [[Åbo]], while a Swedish royal council was instituted, an administrative structure and fiscal apparatus was created, and law codes were codified during the reigns of [[Magnus Ladulås]] (1275–1290) and [[Magnus Eriksson]] (1319–1364).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kirby |first1=David |title=A Concise History of Finland |date=13 July 2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-83225-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hF-e7dTr_xYC |language=en}}</ref> As a result, the Finnish lands were firmly integrated into the Swedish realm.<ref>Kirby, p.9</ref>

Except for the provinces of Scania, Blekinge, and Halland in the southwest of the Scandinavian peninsula, which were part of the Kingdom of Denmark during this period, [[feudalism]] never developed in Sweden as it did in much of Europe.<ref>{{cite book |first=Franklin D. |last=Scott |title=Sweden: The Nation's History |url=https://archive.org/details/swedennationshis00scot |url-access=registration |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1977 |page=[https://archive.org/details/swedennationshis00scot/page/58 58]|isbn=978-0-8166-0804-1 }}</ref> As a result, the peasantry remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of Swedish history.

Sweden remained a poor and economically underdeveloped country, where barter was the primary means of exchange.<ref>Scott, pp. 55–56.</ref>

In 1319, Sweden and Norway were united in a [[personal union]] under King Magnus Eriksson, the grandson of King [[Magnus Ladulås]] of Sweden and of King [[Haakon V of Norway|Haakon V]] of Norway. Magnus Eriksson also ruled Scania from 1332 to 1360. In the mid-14th century, Sweden was struck by the [[Black Death]].<ref>Scott, pp. 56–57.</ref> The population of Sweden and most of Europe was decimated. The population did not reach its pre-1348 levels until the beginning of the 19th century, with one third of the population dying between 1349 and 1351. During this period, the cities began to acquire greater rights and were heavily influenced by German merchants of the [[Hanseatic League]], active especially at [[Visby]]. In 1397, Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark]] (the former daughter-in-law of Magnus Eriksson) established the personal union of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark through the [[Kalmar Union]]. However, Margaret's successors, whose rule was centred in Denmark, were unable to control the Swedish nobility.

In 1520, King [[Christian II of Denmark]], who attempted to restore the Union of Kalmar through military force, ordered the massacre of Swedish nobles in Stockholm, an event known as the "[[Stockholm Bloodbath]]." This atrocity incited the Swedish nobility to renew their resistance, and on 6 June 1523 (now celebrated as [[National Day of Sweden|Sweden's National Day]]), they made [[Gustav Vasa]] their king.<ref name="Scott, p. 121">Scott, p. 121.</ref> This is sometimes considered as the [[foundation of modern Sweden]].

The end of the 16th century was marked by a final phase of rivalry between the remaining Catholics and the new Protestant communities.

In the 17th century, Sweden was engaged in many wars, for example with Poland–Lithuania, with both sides competing for territories of today's [[Baltic states]]. The Polish–Swedish War (1626–1629) ended with a ceasefire in [[Stary Targ]] ([[Truce of Altmark]]) on 26 September 1629 that was in favour of the Swedes, to whom Poland ceded the larger part of [[Livonia]] together with its important port of [[Riga]]. The Swedes also gained the right to tax Poland’s Baltic trade (3.5% on the value of goods), and kept control of several cities in [[Royal Prussia]] and [[Ducal Prussia]] (including [[Pillau]] (Baltiysk), [[Klaipėda|Memel]] (Klaipėda) and [[Elbing]] (Elbląg)). The Swedes later conducted a series of invasions into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, known as the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]].{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=156}} After more than half a century of almost constant warfare, the Swedish economy had deteriorated. It became the lifetime task of Charles X's son, [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]], to rebuild the economy and refit the army.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=216}} His legacy to his son, the coming ruler of Sweden, [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]], was one of the finest arsenals in the world, a large standing army and a great fleet.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=222}} Russia, the most serious threat to Sweden at this time, had a larger army but lagged far behind in both equipment and training.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=232}}

After the [[Battle of Narva (1700)|Battle of Narva]] in 1700, one of the first battles of the [[Great Northern War]], the Russian army was so severely devastated that Sweden had an open chance to invade Russia.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=230}} However, Charles XII did not pursue the Russian army, instead [[Swedish invasion of Poland (1701–1706)|turning against Poland]] and defeating the Polish king, [[Augustus II the Strong]], and his Saxon allies at the [[Battle of Kliszów]] in 1702.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=272}} This gave Russia time to rebuild and modernise its army.

[[File:Marten's Poltava.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709. In the following years, Russia and her allies occupied all [[Dominions of Sweden|Swedish dominions]] on the Baltic coast and even Finland.]]

After the success of invading Poland, Charles XII decided to make an attempt at [[Swedish invasion of Russia|invading Russia]], but this ended in a decisive Russian victory at the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=290}} After a long march exposed to [[Cossack]] raids, the Russian Tsar [[Peter the Great]]'s [[scorched-earth]] techniques and [[Great Frost of 1709|the extremely cold winter of 1709]], the Swedes stood weakened with a shattered morale and were enormously outnumbered against the Russian army at Poltava.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=286}} The defeat meant the beginning of the end for the Swedish Empire.

Forced to cede large areas of land in the [[Treaty of Nystad]] in 1721, Sweden also lost its place as an empire and as the dominant state on the Baltic Sea.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=296}} With Sweden's lost influence, Russia emerged as an empire and became one of [[European balance of power|Europe's dominant nations]]. As the war finally ended in 1721, Sweden had lost an estimated 200,000 men, 150,000 of those from the area of present-day Sweden and 50,000 from the [[Finland under Swedish rule|Finnish part of Sweden]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ericson|first=Lars|title=Svenska knektar|publisher=Historiska media|year=2004|language=sv|page=92}}</ref>
Executive power was historically shared between the King and an aristocratic [[Privy council]] until 1680, followed by the King's [[autocracy|autocratic rule]] initiated by the commoner estates of the [[Riksdag]]. As a reaction to the failed Great Northern War, a parliamentary system was introduced in 1719, followed by three different flavours of constitutional monarchy in 1772, 1789 and 1809, [[Swedish constitution of 1809|the latter]] granting several civil liberties. Already during the first of those three periods, the 'Era of Liberty' (1719–72) the Swedish Riksdag had developed into a very active parliament, and this tradition continued into the nineteenth century, laying the basis for the transition towards modern democracy at the end of that century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

In the 18th century, Sweden did not have enough resources to maintain its territories outside Scandinavia, and most of them were lost, culminating with [[Finnish War|the loss in 1809]] of eastern Sweden to Russia, which became the highly autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Principality of Finland]] in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Eino|last1=Jutikkala|first2=Kauko|last2=Pirinen|title=A History of Finland|year=2003|isbn=978-951-0-27911-3|page=287}}</ref>

In interest of re-establishing Swedish dominance in the Baltic Sea, Sweden allied itself against its traditional ally and benefactor, France, in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. However, in 1810, a French Marshal, [[Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]], was chosen as heir presumptive to [[Charles XIII]]; in 1818, he established the [[House of Bernadotte]], taking the [[regnal name]] of Charles XIV. Sweden's role in the [[Battle of Leipzig]] gave it the authority to force Denmark–Norway, an ally of France, to cede Norway to the King of Sweden on 14 January 1814 in exchange for the northern German provinces, at the [[Treaty of Kiel]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Schäfer|first=Anton|title=Zeittafel der Rechtsgeschichte.

One hundred years later, the corresponding figure was still 72%.}}</ref>

Despite the slow rate of industrialisation into the 19th century, many important changes were taking place in the agrarian economy due to constant innovations and a rapid population growth.<ref name="Koblik9-10">Koblik, pp. 9–10.</ref> These innovations included government-sponsored programmes of [[enclosure]], aggressive exploitation of agricultural lands, and the introduction of new crops such as the potato.<ref name="Koblik9-10" /> The Swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in Swedish politics, which has continued through modern times with modern Agrarian party (now called the Centre Party).<ref>Koblik, p. 11: "The agrarian revolution in Sweden is of fundamental importance for Sweden's modern development. Throughout Swedish history the countryside has taken an unusually important role in comparison with other European states."</ref> Between 1870 and 1914, Sweden began developing the industrialised economy that exists today.<ref>Koblik, p. 90. "It is usually suggested that between 1870 and 1914 Sweden emerged from its primarily agrarian economic system into a modern industrial economy."</ref>

Strong grassroots movements sprang up in Sweden during the latter half of the 19th century (trade unions, [[temperance movement|temperance]] groups, and independent religious groups), creating a strong foundation of democratic principles. These movements precipitated Sweden's migration into a modern parliamentary democracy, achieved by the time of World War I. As the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed during the 20th century, people gradually moved into cities to work in factories and became involved in socialist unions. A communist revolution was avoided in 1917, following the re-introduction of [[parliamentarism]], and the country was [[Democracy|democratised]].

===World War I and World War II===
{{Main|Sweden during World War I|Sweden during World War II}}

Sweden was officially neutral during [[World War I]]. However, under pressure from the [[German Empire]], they did take steps which were detrimental to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] – most notably, mining the [[Öresund]] channel, thus closing it to Allied shipping, and allowing the Germans to use Swedish facilities and the Swedish [[cipher]] to transmit secret messages to their overseas embassies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Siney|first=Marion C.|title=Swedish neutrality and economic warfare in World War I|journal=Conspectus of History|year=1975|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://libx.bsu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/ConspectusH&CISOPTR=410&REC=1|access-date=12 May 2014|archive-date=5 October 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231005113722/https://dmr.bsu.edu/digital/collection/ConspectusH/id/410|url-status=live}}</ref> Sweden also allowed volunteers to fight alongside the Germans for the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]] against the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] and Russians in the [[Finnish Civil War]], and briefly occupied [[Åland]] in cooperation with the German Empire.

As in the First World War, Sweden remained officially neutral during [[World War II]], although its neutrality has been disputed.<ref name="Koblik303-313">Koblik, pp. 303–313.</ref><ref>Nordstrom, p. 315: "Sweden's government attempted to maintain at least a semblance of neutrality while it bent to the demands of the prevailing side in the struggle. Although effective in preserving the country's sovereignty, this approach generated criticism at home from many who believed the threat to Sweden was less serious than the government claimed, problems with the warring powers, ill feelings among its neighbours, and frequent criticism in the postwar period."</ref> Sweden was under German influence for much of the war, as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades.<ref name="Koblik303-313" /><!---Koblik, pg. 307. "Through the blockade of foreign trade that culminated in the establishment of the [[Skagerrak]] blockade in connection with the German invasion of Denmark and Norway in April 1940, Swedish imports were reduced by approximately one-half and exports by about one-third in comparison with the average volume of 1936–1938."---> The Swedish government unofficially supported Finland in the [[Winter War]] and the [[Continuation War]] by allowing volunteers and [[materiel]] to be shipped to Finland. However, Sweden supported Norwegian resistance against Germany, and in 1943 helped [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|rescue Danish Jews]] from deportation to [[Nazi concentration camps]].

During the last year of the war, Sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts, and many refugees, among them several thousand Jews from Nazi-occupied Europe, were rescued thanks to the [[White Buses|Swedish rescue missions to internment camps]] and partly because Sweden served as a haven for refugees.<ref name="NB313-319" /><!---Nordstrom, p. 317: "In the last year of the war, Sweden became a factor in humanitarian efforts and attempts to end the war. It also became a haven for refugees from ''Norden'' and the Baltic states, and Swedes were involved in rescuing Scandinavian victims of internment camps." --- Nordstrom, p. 318: "By late 1943 Sweden was a haven for some 11,000 refugees from Denmark, including over 7,000 Danish Jews, and about 30,000 Norwegians."---> The Swedish diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]] and his colleagues ensured the safety of tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/wallenberg.html |title=Raoul Wallenberg |website=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |access-date=28 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205181950/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/wallenberg.html |archive-date=5 December 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> Nevertheless, both Swedes and others have argued that Sweden could have done more to oppose the Nazis' war efforts.<ref name="NB313-319">Nordstrom, pp. 313–319.</ref>

===Post-war era===
[[File:Olivecrona erlander 380.jpg|thumb|[[Tage Erlander]] (left), Prime Minister under the ruling [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] from 1946 to 1969]]
Sweden was officially a neutral country and remained outside [[NATO]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] membership during the [[Cold War]], but privately Sweden's leadership had strong ties with the United States and other western governments. Following the war, Sweden took advantage of an intact industrial base, social stability and its natural resources to expand its industry to supply the rebuilding of Europe.<ref name="NB335-339">Nordstrom, pp. 335–339.</ref><!---Recovery from the material damage and economic shocks of the war was more rapid than many expected."---> Sweden received aid under the [[Marshall Plan]] and participated in the OECD. During most of the post-war era, the country was governed by the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] largely in co-operation with [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation|trade unions]] and industry. The government actively pursued an internationally competitive manufacturing sector of primarily large corporations.<ref name="svensteinmo" />

Sweden was one of the founding states of the [[European Free Trade Area]] (EFTA). During the 1960s the EFTA countries were often referred to as the Outer Seven, as opposed to the [[Inner Six]] of the then-[[European Economic Community]] (EEC).<ref>{{cite news |title=Finland: Now, the Seven and a Half |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=7 April 1961 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874317,00.htm |access-date=18 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104144427/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874317,00.htm |archive-date=4 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Like many industrialised countries, Sweden entered a period of economic decline and upheaval following the oil embargoes of 1973–74 and 1978–79.<ref>Nordstrom, p. 344: "During the last 25 years of the century a host of problems plagued the economies of Norden and the West. Although many were present before, the 1973 and 1980 global oil crises acted as catalysts in bringing them to the fore."</ref> In the 1980s several key Swedish industries were significantly restructured.
