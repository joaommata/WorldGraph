According to [[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's]] ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', the [[Belgae]] inhabited the northernmost part of [[Gaul]], a region extending from the [[Seine]] and [[Marne (river)|Marne]] rivers to the [[Rhine]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=C.

Following Caesar's conquests, Gallia Belgica became the [[Latin]] name for a large Roman province encompassing most of [[Gaul|Northern Gaul]], including the lands of the Belgae and Treveri. Subsequently, areas closer to the lower Rhine frontier, such as the eastern part of modern Belgium, were incorporated into the frontier province of [[Germania Inferior]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Germania Inferior {{!}} Roman province, Europe {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Germania-Inferior |access-date=2025-04-05 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Germania Inferior (1) - Livius |url=https://www.livius.org/articles/place/germania-inferior/ |access-date=2025-04-05 |website=www.livius.org}}</ref> As the central government of the [[Western Roman Empire]] collapsed, the provinces of Belgica and Germania were inhabited by a mix of Romanized populations and Germanic-speaking [[Franks]], who came to dominate the military and political spheres.<ref>Hamerow, Theodore S., Leyser, K.J., Geary, Patrick J., Wallace-Hadrill, John Michael, Barkin, Kenneth, Berentsen, William H., Duggan, Lawrence G., Schleunes, Karl A., Sheehan, James J., Kirby, George Hall, Bayley, Charles Calvert, Turner, Henry Ashby, Heather, Peter John, Elkins, Thomas Henry, Strauss, Gerald.

===Middle Ages===
During the 5th century, the area came under the rule of the Frankish [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] kings, who initially established a kingdom ruling over the Romanized population in what is now northern France, and then conquered the other Frankish kingdoms. During the 8th century, the empire of the Franks came to be ruled by the [[Carolingian dynasty]], whose centre of power included the area which is now eastern Belgium.<ref>{{citation|first=Matthias|last=Werner|title=Der Lütticher Raum in frühkarolingischer Zeit : Untersuchungen zur Geschichte einer karolingischen Stammlandschaft|year=1980}}</ref> Over the centuries, it was divided up in many ways, but the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843 divided the Carolingian Empire into three kingdoms whose borders had a lasting impact on medieval political boundaries. Most of modern Belgium was in the [[Middle Francia|Middle Kingdom]], later known as [[Lotharingia]], but the coastal [[county of Flanders]], west of the [[Scheldt]], became the northernmost part of [[West Francia]], the predecessor of [[France]]. In 870 in the [[Treaty of Meerssen]], modern Belgium lands all became part of the western kingdom for a period, but in 880 in the [[Treaty of Ribemont]], Lotharingia came under the lasting control of the eastern kingdom, which became the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The lordships and bishoprics along the "March" (frontier) between the two great kingdoms maintained important connections between each other. For example, the county of Flanders expanded over the Scheldt into the empire, and during several periods was ruled by the same lords as the [[county of Hainaut]].

In the 13th and 14th centuries, the cloth industry and commerce boomed especially in the County of Flanders and it became one of the richest areas in Europe. This prosperity played a role in conflicts between Flanders and the [[king of France]]. Famously, Flemish militias scored a surprise victory at the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] against a strong force of mounted knights in 1302, but France soon regained control of the rebellious province.

===Burgundian and Habsburg Netherlands===
[[File:Karte-Haus-Burgund 4-FR.png|thumb|upright|The [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian State]] of [[Charles the Bold]] in the 15th century]]

In the 15th century, the [[Duke of Burgundy]] in France took control of Flanders, and from there [[Burgundian inheritance in the Low Countries|proceeded to unite]] much of what is now the Benelux, the so-called [[Burgundian Netherlands]].<ref name="Wl7Nu">{{cite web|title=Chapter I: The Burgundian Netherlands.|work=History of Holland|author=Edmundson, George|publisher=The University Press, Cambridge.

Born in Belgium, the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles&nbsp;V]] was heir of the Burgundians, but also of the royal families of [[House of Habsburg|Austria]], [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]]. With the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]] he gave the [[Seventeen Provinces]] more legitimacy as a stable entity, rather than just a temporary [[personal union]]. He also increased the influence of these Netherlands over the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]], which continued to exist as a large semi-independent enclave.<ref name="3kmvZ">{{cite web|title=Chapter II: Habsburg Rule in the Netherlands|work=History of Holland|author=Edmundson, George|publisher=The University Press, Cambridge.

===Spanish and Austrian Netherlands===
The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) was triggered by the Spanish government's policy towards [[Protestantism]], which was becoming popular in the Low Countries. The rebellious northern [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] (''Belgica Foederata'' in [[Latin]], the "Federated Netherlands") eventually separated from the [[Southern Netherlands]] (''Belgica Regia'', the "Royal Netherlands"). The southern part continued to be ruled successively by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] ([[Spanish Netherlands]]) and the [[History of Austria|Austrian]] [[House of Habsburg]]s ([[Austrian Netherlands]]) and comprised most of modern Belgium. This was the theatre of several more protracted conflicts during much of the 17th and 18th centuries involving France, including the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (1672–1678), the [[Nine Years' War]] (1688–1697), the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–1714), and part of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740–1748).

===French Revolution and United Kingdom of the Netherlands===
Following the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1794|campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars]], the Low Countries{{snd}}including territories that were never nominally under Habsburg rule, such as the Prince-Bishopric of Liège{{snd}}were annexed by the [[French First Republic]], ending Austrian rule in the region. After the dissolution of the [[First French Empire]] and the abdication of [[Napoleon]] following his defeat on the [[Battle of Waterloo|battlefield of Waterloo]], the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1814–15 created the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. This [[buffer state]], located between the major European powers, united the former territories of the Dutch Republic, the Austrian Netherlands and the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, under King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I of Orange]].

===Independent Belgium===

In 1830, the [[Belgian Revolution]] led to the re-separation of the Southern Provinces from the Netherlands and to the establishment of a Catholic and bourgeois, officially French-speaking and neutral, independent Belgium under a [[Provisional Government of Belgium|provisional government]] and a [[national Congress of Belgium|national congress]].<ref name="Dobbelaere-VoyE">{{cite journal|title = From Pillar to Postmodernity: The Changing Situation of Religion in Belgium|journal = Sociological Analysis|volume = 51|pages = S1–S13|year = 1990|author = Dobbelaere, Karel|author2 = Voyé, Liliane|doi = 10.2307/3711670|jstor = 3711670|df = dmy-all|author-link = Karel Dobbelaere}}</ref><ref name="Gooch"><!--Is this the best source?

The main political parties of the 19th century were the [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]] and the [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal Party]], with the [[Belgian Labour Party]] emerging towards the end of the 19th century. French was originally the official language used by the [[nobility]] and the [[bourgeoisie]], especially after the rejection of the Dutch monarchy. French progressively lost its dominance as Dutch began to recover its status. This recognition became official in 1898, and in 1967, the parliament accepted a Dutch version of the [[Belgian Constitution|Constitution]].<ref name="etpIA">{{cite web|title=Ethnic structure, inequality and governance of the public sector in Belgium|last=Deschouwer|first=Kris|publisher=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD)|date=January 2004|url=http://www.unrisd.org/UNRISD/website/document.nsf/ab82a6805797760f80256b4f005da1ab/ec506a59176be044c1256e9e003077c3/$FILE/Deschou.pdf|access-date=22 May 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614025223/http://www.unrisd.org/UNRISD/website/document.nsf/ab82a6805797760f80256b4f005da1ab/ec506a59176be044c1256e9e003077c3/%24FILE/Deschou.pdf|archive-date=14 June 2007}}</ref>

[[German invasion of Belgium (1914)|Germany invaded Belgium in August 1914]] as part of the [[Schlieffen Plan]] to attack [[France]], and much of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] fighting of [[World War I]] occurred in western parts of the country. The opening months of the war were known as the [[Rape of Belgium]] due to German excesses. Belgium assumed control of the [[German colonies]] of [[Ruanda-Urundi]] (modern-day [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]) during the war, and in 1924 the [[League of Nations]] mandated them to Belgium. In the aftermath of the First World War, Belgium annexed the [[districts of Prussia|Prussian districts]] of [[Eupen-Malmedy|Eupen and Malmedy]] in 1925, thereby causing the presence of a German-speaking minority.

[[Battle of Belgium|German forces again invaded the country in May 1940]], and 40,690 Belgians, over half of them Jews, were killed during the subsequent [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|occupation]] and [[The Holocaust in Belgium|the Holocaust]].
