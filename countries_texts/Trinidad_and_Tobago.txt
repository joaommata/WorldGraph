===Geological history===
The islands that make up modern-day Trinidad and Tobago lie at the southern end of the [[Lesser Antilles]] group. The islands lie close to the continent of South America, separated by the [[Gulf of Paria]].

===Indigenous peoples===
Trinidad and Tobago were originally settled by [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] peoples migrating from [[South America]].<ref name=EBTT/> The earliest known settlement is at [[Banwari Trace]] in [[Trinidad|southwestern Trinidad]], dating back to approximately 5000 BCE, making it the oldest [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] archaeological site in the [[Caribbean]].{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}} The site has yielded artifacts and the remains of "Banwari Man," the oldest human skeleton found in the region.<ref name="Reid 2008">{{Cite book|title=Archaeology and geoinformatics : case studies from the Caribbean|url=https://archive.org/details/archaeologygeoin00reid_533|url-access=limited|last=Reid|first=Basil A.|publisher=University of Alabama Press|year=2008|isbn=9780817380533|location=Tuscaloosa|pages=[https://archive.org/details/archaeologygeoin00reid_533/page/n49 33]–73|chapter=Developing Weights-of-Evidence Predictive Models for the Cultural Resource Management of Pre-Columbian Sites in Trinidad|oclc=567999135}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Banwari Trace: Trinidad's Oldest Archaeological Treasure {{!}} LAC Geo |url=https://lacgeo.com/banwari-trace-archaeological-site |access-date=2025-05-14 |website=lacgeo.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=BANWARI TRACE |url=https://nationaltrust.tt/home/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Banwari-Trace.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Banwari Trace Archaeological Site {{!}} For UNESCO World Heritage Travellers |url=https://www.worldheritagesite.org/tentative/id/5644 |access-date=2025-05-14 |website=www.worldheritagesite.org}}</ref>

At the time of European contact, Trinidad was inhabited by various Indigenous groups, including [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]]-speaking peoples such as the [[Arawakan languages|Nepoya]] and Suppoya, and [[Cariban languages|Cariban]]-speaking groups like the Yao.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Guanaguanare |date=2013-04-10 |title=Review of the Indigenous Caribbean: Indigenous People of Trinidad and Tobago. |url=https://indigenousreview.blogspot.com/2013/09/indigenous-people-of-trinidad-and-tobago.html |access-date=2025-05-14 |website=Review of the Indigenous Caribbean}}</ref> [[Tobago]] was primarily occupied by the [[Kalinago|Island Caribs]]

===European colonization===

Christopher Columbus was the first European to see Trinidad, on his third voyage to the Americas in 1498.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}}{{sfnp|Williams|1964|pp=7–8}} He also reported seeing Tobago on the distant horizon, naming it ''Bellaforma'', but did not land on the island.<ref name=EBTT/>{{sfnp|Carmichael|1961|p=14}}

[[File:Raleigh at Trinidad.jpg|thumb|left|English pirate [[Walter Raleigh]] raiding Spanish settlement in Trinidad in 1595]]

In the 1530s [[Antonio Sedeño|Antonio de Sedeño]], a Spanish soldier intent on conquering the island of Trinidad, landed on its southwest coast with a small army of men, intending to subdue the Indigenous population of the island. Sedeño and his men fought the native peoples on many occasions, and subsequently built a fort. The next few decades were generally spent in warfare with the native peoples, until in 1592, the "Cacique" (native chief) Wannawanare (also known as Guanaguanare) granted the area around modern [[Saint Joseph, Trinidad and Tobago|Saint Joseph]] to Domingo de Vera e Ibargüen, and withdrew to another part of the island.<ref name=Boomert/><ref>{{Cite web |last=ThePersaudCatalog |date=2022-12-31 |title=The Documented History Of Trinidad |url=https://www.thepersaudcatalog.org/post/the-documented-history-of-trinidad |access-date=2025-05-14 |website=The Persaud Catalog |language=en}}</ref> The settlement of San José de Oruña was later established by [[Antonio de Berrío]] on this land in 1592.<ref name=EBTT/>{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}} Shortly thereafter the English pirate [[Walter Raleigh]] arrived in Trinidad on 22 March 1595 [[Raleigh's El Dorado Expedition|in search]] of the long-rumoured "[[El Dorado]]" ("City of Gold") supposedly located in South America.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}} He attacked San José, captured and interrogated Antonio de Berrío, and obtained much information from him and from the Cacique Topiawari; Raleigh then went on his way, and Spanish authority was restored.{{sfnp|Williams|1964|pp=11, 18}}

Meanwhile, there were numerous attempts by European powers to settle Tobago during the 1620–40s, with the Dutch, English and Couronians (people from the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]], now part of [[Latvia]]) all attempting to colonise the island with little success.<ref name="dutch">{{cite web|work=Colonial Voyage|url=http://www.colonialvoyage.com/eng/america/tobago/dutch.html|last=Ramerini|first=Marco|title=Dutch and Courlanders on Tobago: A History of the First Settlements, 1628{{ndash}}1677|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110022814/http://www.colonialvoyage.com/eng/america/tobago/dutch.html|archive-date=10 November 2012|access-date=23 November 2012}}</ref>{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=196}} From 1654 the Dutch and Courlanders managed to gain a more secure foothold, later joined by several hundred French settlers.<ref name="dutch"/> A plantation economy developed based on the production of sugar, indigo and rum, worked by large numbers of African slaves who soon came to vastly outnumber the European colonists.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=196}}<ref name="dutch"/> Large numbers of forts were constructed as Tobago became a source of contention between France, Netherlands and Britain, with the island changing hands some 31 times prior to 1814, a situation exacerbated by widespread piracy.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=196}} The British managed to hold Tobago from 1762 to 1781, whereupon it was captured by the French, who ruled until 1793 when Britain re-captured the island.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=196}}

The 17th century on Trinidad passed largely without major incident, but sustained attempts by the Spaniards to control and rule over the Indigenous population was often fiercely resisted.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}} In 1687 the [[Catholic]] [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[Capuchin friars]] were given responsibility for [[religious conversion|the conversions]] of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] of [[Trinidad]] and the [[Guianas]].{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}} They founded several missions in Trinidad, supported and richly funded by the state, which also granted ''[[encomienda]]'' right to them over the native peoples, in which the native peoples were forced to provide labour for the Spanish.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}} One such mission was ''Santa Rosa de Arima,'' established in 1689, when Indigenous people from the former ''encomiendas'' of [[Tacarigua]] and ''Arauca'' ([[Arouca, Trinidad and Tobago|Arouca]]) were relocated further west.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Escalating tensions between the Spaniards and Indigenous people culminated in violence in 1689, when Indigenous people in the San Rafael encomienda rebelled and killed several priests, attacked a church, and killed the Spanish governor [[José de León y Echales]]. Among those killed in the governor's party was Juan Mazien de Sotomayor, missionary priest to the Nepuyo villages of Caura, Tacarigua and Arauca.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.osargenews.com/history-info/republic-of-trinidad-and-tobago/ |title=Republic of Trinidad and Tobago |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=osargenews.com |publisher= |access-date=11 March 2021 |quote="Among those killed in the governor's party was Fr.Juan Mazien de Sotomayor, O.P., missionary priest to the Nepuyo villages of Cuara, Tacarigua and Arauca." |archive-date=15 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415024736/http://www.osargenews.com/history-info/republic-of-trinidad-and-tobago/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The Spanish retaliated severely, slaughtering hundreds of native peoples in an event that became known as the [[Arena massacre]].{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}} As a result of continuing Spanish slave-raiding, and the devastating impact of introduced disease to which they had no immunity, the native population was virtually wiped out by the end of the following century.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Romero|first1=Aldemaro|title=Death and Taxes: the Case of the Depletion of Pearl Oyster Beds in Sixteenth-Century Venezuela|journal=Conservation Biology|date=2003|volume=17|issue=4|page=1016|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2003.01406.x|bibcode=2003ConBi..17.1013R |s2cid=86335309|url=https://spark.siue.edu/bio_fac/408|access-date=3 September 2019|archive-date=12 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312011430/https://spark.siue.edu/bio_fac/408/|url-status=live | issn = 0888-8892 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}}

During this period Trinidad was an island province belonging to the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], together with Central America, present-day [[Mexico]] and what would later become the southwestern [[United States]].<ref name="Besson, 2000">Besson, Gerard (27 August 2000). "Land of Beginnings – A historical digest", ''Newsday Newspaper''.</ref> In 1757 the capital was moved from San José de Oruña to Puerto de España (modern [[Port of Spain]]) following several pirate attacks.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=55}} However the Spanish never made any concerted effort to colonise the islands; Trinidad in this period was still mostly forest, populated by a few Spaniards with a handful of slaves and a few thousand Indigenous people.<ref name="Besson, 2000"/> Indeed, the population in 1777 was only 1,400, and Spanish colonisation in Trinidad remained tenuous.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

====Influx of French settlers====
{{Main|French West Indies}}

In 1777, the captain general [[Luis de Unzaga]] 'le Conciliateur', married to a French Creole, allowed free trade in Trinidad, attracting French settlers and its economy improved notably.<ref>Cazorla, Frank, Baena, Rose, Polo, David, Reder Gadow, Marion (2019). The Governor Louis de Unzaga (1717-1793) Pioneer in the birth of the United States and liberalism, Foundation, Malaga, pages: 21, 154–155, 163–165, 172, 188–191, 199.</ref>
Since Trinidad was considered underpopulated, Roume de St. Laurent, a Frenchman living in [[Grenada]], was able to obtain a [[Cedula of Population|''Cédula de Población'']] from the Spanish king [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] on 4 November 1783.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=250}} A ''Cédula de Población'' had previously been granted in 1776 by the king, but had not shown results, and therefore the new Cédula was more generous.<ref name=EBTT/> It granted free land and tax exemption for 10 years to Roman Catholic foreign settlers who were willing to swear allegiance to the King of Spain.<ref name=EBTT/> The land grant was 30 fanegas (13 hectares/32 acres) for each free man, woman and child and half of that for each slave that they brought with them. The Spanish sent a new governor, [[José María Chacón]], to implement the terms of the new ''cédula''.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=250}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cedula of Population in Trinidad - 1138 Words {{!}} Bartleby |url=https://www.bartleby.com/essay/Cedula-of-Population-in-Trinidad-FK3R5XA8JKDW |access-date=2025-05-14 |website=www.bartleby.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-03-02 |title=The Cedula of population |url=https://shadapeters.wordpress.com/chacon-and-the-cedula/ |access-date=2025-05-14 |website=José María Chacón in Trinidad |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Trinidad French Creole/title> Trinidad Creole French |url=https://www.hawaii.edu/satocenter/langnet/definitions/trinidad.html |access-date=2025-05-14 |website=www.hawaii.edu}}</ref>

The Cédula was issued only a few years before the [[French Revolution]]. During that period of upheaval, French planters with their slaves, free [[coloureds]] and [[mulattos]] from the neighbouring islands of [[Martinique]], [[Saint Lucia]], Grenada, [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Dominica]] migrated to Trinidad, where they established an agriculture-based economy (sugar and cocoa).<ref name="Besson, 2000"/> These new immigrants established local communities in [[Blanchisseuse]], Champs Fleurs, [[Paramin]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Paramin: a Forgotten World|url=http://www.discovertnt.com/articles/Trinidad/Paramin-a-Forgotten-World/169/3/23|website=Discover Trinidad & Tobago|date=22 October 2013|access-date=28 November 2014|archive-date=5 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205010830/http://www.discovertnt.com/articles/Trinidad/Paramin-a-Forgotten-World/169/3/23|url-status=live}}</ref> Cascade, [[Carenage]] and [[Laventille]].

As a result, Trinidad's population jumped to over 15,000 by the end of 1789, and by 1797 the population of [[Port of Spain]] had increased from under 3,000 to 10,422 in just five years, with a varied population of mixed race individuals, Spaniards, Africans, French republican soldiers, retired pirates and French nobility.<ref name="Besson, 2000"/> The total population of Trinidad was 17,718, of which 2,151 were of European ancestry, 4,476 were "free blacks and people of colour", 10,009 were enslaved people and 1,082 Indigenous people.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} The sparse settlement and slow rate of population-increase during Spanish rule (and even later during British rule) made Trinidad one of the less populated colonies of the West Indies, with the least developed plantation infrastructure.<ref name=Brereton/>

The British had begun to take a keen interest in Trinidad, and in 1797 a British force led by General [[Ralph Abercromby|Sir Ralph Abercromby]] launched an [[Invasion of Trinidad (1797)|invasion of Trinidad]].<ref name=EBTT/>{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=251}} His squadron sailed through the Bocas and anchored off the coast of [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]].

British rule led to an influx of settlers from the United Kingdom and the British colonies of the Eastern Caribbean. English, Scots, Irish, German and Italian families arrived, as well as some free blacks known as "[[Merikins]]" who had fought for Britain in the [[War of 1812]] and were granted land in southern Trinidad.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Trinidad Express Newspapers|url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/commentaries/The-Merikens-again-210343861.html|title=The Merikens again|first=Bridget|last=Brereton|author-link=Bridget Brereton|date=5 June 2013|access-date=20 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220044722/http://www.trinidadexpress.com/commentaries/The-Merikens-again-210343861.html|archive-date=20 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=McNish Weiss|first1=John|title=The Merikens: Free Black American settlers in Trinidad 1815-16|date=2002|publisher=McNish & Weiss|location=London|isbn=0-9526460-5-6|edition=2nd}}</ref>{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=252}} Under British rule, new states were created and the importation of slaves increased, however by this time support for [[abolitionism]] had vastly increased and in England the slave trade was under attack.<ref name=Brereton>Brereton, Bridget (1981).

====Arrival of Indian indentured labourers====
[[File:Newly arrived coolies in Trinidad.jpg|thumb|left|Newly arrived [[Indian indenture system|indentured Indian labourers]] in Trinidad and Tobago.]]

After the African slaves were emancipated many refused to continue working on the plantations, often moving out to urban areas such as Laventille and [[Belmont, Port of Spain|Belmont]] to the east of Port of Spain.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=252}} As a result, a severe agricultural labour shortage emerged. The British filled this gap by instituting a system of [[indentureship]]. Various nationalities were contracted under this system, including Indians, Chinese, and Portuguese.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=253}} Of these, the East Indians were imported in the largest numbers, starting from 1 May 1845, when 225 Indians were brought in the first ship to Trinidad on the ''[[Fatel Razack]]'', a Muslim-owned vessel.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=252}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinicenter.com/indian/indentureship.htm |title=1845: The East Indians and indentureship |publisher=Trinicenter.com |date=8 August 1999 |access-date=2 May 2010 |archive-date=17 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117011017/http://trinicenter.com/indian/indentureship.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Indentureship of the Indians lasted from 1845 to 1917, during which time more than 147,000 Indians came to Trinidad to work on sugarcane plantations.<ref name=EBTT/><ref>Deen, Shamshu (1994). ''Solving East Indian Roots in Trinidad''. Freeport Junction. H.E.M. Enterprise, {{ISBN|976-8136-25-1}}.</ref>

Indentureship contracts were sometimes exploitative, to such an extent that historians such as [[Hugh Tinker]] were to call it "a new system of slavery". Despite these descriptions, it was not truly a new form of slavery, as workers were paid, contracts were finite, and the idea of an individual being another's property had been eliminated when slavery was abolished.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indentured labor in the age of imperialism, 1834-1922|last=Northrup, David|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521480477|location=Cambridge|oclc=31290367}}</ref> In addition, employers of indentured labour had no legal right to flog or whip their workers; the main legal sanction for the enforcement of the indenture laws was prosecution in the courts, followed by fines or (more likely) jail sentences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brereton|first=Bridget|date=2010|title=The Historical Background to the Culture of Violence in Trinidad and Tobago|url=http://www2.sta.uwi.edu/crgs/february2010/journals/BridgetBrereton.pdf|journal=Caribbean Review of Gender Studies|issue=4|access-date=9 November 2019|archive-date=9 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191109163824/http://www2.sta.uwi.edu/crgs/february2010/journals/BridgetBrereton.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> People were contracted for a period of five years, with a daily wage as low as 25 cents in the early 20th century, and they were guaranteed return passage to India at the end of their contract period.

Few Indians settled on Tobago however, and the descendants of African slaves continued to form the majority of the island's population. An ongoing economic slump in the middle-to-late 19th century caused widespread poverty.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=239}} Discontent erupted into rioting on the [[Roxborough, Trinidad and Tobago|Roxborough]] plantation in 1876, in an event known as the Belmanna Uprising after a policeman who was killed.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=239}} The British eventually managed to restore control; however, as a result of the disturbances Tobago's Legislative Assembly voted to dissolve itself and the island became a Crown colony in 1877.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=239}} With the sugar industry in a state of near-collapse and the island no longer profitable, the British attached Tobago to their Trinidad colony in 1889.<ref name=EBTT/>{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=255}}{{sfnp|Williams|1964|p=149}}

====Early 20th century====
[[File:Stamps of Trinidad and Tobago.jpg|thumb|left|The Queen on 1953 stamps of Trinidad and Tobago]]
In 1903, [[1903 Water Riots|a protest]] against the introduction of new water rates in Port of Spain erupted into rioting; 18 people were shot dead, and the [[Red House (Trinidad and Tobago)|Red House]] (the government headquarters) was damaged by fire.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=255}} A local elected assembly with some limited powers was introduced in 1913.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=255}} Economically Trinidad and Tobago remained a predominantly agricultural colony; alongside sugarcane, the cacao ([[cocoa bean|cocoa]]) crop also contributed greatly to economic earnings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In November 1919, the dockworkers went on strike over bad management practices, low wages compared to a higher cost of living.{{sfn|Kiely|1996|p=66}} Strikebreakers were brought in to keep a minimum of goods moving through the ports. On 1 December 1919, the striking dockworkers rushed the harbour and chased off the strikebreakers.{{sfn|Kiely|1996|p=66}} They then proceeded to march on the government buildings in Port of Spain. Other unions and workers, many with the same grievances, joined the dock worker's strike making it a General Strike.{{sfn|Kiely|1996|p=66}} Violence broke out and was only put down with help from the sailors of British Naval ship {{ship|HMS|Calcutta|D82|6}}. The unity brought upon by the strike was the first time of cooperation between the various ethnic groups of the time.{{sfn|Kiely|1996|p=67}} Historian Brinsley Samaroo says that the 1919 strikes "seem to indicate that there was a growing class consciousness after the war and this transcended racial feelings at times."{{sfn|Kiely|1996|p=67}}

However, in the 1920s, the collapse of the sugarcane industry, concomitant with the failure of the cocoa industry, resulted in widespread depression among the rural and agricultural workers in Trinidad, and encouraged the rise of a labour movement. Conditions on the islands worsened in the 1930s with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], with an outbreak of [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934–39|labour riots]] occurring in 1937 which resulted in several deaths.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=185}} The labour movement aimed to unite the urban working class and agricultural labour class; the key figures being [[Arthur Andrew Cipriani|Arthur Cipriani]], who led the [[Trinidad Labour Party]] (TLP), [[Tubal Uriah Butler|Tubal Uriah "Buzz" Butler]] of the [[Butler Party|British Empire Citizens' and Workers' Home Rule Party]], and [[Adrian Cola Rienzi]], who led the Trinidad Citizens League (TCL), [[Oilfields Workers' Trade Union]], and [[All Trinidad Sugar Estates and Factory Workers Union]].{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=185}} As the movement developed calls for greater autonomy from British colonial rule became widespread; this effort was severely undermined by the British Home Office and by the British-educated Trinidadian elite, many of whom were descended from the plantocracy class.

The collapse of Trinidad's major agricultural commodities, followed by the Depression, and the rise of the oil economy, led to major changes in the country's social structure.

The presence of American [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement|military bases]] in Chaguaramas and [[Cumuto]] in Trinidad during [[World War II]] had a profound effect on society. The Americans vastly improved the infrastructure on Trinidad and provided many locals with well-paying jobs. The Americans left in 1961.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=96}}

Trinidad and Tobago gained its [[Trinidad and Tobago Independence Act 1962|independence]] from the [[United Kingdom]] on 31 August 1962.<ref name=EBTT/><ref name="WDL"/> However, [[Elizabeth II]] remained head of state, represented locally by [[List of heads of state of Trinidad and Tobago#Governor-General|Governor-General]] [[Solomon Hochoy]], until the passage of the 1976 Republican Constitution.<ref>[https://rgd.legalaffairs.gov.tt/Laws2/Constitution.pdf 1976 Republican Constitution] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231221142521/https://rgd.legalaffairs.gov.tt/Laws2/Constitution.pdf |date=21 December 2023 }}.

[[Eric Williams]] of the [[People's National Movement]] became the first [[List of Prime Ministers of Trinidad and Tobago|Prime Minister]], serving in that capacity uninterrupted until 1981.<ref name="EBTT" /> The dominant figure in the opposition in the early independence years was [[Leader of the Opposition (Trinidad and Tobago)|Opposition Leader]] [[Rudranath Capildeo]] of the [[Democratic Labour Party (Trinidad and Tobago)|Democratic Labour Party]]. The first [[List of speakers of the House of Representatives of Trinidad and Tobago|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] was [[Clytus Arnold Thomasos]] and the first [[President of the Senate of Trinidad and Tobago|President of the Senate]] was J. Hamilton Maurice. The 1960s saw the rise of a [[Black Power Revolution|Black Power movement]], inspired in part by the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States. Protests and strikes became common, with events coming to head in April 1970 when police shot dead a protester named Basil Davis.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=256}} Fearing a breakdown of law and order, Prime Minister Williams declared a state of emergency and ordered that many of the Black Power leaders be arrested. Some army leaders who were sympathetic to the Black Power movement, notably [[Raffique Shah]] and [[Rex Lassalle]], attempted to mutiny; however, this was quashed by the [[Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard]].{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=256}} Williams and the PNM retained power, largely due to divisions in the opposition.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=256}}

Amidst the backdrop of the rising Black Power movement in 1960s Trinidad and Tobago, and following protests, strikes, and a mutiny attempt in April 1970, a more radical opposition emerged in the form of the [[National Union of Freedom Fighters]] (NUFF).  Dissatisfied with the perceived slow progress of change, and inspired by guerrilla warfare tactics, NUFF members launched attacks on banks, police stations, and other infrastructure, aiming to ignite a full-scale revolution against Prime Minister Eric Williams' government.  However, the group faced increasing pressure from police and security forces, leading to the deaths of many members and the eventual suppression of the insurgency by 1974.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Remembering Trinidad and Tobago's Black Power Revolution |url=https://tribunemag.co.uk/2023/02/trinidad-and-tobago-black-power-revolution-1970 |access-date=2025-03-17 |website=tribunemag.co.uk |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=23.

In 1963 Tobago was struck by [[Hurricane Flora]], which killed 30 people and resulted in enormous destruction across the island.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=236}} Partly as a result of this, tourism came to replace agriculture as the island's primary source of income in the subsequent decades.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=236}} On 1 May 1968, Trinidad and Tobago joined the [[Caribbean Free Trade Association]] (CARIFTA), which provided a continued economic, rather than political, linkage between the former [[British West Indies]] [[Commonwealth Caribbean|English-speaking countries]] after the [[West Indies Federation]] failed. On 1 August 1973, the country became a founding member state of CARIFTA's successor, the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), which is a [[Political union|political]] and [[economic union]] between several [[Caribbean]] countries and territories.

Between 1972 and 1983, the country profited greatly from the rising [[price of oil]] and the discovery of vast new oil deposits in its territorial waters, resulting in an economic boom that substantially increased living standards.<ref name=EBTT/>{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=256}} In 1976 the country became a republic within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], though it retained the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] as its final appellate court.<ref name=EBTT/> The position of governor-general was replaced with that of [[President of Trinidad and Tobago|President]]; [[Ellis Clarke]] was the first to hold this largely ceremonial role.<ref>[http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=17567 Paul Donovan, "Obituary: Sir Ellis Clarke"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005112226/http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=17567 |date=5 October 2018 }}, ''Independent Catholic News'', 1 February 2011.</ref> Tobago was granted limited self-rule with the creation of the [[Tobago House of Assembly]] in 1980.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=239}}

Williams died in 1981, being replaced by [[George Chambers]] who led the country until 1986. By this time a fall in the price of oil had resulted in a recession, causing rising inflation and unemployment.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=257}} The main opposition parties united under the banner of [[National Alliance for Reconstruction]] (NAR) and won the [[1986 Trinidad and Tobago general election]], with NAR leader [[A.
