===Pre-colonial period===

The earliest known inhabitants of Saint Kitts and Nevis were pre-ceramic, pre-agricultural peoples who arrived as early as 3000 BCE. These groups, often referred to as "Archaic people," were hunter-gatherers who migrated down the archipelago from [[Florida]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=SKNVibes {{!}} History |url=https://www.sknvibes.com/islandfacts/sitepage.cfm?p=124 |access-date=2025-05-09 |website=www.sknvibes.com}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=History of Liamuiga |url=https://saintkittslocally.weebly.com/history-of-liamuiga.html |access-date=2025-05-09 |website=Saint Kitts Locally}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=St Kitts History |url=https://www.beyondships3.com/st-kitts-history.html |access-date=2025-05-09 |website=Beyondships Cruise Destinations |language=en}}</ref> Due to the absence of pottery and other durable artifacts, their cultural affiliations remain uncertain.<ref>See for example [http://www.arch.soton.ac.uk/Projects/default.asp?ProjectID=12 Nevis Heritage excavation reports, 2000–2002] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708150627/http://www.arch.soton.ac.uk/Projects/default.asp?ProjectID=12 |date=8 July 2006 }}, Department of Archaeology, University of Southampton.

By approximately 800 CE, the [[Igneri]] people, associated with the [[Arawak]] linguistic group, had settled on the islands.<ref>{{Cite web |title=St. Kitts and Nevis Archives |url=https://www.caribbeanmemoryproject.com/st-kitts-and-nevis-archives.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241008064605/https://www.caribbeanmemoryproject.com/st-kitts-and-nevis-archives.html |archive-date=8 October 2024 |access-date=2025-05-09 |website=CARIBBEAN.MEMORY.PROJECT |language=en |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> The Igneri were known for their peaceful nature and religious practices, and they continued the agricultural traditions of their predecessors.<ref name=":2" />

===European arrival and early colonial period (1493–1700)===
[[Christopher Columbus]] was the first European to sight the islands in 1493.<ref name="thecommonwealth.org">{{cite web |url=http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/st-kitts-and-nevis/history |title=Commonwealth – History of St Kitts and Nevis |access-date=10 July 2019 |archive-date=21 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321210636/http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/st-kitts-and-nevis/history |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="britannica.com"/> The first settlers were the English in 1623, led by [[Thomas Warner (explorer)|Thomas Warner]], who established a settlement at [[Old Road Town]] on the west coast of St Kitts after achieving an agreement with the Carib chief [[Ouboutou Tegremante]].<ref name=Hubbard/>{{rp|15–18}}<ref name="britannica.com"/> The French later also settled on St Kitts in 1625 under [[Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc]].<ref name="britannica.com"/> As a result, both parties agreed to partition the island into French and English sectors.

A Spanish expedition of 1629 sent to enforce Spanish claims [[Battle of St. Kitts (1629)|destroyed the English and French colonies]] and deported the settlers back to their respective countries.

As Spanish power declined, Saint Kitts became a key base for English and French expansion in the Caribbean. From St Kitts the British settled the islands of [[Antigua]], [[Montserrat]], [[Anguilla]] and [[Tortola]], and the French settled [[Martinique]], the [[Guadeloupe]] archipelago and [[Saint Barthélemy]]. During the late 17th century, France and England fought for control over St Kitts and Nevis, fighting wars in [[Battle of Nevis|1667]],<ref name=Hubbard/>{{rp|41–50}} [[Nine Years' War#Asia and the Caribbean|1689–90]]<ref name=Hubbard/>{{rp|51–55}} and [[War of the Spanish Succession|1701–13]].

===British colonial period (1700–1983)===
The colony had recovered by the turn of the 18th century, and St Kitts had become the richest British Crown Colony per capita in the Caribbean as result of its slave-based [[sugar industry]] by the close of the 1700s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondships3.com/st-kitts-history.html|title=St Kitts History|website=Beyondships Cruise Destinations|access-date=27 November 2017|archive-date=8 June 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230608151001/https://www.beyondships3.com/st-kitts-history.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The 18th century also saw Nevis, formerly the richer of the two islands, being eclipsed by St Kitts in economic importance.<ref name=Hubbard/>{{rp|75}}<ref name=Vincent/>{{rp|126,137}} [[Alexander Hamilton]], the future U.S. secretary of the Treasury, was born on Nevis in 1755 or 1757.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chernow|first=Ron|url=https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/17/mode/2up|title=Alexander Hamilton|date=2004|publisher=Penguin Press|isbn=1-59420-009-2|location=New York|pages=17|oclc=53083988}}</ref>

[[File:BrimstoneHill01.jpg|thumb|right|The fortress on Brimstone Hill, focus of the successful French invasion of 1782]]
As Britain became embroiled in [[American Revolutionary War|war with its American colonies]], the French decided to use the opportunity to [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|re-capture St Kitts]] in 1782; however St Kitts was given back and recognised as British territory in the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)]].<ref name="britannica.com"/><ref name="thecommonwealth.org"/>

The African slave trade was terminated within the British Empire in 1807, and slavery outlawed completely in 1834. A four-year "apprenticeship" period followed for each slave, in which they worked for their former owners for wages. On Nevis 8,815 slaves were freed, while St Kitts freed 19,780.<ref name=Vincent/>{{rp|174}}<ref name=Hubbard/>{{rp|110,114–117}}

Saint Kitts and Nevis, along with Anguilla, were federated in 1882. In the first few decades of the 20th century economic hardship and lack of opportunities led to the growth of a labour movement; [[the Great Depression]] prompted sugar workers to go on strike in 1935.<ref name="Paravisini104">Paravisini-Gebert, p.104</ref> The 1940s saw the founding of the [[Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party|St Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla Labour Party]] (later renamed the Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party, or SKNLP)<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMZMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA606|title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience|last1=Appiah|first1=Kwame Anthony|last2=Gates|first2=Henry Louis Jr.|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517055-9|page=606|chapter=Bradshaw, Robert Llewellyn}}</ref> under [[Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw]].

After a brief period as part of the [[West Indies Federation]] (1958–62), the islands became an [[Saint Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla|associated state]] with full internal autonomy in 1967.<ref name="britannica.com"/> Residents of Nevis and Anguilla were unhappy with St Kitts's domination of the federation, and Anguilla unilaterally declared independence in 1967.<ref name="thecommonwealth.org"/><ref name="britannica.com"/> In 1971 Britain resumed full control of Anguilla, but it was formally separated in 1980.<ref>{{cite book |last=Minahan |first=James |date=2013 |title= The Complete Guide to National Symbols and Emblems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfrWCQAAQBAJ| pages=656–657|publisher=Abc-Clio |isbn=9780313344978 }}</ref><ref name=Hubbard/>{{rp|147–149}}<ref name="britannica.com"/> Attention then focused on Nevis, with the [[Nevis Reformation Party]] seeking to safeguard the smaller island's interests in any future independent state.

Kennedy Simmonds went on to win elections in [[1984 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election|1984]], [[1989 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election|1989]] and [[1993 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election|1993]], before being unseated when the SKNLP returned to power in 1995 under [[Denzil Douglas]].<ref name="thecommonwealth.org"/><ref name="britannica.com"/>

In late-September 1998, [[Hurricane Georges]] caused approximately $458,000,000 in damages and limited GDP growth for the year and beyond.
