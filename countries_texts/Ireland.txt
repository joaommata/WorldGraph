The [[Bronze Age]] began around 2,500 BC, with technology changing people's everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the wheel, harnessing [[oxen]], [[weaving|weaving textiles]], brewing [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[metalworking]],<ref name="National Museum" /> which produced new weapons and tools, along with fine gold decoration and jewellery, such as [[brooch]]es and [[torc]]s.

=== Celts ===
How and when the island became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the [[Celts]] being one of the more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. The most recent genetic research strongly associates the spread of [[Indo-European languages]] (including [[Celtic languages|Celtic]]) through Western Europe with a people bringing a composite [[Bell Beaker culture]], with its arrival in Britain and Ireland dated to around the middle of the third millennium BC.<ref name="Reich 2018 115">{{cite book |last=Reich |first=David |title=Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past |year=2018 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-882125-0 |page=115}}</ref> According to [[John T.

The long-standing traditional view is that the Celtic language, [[Ogham]] script and culture were brought to Ireland by waves of invading or migrating Celts from mainland Europe. This theory draws on the ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'', a medieval Christian pseudo-history of Ireland, along with the presence of Celtic culture, language and artefacts found in Ireland such as Celtic bronze spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The [[Priteni]] were said to be the first, followed by the [[Belgae]] from northern [[Gaul]] and Britain. Later, [[Laigin|Laighin]] tribes from [[Armorica]] were said to have invaded Ireland and Britain more or less simultaneously. Lastly, the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]] ([[Gaels]]) were said to have reached Ireland from either northern Iberia or southern Gaul.<ref>''The Celts: A History'', by Dáithí Ó hÓgáin</ref> It was claimed that a second wave named the Euerni, belonging to the Belgae people of northern Gaul, began arriving about the 6th century BC. They were said to have given their name to the island.<ref>Early Peoples of Britain and Ireland: A-G Christopher Allen Snyder</ref><ref>"A History of Ireland: From the Earliest Times to 1922" By Edmund Curtis</ref>

The theory was advanced in part because of the lack of archaeological evidence for large-scale Celtic immigration, though it is accepted that such movements are notoriously difficult to identify. Historical linguists are skeptical that this method alone could account for the absorption of Celtic language, with some saying that an assumed processual view of Celtic linguistic formation is 'an especially hazardous exercise'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Waddell |first=John |title=Ireland in the Bronze Age |publisher=Irish Government Stationery Office |date=April 1995 |location=Dublin |url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celts.pdf |archive-date=19 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319230912/http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celts.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Waddell |first=John |title=The Question of the Celticization of Ireland |publisher=Emania |date=September 1992 |url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celticization_of_ire.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721151900/http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celticization_of_ire.pdf |archive-date=21 July 2015}}</ref> Genetic lineage investigation into the area of Celtic migration to Ireland has led to findings that showed no significant differences in [[mitochondrial DNA]] between Ireland and large areas of continental Europe, in contrast to parts of the Y-chromosome pattern. When taking both into account, a study concluded that modern Celtic speakers in Ireland could be thought of as European "Atlantic Celts" showing a shared ancestry throughout the Atlantic zone from northern Iberia to western Scandinavia rather than substantially central European.<ref>{{cite journal |pmc=1182057 |title=The Longue Durée of Genetic Ancestry: Multiple Genetic Marker Systems and Celtic Origins on the Atlantic Facade of Europe |pmid=15309688 |doi=10.1086/424697 |volume=75 |issue=4 |date=October 2004 |journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |pages=693–702 |last1=McEvoy |first1=B. |last2=Richards |first2=M. |last3=Forster |first3=P. |last4=Bradley |first4=D.G.}}</ref>
In 2012, research showed that the occurrence of genetic markers for the earliest farmers was almost eliminated by Beaker-culture immigrants: they carried what was then a new Y-chromosome R1b marker, believed to have originated in Iberia about 2,500 BC. The prevalence amongst modern Irish men of this mutation is a remarkable 84%, the highest in the world, and closely matched in other populations along the Atlantic fringes down to Spain. A similar genetic replacement happened with lineages in mitochondrial DNA.<ref name="Ireland's DNA"/><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hay |first1=Maciamo |title=Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA) |url=http://www.eupedia.com/europe/Haplogroup_R1b_Y-DNA.shtml |website=Eupedia |access-date=1 August 2015 |archive-date=22 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822060129/http://www.eupedia.com/europe/Haplogroup_R1b_Y-DNA.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> This conclusion is supported by recent research carried out by the geneticist [[David Reich (geneticist)|David Reich]], who says: "British and Irish skeletons from the Bronze Age that followed the Beaker period had at most 10 per cent ancestry from the first farmers of these islands, with other 90 per cent from people like those associated with the Bell Beaker culture in the Netherlands." He suggests that it was Beaker users who introduced an Indo-European language, represented here by Celtic (i.e. a new language and culture introduced directly by migration and genetic replacement).<ref name="Reich 2018 115"/>

The earliest written records of Ireland come from classical [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] geographers.

The earlier names, [[Exonym and endonym|in contrast]], were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made.<ref>{{cite book |first=Philip |last=Freeman |title=Ireland and the Classical World |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |date=2001}}</ref>

Ireland continued as a patchwork of rival kingdoms; however, beginning in the 7th century, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through the concept of a [[High King of Ireland]]. [[Medieval Irish literature]] portrays an almost unbroken sequence of high kings stretching back thousands of years, but some modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.<ref name="DOC">{{lang|ga|[[Dáibhí Ó Cróinín]]}}, "Ireland, 400–800", in {{lang|ga|Dáibhí Ó Cróinín}} (ed.), ''A New History of Ireland 1: Prehistoric and Early Ireland'', Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 182–234.</ref>

All of the Irish kingdoms had their own kings but were nominally subject to the high king. The high king was drawn from the ranks of the provincial kings and ruled also the royal [[kingdom of Meath]], with a ceremonial capital at the [[Hill of Tara]]. The concept did not become a political reality until the [[Viking Age#Ireland|Viking Age]] and even then was not a consistent one.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Jaski |first=Bart |date=2005 |title=Kings and kingship |editor=Seán Duffy |encyclopedia=Medieval Ireland.

In 1171, Henry arrived in Ireland in order to review the general progress of the expedition. He wanted to re-exert royal authority over the invasion which was expanding beyond his control. Henry successfully re-imposed his authority over Strongbow and the Cambro-Norman warlords and persuaded many of the Irish kings to accept him as their overlord, an arrangement confirmed in the 1175 [[Treaty of Windsor 1175|Treaty of Windsor]].

The invasion was legitimised by reference to provisions of the alleged [[Papal Bull]] ''[[Laudabiliter]]'', issued by an Englishman, [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]], in 1155. The document apparently encouraged Henry to take control in Ireland in order to oversee the financial and administrative reorganisation of the [[Celtic Church|Irish Church]] and its integration into the Roman Church system.<ref name="Curtis 2002 49">{{Cite book |last=Curtis |first=Edmund |title=A History of Ireland from Earliest Times to 1922 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |date=2002 |page=49 |isbn=978-0-415-27949-9}}</ref> Some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the [[Synod of Kells]] in 1152.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Ruth |last1=Edwards |display-authors=etal |title=An Atlas of Irish History |publisher=Routledge |date=2005 |page=106 |isbn=978-0-415-33952-0}}</ref> There has been significant controversy regarding the authenticity of ''Laudabiliter'',<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last={{lang|ga|Ó Clabaigh}} |first=Colmán N. |date=2005 |title=Papacy |editor=Seán Duffy |encyclopedia=Medieval Ireland.

In 1172, Pope [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]] further encouraged Henry to advance the integration of the Irish Church with Rome. Henry was authorised to impose a tithe of one penny per hearth as an annual contribution. This church levy, called [[Peter's Pence]], is extant in Ireland as a voluntary donation. In turn, Henry assumed the title of [[Lord of Ireland]] which Henry conferred on his younger son, [[John Lackland]], in 1185. This defined the Anglo-Norman administration in Ireland as the [[Lordship of Ireland]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} When Henry's successor, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] died unexpectedly in 1199, [[John of England|John]] inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of Ireland. Over the century that followed, Norman feudal law gradually replaced the Gaelic Brehon Law across large areas, so that by the late 13th century the [[Hiberno-Norman|Norman-Irish]] had established a feudal system throughout much of Ireland. Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and the seeds of the modern county system. A version of [[Magna Carta]] (the [[Great Charter of Ireland]]), substituting ''Dublin'' for ''London'' and the ''Irish Church'' for, the English church at the time, the ''Catholic Church'', was published in 1216 and the [[Parliament of Ireland]] was founded in 1297.

=== Gaelicisation ===
From the mid-14th century, after the [[Black Death]], Norman settlements in Ireland went into a period of decline. The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the [[Parliament of Ireland#Middle Ages|Irish parliament]] passed the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] in 1367. These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into Irish society by requiring English subjects in Ireland to speak English, follow English customs and abide by English law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/irish.pdf |title=The Great Irish Famine: Laws that Isolated and Impoverished the Irish |publisher=New Jersey Commission on Holocaust Education |date=1998 |website=Irish Famine Curriculum Committee |access-date=9 September 2011 |archive-date=19 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319234704/http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/irish.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

By the end of the 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared, and a renewed Irish culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was again dominant. English Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as [[The Pale]], and under the provisions of [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] of 1494, Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the [[English Privy Council]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pack |first=Mark |title=Charles James Fox, the Repeal of Poynings Law, and the Act of Union: 1782–1801 |journal=Journal of Liberal History |volume=33 |date=2001 |page=6 |url=http://www.markpack.org.uk/1288/charles-james-fox-the-repeal-of-poynings-law-and-the-act-of-union/ |access-date=23 March 2015 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100142/http://www.markpack.org.uk/1288/charles-james-fox-the-repeal-of-poynings-law-and-the-act-of-union/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The title of [[King of Ireland]] was re-created in 1542 by [[Henry VIII]], the then [[King of England]], of the [[Tudor dynasty]]. English rule was reinforced and expanded in Ireland during the latter part of the 16th century, leading to the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]]. A near-complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the 17th century, following the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] and the [[Flight of the Earls]].

This control was consolidated during the wars and conflicts of the 17th century, including the English and Scottish colonisation in the [[Plantations of Ireland]], the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] and the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]]. Irish losses during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (which, in Ireland, included the [[Irish Confederacy]] and the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]) are estimated to include 20,000 battlefield casualties. 200,000 civilians are estimated to have died as a result of a combination of war-related famine, displacement, guerrilla activity and pestilence throughout the war.

The religious struggles of the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in Ireland. Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the Irish King and Parliament. After the passing of [[Test Act#Test Act of 1673|the Test Act 1672]], and the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] over the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the Irish Parliament. Under the emerging [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various civil rights, even the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed in 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists.<ref>{{cite web |title=Laws in Ireland for the Suppression of Popery |publisher=University of Minnesota Law School |url=http://library.law.umn.edu/irishlaw/offices.html |access-date=23 January 2009 |archive-date=25 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125003816/http://library.law.umn.edu/irishlaw/offices.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The new Anglo-Irish ruling class became known as the [[Protestant Ascendancy]].

The "[[Irish Famine (1740–1741)#Cause|Great Frost]]" struck Ireland and the rest of Europe between December 1739 and September 1741, after a decade of relatively mild winters. The winters destroyed stored crops of potatoes and other staples, and the poor summers severely damaged harvests.<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Dickson |title=Arctic Ireland: The Extraordinary Story of the Great Frost and Forgotten Famine of 1740–41 |publisher=White Row Press |location=Belfast |date=1997 |isbn=978-1-870132-85-5}}</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2019}} This resulted in the [[Irish Famine (1740–1741)|famine of 1740]].

In the aftermath of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared in the latter part of this century and the [[Georgian architecture|architectural legacy of Georgian]] Ireland was built. In 1782, [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament.

===1798 Rebellion===
{{Main|Irish Rebellion of 1798}}

[[File:MAXWELL(1845) p130 Camp on Vinegar Hill.jpg|thumb|right|"The Camp on Vinegar Hill" - an illustration by [[George Cruikshank]] to accompany [[William Hamilton Maxwell]]'s 1845 work ''History of the Irish rebellion in 1798'']]

In 1798, members of the Protestant Dissenter tradition (mainly [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the [[Society of United Irishmen]], with the aim of creating an independent Ireland. Despite assistance from France the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces. The rebellion lasted from the 24th of May to the 12th of October that year and saw the establishment of the short lived [[Irish Republic (1798)]] in the province of [[Connacht]]. It saw numerous battles across the island with an estimated 30,000 people dead.{{citation needed|date=November 2024}}

===Union with Great Britain===
{{Main|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland}}

As a direct result of the 1798 rebellion in its aftermath in 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] to create a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].<ref name="Ward 1994 28">{{cite book |last=Ward |first=Alan J. |title=The Irish Constitutional Tradition: Responsible Government and Modern Ireland, 1782–1992 |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |date=1994 |location=Washington, DC |page=28 |isbn=978-0-8132-0784-1}}</ref>

The passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities, having failed on the first attempt in 1799. According to contemporary documents and historical analysis, this was achieved through a considerable degree of bribery, with funding provided by the British Secret Service Office, and the awarding of peerages, places and honours to secure votes.<ref name="Ward 1994 28"/> Thus, the parliament in Ireland was abolished and replaced by a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|united parliament at Westminster]] in London, though resistance remained, as evidenced by [[Robert Emmet]]'s failed [[Irish Rebellion of 1803]].

Aside from the development of the [[linen]] industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the [[Industrial Revolution]], partly because it lacked coal and iron resources<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.worldtimelines.org.uk/world/british_isles/ireland/AD1750-1900 |title=Ireland AD 1750–1900 The Industrial Age |website=WorldTimelines.org.uk |publisher=The British Museum |access-date=28 March 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101226180112/http://worldtimelines.org.uk/world/british_isles/ireland/AD1750-1900 |archive-date=26 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LamjgLbhTvwC&q=ireland+failed+to+industrialize+due+to+lack+of+coal+and+iron&pg=PA314 |first=Cormac |last=Ó Gráda |title=Ireland: A New Economic History, 1780–1939 |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1994 |pages=314–330 |isbn=978-0-19-820598-2 |access-date=26 October 2020 |archive-date=6 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210206093038/https://books.google.com/books?id=LamjgLbhTvwC&q=ireland+failed+to+industrialize+due+to+lack+of+coal+and+iron&pg=PA314 |url-status=live }}</ref> and partly because of the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England,<ref>{{cite book |title=Culture and Capitalism in Contemporary Ireland |first1=Paul |last1=Keating |first2=Derry |last2=Desmond |publisher=Avebury Press |location=Hampshire, UK |date=1993 |isbn=978-1-85628-362-5 |page=119}}</ref> which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Jacobsen |title=Chasing Progress in the Irish Republic |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1994 |page=47}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Joel |last=Mokyr |title=Why Ireland Starved: A Quantitative and Analytical History of the Irish Economy, 1800–1850 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |location=Oxon |date=1983 |page=152}}</ref>

The 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of modern [[Irish nationalism]], primarily among the Roman Catholic population. The pre-eminent Irish political figure after the Union was [[Daniel O'Connell]]. He was elected as Member of Parliament for [[Ennis (UK Parliament constituency)|Ennis]] in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat [[The Test Act|as a Roman Catholic]]. O'Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the Prime Minister, the Irish-born soldier and statesman, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. Steering the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Bill]] through Parliament, aided by future prime minister [[Robert Peel]], Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. [[George III|George's father]] had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]], to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing [[Catholic Emancipation]] to be in conflict with the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].

Daniel O'Connell led a subsequent campaign, for the repeal of the Act of Union, which failed. Later in the century, [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or "[[Irish Home Rule Bills|Home Rule]]". Unionists, especially those located in Ulster, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kee |first=Robert |title=The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |date=1972 |location=London |pages=376–400 |isbn=978-0-297-17987-0}}</ref> After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914.

Their formation was followed in 1914 by the establishment of the [[Irish Volunteers]], whose aim was to ensure that the [[Third Home Rule Act|Home Rule Bill]] was passed. The Act was passed but with the "temporary" exclusion of the six counties of Ulster, which later became Northern Ireland. Before it could be implemented, however, the Act was suspended for the duration of the [[First World War]]. The Irish Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under [[John Redmond]], took the name [[National Volunteers]] and supported [[Ireland and World War I|Irish involvement]] in the war. A minority, approximately 13,000, retained the Irish Volunteers' name and opposed Ireland's involvement in the war.<ref name="Kee 1972 478–530"/>

===Partition===
{{Main|Partition of Ireland}}

In December 1921, the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] was concluded between the British government and representatives of the [[Second Dáil]]. It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed [[Northern Ireland]] to remain within the United Kingdom, which it immediately exercised. Additionally, Members of the [[Third Dáil|Free State Parliament]] were required to swear [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the Irish Free State]] and make a statement of faithfulness to the king.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kee |first=Robert |title=The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |date=1972 |location=London |pages=719–748 |isbn=978-0-297-17987-0}}</ref> Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent [[Irish Civil War]] between the new government of the [[Irish Free State]] and those opposed to the treaty, led by [[Éamon de Valera]]. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gwynn |first=Stephen |title=Ireland Since the Treaty |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=12 |issue=2 |date=January 1934 |page=322 |doi=10.2307/20030588|jstor=20030588}}</ref>

[[File:Anglo-Irish Treaty Griffith annotated2.gif|thumb|Annotated page from the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] that established the [[Irish Free State]] and independence for 26 out of 32 [[Counties of Ireland|Irish counties]]]]
During its first decade, the newly formed Irish Free State was governed by the victors of the civil war. When de Valera achieved power, he took advantage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] and [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|political circumstances]] to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government. The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted.<ref name="autogenerated34"/> This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence. However, it was not until 1949 that the state was declared, officially, to be the [[Republic of Ireland]].

Large-scale emigration marked most of the post-WWII period (particularly during the 1950s and 1980s), but beginning in 1987 the economy improved, and the 1990s saw the beginning of substantial economic growth. This period of growth became known as the [[Celtic Tiger]].<ref name=clancy3>{{cite book|last1=Clancy |first1=Patrick |first2=Sheelagh |last2=Drudy |first3=Kathleen |last3=Lynch |first4=Liam |last4=O'Dowd |title=Irish Society: Sociological Perspectives |pages=[https://archive.org/details/irishsociety00patr/page/68 68–70] |publisher=Institute of Public Administration |date=1997 |isbn=978-1-872002-87-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/irishsociety00patr/page/68 }}</ref> The Republic's real GDP grew by an average of 9.6% per annum between 1995 and 1999,<ref>{{cite book |first=Doris |last=Schmied |title=Winning and Losing: the Changing Geography of Europe's Rural Areas |publisher=Ashgate |location=Chippenham, UK |date=2005 |page=234 |isbn=978-0-7546-4101-8}}</ref> in which year the Republic joined the [[euro]].

F. Foster (historian)|R. F. Foster]] argues the cause was a combination of a new sense of initiative and the entry of American corporations. He concludes the chief factors were low taxation, pro-business regulatory policies, and a young, tech-savvy workforce. For many multinationals, the decision to do business in Ireland was made easier still by generous incentives from the [[IDA Ireland|Industrial Development Authority]]. In addition [[European Union]] membership was helpful, giving the country lucrative access to markets that it had previously reached only through the United Kingdom, and pumping huge subsidies and investment capital into the Irish economy.<ref>R. F. Foster, ''Luck and the Irish: A Brief History of Change 1970–2000'' (2007), pp 7–36</ref>

Modernisation brought secularisation in its wake. The traditionally high levels of religiosity have sharply declined. Foster points to three factors: First, Irish feminism, largely imported from America with liberal stances on contraception, abortion and divorce, undermined the authority of bishops and priests. Second, the mishandling of the paedophile scandals humiliated the Church, whose bishops seemed less concerned with the victims and more concerned with covering up for errant priests. Third, prosperity brought hedonism and materialism that undercut the ideals of saintly poverty.<ref>Foster, ''Luck and the Irish'' pp 37–66.</ref>

The [[post-2008 Irish economic downturn]] dramatically ended this period of boom. GDP fell by 3% in 2008 and by 7.1% in 2009, the worst year since records began (although earnings by foreign-owned businesses continued to grow).<ref>{{cite news |first=Shawn |last=Pogatchnik |title=Ireland's Economy Suffered Record Slump in 2009 |work=[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]] |date=25 March 2010 |access-date=6 April 2010 |url= http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9ELOCOG1.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150208020158/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9ELOCOG1.htm |archive-date=8 February 2015}}</ref> The state has since experienced deep recession, with unemployment, which doubled during 2009, remaining above 14% in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |title=Measuring Ireland's Progress 2011 |website=CSO.ie |publisher=[[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] |date=October 2012 |page=36 |url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/otherreleases/2011/measuringirelandsprogress2011.pdf |issn=1649-6728 |access-date=30 August 2015 |archive-date=23 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223057/http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/otherreleases/2011/measuringirelandsprogress2011.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Northern Ireland====
{{Main|History of Northern Ireland|Economy of Northern Ireland}}

Northern Ireland resulted from the division of the United Kingdom by the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]], and until 1972 was a self-governing jurisdiction within the United Kingdom with its own parliament and prime minister. Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, was not neutral during the Second World War, and [[Belfast Blitz|Belfast suffered four bombing raids]] in 1941. [[Conscription]] was not extended to Northern Ireland, and roughly an equal number volunteered from Northern Ireland as volunteered from the Republic of Ireland.

Although Northern Ireland was largely spared the strife of the civil war, in the decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter-communal violence. Nationalists, mainly Roman Catholic, wanted to unite Ireland as an independent republic, whereas unionists, mainly Protestant, wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland voted largely along [[sectarian]] lines, meaning that the government of Northern Ireland (elected by [[Plurality electoral system|"first-past-the-post"]] from 1929) was controlled by the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as [[gerrymandering]] and discrimination in housing and employment.<ref name=whyte>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm |chapter=How much discrimination was there under the Unionist regime, 1921–1968? |last=Whyte |first=John |editor-first1=Tom |editor-last1=Gallagher |editor-first2=James |editor-last2=O'Connell |title=Contemporary Irish Studies |isbn=0-7190-0919-7 |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |via=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] |year=1983 |access-date=30 April 2019 |archive-date=14 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514131114/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/cmd380.htm |title=Fair Employment in Northern Ireland |isbn=0-10-103802-X |year=1988 |access-date=23 October 2008 |author=Northern Ireland Office |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |via=Conflict Archive on the Internet |author-link=Northern Ireland Office |archive-date=4 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104025822/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/cmd380.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/nicra/nicra78.htm |title='We Shall Overcome' ...

In the late 1960s, nationalist grievances were aired publicly in mass civil rights protests, which were often confronted by [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] counter-protests.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Taylor |first=Peter |date=1997 |title=Provos: The IRA and {{lang|ga|Sinn Féin}} |pages=33–56 |location=London |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-0-7475-3392-4}}</ref> The government's reaction to confrontations was seen to be one-sided and heavy-handed in favour of unionists.

In 1969, the paramilitary [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]], which favoured the creation of a [[united Ireland]], emerged from a split in the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Irish Republican Army]] and began a campaign against what it called the "British occupation of the six counties".{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

Other groups, both the unionist and nationalist participated in violence, and a period known as "[[the Troubles]]" began. More than 3,600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/467904.stm |title=Turning the pages on lost lives |publisher=BBC News |access-date=4 January 2010 |date=8 October 1999 |archive-date=17 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217024018/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/467904.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> Owing to the civil unrest during the Troubles, the British government suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]]. There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the [[Good Friday Agreement]] was concluded as a treaty between the British and Irish governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks.

The substance of the Agreement (formally referred to as the Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional [[Northern Ireland Executive|Executive]] drawn from the major parties in a new [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]] drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994, and in 2005, the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning|independent commission]] supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/decommission/iicd190106.pdf |first1=Tauno |last1=Nieminen |first2=John |last2=de Chastelain |author3=Andrew D.

The Assembly and power-sharing Executive were suspended several times but were restored again in 2007. In that year the British government officially ended its military support of the police in Northern Ireland ([[Operation Banner]]) and began withdrawing troops. On 27 June 2012, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister and former IRA commander, [[Martin McGuinness]], shook hands with Queen Elizabeth II in Belfast, symbolising reconciliation between the two sides.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-18607911 |title=Queen and Martin McGuinness shake hands |publisher=BBC News |date=27 June 2012 |access-date=22 June 2021 |archive-date=20 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210820133101/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-18607911 |url-status=live }}</ref>
