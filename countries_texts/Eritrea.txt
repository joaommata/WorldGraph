[[Madam Buya]] is the name of a fossil found at an archaeological site in Eritrea by Italian anthropologists. She has been identified as among the oldest [[hominid]] fossils found to date that reveal significant stages in the evolution of humans and to represent a possible link between the earlier ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and an archaic ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]''. Her remains have been dated to 1 million years old. She is the oldest skeletal find of her kind and provides a link between earlier hominids and the earliest [[anatomically modern humans]].<ref>{{Cite book|isbn=978-0-07-913665-7|title=McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology|edition=9th|publisher=The McGraw Hill Companies Inc.|year=2002|title-link=McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology}}</ref> It is believed that the section of the [[Danakil Depression]] in Eritrea was a major site in terms of human evolution and may contain other traces of evolution from ''Homo erectus'' hominids to anatomically modern humans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://exn.ca/hominids/pleistocenepark.cfm |title=Pleistocene Park |access-date=2 October 2006 |date=8 September 1999 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991013050335/http://exn.ca/hominids/pleistocenepark.cfm |archive-date=13 October 1999 |last=Chang |first=Gloria |website=Hunting Hominids |publisher=Discovery Channel Canada}}</ref>

[[File:Leaping Ibex, Ethiopia (2130266960).jpg|thumb|Bronze oil lamp excavated at [[Matara, Eritrea|Matara]], dating from the [[Dʿmt|Kingdom of Dʿmt]] (first century BC or earlier)]]

[[Dʿmt]] was a kingdom that existed from the tenth to fifth centuries BC in what is now Eritrea and northern Ethiopia. Given the presence of a massive temple complex at [[Yeha]], this area was most likely the kingdom's capital. [[Qohaito]], often identified as the town of Koloe in the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'',<ref>Huntingford, G.W.B. (1989) ''Historical Geography of Ethiopia from the first century AD to 1704''. London: British Academy. pp. 38 ff</ref> as well as [[Matara, Eritrea|Matara]] were important ancient Dʿmt kingdom cities in southern Eritrea.

The realm developed [[irrigation]] schemes, used [[plow]]s, grew [[millet]], and made [[iron]] tools and weapons. After the fall of Dʿmt in the fifth century BC, the plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms. This lasted until the rise of one of these polities during the first century, the [[Kingdom of Aksum]], which was able to reunite the area.<ref>Pankhurst, Richard K.P.

The [[Kingdom of Aksum]] (or Axum) was a trading empire centered in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite book|date= 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeJMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA48|title=The Oxford Companion to Archaeology|author=Phillipson, David |isbn=978-0-19-973578-5|editor=Neil Asher Silberman}}</ref> It existed from approximately 100–940 AD, growing from the proto-Aksumite [[Iron Age]] period around the fourth century BC to achieve prominence by the first century AD.

According to the medieval ''Liber Axumae'' ([[Book of Aksum]]), Aksum's first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush.<ref name="Agrvt">{{cite book|title=Africa Geoscience Review, Volume 10|date=2003|publisher=Rock View International|page=366|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWBPAQAAIAAJ}}</ref> The capital was later moved to [[Axum]] in northern Ethiopia. The kingdom used the name "Ethiopia" as early as the fourth century.<ref name="Munro-Hay57"/><ref name="Paul B. Henze 2005"/>

The Aksumites erected a number of large [[Stele|stelae]], which served a religious purpose in pre-[[Christianity|Christian]] times.

Christianity was the first [[world religion]] to be adopted in modern Eritrea. The oldest monastery, [[Debre Sina (monastery)|Debre Sina]], dates back to the fourth century, and [[Debre Libanos (Eritrea)|Debre Libanos]] was built in the late fifth or early sixth century. Originally located in the village of Ham, it was moved to an inaccessible location on the edge of a cliff below the Ham plateau. Its church contains the Golden Gospel, a metal-covered bible dating to the thirteenth century during which Debre Libanos was an important seat of religious power.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SYsgpIc3mrsC&q=debre+libanos+eritrea&pg=PA164|title=Historical Dictionary of Eritrea, 2nd Edition|first1=Dan|last1=Connell|first2=Tom|last2=Killion|date=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc|isbn=978-0-8108-7505-0|via=Google Books}}</ref>

In the seventh century AD, early [[Muslim]]s from [[Mecca]], at least [[Sahaba|companions]] of the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], sought refuge from [[Quraysh]]i [[persecution of Muslims by the Meccans|persecution]] by travelling to the kingdom, a journey known in [[Islamic history]] as the [[Migration to Abyssinia|First Hijrah]]. They reportedly built the [[Al-Fatah Mosque, Kigali|first]] African [[mosque]], that is the [[Mosque of the Companions]] in Massawa.<ref>{{cite book |last=Reid |first=Richard J. |title=A History of Modern Africa: 1800 to the Present |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] |chapter=The Islamic Frontier in Eastern Africa |page=106 |isbn=978-0-470-65898-7 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=US6RQtYwasUC |date=12 January 2012 |access-date=15 March 2015}}</ref>

The kingdom is mentioned in the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'' as an important market place for [[Ivory trade|ivory]], which was exported throughout the ancient world. At the time, Aksum was ruled by [[Zoskales]], who also governed the port of [[Adulis]].<ref name="Periplusme">[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/periplus.html ''Periplus of the Erythreaean Sea''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814160845/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/periplus.html |date=14 August 2014 }}, chs. 4, 5</ref> The Aksumite rulers facilitated trade by minting their own [[Aksumite currency]].<ref name="Raffaele2007">{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Raffaele |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/ark-covenant-200712.html?c=y&page=1 |title=Keepers of the Lost Ark?|journal=Smithsonian Magazine |date=December 2007 |access-date= 5 April 2011}}</ref>

Pre-colonial Eritrea had four distinct regions divided by geography that had limited contact with each other. The [[Abyssinian people|Abyssinian]] [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]]-speaking Christians controlled the highlands, the nomadic [[Tigre people|Tigre]] and [[Beni-Amer people|Beni Amer]] clans the western lowlands, the Arabic Muslims of [[Massawa]] and Dahlak, and the [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] [[Afar people|Afar]]s the [[Southern Red Sea Region|Dankalia]] region.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=WARNER |first=JASON |date=10 August 2015 |title=The African Garrison State: Human Rights and Political Development in Eritrea by Kjetil Tronvoll and Daniel R.

After the decline of Aksum, the Eritrean highlands fell under the domain of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Zagwe dynasty]], and later under the sphere of influence of the [[Ethiopian Empire]].<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"/> The area was first known as ''Ma'ikele Bahri'' ("between the seas/rivers", i.e. the land between the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Mareb River|Mereb river]]), and later renamed the Medri Bahri ("Sea land" in Tigrinya).<ref>Tamrat, Taddesse (1972) ''Church and State in Ethiopia (1270–1527)''.

The first Westerner to document a visit to Eritrea was Portuguese explorer [[Francisco Álvares]] in 1520. He recounted his journey through the principality ruled by the Bahr Negus, highlighting three key cities, with [[Debarwa]] as the capital. He then detailed the border demarcation at the [[Mereb River]] with the province of Tigray and recounted the difficulties in transporting certain goods across the border. His books have the first description of the local powers of [[Tigray Region|Tigray]] and the Bahr Negus (lord of the lands by the sea).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dacb.org/stories/ethiopia/alvares-f/|title=Francisco Álvares|access-date=7 September 2020|website=dacb.org}}</ref>

The contemporary coast of Eritrea guaranteed the connection to the region of Tigray, where the Portuguese had a small colony, and to the interior [[Ethiopia]]n allies of the Portuguese. Massawa was also the stage for the 1541 landing of troops by [[Cristóvão da Gama]] in the military campaign that eventually defeated the [[Adal Sultanate]] in the [[battle of Wayna Daga]] in 1543.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pereira|first=Hugo|title=Uma força Expedicionária Portuguesa na Campanha da Etiópia de 1541-1543|url=https://comum.rcaap.pt/bitstream/10400.26/6888/1/Uma%20for%C3%A7a%20Expedicion%C3%A1ria%20Portuguesa%20na%20Campanha%20da%20Eti%C3%B3pia...pdf}}</ref>

By 1557, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] had succeeded in occupying all of northeastern present-day Eritrea for the following two decades, an area that stretched from Massawa to [[Suakin|Swakin]] in Sudan.<ref name="MB01"/> The territory became an Ottoman governorate, known as the [[Habesh Eyalet]], with a capital at Massawa. When the city became of secondary economic importance, the administrative capital moved across the Red Sea to [[Jeddah]].<ref name=encaet>{{cite book|author=Siegbert Uhlig|title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X38lxaUjm1MC&pg=PA951|year=2005|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-05238-2|page=951}}</ref>
The Turks tried to occupy the highlands of Eritrea in 1559 but withdrew after they encountered resistance, pushed back by the Bahri Negash and highland forces. In 1578 they tried to expand into the highlands with the help of Bahri Negash Yisehaq, who had switched alliances due to a power struggle. Ethiopian Emperor [[Sarsa Dengel]] made a punitive expedition against the Turks in 1588 in response to their raids in the northern provinces, and apparently by 1589 they were once again compelled to withdraw to the coast. The Ottomans were eventually driven out in the last quarter of the sixteenth century. However, they retained control over the seaboard until the establishment of [[Italian Eritrea]] in the late 1800s.<ref name="MB01"/><ref name="A10-4">Jonathan Miran [https://books.google.com/books?id=PMFVeWTWF0YC&pg=PA38 Red Sea Citizens: Cosmopolitan Society and Cultural Change in Massawa].

In 1734, the [[Afar people|Afar]] leader Kedafu established the [[Mudaito Dynasty]] in Ethiopia, which later also came to include the southern Denkel lowlands of Eritrea, thus incorporating the southern Denkel lowlands into the [[Sultanate of Aussa]].<ref name="MB01">{{cite book|author=Okbazghi Yohannes|title=A Pawn in World Politics: Eritrea|url=https://archive.org/details/eritreapawninwor00yoha/page/31|year=1991|publisher=University of Florida Press|isbn=978-0-8130-1044-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/eritreapawninwor00yoha/page/31 31–32]}}</ref><ref name="Pankhurstteb">{{cite book|last=Pankhurst|first=Richard|title=The Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History from Ancient Times to the End of the 18th Century|year=1997|publisher=Red Sea Press|isbn=978-0-932415-19-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQ1CH3-RMe0C&pg=PA391}}</ref> The northern coastline of Denkel was dominated by a number of smaller Afar sultanates, such as the Sultanate of [[Rahayta]], the Sultanate of [[Beylul]] and the Sultanate of [[Bidu (woreda)|Bidu]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shehim |first1=Kassim |title=THE INFLUENCE OF ISLAM ON THE 'AFAR (ETHIOPIA) |url=https://www.proquest.com/openview/e4f5c5d014f4671f4930a0d761ecbf86/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y |access-date=18 March 2024 |archive-date=18 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240318004728/https://www.proquest.com/openview/e4f5c5d014f4671f4930a0d761ecbf86/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Aesna">{{cite book |title=In defence of the Eritrean revolution against Ethiopian social chauvinists |date=1978 |publisher=AESNA |page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idUtAQAAIAAJ|quote=Later in their history, the Denkel lowlands of Eritrea were part of the Sultanate of Aussa, which came into being towards the end of the sixteenth century.}}</ref><ref>Abir, Mordechai (1968) ''The era of the princes: the challenge of Islam and the re-unification of the Christian empire, 1769–1855''.

The boundaries of present-day Eritrea were established during the [[Scramble for Africa]]. On 15 November 1869, the ruling local chief sold lands surrounding the Bay of [[Assab]] to the Italian missionary [[Giuseppe Sapeto]] on behalf of the [[Società di Navigazione Rubattino|Rubattino Shipping Company]].<ref name=EBAb>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Eritrea |volume=9 |page=747}}</ref> The area served as a [[coaling station]] along the [[shipping lane]]s introduced by the recently completed [[Suez Canal]]. In 1882, the Italian government formally took possession of the [[Assab]] colony from its commercial owners and expanded their control to include [[Massawa]] and most of the Eritrean coastal lowlands after the Egyptians withdrew from Eritrea in February 1885.<ref name=Ully>[[Edward Ullendorff|Ullendorff, Edward]].

In the vacuum that followed the [[Battle of Gallabat|1889 death]] of [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Yohannes IV|Yohannes&nbsp;IV]], Gen. [[Oreste Baratieri]] occupied the highlands along the Eritrean coast and Italy proclaimed the establishment of [[Italian Eritrea]], a colony of the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. In the [[Treaty of Wuchale]] (It.&nbsp;''Uccialli'') signed the same year, [[Menelik II]] of [[Shewa]], a southern Ethiopian kingdom, recognized the Italian occupation of his rivals' lands of [[Bogos]], [[Hamasien]], [[Akkele Guzay]], and [[Serae]] in exchange for guarantees of financial assistance and continuing access to European arms and ammunition. His subsequent victory over rival kings and enthronement as Emperor [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik&nbsp;II]] (r.&nbsp;1889–1913) made the treaty formally binding upon the entire territory.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Abyssinia |volume=1 |page=94}}</ref><ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica"/>

In 1888, the Italian administration launched its first development projects in the new colony. The [[Eritrean Railway]] was completed to Saati in 1888,<ref>Olivieri, Emilio (1888) [http://www.ferroviaeritrea.it/la_ferrovia_massauasaati.htm La Ferrovia Massaua-Saati] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012032531/http://www.ferroviaeritrea.it/la_ferrovia_massauasaati.htm |date=12 October 2013 }} (report on the construction of the Massawa–Saati Railway).

Besides major infrastructural projects, the colonial authorities invested significantly in the agricultural sector. They also oversaw the provision of urban amenities in Asmara and Massawa, and employed many Eritreans in public service, particularly in the police and public works departments.<ref name=f1/> Thousands of Eritreans were concurrently enlisted in the army, serving during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in Libya as well as the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War|First]] and [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Second]] Italo-Abyssinian Wars.

Additionally, the Italian Eritrea administration opened many new factories that produced buttons, cooking oil, pasta, construction materials, packing meat, tobacco, hide, and other household commodities. In 1939, there were approximately 2,198 factories and most of the employees were Eritrean citizens. The establishment of industries also increased the number of Italians and Eritreans residing in the cities. The number of Italians in the territory increased from 4,600 to 75,000 in five years; and with the involvement of Eritreans in the industry, trade and fruit plantations were expanded across the nation, and some of the plantations were owned by Eritreans.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://shabait.com/2009/11/13/italian-administration-in-eritrea/ |title=Italian administration in Eritrea |date=13 November 2009 |publisher=Eritrea Ministry of Information |access-date=9 September 2020}}</ref>

In 1922, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s rise to power in Italy brought profound changes to the colonial government in Italian Eritrea. After ''[[il Duce]]'' declared the birth of the [[Italian Empire]] in May 1936, Italian Eritrea (enlarged with northern Ethiopia's regions) and [[Italian Somaliland]] were merged with the just-conquered Ethiopia into the new [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana''). This [[Fascists|Fascist]] period was characterized by imperial expansion in the name of a "new Roman Empire". Eritrea was chosen by the Italian government to be the industrial center of Italian East Africa.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090429102012/http://www.dankalia.com/history/04503.htm ITALIAN INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES]. dankalia.com</ref>

After 1935, [[art deco]] architecture was widely employed in Asmara. The Italians designed more than 400 buildings in a construction boom that only halted with Italy's involvement in [[World War II]]. These included the [[Fiat Tagliero Building]] and [[Cinema Impero]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dadfeatured.blogspot.com/2018/08/italian-asmara.html |title=ITALIAN ASMARA |date=6 August 2018 |website=Dadfeatured}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=October 2024}} In 2017, the city was declared a [[World Heritage Site]], described by [[UNESCO]] as featuring ''eclectic and rationalist built forms, well-defined open spaces, and public and private buildings, including cinemas, shops, banks, religious structures, public and private offices, industrial facilities, and residences''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1550|title=Asmara: A Modernist African City|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}</ref>)

Through the 1941 [[Battle of Keren]], the British expelled the Italians and took over the administration of the country.<ref>{{cite web |last=Law |first=Gwillim |title=Regions of Eritrea |url=http://www.statoids.com/uer.html |website=Administrative Divisions of Countries ('Statoids') |access-date=15 August 2011}}</ref> Economically, the decade of British administration saw a significant restructuring of the Eritrean economy. Until 1945, the British and Americans relied on Italian equipment and skilled labor for wartime needs and to support the Allies in the Middle East. This economic boom, fueled by substantial Italian involvement, lasted until the end of the war. However, shortly after the conflict concluded, the Eritrean economy faced a combination of recession and depression that severely impacted the local urban population. War factories that had employed thousands were shut down, and Italians began to be repatriated. Additionally, many small manufacturing plants established between 1936 and 1945 were forced to close due to intense competition from factories in Europe and the Middle East.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Negash |first1=Tekeste |title=Eritrea and Ethiopia The Federal Experience |pages=24 |url=https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:272775/FULLTEXT01.pdf}}</ref>

The British placed Eritrea under British military administration until [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] could determine its fate. In the absence of agreement amongst the Allies concerning the status of Eritrea, the British administration continued for the remainder of World War II and until 1950.  During the immediate postwar years, the British proposed that Eritrea be divided along religious community lines and annexed partly to the British colony of Sudan and partly to Ethiopia. After the peace treaty with Italy was signed in 1947, the [[United Nations]] sent a Commission of Enquiry to decide the fate of the colony.<ref name="auto5">{{cite book |last1=Negash |first1=Tekeste |title=Eritrea and Ethiopia The Federal Experience |pages=58 |url=https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:272775/FULLTEXT01.pdf}}</ref>

=== Annexation by Ethiopia ===
{{main|Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea}}
[[File:Eritrean Independence War Map.png|thumb|[[Eritrean War of Independence]] against Ethiopia 1961–1991]]
In the 1950s, the Ethiopian feudal administration under Emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] sought to annex Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. He laid claim to both territories in a letter to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the Paris Peace Conference and the First Session of the United Nations.<ref name="un">{{cite book|last=Habte Selassie |first=Bereket |title=Eritrea and the United Nations |isbn= 978-0-932415-12-7 |publisher=Red Sea Press|year=1989}}</ref> In the United Nations, the debate over the fate of the former Italian colonies continued. The British and Americans preferred to cede all of Eritrea except the Western province to the Ethiopians as a reward for their support during [[World War II]].<ref>Top Secret Memorandum of 1949-03-05, written with the UN Third Session in view, from Mr. Rusk to the Secretary of State.</ref> The Independence Bloc of Eritrean parties consistently requested from the United Nations General Assembly that a referendum be held immediately to settle the Eritrean question of sovereignty.

The United Nations Commission of Enquiry arrived in Eritrea in early 1950 and after about six weeks returned to New York to submit its report. Two reports were presented. The minority report presented by Pakistan and Guatemala proposed that Eritrea be independent after a period of trusteeship. The majority report compiled by Burma, Norway, and the Union of South Africa called for Eritrea to be incorporated into Ethiopia.<ref name="auto5"/>

Following the adoption of [[s:United Nations General Assembly Resolution 390|U.N. Resolution 390A(V)]] in December 1950, Eritrea was [[Federation|federated]] with Ethiopia under the prompting of the United States.<ref name=UNGA390>{{cite web |author=United Nations General Assembly |title=Eritrea: Report of the United Nations Commission for Eritrea; Report of the Interim Committee of the General Assembly on the Report of the United Nations Commission for Eritrea |url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/059/88/IMG/NR005988.pdf?OpenElement |access-date=15 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115022039/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/059/88/IMG/NR005988.pdf?OpenElement |archive-date=15 November 2012}}</ref> The resolution called for Eritrea and Ethiopia to be linked through a loose federal structure under the sovereignty of the emperor. Eritrea was to have its own administrative and judicial structure, its own new flag, and control over its domestic affairs, including police, local administration, and taxation.<ref name="un"/> The federal government, which for all practical purposes was the existing imperial government, was to control foreign affairs (including commerce), defense, finance, and transportation. The resolution ignored the wishes of Eritreans for independence but guaranteed the population democratic rights and a measure of autonomy.<ref name="auto5"/>

In 1958, a group of Eritreans founded the Eritrean Liberation Movement (ELM). The organization mainly consisted of Eritrean students, professionals, and intellectuals. It engaged in clandestine political activities intended to cultivate resistance to the centralizing policies of the imperial Ethiopian state.<ref>Ofcansky, TP Berry, L (2004) Ethiopia, a country study, Kessinger Publishing, p. 69</ref> On 1 September 1961, the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]] (ELF), under the leadership of [[Hamid Idris Awate]], waged an armed struggle for independence. In 1962, Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] unilaterally dissolved the Eritrean parliament and [[Annexation|annexed]] the territory. The ensuing [[Eritrean War of Independence]] went on for 30 years against successive Ethiopian governments until 1991, when the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] (EPLF), a successor of the [[Eritrean Liberation Front|ELF]], defeated the Ethiopian forces in Eritrea and helped a coalition of [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front|Ethiopian rebel forces]] take control of the Ethiopian capital [[Addis Ababa]].

In the 1980s a non-government organization called the Eritrea Inter-Agency Consortium (EIAC) aided in the development projects for the Eritrean Liberation movement.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Davey |first=Eleanor |date=1 June 2020 |title=Relief, Development and the Eritrean War of Independence: Subverting the Anti-politics Machine |journal=Histoire Politique |language=en |issue=41 |doi=10.4000/histoirepolitique.324 |s2cid=239592534 |issn=1954-3670|doi-access=free }}</ref>
