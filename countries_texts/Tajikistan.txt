The earliest recorded history of the region dates back to about 500 BC when most, if not all, of Tajikistan was part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /> Some authors have suggested that in the seventh and sixth centuries BC parts of Tajikistan, including territories in the Zeravshan valley, formed part of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Kambojas]] tribe<ref>Scholars have located the Kamboja realm on the southern side of the Hindu Kush ranges in the [[Kabul Valley|Kabul]], [[Swat Valley|Swat]], and [[Kunar Valley]]s, and the Parama-Kambojas in the territories on the north side of the Hindu Kush in [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] and [[Badakhshan]] region in Tajikistan.

After the region's conquest by [[Alexander the Great]] it became part of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], a successor state of Alexander's empire. Northern Tajikistan (the cities of [[Khujand]] and [[Panjakent]]) was part of [[Sogdia]], a collection of city-states which was overrun by [[Scytho-Siberians]] and [[Yuezhi]] nomadic tribes around 150 BC. The [[Silk Road]] passed through the region and following the expedition of Chinese explorer [[Zhang Qian]] during the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han|Wudi]] (141 BC–87 BC) commercial relations between [[Han Empire]] and Sogdiana flourished.<ref>[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006 C.

=== Samanid Empire ===
{{Main|Samanid Empire}}

The [[Samanids|Samanid Empire]], 819 to 999, restored [[Persian people|Persian]] control of the region and enlarged the cities of [[Samarkand]] and [[Bukhara]], which became the cultural centres of [[Iran]]; the region was known as Khorasan. The empire was centred in Khorasan and Transoxiana, at its greatest extent encompassing Afghanistan, parts of Iran, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, parts of Kazakhstan, and Pakistan.

Four brothers Nuh, Ahmad, Yahya, and Ilyas founded the Samanid state. Each of them ruled territory under [[Abbasid]] suzerainty. In 892, [[Ismail Samani]] (892–907) united the Samanid state under one ruler, thus putting an end to the feudal system used by the Samanids. It was under him that the Samanids became independent of Abbasid authority.

The [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] conquered [[Transoxania]] (which corresponded approximately with what later would be Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, southern Kyrgyzstan, and southwest Kazakhstan) and ruled between 999 and 1211.<ref name=encyclo>{{cite web|url=http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9062103|title=Encyclopedia – Britannica Online Encyclopedia|work=eb.com|access-date=2 June 2014|archive-date=2 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202055513/http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9062103|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Grousset, Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 }}</ref> Their arrival in Transoxania signalled a definitive shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia,<ref name="svat">{{cite book |title=A history of Inner Asia |author=Svatopluk Soucek |chapter=Chapter 5 – The Qarakhanids |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-521-65704-4 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/historyofinneras00souc }}</ref> and gradually the Kara-khanids became assimilated into the Perso-Arab Muslim culture of the region.<ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ilak-khanids ilak-khanids] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909080737/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ilak-khanids |date=9 September 2015 }}: Iranica. accessed May 2014.</ref>

In the 13th century, the [[Mongol Empire]] swept through Central Asia, invaded the [[Khwarezmian Empire]] and sacked its cities, looting and massacring people. [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turco-Mongol]] conqueror [[Timur|Tamerlane]] founded the [[Timurid Empire]], becoming the first ruler of the [[Timurid dynasty]] in and around what later became Tajikistan and Central Asia.<ref name="auto"/>

=== Bukharan rule ===
{{Main|Khanate of Bukhara}}

What later became Tajikistan fell under the rule of the [[Khanate of Bukhara]] during the 16th century and, with the empire's collapse in the 18th century, it came under the rule of the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] and [[Khanate of Kokand]]. The [[Emirate of Bukhara]] remained intact until the 20th century.

During the 19th century, the Russian Empire began to conquer parts of the region.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of Central Asia – Under Russian rule|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-Central-Asia|access-date=5 January 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|archive-date=7 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210507015604/https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-Central-Asia|url-status=live}}</ref> Russian [[Imperialism]] led to the [[Russian Empire]]'s conquest of [[Central Asia]] during the 19th century's [[Great Game|Imperial Era]]. Between 1864 and 1885, Russia gradually took control of the entire territory of [[Russian Turkestan]], the Tajikistan portion of which had been controlled by the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] and [[Khanate of Kokand]]. Russia was interested in gaining access to a supply of [[cotton]] and in the 1870s attempted to switch cultivation in the region from grain to cotton (a strategy later copied and expanded by the Soviets).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Whitman |first1=John |title=Turkestan Cotton in Imperial Russia |journal=American Slavic and East European Review |date=1956 |volume=15 |issue=2 |publisher=Association for Slavic and Eurasian Studies |location=Cambridge University |pages=190–205 |doi=10.2307/3000976 |jstor=3000976 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3000976 |access-date=5 February 2021 |archive-date=18 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210818153542/https://www.jstor.org/stable/3000976 |url-status=live  |issn=1049-7544|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

During the 19th century, the [[Jadid]]ists established themselves as an Islamic social movement throughout the region. While the Jadidists were pro-modernisation and not necessarily anti-Russian, the Russians viewed the movement as a threat because the Russian Empire was predominantly Christian.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Khalid |first1=Adeeb |title=Jadidism in Central Asia: Origins, Development, and Fate Under the Soviets |url=https://mesbar.org/jadidism-in-central-asia-origins-development-and-fate-under-the-soviets/ |website=Al Mesbar Studies and Research Centre |date=10 April 2018 |access-date=5 February 2021 |archive-date=1 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210301165850/https://mesbar.org/jadidism-in-central-asia-origins-development-and-fate-under-the-soviets/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Russian troops were required to restore order during uprisings against the Khanate of Kokand between 1910 and 1913. Further violence occurred in July 1916 when demonstrators attacked Russian soldiers in [[Khujand]] over the threat of forced [[conscription]] during [[World War I]]. While Russian troops brought Khujand back under control, clashes continued throughout the year in various locations in Tajikistan.

Tajikistan was first created in 1924 as the [[Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] (abbrievated Tajik ASSR), an autonomous republic within the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]].{{sfn|Heathershaw|Herzig|2013|p=1}} Despite their historical status as Tajik cities and mostly being populated by Tajiks, none of the regional urban centres—such as [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]], [[Tirmiz]], [[Qarshi]], and [[Khojand]]—were included in Tajikistan. Instead, the Tajikistani capital was established in [[Dushanbe]], a mountain town with approximately 1,000 residents.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=119}}

A specific Persian dialect, with vocabulary and pronunciation different from formal written Persian, was deliberately made the national language of Tajikistan by the Soviets and renamed "Tajiki" to forcibly separate it from the common variant of Persian spoken from [[Istanbul]] to [[Calcutta]]. The Tajiks were also excluded from the enormous global world of Persian literature, both past and current, by the creation of a new phonetic alphabet, first Latin-based in 1928 and later Cyrillic in 1940.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=118}} With Persian confined to Tajikistan and replaced by Russian as Central Asia's common language, the unity of the [[Persianate]] world was broken, steering Soviet and post-Soviet Central Asia onto a developmental path distinct from Iran and Afghanistan.{{sfn|Arjomand|2025|p=344}} In 1929, the Tajik ASSR was elevated to its own full [[Republics of the Soviet Union|union republic]], the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The [[Sughd Region]] was added to Tajikistan in the same year.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=120}}
