[[Prussian Crusade|German crusaders]] were sent, or more likely decided to go of their own accord as they were known to do. [[Saint Meinhard]] of Segeberg arrived in [[Ikšķile]], in 1184, traveling with merchants to [[Livonia]], on a Catholic mission to convert the population from their original pagan beliefs. [[Pope Celestine III]] had called for [[Livonian Crusade#Wars against Estonians (1208–27)|a crusade against pagans in northern Europe]] in 1193. When peaceful means of conversion failed to produce results, Meinhard plotted to convert Livonians by force of arms.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.balticsworldwide.com/the-crusaders/|title= The Crusaders|newspaper= City Paper|access-date= 28 July 2007|date= 22 March 2006|url-status= usurped|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101222014019/http://www.balticsworldwide.com/the-crusaders/|archive-date= 22 December 2010}}</ref>

After the [[Livonian War]] (1558–1583), Livonia (northern Latvia and southern Estonia) fell under the hegemony of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref name="Lonely" /> The lands were ceded to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and formed into the [[Duchy of Livonia]] (''Ducatus Livoniae Ultradunensis''). [[Gotthard Kettler]], the last master of the [[Livonian Order|Order of Livonia]], formed the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ceaser|first1=Ray A.|url=http://depts.washington.edu/baltic/papers/duchy.html|title=Duchy of Courland|publisher=University of Washington|access-date=11 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030302122941/http://depts.washington.edu/baltic/papers/duchy.html|archive-date=2 March 2003|date=June 2001}}</ref> Though the duchy was a vassal state to the Lithuanian Grand Duchy and later of Poland–Lithuania, it retained a considerable degree of autonomy and experienced a golden age in the 16th century. [[Latgalia]], the easternmost region of Latvia, became a part of the [[Inflanty Voivodeship]] of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IpR0-OrrwssC&q=Inflanty+Latgale&pg=PA14|title=Culture and Customs of the Baltic States|first=Kevin|last=O'Connor|date=3 October 2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0-313-33125-1|access-date=14 November 2020|archive-date=19 January 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230119144020/https://books.google.com/books?id=IpR0-OrrwssC&q=Inflanty+Latgale&pg=PA14|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 17th and early 18th centuries, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] struggled for supremacy in the eastern Baltic. After the [[Polish–Swedish War (1600–1611)|Polish–Swedish War]], northern Livonia (including Vidzeme) came under Swedish rule. Riga became the capital of [[Swedish Livonia]] and the largest city in the entire Swedish Empire.<ref>Kasekamp, p. 47</ref> Fighting continued sporadically between Sweden and Poland until the [[Truce of Altmark]] in 1629.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Sweden, the nation's history  |oclc=17676837 |language=en }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Rickard |first1=J |title=Truce of Altmark, 12 September 1629 |url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/truce_altmark.html |website=www.historyofwar.org |access-date=28 January 2021 |archive-date=22 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722160109/http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/truce_altmark.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In Latvia, the Swedish period is generally remembered as positive; serfdom was eased, a network of schools was established for the peasantry, and the power of the regional [[baltic Germans|barons]] was diminished.<ref>H.

Several important cultural changes occurred during this time. Under Swedish and largely German rule, western Latvia adopted [[Lutheranism]] as its main religion.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Žemaitis |first1=Augustinas |title=Lutherans |url=https://www.onlatvia.com/lutherans-143 |website=OnLatvia.com |access-date=27 August 2022 |archive-date=25 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220925101326/https://www.onlatvia.com/lutherans-143 |url-status=live }}</ref> The ancient tribes of the Couronians, Semigallians, Selonians, Livs, and northern Latgallians assimilated to form the Latvian people, speaking one Latvian language.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ereminas |first1=Gintautas |title=Latviai |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/latviai/ |website=Vle.lt |access-date=27 August 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Latvian language |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Latvian-language |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=27 August 2022 |archive-date=8 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221008003509/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Latvian-language |url-status=live }}</ref> An actual Latvian state had not been established, so the borders and definitions of who fell within that group are largely subjective.

=== Livonia and Courland in the Russian Empire ===
During the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721), up to 40 percent of Latvians died from famine and plague.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kevin O'Connor|title=The History of the Baltic States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3b5nU4bnw4C&pg=PA29|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32355-3|pages=29–|access-date=11 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427085953/https://books.google.com/books?id=b3b5nU4bnw4C&pg=PA29|archive-date=27 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Half the residents of Riga were killed by [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague in 1710–1711]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bank.lv/eng/main/am/jubmon/nmp/index.php?32661 |title=Collector Coin Dedicated to 18th Century Riga |access-date=19 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719083420/http://www.bank.lv/eng/main/am/jubmon/nmp/index.php?32661 |archive-date=19 July 2010}}. Bank of Latvia.</ref> The [[capitulation of Estonia and Livonia]] in 1710 and the [[Treaty of Nystad]], ending the Great Northern War in 1721, gave Vidzeme to Russia (it became part of the [[Governorate of Livonia|Riga Governorate]]).  The Latgale region remained part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as Inflanty Voivodeship until 1772, when it was incorporated into Russia. The [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]], a vassal state of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, was annexed by Russia in 1795 in the [[Third Partition of Poland]], bringing all of what is now Latvia into the Russian Empire. All three Baltic provinces preserved local laws, German as the local [[official language]] and their own parliament, the [[Landtag]].

The Soviets reoccupied the country in 1944–1945, and further [[Operation Priboi|deportations]] followed as the country was [[collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivised]]
and [[Sovietisation|Sovietised]].<ref name="Country profile" /> <!-- The first post-war years were marked by particularly dismal and sombre events in the fate of the Latvian nation{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} I'll take this out; let the readers evaluate the events&nbsp;– they are quite self explanatory -->

In the post-war period, Latvia was made to adopt Soviet farming methods. Rural areas were forced into [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]].<ref>Bleiere, p. 384</ref> An extensive program to impose [[bilingualism]] was initiated in Latvia, limiting the use of Latvian language in official uses in favor of using Russian as the main language. All of the minority schools (Jewish, Polish, Belarusian, Estonian, Lithuanian) were closed down leaving only two media of instructions in the schools: Latvian and Russian.<ref>Bleiere, p. 411</ref> An influx of new colonists, including laborers, administrators, military personnel and their dependents from Russia and other Soviet republics started. By 1959 about 400,000 Russian settlers arrived and the ethnic Latvian population had fallen to 62%.<ref>Bleiere, p. 418</ref>

Since Latvia had maintained a well-developed infrastructure and educated specialists, Moscow decided to base some of the Soviet Union's most advanced manufacturing in Latvia. New industry was created in Latvia, including a major [[Riga Autobus Factory|machinery factory RAF]] in [[Jelgava]], electrotechnical factories in [[Riga]], chemical factories in [[Daugavpils]], [[Valmiera]] and [[Olaine]]—and some food and oil processing plants.<ref>Bleiere, p. 379</ref> Latvia manufactured trains, ships, minibuses, mopeds, telephones, radios and hi-fi systems, electrical and diesel engines, textiles, furniture, clothing, bags and luggage, shoes, musical instruments, home appliances, watches, tools and equipment, aviation and agricultural equipment and long list of other goods. Latvia had its own film industry and musical records factory (LPs). However, there were not enough people to operate the newly built factories.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} To maintain and expand industrial production, skilled workers were migrating from all over the Soviet Union, decreasing the proportion of ethnic Latvians in the republic.<ref>Lumans, p. 400</ref> The population of Latvia reached its peak in 1990 at just under 2.7 million people.

In the second half of the 1980s, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] started to introduce political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union that were called [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]]. In the summer of 1987, the first large demonstrations were held in Riga at the [[Freedom Monument]]—a symbol of independence. In the summer of 1988, a national movement, coalescing in the [[Popular Front of Latvia]], was opposed by the [[International Front of the Working People of Latvia|Interfront]]. The Latvian SSR, along with the other [[Baltic states|Baltic Republics]] was allowed greater autonomy, and in 1988, the old pre-war [[Flag of Latvia]] flew again, replacing the Soviet Latvian flag as the official flag in 1990.<ref>{{cite web |title=Flag Log's World Flag Chart 1991 |url=https://flaglog.com/1991 |website=flaglog.com |access-date=9 December 2021 |archive-date=2 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220102050401/https://flaglog.com/1991 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>More-detailed discussion in Daina Stukuls Eglitis, ''Imagining the Nation: History, Modernity, and Revolution in Latvia'' State College PA: Pennsylvania State Press, 2010), 41-46. {{ISBN|9780271045627}}</ref> In 1989, the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] adopted a resolution on the ''[[Occupation of the Baltic states]]'', in which it declared the occupation "not in accordance with law", and not the "will of the Soviet people".

However, the central power in Moscow continued to regard Latvia as a Soviet republic in 1990 and 1991. In January 1991, Soviet political and military forces unsuccessfully tried to overthrow the Republic of Latvia authorities by occupying the central publishing house in Riga and establishing a Committee of National Salvation to usurp governmental functions. During the transitional period, Moscow maintained many central Soviet state authorities in Latvia.<ref name="Imagining" />

[[Popular Front of Latvia|The Popular Front of Latvia]] advocated that all permanent residents be eligible for Latvian citizenship, however, universal citizenship for all permanent residents was not adopted. Instead, citizenship was granted to persons who had been citizens of Latvia on the day of loss of independence in 1940 as well as their descendants. As a consequence, the majority of ethnic non-Latvians did not receive Latvian citizenship since neither they nor their parents had ever been citizens of Latvia, becoming [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|non-citizens]] or citizens of other former Soviet republics. By 2011, more than half of non-citizens had taken [[naturalization]] exams and received Latvian citizenship, but in 2015 there were still 290,660 non-citizens in Latvia, which represented 14.1% of the population.
