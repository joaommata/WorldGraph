[[File:Kingdom of Dahomy-1793.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]], 1793]]
Prior to 1600, present-day Benin comprised a variety of areas with different political systems and ethnicities. These included [[city-state]]s along the coast (primarily of the [[Aja people|Aja]] ethnic group and also including [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Gbe languages|Gbe]] peoples) and tribal regions inland (composed of [[Bariba people|Bariba]], Mahi, Gedevi, and Kabye peoples). The [[Oyo Empire]], located primarily to the east of Benin, was a military force in the region, conducting raids and exacting tribute from the coastal kingdoms and tribal regions.<ref name="Bay-1998">{{cite book |last=Bay |first=Edna |title=Wives of the Leopard: Gender, Politics, and Culture in the Kingdom of Dahomey |year=1998 |publisher=University of Virginia Press}}</ref> The situation changed in the 17th and 18th centuries as the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]], consisting mostly of [[Fon people]], was founded on the [[Abomey]] plateau and began taking over areas along the coast.<ref>{{cite book |last=Akinjogbin |first=I.A. |title=Dahomey and Its Neighbors: 1708–1818 |year=1967 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |oclc=469476592}}</ref> By 1727, King [[Agaja]] of the Kingdom of Dahomey had conquered the coastal cities of [[Allada]] and [[Ouidah|Whydah]].

The capital [[Porto-Novo]] ("New Port" in Portuguese) was originally developed as a port for the slave trade.

[[File:Bénin- 1893.jpg|thumb|A French depiction of the conquest of Dahomey in 1893]]
By the middle of the 19th century, Dahomey had "begun to weaken and lose its status as the [[regional power]]". The French took over the area in 1892. In 1899, the French included the land called [[French Dahomey]] within the larger [[French West Africa]] colonial region.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

France sought to benefit from [[Dahomey]] and the region "appeared to lack the necessary agricultural or [[mineral resources]] for large-scale [[capitalist development]]". As a result, France treated Dahomey as a sort of preserve in case future discoveries revealed resources worth developing.<ref name=":1"/>{{rp|15}}

The [[French government]] outlawed the capture and sale of slaves. Previous [[slaveowners]] sought to redefine their control over slaves as control over land, [[tenants]], and lineage members. This provoked a struggle among Dahomeans, "concentrated in the period from 1895 to 1920, for the redistribution of control over land and labor. Villages sought to redefine boundaries of lands and fishing preserves. Religious disputes scarcely veiled the factional struggles over control of land and commerce which underlay them. Factions struggled for the leadership of great families".<ref name=":1" />{{rp|15–16}}

In 1958, France granted [[autonomy]] to the [[Republic of Dahomey]], and full independence on 1 August 1960 which is celebrated each year as [[Independence Day]], a [[Public holidays in Benin|national holiday]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://apanews.net/en/news/president-sirleaf-congratulates-benin-on-57th-independence-anniversary |title=President Sirleaf congratulates Benin on 57th Independence Anniversary |date=31 July 2017 |work=Agence de Presse Africane |access-date=30 July 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730234816/http://apanews.net/en/news/president-sirleaf-congratulates-benin-on-57th-independence-anniversary |archive-date=30 July 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The president who led the country to independence was [[Hubert Maga]].<ref name="Stokes2009">{{cite book |editor-last=Stokes |editor-first=Jamie |title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East: L to Z |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gaFvrgEACAAJ |date=2009 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-0-8160-7158-6 |page=229 |access-date=12 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503171808/https://books.google.com/books?id=gaFvrgEACAAJ |archive-date=3 May 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Araujo2010">{{cite book |last=Araujo |first=Ana Lucia |title=Public Memory of Slavery: Victims and Perpetrators in the South Atlantic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kymzngEACAAJ |year=2010 |publisher=Cambria Press |isbn=978-1-60497-714-1 |page=111 |access-date=12 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617084013/https://books.google.com/books?id=kymzngEACAAJ |archive-date=17 June 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Post-colonial===
After 1960, there were coups and regime changes, with the figures of [[Hubert Maga]], [[Sourou Migan Apithy]], [[Justin Ahomadégbé]], and [[Émile Derlin Zinsou]] dominating; the first three each represented a different area and ethnicity of the country. These three agreed to form a [[Presidential Council (Benin)|Presidential Council]] after violence marred the 1970 elections.{{citation needed|date=December 2024}}

On 7 May 1972, Maga ceded power to Ahomadégbé. On 26 October 1972, Lt. Col. [[Mathieu Kérékou]] overthrew the ruling triumvirate, becoming president and stating that the country would not "burden itself by copying foreign ideology, and wants neither Capitalism, Communism, nor Socialism". On 30 November 1974, he announced that the country was officially [[Marxism|Marxist]], under control of the Military Council of the Revolution (CMR), which nationalized the petroleum industry and banks. On 30 November 1975, he renamed the country the [[People's Republic of Benin]].<ref name="Dickovick2012">{{cite book |last=Dickovick |first=J.

In 1974, the government embarked on a program to nationalize strategic sectors of the economy, reform the education system, establish agricultural cooperatives and new local government structures, and a campaign to eradicate "[[Feudalism|feudal]] forces" including [[tribalism]]. The regime banned opposition activities. Mathieu Kérékou was elected president by the National Revolutionary Assembly in 1980, re-elected in 1984. Establishing relations with China, [[North Korea]], and [[Libya]], he put "nearly all" businesses and economic activities under state control, causing foreign investment in Benin to dry up.<ref name=kneib>{{Cite book |title=Benin |last=Kneib |first=M. |pages=22–25 |isbn=978-0-7614-2328-7 |date=2007 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Benchmark |url=https://archive.org/details/benin0000knei/page/22}}</ref> Kérékou attempted to reorganize education, pushing his own aphorisms such as "Poverty is not a fatality".<ref name=kneib/> The regime financed itself by contracting to take nuclear waste, first from the Soviet Union and later from France.<ref name=kneib/>

In the 1980s, Benin experienced higher economic growth rates (15.6% in 1982, 4.6% in 1983 and 8.2% in 1984), until the closure of the Nigerian border with Benin led to a drop in customs and tax revenues. The government was no longer able to pay civil servants' salaries.<ref name="auto"/> In 1989, riots broke out when the regime did not have enough money to pay its army. The banking system collapsed.
