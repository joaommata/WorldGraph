Stone tools, weapons, elephants, and remnants of large stone structures provide evidence that Bhutan was inhabited as early as 2000 BCE, although there are no existing records from that time. Historians have theorised that the state of ''Lhomon'' ({{lit|southern darkness}}), or ''Monyul'' ("Dark Land", a reference to the [[Monpa people|Monpa]], an ethnic group in Bhutan and [[Arunachal Pradesh]], India), may have existed between 500 BCE and 600 CE. The names ''Lhomon Tsendenjong'' ([[Sandalwood]] Country) and ''Lhomon Khashi'' or Southern Mon (country of four approaches), have been found in ancient Bhutanese and Tibetan chronicles.<ref name="WIAS">{{cite web |url = http://www.worldinstituteforasianstudies.org/buthan.html |title = Bhutan |publisher = World Institute for Asian Studies |date = 21 August 2006 |access-date = 23 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090801085158/http://www.worldinstituteforasianstudies.org/buthan.html |archive-date = 1 August 2009 }}</ref><ref name="CS0">{{Country study|country=Bhutan|abbr=bt|editor=Savada, Andrea Matles|year=1991|section=Origins and Early Settlement, A.D. 600–1600|last=Worden |first= Robert L|pd=yes}}</ref>

By the 10th century, Bhutan's religious history had had a significant impact on its political development. Various subsects of Buddhism emerged that were patronised by the various [[Mongols|Mongol]] warlords.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/item/93012226/ Nepal and Bhutan : country studies] Savada, Andrea Matles and Harris, George Lawrence. p.256.</ref>

Bhutan may have been influenced by the [[Yuan dynasty]], with which it shares various cultural and religious similarities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Living Edens: Bhutan – People Culture and History |url=https://www.pbs.org/edens/bhutan/Bhu_people2.htm |access-date=2025-03-19 |website=www.pbs.org}}</ref>

After the decline of the [[Yuan dynasty]] in the 14th century, these subsects vied with each other for supremacy in the political and religious landscape, eventually leading to the ascendancy of the [[Drukpa Lineage]] by the 16th century.<ref name=CS1/><ref name=CS4>{{country study |country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |editor=Savada, Andrea Matles |year=1991 |section=Rivalry among the Sects |last=Worden |first= Robert L |pd=yes}}</ref>

To defend the country against intermittent Tibetan forays, Namgyal built a network of impregnable ''[[dzong architecture|dzongs]]'' or fortresses, and [[promulgation|promulgated]] the [[Tsa Yig]], a code of law that helped to bring local lords under centralised control.

When Ngawang Namgyal died in 1651, his death was kept secret for 54 years. After a period of consolidation, Bhutan lapsed into internal conflict. In 1711, Bhutan went to war against the [[Raja]] of the kingdom of [[Cooch Behar State|Koch Bihar]] in the south. During the chaos that followed, the Tibetans unsuccessfully attacked Bhutan in 1714.<ref name=CS3>{{Country study|country=Bhutan|abbr=bt|editor=Savada, Andrea Matles|year=1991|section=Administrative Integration and Conflict with Tibet, 1651–1728|last=Worden |first= Robert L|pd=yes}}</ref> This period was marked by an increase in Bhutan's influence in Koch Bihar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-the-brief-supremacy-of-a-mountain-kingdom-2549548|title=The brief supremacy of a mountain kingdom|first=Ananth|last=Karthikeyan|date=1 October 2017|website=DNA India|access-date=27 December 2020|archive-date=18 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418004313/https://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-the-brief-supremacy-of-a-mountain-kingdom-2549548|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 18th century, the Bhutanese invaded and occupied the kingdom of Koch Bihar. In 1772, the [[Maharaja]] of Koch Bihar appealed to the British [[East India Company]] which assisted by ousting the Bhutanese and later attacking Bhutan itself in 1774. A peace treaty was signed in which Bhutan agreed to retreat to its pre-1730 borders. However, the peace was tenuous, and border skirmishes with the [[British India|British]] were to continue for the next hundred years. The skirmishes eventually led to the [[Duar War]] (1864–65), a confrontation to control of the [[Bengal]] [[Duars]]. After Bhutan lost the war, the [[Treaty of Sinchula]] was signed between [[British India]] and Bhutan. As part of the [[war reparations]], the Duars were ceded to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in exchange for a rent of {{Indian Rupee|50,000}}. The treaty ended all hostilities between British India and Bhutan.

During the 1870s, power struggles between the rival valleys of [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]] and [[Tongsa]] led to civil war in Bhutan, eventually leading to the ascendancy of [[Ugyen Wangchuck]], the ''[[Penlop of Trongsa|penlop]]'' (governor) of [[Trongsa District|Trongsa]]. From his power base in central Bhutan, Ugyen Wangchuck defeated his political enemies and united the country following several civil wars and rebellions during 1882–85.<ref name=CS2>{{Country study|country=Bhutan|abbr=bt|editor=Savada, Andrea Matles|year=1991|section=British Intrusion, 1772–1907|last=Worden |first= Robert L|pd=yes}}</ref>

In 1907, an epochal year for the country, Ugyen Wangchuck was unanimously chosen as the hereditary king of the country by the Lhengye Tshog of leading Buddhist monks, government officials, and heads of important families, with the firm petition made by ''Gongzim'' [[Ugyen Dorji]]. [[John Claude White]], British Political Agent in Bhutan, took photographs of the ceremony.<ref>{{cite book|first1=John|last1=Hannavy|title=Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kd5cAgAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-87327-1|page=1496|access-date=18 October 2015|archive-date=15 January 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230115124721/https://books.google.com/books?id=Kd5cAgAAQBAJ|url-status=live}}</ref> The British government promptly recognised the new monarchy. In 1910, Bhutan signed the [[Treaty of Punakha]], a [[subsidiary alliance]] that gave the British control of Bhutan's foreign affairs and meant that Bhutan was treated as an Indian [[princely state]]. This had little real effect, given Bhutan's historical reticence, and also did not appear to affect Bhutan's traditional relations with Tibet. After the new [[Dominion of India|Union of India]] gained [[Independence of India|independence]] from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, Bhutan became one of the first countries to recognise India's independence. On 8 August 1949, a treaty similar to that of 1910, in which Britain had gained power over Bhutan's foreign relations, was signed with the newly independent India.<ref name=WIAS/>

In 1953, King [[Jigme Dorji Wangchuck]] established the country's legislature—a 130-member [[National Assembly (Bhutan)|National Assembly]]—to promote a more democratic form of governance. In 1965, he set up a Royal Advisory Council, and in 1968 he formed a Cabinet. In 1971, Bhutan was admitted to the [[United Nations]], having held observer status for three years. In July 1972, [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]] ascended to the throne at the age of sixteen after the death of his father, Dorji Wangchuck.

Bhutan's sixth Five-Year Plan (1987–92) included a policy of 'one nation, one people' and introduced a code of traditional Drukpa dress and etiquette called ''[[Driglam namzha|Driglam Namzhag]]''.

===Political reform and modernisation===

Bhutan's political system has recently changed from an [[absolute monarchy]] to a [[constitutional monarchy]].

A new constitution was presented in early 2005. In December 2005, Wangchuck announced that he would abdicate the throne in his son's favour in 2008. On 9 December 2006, he announced that he would abdicate immediately. This was followed by the first national [[Elections in Bhutan|parliamentary elections]] in [[Bhutanese National Council election, 2007–2008|December 2007]] and [[2008 Bhutanese general election|March 2008]].
