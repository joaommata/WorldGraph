===European arrival and slavery===
[[Christopher Columbus]] was the first European to sight the islands in 1493.<ref name=Britannica /><ref name=Commonwealth /> The Spanish did not colonise Antigua until after a combination of European and African diseases, malnutrition, and slavery eventually extirpated most of the native population; [[smallpox]] was probably the greatest killer.<ref>{{cite book| last = Austin Alchon| first = Suzanne| title = A pest in the land: new world epidemics in a global perspective| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YiHHnV08ebkC&pg=PA62| year = 2003| publisher = University of New Mexico Press| isbn = 0-8263-2871-7| pages = 62–63| access-date = 11 September 2020| archive-date = 29 November 2021| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211129165420/https://books.google.com/books?id=YiHHnV08ebkC&pg=PA62| url-status = live}}</ref>

The English settled on Antigua in 1632;<ref name=Commonwealth /><ref name=Britannica /> Christopher Codrington settled on Barbuda in 1685.<ref name=Commonwealth /><ref name=Britannica /> Tobacco and then sugar was grown, worked by a large population of slaves transported from West Africa, who soon came to vastly outnumber the European settlers.<ref name=Britannica />

===Colonial era===
The English maintained control of the islands, repulsing an attempted French attack in 1666.<ref name=Britannica /> The brutal conditions endured by the slaves led to revolts in 1701 and 1729 and a planned revolt in 1736, the last led by [[Prince Klaas]], though it was discovered before it began and the ringleaders were executed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/antiguas-disputed-slave-conspiracy-of-1736-117569/ |title=Antigua's Disputed Slave Conspiracy of 1736 |access-date=8 July 2019 |archive-date=8 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708151331/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/antiguas-disputed-slave-conspiracy-of-1736-117569/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-08-31 |title=ANTIGUAN SLAVE REVOLT 1735-1736 |url=https://legacyofrevolution.wordpress.com/antiguan-slave-revolt-1735-1736/ |access-date=2025-05-08 |website=Water, Fire & Ash |language=en}}</ref> [[Slavery]] was abolished in the British Empire in 1833, affecting the economy.<ref name=Commonwealth /><ref name=Britannica /> This was exacerbated by natural disasters such as the 1843 earthquake and the 1847 hurricane.<ref name=Britannica /> Mining occurred on the isle of [[Redonda]], however, this ceased in 1929 and the island has since remained uninhabited.<ref name="kras-2008">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TnItHSAgevMC&pg=PA18|page=18|title=Antigua and Barbuda|first=Sara Louise|last=Kras|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7614-2570-0|series=Cultures of the World|volume=26|quote=a cableway using baskets was built to transfer the mined phosphate to a pier for shipping|access-date=11 September 2020|archive-date=18 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418004906/https://books.google.com/books?id=TnItHSAgevMC&pg=PA18|url-status=live}}</ref>

Eventually, Antigua and Barbuda gained full independence on 1 November 1981; Vere Bird became prime minister of the new country.<ref name=Britannica /> The country opted to remain within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], retaining [[Elizabeth II]] ({{reign|1952|2022}}) as [[Monarchy of Antigua and Barbuda|head of state]], with the first [[List of colonial governors and administrators of Antigua#Governors of Antigua and Barbuda (1967–1981)|governor]], [[Wilfred Jacobs|Sir Wilfred Jacobs]], as [[Governor-general of Antigua and Barbuda|governor-general]].

===Independence era===
