===Early history===
The northwestern part of present-day Burkina Faso was populated by [[hunter-gatherer]]s from 14,000 BC to 5,000 BC. Their tools, including [[scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], [[chisel]]s and [[arrowhead]]s, were discovered in 1973 through [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavations]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Burkina Faso|url=https://www.smoketreemanor.com/burkina-faso/|date=23 October 2019|website=Smoke Tree Manor|language=en-US|access-date=30 May 2020}}</ref> Agricultural settlements were established between 3600 and 2600&nbsp;BC.<ref name=":0" /> The [[Bura culture]] was an [[Iron Age|Iron-Age]] [[civilization]] centred in the southwest portion of modern-day Niger and in the southeast part of contemporary Burkina Faso.<ref name="whc.unesco.org">UNESCO World Heritage Centre.

Various ethnic groups of present-day Burkina Faso, such as the [[Mossi people|Mossi]], [[Fula people|Fula]] and [[Dyula people|Dioula]], arrived in successive waves between the 8th and 15th centuries. From the 11th century, the Mossi people established [[Mossi Kingdoms|several separate kingdoms]].

===8th to 18th centuries===
There is debate about the exact dates when Burkina Faso's many ethnic groups arrived to the area. The proto-[[Mossi people|Mossi]] arrived in the far eastern part of what is today Burkina Faso sometime between the 8th and 11th centuries, and accepted [[Islam]] as their religion in the 11th century.<ref>[[#Rupley|Rupley]], p.&nbsp;27</ref> The [[Samo language (Burkina)|Samo]] arrived around the 15th century.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[#Rupley|Rupley]], p.&nbsp;28</ref> The [[Dogon people|Dogon]] lived in Burkina Faso's north and northwest regions until sometime in the 15th or 16th centuries, and many of the other ethnic groups that make up the country's population arrived in the region during this time.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shoup |first=John A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SPBfnT_E1mgC&q=the+dogon+lived+in+burkina+faso+in+15th+century&pg=PA86 |title=Ethnic Groups of Africa and the Middle East: An Encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2011|isbn=978-1-59884-362-0}}</ref>

Starting in the early 1890s during the European [[Scramble for Africa]], a series of European military officers made attempts to claim parts of what is today Burkina Faso. At times these [[Colonialism|colonialists]] and their armies fought the local peoples; at times they forged alliances with them and made treaties. The colonialist officers and their home governments also made treaties among themselves. The territory of Burkina Faso was invaded by [[French Third Republic|France]], becoming a [[French colonial empire|French protectorate]] in 1896.<ref>[[#Rupley|Rupley]], pp.&nbsp;30–33</ref>

[[File:Carte de l'Afrique-Occidentale française, 1914.svg|thumb|[[French West Africa]] c. 1913]]

The eastern and western regions, where a standoff against the forces of the powerful ruler [[Samori Ture]] complicated the situation, came under French occupation in 1897. By 1898, the majority of the territory corresponding to Burkina Faso was nominally conquered; however, French control of many parts remained uncertain.<ref name=":0"/>

The [[Anglo-French Convention of 1898|Franco-British Convention of 14 June 1898]] created the country's modern borders. In the French territory, a war of conquest against local communities and political powers continued for about five years. In 1904, the largely pacified territories of the [[Volta River|Volta basin]] were integrated into the [[Upper Senegal and Niger]] colony of [[French West Africa]] as part of the reorganization of the French West African colonial empire. The colony had its capital in [[Bamako]].

The language of colonial administration and schooling became French. The public education system started from humble origins. Advanced education was provided for many years during the colonial period in Dakar.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

The indigenous population was highly discriminated against. For example, African children were not allowed to ride bicycles or pick fruit from trees, "privileges" reserved for the children of colonists. Violating these regulations could land parents in jail.<ref>Figures de la révolution africaine, de Kenyatta à Sankara, La Découverte, 2014, pp. 271–288.</ref>

[[Conscription|Draftees]] from the territory participated in the European fronts of [[World War I]] in the battalions of the [[Tirailleurs sénégalais|Senegalese Rifles]]. Between 1915 and 1916, the districts in the western part of what is now Burkina Faso and the bordering eastern fringe of Mali became the stage of one of the most important armed oppositions to colonial government: the [[Volta-Bani War]].<ref>Mahir Saul and Patrick Royer, ''West African Challenge to Empire'', 2001</ref>

The French government finally suppressed the movement but only after suffering defeats. {{Verify source|date=May 2025}} It also had to organize its largest expeditionary force of its colonial history to send into the country to suppress the insurrection. Armed opposition wracked the Sahelian north when the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and allied groups of the Dori region ended their truce with the government.

[[File:Mittelholzer-ouagadougou.jpg|thumb|The capital, [[Ouagadougou]], in 1930]]

[[French Upper Volta]] was established on 1 March 1919. The French feared a recurrence of armed uprising and had related economic considerations. To bolster its administration, the colonial government separated the present territory of Burkina Faso from Upper Senegal and Niger.

The new colony was named ''Haute Volta'' for its location on the upper courses of the [[Volta River]] (the [[Black Volta|Black]], [[Red Volta|Red]] and [[White Volta]]), and François Charles Alexis Édouard Hesling became its first [[List of governors of Upper Volta|governor]]. Hesling initiated an ambitious road-making program to improve infrastructure and promoted the growth of cotton for export. The cotton policy – based on [[coercion]] – failed, and revenue generated by the colony stagnated. The colony was dismantled on 5 September 1932, being split between the French colonies of [[Ivory Coast]], [[French Sudan]] and [[Niger]]. Ivory Coast received the largest share, which contained most of the population as well as the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

France reversed this change during the period of intense anti-colonial agitation that followed the end of [[World War II]]. On 4 September 1947, it revived the colony of Upper Volta, with its previous boundaries, as a part of the [[French Union]]. The French designated its colonies as departments of [[metropolitan France]] on the European continent.

On 11 December 1958 the colony achieved [[Self-governance|self-government]] as the [[Republic of Upper Volta]]; it joined the Franco-African Community. A revision in the organization of French Overseas Territories had begun with the passage of the Basic Law (Loi Cadre) of 23 July 1956. This act was followed by reorganization measures approved by the French parliament early in 1957 to ensure a large degree of self-government for individual territories. Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the French community on 11 December 1958. Full independence from France was received in 1960.<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/635|title=More (Language of the Moose people) Phrase Book|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|access-date=16 February 2013}}</ref>

===Upper Volta (1958–1984)===
{{main|Republic of Upper Volta}}
[[File:Maurice Yaméogo and Louis Jacquinot exchanging instruments of ratification for the independence of the Upper Volta.jpg|thumb|[[Maurice Yaméogo]], the first president of Upper Volta, examines documents pertaining to the ratification of the country's independence in 1960.]]

The Republic of Upper Volta ({{langx|fr|link=no|République de Haute-Volta}}) was established on 11 December 1958 as a [[self-governing colony]] within the [[French Community]]. The name ''Upper Volta'' related to the nation's location along the upper reaches of the [[Volta River]]. The river's three [[Tributary|tributaries]], the [[Black Volta|Black]], [[White Volta|White]] and [[Red Volta]], were expressed in the three colors of the [[Flag of Upper Volta|former national flag]].

Before attaining autonomy, it had been French Upper Volta and part of the French Union. On 5 August 1960, it attained full independence from [[French Fourth Republic|France]]. The first president, [[Maurice Yaméogo]], was the leader of the [[Voltaic Democratic Union]] (UDV). The 1960 constitution provided for election by [[universal suffrage]] of a president and a national assembly. Soon after coming to power, Yaméogo banned all political parties other than the UDV. The government lasted until 1966. After much unrest, including mass demonstrations and strikes by students, labor unions, and civil servants, the military intervened.

==== Lamizana's rule and multiple coups ====

The [[1966 Upper Voltan coup d'état|1966 military coup]] deposed Yaméogo, suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lt. Col. [[Sangoulé Lamizana]] at the head of a government of senior army officers. The army remained in power for four years. On 14 June 1976, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a four-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. Lamizana's rule coincided with the beginning of the [[Sahel drought]] and famine which had a devastating impact on Upper Volta and neighboring countries. After conflict over the 1976 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977. Lamizana was re-elected by open elections in 1978.

Lamizana's government faced problems with the country's traditionally powerful trade unions, and on 25 November 1980, Col. [[Saye Zerbo]] overthrew President Lamizana in a [[1980 Upper Voltan coup d'état|bloodless coup]]. Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority, thus eradicating the 1977 constitution.

Colonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later by Maj. Dr. [[Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo]] and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP) in the [[1982 Upper Voltan coup d'état]]. The CSP continued to ban political parties and organizations, yet promised a transition to civilian rule and a new constitution.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqEHU3iW2i0C&pg=PA137 |title=Revolutionary Overthrow of Constitutional Orders in Africa |last=Anyangwe|first=Carlson|date=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-727-78-0|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Burkina Faso's history, also called Upper Volta, endured between 1960 and 1987, 6 military coups and the establishment of 3 republics.|url=https://www.blaisecompaore.com/en/political-and-military-career/1960-1983-engagement/|access-date=5 November 2020|website=Blaise Compaore |language=en-GB}}</ref>

====1983 coup d'état====

Infighting developed between the right and left factions of the CSP. The leader of the leftists, Capt. [[Thomas Sankara]], was appointed prime minister in January 1983, but was subsequently arrested. Efforts to free him, directed by Capt. [[Blaise Compaoré]], resulted in a military coup d'état on 4 August 1983.

The coup brought Sankara to power and his government began to implement a series of revolutionary programs which included mass-vaccinations, infrastructure improvements, the expansion of women's rights, encouragement of domestic agricultural consumption, and anti-desertification projects.<ref name="UprightDVD">''[[Thomas Sankara: the Upright Man]]'' by ''[[California Newsreel]]''</ref>

=== Burkina Faso (since 1984) ===
On 2 August 1984, on Sankara's initiative, the country's name changed from "Upper Volta" to "Burkina Faso", or ''land of the honest men''; (the literal translation is ''land of the upright men'').<ref>

The "-be" suffix in the name for the people – Burkinabe – comes from the Fula plural suffix for people, ''-ɓe''.</ref> The presidential decree was confirmed by the National Assembly on 4 August 1984.

Sankara's government comprised the National Council for the Revolution (CNR – {{langx|fr|Conseil national révolutionnaire}}), with Sankara as its president, and established popular [[Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (Burkina Faso)|Committees for the Defense of the Revolution]] (CDRs). The [[Pioneers of the Revolution]] youth programme was also established.

Sankara launched an ambitious socioeconomic programme for change, one of the largest ever undertaken on the African continent.<ref name="UprightDVD" /> His foreign policies centred on [[anti-imperialism]], with his government rejecting all [[foreign aid]], pushing for [[odious debt]] reduction, nationalising all land and mineral wealth and averting the power and influence of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[World Bank]]. His domestic policies included a nationwide literacy campaign, land redistribution to peasants, railway and road construction and the outlawing of [[female genital mutilation]], [[forced marriage]]s and [[polygamy]].<ref name="UprightDVD" /><ref name="Grila2">{{Cite web |url=https://znetwork.org/znetarticle/commemorating-thomas-sankara-by-farid-omar |title=Commemorating Thomas Sankara |first=Farid |last=Omar |work=Group for Research and Initiative for the Liberation of Africa (GRILA) |date=28 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124093433/http://www.znetwork.org/commemorating-thomas-sankara-by-farid-omar |archive-date=24 January 2012}}</ref>

Sankara pushed for agrarian self-sufficiency and promoted public health by vaccinating 2,500,000 children against [[meningitis]], [[yellow fever]], and [[measles]].<ref name="Grila2"/> His national agenda also included planting more than 10,000,000 trees to halt the growing [[desertification]] of the [[Sahel]]. Sankara called on every village to build a medical dispensary and had more than 350 communities build schools with their own labour.<ref name="UprightDVD" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://thomassankara.net/resurrecting-thomas-sankara/?lang=en |title=Resurrecting Thomas Sankara – My Blog |last=X |first=Mr |date=28 October 2015 |work=My Blog |access-date=25 April 2017}}</ref>

In the 1980s, when ecological awareness was still very low, Sankara was one of the few African leaders to consider environmental protection a priority. He engaged in three major battles: against bush fires "which will be considered as crimes and will be punished as such"; against cattle roaming "which infringes on the rights of peoples because unattended animals destroy nature"; and against the illegitimate cutting of firewood "whose profession will have to be organized and regulated". As part of a development program involving a large part of the population, ten million trees were planted in Burkina Faso in fifteen months during the revolution. To face the advancing desert and recurrent droughts, Sankara also proposed the planting of wooded strips about fifty kilometers wide, crossing the country from east to west. Cereal production, close to 1.1 billion tons before 1983, was predicted to rise to 1.6 billion tons in 1987. Jean Ziegler, former UN special rapporteur for the right to food, said that the country "had become food self-sufficient."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2020/01/03/thomas-sankara-l-ecologiste_6024742_3212.html |title=Thomas Sankara, l'écologiste |language=fr |first=Pierre |last=Lepidi |date=3 January 2020 |newspaper=[[Le Monde]] |location=Paris}}</ref>

On 15 October 1987, Sankara and twelve other government officials were assassinated in a coup d'état organized by Blaise Compaoré, Sankara's former colleague, who took over as Burkina Faso's president.

Following an alleged [[1989 Burkina Faso coup attempt|coup-attempt in 1989]], Compaoré introduced limited democratic reforms in 1990. Under the new (1991) [[Constitution of Burkina Faso|constitution]], Compaoré was [[1991 Burkinabé presidential election|re-elected]] without opposition in December 1991. In 1998 Compaoré won [[1998 Burkinabé presidential election|election]] in a landslide. In 2004, 13 people were tried for plotting a coup against President Compaoré and the coup's alleged mastermind was sentenced to life imprisonment.<ref>"Burkina Faso Profile", BBC NEWS AFRICA, 21 March 2014, 24 September 2014.</ref>

In 2000, the constitution was amended to reduce the presidential term to five years and set term limits to two, preventing successive re-election. The amendment took effect during the 2005 elections. If passed beforehand, it would have prevented Compaoré from being reelected. Other presidential candidates challenged the election results. But in October 2005, the constitutional council ruled that the amendment would not apply until the end of his second term in office. This cleared the way for his candidacy in [[2005 Burkinabé presidential election|the 2005 election]]. On 13 November 2005, he was reelected in a landslide.

In the [[2010 Burkinabé presidential election|2010 presidential election]], Compaoré was re-elected. Only 1.6 million Burkinabè voted, out of a total population 10 times that size. In February 2011, the death of a schoolboy provoked the [[2011 Burkinabè protests]], a series of popular protests, coupled with a military mutiny and a magistrates' strike, that called for Compaoré's resignation, democratic reforms, higher wages for troops and public servants and economic freedom.<ref>{{cite news |date=23 April 2011 |title=Burkina opposition calls anti-president demo |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=182823 |access-date=24 April 2011 |work=The Daily Star}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Taoko |first1=Hervé |last2=Nossiter |first2=Adam |date=27 April 2011 |title=Mayor's Home Burned as Burkina Faso Protests Continue |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/world/africa/28burkina.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430114102/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/world/africa/28burkina.html |archive-date=30 April 2011 |access-date=30 April 2011 |work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Gongo |first=Simon |date=28 April 2011 |title=Burkina Faso Riot Police Join Wave of Protests After Government Dissolved |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-28/burkina-faso-riot-police-join-wave-of-protests-after-government-dissolved.html |access-date=30 April 2011 |publisher=Bloomberg L.P.}}</ref> As a result, governors were replaced and wages for public servants were raised.<ref>{{cite news |date=25 May 2011 |title=Burkina Faso teachers' strike: Union agrees deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13542959 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527020543/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13542959 |archive-date=27 May 2011 |access-date=28 May 2011 |work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=9 June 2011 |title=Burkina Faso government replaces its governors |url=http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=1623195 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304115622/http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=1623195 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |access-date=11 June 2011 |work=Taiwan News}}</ref> In April 2011, there was an [[2011 Burkina Faso mutiny|army mutiny]]; the president named new chiefs of staff, and a curfew was imposed in [[Ouagadougou]].<ref>{{cite news |date=16 April 2011 |title=Burkina Faso capital under curfew after army mutiny |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13107109 |access-date=17 April 2011 |work=BBC News}}</ref>
