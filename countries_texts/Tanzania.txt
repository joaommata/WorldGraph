Tanzania is one of the oldest continuously inhabited areas on Earth. The [[Olduvai Gorge]], in the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], features a collection with remnants of tools that document the development and use of transitional [[technology]].

The first wave of migration was by [[South Cushitic languages|Southern Cushitic]] speakers who moved south from [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]] into Tanzania. They are ancestral to the [[Iraqw language|Iraqw]], [[Gorowa language|Gorowa]], and [[Burunge language|Burunge]].<ref name="Genetics"/>{{rp|page 17}} Based on linguistic evidence, there may also have been two movements into Tanzania of Eastern Cushitic people at about 4,000 and 2,000 years ago, originating from north of [[Lake Turkana]].<ref name="Genetics"/>{{rp|pages 17–18}}

Archaeological evidence supports the conclusion that [[Southern Nilotic languages|Southern Nilotes]], including the [[Datooga people|Datoog]], moved south from the present-day South Sudan / Ethiopia border region into central northern Tanzania between 2,900 and 2,400 years ago.<ref name="Genetics"/>{{rp|page 18}}

These movements took place at approximately the same time as the settlement of the iron-making [[Bantu languages|Mashariki (Eastern) Bantu]] from West Africa in the [[Lake Victoria]] and [[Lake Tanganyika]] areas, as part of the centuries-long [[Bantu expansion]]. The Bantu peoples brought with them the west African planting tradition and the primary staple of [[yam (vegetable)|yams]]. They subsequently migrated out of these regions across the rest of Tanzania between 2,300 and 1,700 years ago.<ref name="Genetics"/><ref name="auto"/>

[[Eastern Nilotic languages|Eastern Nilotic]] peoples, including the [[Maasai people|Maasai]], represent a more recent migration from present-day South Sudan within the past 500 to 1,500 years.<ref name="Genetics"/><ref>{{cite book |first1=Phyllis |last1=Martin |first2=Patrick |last2=O'Meara |title=Africa |url=https://archive.org/details/africa00mart |url-access=registration |date=1995 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-20984-9}}</ref>

===Medieval===
Bantu-speakers built farming and trade villages along the Tanzanian coast from the outset of the first millennium. Archaeological finds at [[Fukuchani]], on the north-west coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century CE at the latest. The considerable amount of daub found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site. There is evidence for limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century. The similarity to contemporary sites such as [[Mkokotoni]] and [[Dar es Salaam]] indicate a unified group of communities that developed into the first centre of coastal maritime culture. The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period. Trade rapidly increased in importance and quantity beginning in the mid-8th century and by the close of the 10th century Zanzibar was one of the central Swahili trading towns.<ref>Horton, Mark and Middleton, Tom. "The Swahili: The Social Landscape of a Mercantile Community." (Oxford: Blackwell, 2010), 46.</ref>

Growth in Egyptian and Persian shipping from the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf revitalised [[Indian Ocean trade]], particularly after the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] relocated to Fustat (Cairo). Swahili agriculturalists built increasingly dense settlements to tap into trade, these forming the earliest Swahili city-states. The Venda-Shona Kingdoms of [[Mapungubwe]] and Zimbabwe in South Africa and [[Zimbabwe]], respectively, became a major producer of gold around this same period. Economic, social, and religious power was increasingly vested in [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]], Tanzania's major medieval city-state. Kilwa controlled a number of smaller ports stretching down to modern-day Mozambique. [[Sofala]] became the major gold emporium and Kilwa grew rich off the trade, lying at the southern end of the Indian Ocean Monsoons. Kilwa's major rivals lay to the north, in modern-day Kenya, namely [[Mombasa]] and [[Malindi]]. Kilwa remained the major power in East Africa until the arrival of the Portuguese at the end of the 15th century.<ref>Campbell, Gwyn.

In 1954, [[Julius Nyerere]] transformed an organisation into the politically-oriented [[Tanganyika African National Union]] (TANU). TANU's main objective was to achieve national [[sovereignty]] for Tanganyika. A campaign to register new members was launched, and within a year, TANU had become the leading political organisation in the country. Nyerere became Minister of British-administered Tanganyika in 1960 and continued as prime minister when Tanganyika became independent in 1961.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mulenga|first=Derek C.|date=November 2001|title=Mwalimu Julius Nyerere: a critical review of his contributions to adult education and postcolonialism|journal=International Journal of Lifelong Education|volume=20|issue=6|pages=446–470|doi=10.1080/02601370110088436|s2cid=143740319|issn=0260-1370}}</ref>

Following Tanganyika's independence and unification with Zanzibar leading to the state of Tanzania, President Nyerere emphasised a need to construct a national identity for the citizens of the new country. To achieve this, Nyerere provided what is regarded as one of the most successful cases of ethnic repression and identity transformation in Africa.<ref>[[Pierre Englebert]] and Kevin C. Dunn, "Inside African Politics" 2013: 81</ref> With more than 130 languages spoken within its territory, Tanzania is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in Africa. Despite this obstacle, ethnic divisions remained rare in Tanzania when compared to the rest of the continent, notably its immediate neighbour, [[Kenya]]. Furthermore, since its independence, Tanzania has displayed more political stability than most African countries, particularly due to Nyerere's ethnic repression methods.<ref>Henry Bienen and John Waterbury, "World Development Vol 17", 1989: 100</ref>

[[File:Arusha Declaration Monument.jpg|thumb|The [[Arusha Declaration Monument]]]]
In 1967, Nyerere's first presidency took a turn to the [[left politics|left]] after the [[Arusha Declaration]], which codified a commitment to socialism as well as [[Pan-Africanism]]. After the declaration, banks and many large industries were nationalised.

Tanzania was also aligned with China, which from 1970 to 1975 financed and helped build the {{convert|1860|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} [[TAZARA Railway]] from [[Dar es Salaam]], Tanzania, to [[Kapiri Mposhi]], Zambia.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jamie |last=Monson |title=Africa's Freedom Railway: How a Chinese Development Project Changed Lives and Livelihoods in Tanzania |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeeDwcT51BcC&pg=PA23 |year=2009 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-35271-2 |page=199}}</ref> Nonetheless, from the late 1970s, Tanzania's economy took a turn for the worse, in the context of an international economic crisis affecting both developed and developing economies.

In 1978, the neighbouring [[Uganda]], under the leadership of Idi Amin, [[Uganda–Tanzania War|invaded Tanzania]]. This disastrous invasion would culminate in Tanzania invading [[Uganda]] with the aid of Ugandan rebels and deposing Idi Amin as a result. However, the war severely damaged Tanzania's economy.<ref>{{cite thesis |last= Francis|first= Joyce L.|date= 1994|title= War as a social trap: The case of Tanzania|publisher=American University |type= PhD thesis|oclc= 33488070|url= https://auislandora.wrlc.org/islandora/object/thesesdissertations:2786}}</ref><ref name= atuhaire>{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200704110882.html|title=Uganda: Country Pays Tanzania Shs120 Billion Amin War Debt|last=Atuhaire|first=Alex B.|date=11 April 2007|website=allAfrica.com|access-date=8 December 2013}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

Through the 1980s, conservation-oriented national parks such as [[Serengeti National Park|Serengeti]] and [[Kilimanjaro National Park|Kilimanjaro]], with [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] as the tallest freestanding summit on Earth, were included on the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]].

From the mid-1980s, the regime financed itself by borrowing from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and underwent some reforms. Since then, Tanzania's gross domestic product per capita has grown and poverty has been reduced, according to a report by the World Bank.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tanzaniagateway.org/docs/Tanzania_Country_Study_Full_Case.pdf |title=Tanzania's Economic Reforms&nbsp;– and Lessons Learned |first=Anna |last=Muganda |year=2004 |access-date=19 February 2014 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215310/http://www.tanzaniagateway.org/docs/Tanzania_Country_Study_Full_Case.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>
