===Prehistory===
The history of Vanuatu before European colonisation is mostly obscure because of the lack of written sources, which predate European contact, and because only limited archaeological work has been conducted; Vanuatu's volatile geology and climate are also likely to have destroyed or hidden many prehistoric sites.<ref name="Archaeology">{{cite journal |last1=Spriggs |last2=Bedford |first1=Matthew |first2=Stuart |editor-first1=Ethan E. |editor-first2=Terry L. |editor-last1=Cochrane |editor-last2=Hunt |title=The Archaeology of Vanuatu: 3,000 Years of History across Islands of Ash and Coral |url=https://www.academia.edu/24751281 |website=Oxford Handbooks Online |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |doi=10.1093/OXFORDHB/9780199925070.013.015 |access-date=22 August 2020 |archive-date=6 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211206010724/https://www.academia.edu/24751281 |url-status=live }}</ref> Archaeological evidence gathered since the 1980s supports the theory that the Vanuatuan islands were first settled about 3,000 years ago, in the period roughly between 1100 [[Common Era|BCE]] and 700 BCE.<ref name="Archaeology"/>{{sfn|Bedford|Spriggs|2008}} These were almost certainly people of the [[Lapita culture]]. The formerly widespread idea that Vanuatu might have been only marginally affected by this culture was rendered obsolete by the evidence uncovered in recent decades at numerous sites on most of the islands in the archipelago, ranging from the [[Banks Islands]] in the north to [[Aneityum]] in the south.<ref name="Archaeology"/>

Notable Lapita sites include [[Teouma]] on [[Éfaté]], [[Uripiv]], and [[Vao Island|Vao]] off the coast of [[Malakula]], and Makue on [[Aore]]. Several ancient burial sites have been excavated, most notably Teouma on Éfaté, which has a large ancient cemetery containing the remains of 94 individuals.<ref name="Archaeology" /> There are also sites – on Éfaté and on the adjacent islands of [[Lelepa Island|Lelepa]] and [[Eretoka]] – associated with the 16th–17th century chief or chiefs called [[Roy Mata]].

Over time, the Lapita culture lost much of its early unity; as such, it became increasingly fragmented, the precise reasons for which are unclear. Over the centuries, pottery, settlement and burial practices in Vanuatu all evolved in a more localised direction, with long-distance trade and migration patterns contracting.<ref name="Archaeology"/> Nevertheless, some limited long-distance trade did continue, with similar cultural practices and late-period items also being found in [[Fiji]], [[New Caledonia]], the Bismarcks and the Solomons.<ref name="Archaeology"/> Finds in central and southern Vanuatu, such as distinctive adzes, also indicate some trade connections with, and possibly population movements of, Polynesian peoples to the east.<ref name="Archaeology"/><ref name="Beginning"/>

Over time, it is thought that the Lapita either mixed with, or acted as pioneers for, migrants coming from the Bismarks and elsewhere in Melanesia, ultimately producing the darker-skinned physiognomy that is typical of modern Ni-Vanuatu.<ref>{{cite web|title=Study of ancient skulls from Vanuatu cemetery sheds light on Polynesian migration, scientists say|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-29/vanuatu-skulls-shed-light-on-origin-of-polynesian-people/7058120|website=ABC Radio Canberra|date=29 December 2015|access-date=23 August 2020|archive-date=6 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211206085916/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-29/vanuatu-skulls-shed-light-on-origin-of-polynesian-people/7058120|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Scientists Reveal the Genetic Timeline of Ancient Vanuatu People|url=https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-reveal-the-genetic-timeline-of-ancient-vanuatu-people/|website=SciTech Daily|date=9 March 2018|access-date=23 August 2020|archive-date=6 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211206042630/https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-reveal-the-genetic-timeline-of-ancient-vanuatu-people/|url-status=live}}</ref> Linguistically, the Lapita peoples' Austronesian languages were maintained, with all of the numerous 100+ autochthonous [[languages of Vanuatu]] being classified as belonging to the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] branch of the [[Austronesian language family]].<ref name=eth>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130421035933/http://www.ethnologue.com/country/VU/languages "Languages of Vanuatu"] – 2013 archive from [[Ethnologue]].</ref>

This linguistic hyperdiversity resulted from a number of factors: continuing waves of migration, the existence of numerous decentralised and generally self-sufficient communities, hostilities between people groups, with none able to dominate any of the others, and the difficult geography of Vanuatu that impeded inter- and intra-island travel and communication.<ref>{{cite web|title=The exceptional linguistic diversity of Vanuatu|url=http://www.sorosoro.org/en/2015/09/the-exceptional-linguistic-diversity-of-vanuatu/|website=Sorosoro|date=9 June 2011|access-date=23 August 2020|archive-date=6 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211206042745/https://www.sorosoro.org/en/2015/09/the-exceptional-linguistic-diversity-of-vanuatu/|url-status=live}}</ref> The geological record also shows that a huge volcanic eruption occurred on [[Ambrym]] in {{Citation needed span|{{Circa|200}}|date=July 2025}} CE, which would have devastated local populations and likely resulted in further population movements.<ref name="Archaeology"/><ref name="Beginning">{{cite web |last1=Flexner |first1=James |last2=Spriggs |first2=Matthew |last3=Bedford |first3=Stuart |title=Beginning Historical Archaeology in Vanuatu: Recent Projects on the Archaeology of Spanish, French, and Anglophone Colonialism |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301294502 |website=Research Gate |publisher=Springer |access-date=22 August 2020}}</ref><ref name=kuwae2006 >{{Cite journal |first1=Chaochao |last1=Gao |first2=Alan |last2=Robock |first3=Stephen |last3=Self |first4=Jeffrey B. |last4=Witter |author5=J.

===Arrival of Europeans (1606–1906)===
[[File:Pedro Fernández de Quirós.JPG|thumb|upright|Portuguese explorer [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]] was the first European to arrive in Vanuatu, in 1606. He named [[Espiritu Santo]], the largest island in Vanuatu.]]

The Vanuatu islands first had contact with Europeans in April 1606, when the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] explorer [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], sailing for the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]], departed [[Callao|El Callao]],<ref>{{cite web |first1=Elizabeth |last1=Rogers Kotlowski |title=Southland of the Holy Spirit |url=http://www.chr.org.au/books/southloand-of-holy-spirit/page5.html |publisher=CHR |access-date=10 August 2021 |quote=In 1605 [...] Quiros sailed west from Callao, Peru |archive-date=24 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211224084941/http://www.chr.org.au/books/southloand-of-holy-spirit/page5.html }}</ref> sailed by the [[Banks Islands]], landing briefly on [[Gaua]] (which he called Santa María).<ref name="Beginning"/><ref name="Jolly">{{cite CiteSeerX |last1=Jolly |first1=Margaret |title=The Sediment of Voyages: Re-membering Quirós, Bougainville and Cook in Vanuatu |citeseerx=10.1.1.533.9909 }}</ref> Continuing further south, Queirós arrived at the largest island, naming it {{lang|es|La Austrialia del [[Espíritu Santo]]}} or "The Southern Land of the Holy Spirit", believing he had arrived in [[Terra Australis]] (Australia).<ref name="Archaeology"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Vanuatu and New Caledonia |url=https://archive.org/details/vanuatunewcaledo00joce |url-access=registration |year=2009 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=978-1-74104-792-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/vanuatunewcaledo00joce/page/29 29] |access-date=15 December 2017 }}</ref> The Spanish established a settlement named ''Nueva Jerusalem'' at Big Bay on the north side of the island, but it was a short-lived endeavor.<ref name="Beginning"/><ref name="Jolly"/>

Regardless of Queirós's intention, relations with the Ni-Vanuatu turned violent within days.

Europeans did not return until 1768, when the French explorer [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] sailed by the islands on 22 May, naming them the Great [[Cyclades]].<ref name="Anne">{{cite book |last1=Salmond |first1=Anne |title=Aphrodite's Island |date=2010 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=978-0-520-26114-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/aphroditesisland00salm/page/113 113] |url=https://archive.org/details/aphroditesisland00salm/page/113 }}</ref><ref name="Archaeology"/> Of the various French toponyms Bougainville devised, only [[Pentecost Island]] has stuck.<ref name="Jolly"/>

The French landed on [[Ambae]], trading with the native people in a peaceful manner, though Bougainville stated that they were later attacked, necessitating him to fire warning shots with his muskets, before his crew left and continued their voyage.<ref name="Jolly"/> In July–September 1774 the islands were explored extensively by British explorer [[Captain James Cook]], who named them the New Hebrides, after the [[Hebrides]] off the west coast of [[Scotland]], a name that lasted until independence in 1980.<ref name="State" /><ref name="Archaeology"/><ref name="Jolly"/> Cook managed to maintain generally cordial relations with the Ni-Vanuatu by giving them presents and refraining from violence.<ref name="Beginning"/><ref name="Jolly"/>

In 1789, [[William Bligh]] and the remainder of his crew sailed through the Banks Islands on their return voyage to [[Timor]] following the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|mutiny on the ''Bounty'']]; Bligh later returned to the islands, naming them after his benefactor [[Joseph Banks]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wahlroos |first1=Sven |title=Mutiny and Romance in the South Seas: A Companion to the Bounty Adventure |url=https://library.puc.edu/pitcairn/bounty/encyclopedia.shtml |publisher=Pitcairn Islands Study Centre |access-date=23 August 2020 |archive-date=1 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211001151537/https://library.puc.edu/pitcairn/bounty/encyclopedia.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref>

Whaleships were among the first regular visitors to this group of islands.

During the 1860s, [[plantations|planters]] in Australia, Fiji, New Caledonia, and the Samoan islands, in need of labourers, encouraged a long-term [[indentured labour]] trade called "[[blackbirding]]".<ref name="JM"/> At the height of the labour trade, more than one-half the adult male population of several of the islands worked abroad. Because of this, and the poor conditions and abuse often faced by workers, as well the introduction of common diseases to which native Ni-Vanuatu had no immunity, the population of Vanuatu declined severely, with the current population being greatly reduced compared to pre-contact times.<ref name=cp>{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2815.htm |title=Background Note: Vanuatu |publisher=[[US Department of State]] |access-date=22 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604193751/https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2815.htm |archive-date=4 June 2019 |url-status=live }}<br /></ref><ref name="Archaeology"/><ref name="JM"/> Greater oversight of the trade saw it gradually wind down, with Australia barring any further 'blackbird' labourers in 1906, followed by Fiji and Samoa in 1910 and 1913 respectively.<ref name="JM"/>

From 1839 onwards, [[missionary|missionaries]], both [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]], arrived on the islands.<ref name="Beginning"/><ref name="JM"/> At first, they faced hostility, most notably with the killings of [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]] and James Harris of the [[London Missionary Society]] on Erromango in 1839.<ref name="Beginning"/>{{sfn|Van Trease|1987|p=15}} Despite this, they pressed on, resulting in many conversions. To the consternation of the Europeans, Ni-Vanuatu [[syncretism|syncretised]] Christianity with traditional ''[[kastom]]'' beliefs.<ref name="JM"/> The Anglican [[Melanesian Mission]] also took young converts for further training in New Zealand and [[Norfolk Island]].<ref name="Beginning"/> Presbyterian missionaries were particularly successful on Aneityum, though less so on Tanna, with missionaries being repeatedly chased off the island by locals throughout the 1840s–60s.<ref name="Beginning"/>  The waves of illnesses and deaths the missionaries brought with them may have been partly to blame for the hostile response.<ref name="Beginning"/><ref name="JM"/>

Other European settlers also came, looking for land for [[cotton plantation]]s, the first of these being [[Henry Ross Lewin]] on Tanna in 1865 (which he later abandoned).{{sfn|Van Trease|1987|p=19}} When international cotton prices collapsed after the ending of the [[American Civil War]], they switched to coffee, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], bananas, and, most successfully, [[coconut]]s. Initially British subjects from Australia made up the majority of settlers, but with little support from the British government they frequently struggled to make a success of their settlements.<ref name="JM"/>

French planters also began arriving, beginning with Ferdinand Chevillard on Efate in 1880, and later in larger numbers following the creation of the ''Compagnie Caledonienne des Nouvelles-Hébrides'' (CCNH) I. 1882 by [[John Higginson (entrepreneur)|John Higginson]] (a fiercely pro-French Irishman), which soon tipped the balance in favour of French subjects.<ref name="UsaUSA2009">{{cite book |title=Vanuatu Country Study Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjuxcXTEJ_sC&pg=PA26 |date=30 March 2009 |publisher=International Business Publications |isbn=978-1-4387-5649-3 |page=26 |access-date=15 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729084223/https://books.google.com/books?id=wjuxcXTEJ_sC&pg=PA26 |archive-date=29 July 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Van Trease|1987|p=26-7}} The [[French government]] took over the CCNH in 1894 and actively encouraged French settlement.<ref name="JM"/> By 1906, French settlers (at 401) outnumbered the British (228), almost two to one.<ref name=cp/><ref name="JM"/>

As a result, in 1906, France and the United Kingdom agreed to administer the islands jointly; called the Anglo-French [[Condominium (international law)|Condominium]] of the New Hebrides ({{langx|fr|link=yes|Condominium des Nouvelles-Hébrides}}), it was a unique form of government with two separate governmental, legal, judicial and financial systems that came together only in a Joint Court.<ref name="JM"/><ref name="Museum">{{cite web |title=A Short History Of Vanuatu |url=https://southpacificwwiimuseum.com/history/ |publisher=[[South Pacific WWII Museum]] |access-date=24 August 2020 |archive-date=25 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211225091226/https://southpacificwwiimuseum.com/history/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Land expropriation and exploitation of Ni-Vanuatu workers on plantations continued apace.<ref name="JM"/> In an effort to curb the worst of the abuses, and with the support of the missionaries, the Condominium's authority was extended via the Anglo-French Protocol of 1914, although this was not formally ratified until 1922.<ref name="JM"/> While this resulted in some improvements, labour abuses continued, and Ni-Vanuatu were barred from acquiring the [[citizenship]] of either power, being officially stateless.<ref name=cp/><ref name="JM"/> The underfunded Condominium government proved dysfunctional, with the duplication of administrations making effective governance difficult and time-consuming.<ref name="JM"/> Education, healthcare and other such services were left in the hands of the missionaries.<ref name="JM"/>

With the successful [[Solomon Islands campaign|reoccupation of the Solomons]] in 1943 the New Hebrides lost their strategic importance, and the Americans withdrew in 1945, selling much of their equipment at bargain prices and dumping the rest in the sea, at a place now called [[Naval Advance Base Espiritu Santo#Million dollar point|Million Dollar Point]] on [[Espiritu Santo]].<ref name="JM"/> The rapid American deployment and withdrawal led to growth in '[[cargo cult]]s', most notably that of [[John Frum]], whereby Ni-Vanuatu hoped that by returning to traditional values whilst mimicking aspects of the American presence that 'cargo' (i.e. large quantities of American goods) would be delivered to them.<ref name= Guiart>{{cite journal |url=http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_5/b_fdi_16-17/22920.pdf |last=Guiart |first=Jean |date=March 1952 |title=John Frum Movement in Tanna |journal=Oceania |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=165–177 |doi=10.1002/j.1834-4461.1952.tb00558.x |access-date=7 March 2020 |archive-date=16 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220216084316/https://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_5/b_fdi_16-17/22920.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=westoc>{{cite web |url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/westoc/jonfrum.html |title=Western Oceanian Religions: Jon Frum Movement |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031016150752/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/westoc/jonfrum.html |archive-date=16 October 2003 |publisher=University of Cumbria}}</ref> Meanwhile, the Condominium government returned, though understaffed and underfunded, it struggled to reassert its authority.<ref name="JM"/>

====Lead-up to independence (1945–1980)====
[[File:Flag of New Hebrides.svg|thumb|1966 flag of the Anglo-French Condominium of the New Hebrides]]

Decolonisation began sweeping the European empires after the war, and from the 1950s the Condominium government began a somewhat belated campaign of modernisation and economic development.<ref name="JM"/> Hospitals were built, doctors trained and immunisation campaigns carried out.<ref name="JM"/> The inadequate mission-run school system was taken over and improved, with primary enrollment greatly increasing to be near-universal by 1970.<ref name="JM"/> There was greater oversight of the plantations, with worker exploitation being clamped down on and Ni-Vanuatu paid higher wages.<ref name="JM"/>

New industries, such as [[cattle ranching]], commercial fishing and [[manganese]] mining were established.<ref name="JM"/> Ni-Vanuatu began gradually to take over more positions of power and influence within the economy and the church.<ref name="JM"/> Despite this, the British and French still dominated the politics of the colony, with an Advisory Council set up in 1957 containing some Ni-Vanuatu representation having little power.<ref name="JM"/>

The economic development had unintended consequences. In the 1960s, many planters began fencing off and clearing large areas of bushland for cattle ranching, which were often deemed to be communally-held ''kastom'' lands by Ni-Vanuatu.<ref name="JM"/> On Espiritu Santo, the [[Nagriamel]] movement was founded in 1966 by Chief Buluk and [[Jimmy Stevens (politician)|Jimmy Stevens]] on a platform of opposing any further land clearances and gradual, Ni-Vanuatu-led, economic development.<ref name="JM"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-330239351/view?partId=nla.obj-330246081#page/n24/mode/1up |title="Chief President Moses": Man with a message for 10,000 New Hebrideans |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201023094413/https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-330239351/view?partId=nla.obj-330246081#page/n24/mode/1up |archive-date=23 October 2020 |work=Pacific Islands Monthly |date=July 1969 |pages=23–25}}</ref> The movement gained a large following, prompting a crackdown by the authorities, with Buluk and Stevens being arrested in 1967.<ref name="JM"/> Upon their release, they began to press for complete independence.<ref name="JM"/> In 1971, Father [[Walter Lini]] established another party: the New Hebrides Cultural Association, later renamed the [[New Hebrides National Party]] (NHNP), which also focused on achieving independence and opposition to land expropriation.<ref name="JM"/> The NNDP first came to prominence in 1971, when the Condominium government was forced to intervene after a rash of land speculation by foreign nationals.<ref name="JM"/>

Meanwhile, French settlers, and Francophone and mixed-race Ni-Vanuatu, established two separate parties on a platform of more gradual political development – the ''Mouvement Autonomiste des Nouvelles-Hébrides'' (MANH), based on Espiritu Santo, and the ''Union des Communautés des Nouvelles-Hébrides'' (UCNH) on Efate.<ref name="JM"/> The parties aligned on linguistic and religious lines: the NHNP was seen as the party of Anglophone Protestants, and were backed by the British who wished to exit the colony altogether, whereas the MANH, UCNH, Nagriamel and others (collectively known as the 'Moderates') represented Catholic Francophone interests, and a more gradual path to independence.<ref name="JM"/> France backed these groups as they were keen to maintain their influence in the region, most especially in their mineral-rich colony of New Caledonia where they were attempting to suppress an independence movement.<ref name="JM"/><ref name=PIM2>{{cite web |url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-332653576/view?partId=nla.obj-332655109#page/n9/mode/1up |title=Bombs, bribery and ballots in New Hebrides |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201023094115/https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-332653576/view?partId=nla.obj-332655109#page/n9/mode/1up |archive-date=23 October 2020 |work=Pacific Islands Monthly |date=January 1976 |page=8}}</ref>

Meanwhile, economic development continued, with numerous banks and financial centres opening up in the early 1970s to take advantage of the territory's [[tax haven]] status.<ref name="JM"/> A mini-building boom took off in Port Vila and, following the building of a deep-sea wharf, cruise ship tourism grew rapidly, with annual arrivals reaching 40,000 by 1977.<ref name="JM"/> The boom encouraged increasing urbanisation and the populations of Port Vila and [[Luganville]] grew rapidly.<ref name="JM"/>

Since the 1991 general election, Vanuatuan politics have been unstable with a series of fractious coalition governments and the use of [[Motion of no confidence|no confidence votes]] resulting in frequent changes of prime ministers.
