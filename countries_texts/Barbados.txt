=== Geological history ===
Around 700,000 years ago, the island emerged from the ocean as a body of soft rock known as a [[diapir]] rose from the mantle beneath its present-day location. This process is still ongoing, raising Barbados at an average rate of 30 centimetres per thousand years.<ref name="earthmagazine">{{cite web|url=https://www.earthmagazine.org/article/travels-geology-barbados-ascending-sea-level-staircase/|title=Travels in Geology: Barbados: Ascending the sea-level staircase|first1=Terri|last1=Cook|first2=Lon |last2=Abbott|website=Earth Magazine|date=7 June 2018|access-date=13 February 2023|archive-date=31 May 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230531170107/https://www.earthmagazine.org/article/travels-geology-barbados-ascending-sea-level-staircase/|url-status=live}}</ref> Dozens of inland sea reefs still dominate coastal features within terraces and cliffs on the island.<ref name="earthmagazine"/>

=== European arrival ===

[[File:1632 Cardona Descripcion Indias (11).jpg|thumb|left|Spanish map of the island (1632)]]
It is uncertain which European nation arrived first in Barbados, which probably would have been at some point in the 15th century or 16th century.

=== English settlement in the 17th century ===

[[File:GEORGE WASHINGTON HOUSE - BARBADOS.jpg|thumb|right|[[George Washington House (Barbados)|George Washington House]] was visited by [[George Washington]] in 1751, in what is believed to have been his only trip outside the present-day United States.<ref name=boston>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/travel/getaways/caribbean/articles/2008/02/17/new_take_on_george_slept_here/ |title=New Take on George Slept Here |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |access-date=18 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093752/http://www.boston.com/travel/getaways/caribbean/articles/2008/02/17/new_take_on_george_slept_here/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>]]
The first English ship, which had arrived on 14 May 1625, was captained by John Powell. The first settlement began on 17 February 1627, near what is now [[Holetown]] (formerly Jamestown, after King James I of England),<ref>Beckles, ''A History of Barbados'' (2007), p. 7.</ref> by a group led by John Powell's younger brother, [[Henry Powell (governor)|Henry]], consisting of 80 settlers and 10 English [[Indentured servitude|indentured labourers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.funbarbados.com/Sights/holetown.cfm |title=Holetown Barbados – Fun Barbados Sights |website=funbarbados.com |access-date=12 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912191845/http://www.funbarbados.com/Sights/holetown.cfm |archive-date=12 September 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Some sources state that some Africans were among these first settlers.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica- Barbados"/>

The settlement was established as a [[proprietary colony]] and funded by Sir [[William Courten]], a [[City of London]] merchant who acquired the title to Barbados and several other islands. The first colonists were actually tenants, and much of the profits of their labour returned to Courten and his company.<ref>[http://www.shipstamps.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=10931 William And John] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117122343/http://www.shipstamps.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=10931 |date=17 November 2017 }}, 11 January 201, Shipstamps.co.uk</ref> Courten's title was later transferred to [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle]], in what was called the "Great Barbados Robbery".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Barbados: A Walk through History (Part 3) {{!}} The Association for Promotion of International Cooperation (APIC) |url=https://www.apic.or.jp/english/projects/barbados003-eng.html |access-date=2025-09-24 |website=www.apic.or.jp}}</ref> Carlisle then chose as governor [[Henry Powell (governor)|Henry Powell]], who established the [[Barbados House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] in 1639, in an effort to appease the planters, who might otherwise have opposed his controversial appointment.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica- Barbados"/><ref name="Slavery and Economy in Barbados">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/barbados_01.shtml |title=Slavery and Economy in Barbados |access-date=9 July 2019 |archive-date=12 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212022845/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/barbados_01.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the period 1640–1660, the West Indies attracted more than two-thirds of the total number of English emigrants to the Americas. By 1650, there were 44,000 settlers in the West Indies, as compared to 12,000 on the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] and 23,000 in [[New England]]. Most English arrivals were indentured. After five years of labour, they were given "freedom dues" of about £10, usually in goods. Before the mid-1630s, they also received {{convert|5|to|10|acre|ha|abbr=off|0}} of land, but after that time the island filled and there was no more free land. During the [[Interregnum (England)|Cromwellian era]] (1650s) this included a large number of prisoners-of-war, vagrants and people who were illicitly kidnapped, who were forcibly transported to the island and sold as servants. These last two groups were predominantly Irish, as several thousand were infamously rounded up by English merchants and sold into servitude in Barbados and other Caribbean islands during this period, a practice that came to be known as being ''Barbadosed''.<ref name="Slavery and Economy in Barbados"/><ref>{{cite book |url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199562527.003.0014 |title=Patrick J.

[[Parishes of Barbados|Parish]] registers from the 1650s show that, for the white population, there were four times as many deaths as marriages. The mainstay of the infant colony's economy was the growth export of tobacco, but tobacco prices eventually fell in the 1630s as Chesapeake production expanded.<ref name="Slavery and Economy in Barbados"/>

==== Effects of the English Civil War ====

{{Main|English overseas possessions in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Restoration in the English colonies}}
Around the same time, fighting during the [[War of the Three Kingdoms]] and the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] spilled over into Barbados and Barbadian territorial waters. The island was not [[English overseas possessions in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|involved in the war]] until after the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], when the island's government fell under the control of Royalists (ironically the Governor, Philip Bell, remaining loyal to [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] while the Barbadian [[House of Assembly]], under the influence of Humphrey Walrond, supported [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]). To try to bring the recalcitrant colony to heel, the [[Rump Parliament#Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth Parliament]] passed an act on 3 October 1650 prohibiting trade between England and Barbados, and because the island also traded with the Netherlands, further [[Navigation Acts]] were passed, prohibiting any but English vessels trading with [[Dutch Empire#Atlantic|Dutch colonies]]. These acts were a precursor to the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]]. The [[Commonwealth of England]] sent an invasion force under the command of [[George Ayscue|Sir George Ayscue]], which arrived in October 1651. Ayscue, with a smaller force that included Scottish prisoners, surprised a larger force of Royalists, but had to resort to spying and diplomacy ultimately. On 11 January 1652, the Royalists in the House of Assembly led by [[Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham|Lord Willoughby]] surrendered, which marked the end of royalist privateering as a major threat.<ref>Blakemore, Richard J. and Murphy, Elaine.

=== Irish people in Barbados ===

{{Main|Irish people in Barbados}}
Starting with [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]], a large percentage of the white labourer population were indentured servants and involuntarily transported people from Ireland.

==== The sugar revolution ====
[[File:Mercado de los domingos, donde lo esclavos eran intercambiados por otros bienes y necesidades (Barbados Museum, Bridgetown).jpg|thumb|Sunday market in Barbados during the colonial era]]
The introduction of [[sugar cane]] from [[Dutch Brazil]] in 1640 completely transformed society, the economy and the physical landscape.

At first, Dutch traders supplied the equipment, financing, and African slaves, in addition to transporting most of the sugar to Europe.<ref name="Slavery and Economy in Barbados"/><ref name="Encylopedia Britannica- Barbados"/> In 1644 the population of Barbados was estimated at 30,000, of which about 800 were of African ancestry, with the remainder mainly of English ancestry. These English smallholders were eventually bought out and the island filled up with large sugar plantations worked by African slaves.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica- Barbados"/> By 1660 there was near parity with 27,000 Black people and 26,000 White people. By 1666 at least 12,000 white smallholders had been bought out, died, or left the island, many choosing to emigrate to [[Jamaica]] or the [[Thirteen Colonies|American Colonies]] (notably the Carolinas).<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica- Barbados"/> As a result, Barbados enacted a [[Barbados Slave Code|slave code]] as a way of legislatively controlling its enslaved Black population.<ref>Jerome Handler, ''New West Indian Guide'' 91 (2017) 30–55</ref> The law's text was influential in laws in other colonies.<ref name=menard>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FyB24GZrJxAC&pg=PA112 ''Sweet Negotiations: Sugar, Slavery, and Plantation Agriculture in Early Barbados''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210125230814/https://books.google.com/books?id=FyB24GZrJxAC&pg=PA112 |date=25 January 2021 }}, Chapter 6 "The Expansion of Barbados", p. 112</ref>

==== Transition to republic ====

{{Main|Republicanism in Barbados}}
The Government of Barbados announced on 15 September 2020 that it intended to become a republic by 30 November 2021, the 55th anniversary of its independence, resulting in the replacement of the [[Barbadian monarchy]] with a president elected through [[electoral college]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Yasharoff |first=Hannah |title=Barbados announces plan to remove Queen Elizabeth as head of state next year|date=16 September 2020|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/09/16/queen-elizabeth-removed-barbados-head-state-barbados-says/5814409002/ |access-date=16 September 2020 |website=USA TODAY|archive-date=7 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211007081350/https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/09/16/queen-elizabeth-removed-barbados-head-state-barbados-says/5814409002/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/22/americas/barbados-elects-first-president-intl-hnk/index.html |title=Barbados elects first president, replacing UK Queen as head of state |website=CNN|date=22 October 2021 |access-date=23 October 2021 |archive-date=26 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211026044014/https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/22/americas/barbados-elects-first-president-intl-hnk/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Barbados would then cease to be a [[Commonwealth realm]], but could maintain membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], like [[Guyana]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Team |first=Caribbean Lifestyle Editorial |date=15 September 2020 |title=Barbados to become an Independent Republic in 2021 |url=https://caribbeanlifestyle.com/barbados-to-become-republic-by-2021/ |access-date=15 September 2020 |website=Caribbean Culture and Lifestyle|archive-date=23 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210923111016/https://caribbeanlifestyle.com/barbados-to-become-republic-by-2021/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Speare-Cole |first=Rebecca |date=16 September 2020 |title=Barbados to remove Queen as head of state by November 2021 |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/barbados-queen-head-of-state-removal-a4548381.html |access-date=16 September 2020 |website=Evening Standard|archive-date=13 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813201215/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/barbados-queen-head-of-state-removal-a4548381.html |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=17 September 2020 |title=Wickham predicts Barbados' republic model to mirror Trinidad's |url=https://barbadostoday.bb/2020/09/17/wickham-predicts-barbados-republic-model-to-mirror-trinidads/ |url-status=live |editor1-last=Madden |editor1-first=Marlon |department=Top Featured Article |publisher=Barbados Today |publication-date=17 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813162631/https://barbadostoday.bb/2020/09/17/wickham-predicts-barbados-republic-model-to-mirror-trinidads/ |archive-date=13 August 2021 |access-date=4 June 2021 |url-access= |quote=As Barbados prepares to ditch the Queen as its Head of State and become a republic, a prominent political scientist is predicting that Prime Minister Mia Mottley will follow the Trinidad and Tobago model.

'There is no need to and I don't think it makes a lot of sense. We had a situation where since 1999 this [political party] indicated its desire to go in the direction of a republic. The Opposition has always supported it ... So, I think there is enough cohesion in that regard to go with it,' he said. }}</ref><ref name="auto1">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-54174794 |title=Barbados to remove Queen Elizabeth as head of state |work=BBC News |date=16 September 2020 |access-date=18 March 2021 |archive-date=11 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210311160055/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-54174794 |url-status=live}}</ref>
