At the end of the 4th millennium BC, Arabia entered the [[Bronze Age]]; metals were widely used, and the period was characterized by its 2&nbsp;m high burials which were simultaneously followed by the existence of numerous temples that included many free-standing sculptures originally painted with red colours.<ref>طرق التجارة القديمة، روائع آثار المملكة العربية السعودية pp. 156–157</ref>

The earliest sedentary culture in Saudi Arabia dates back to the [[Ubaid period]] at [[Dosariyah]]. Climatic change and the onset of aridity may have brought about the end of this phase of settlement, as little archaeological evidence exists from the succeeding millennium.<ref>Roads of Arabia p. 176.</ref> The settlement of the region picks up again in the period of [[Dilmun]] in the early 3rd millennium. Known records from [[Uruk]] refer to a place called Dilmun, associated on several occasions with copper, and in later periods it was a source of imported woods in southern Mesopotamia. Scholars have suggested that Dilmun originally designated the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]], notably linked with the major Dilmunite settlements of Umm an-Nussi and Umm ar-Ramadh in the interior and Tarout on the coast. It is likely that [[Tarout Island]] was the main port and the capital of Dilmun.<ref name="Roads of Arabia p. 180" /> Mesopotamian inscribed clay tablets suggest that, in the early period of Dilmun, a hierarchical organized political structure existed. In 1966, an earthwork in Tarout exposed an ancient burial field that yielded a large statue dating to the Dilmunite period (mid 3rd millennium BC). The statue was locally made under the strong Mesopotamian influence on the artistic principle of Dilmun.<ref name="Roads of Arabia p. 180" />

By 2200 BC, the centre of Dilmun shifted for unknown reasons from Tarout and the Saudi Arabian mainland to the island of Bahrain, and a highly developed settlement emerged there, where a laborious temple complex and thousands of burial mounds dating to this period were discovered.<ref name="Roads of Arabia p. 180"/>

[[Arab]]s originating from modern-day Saudi Arabia, the [[Hejaz]] in particular, founded the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] (632–661), [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] (661–750), [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] (750–1517), and the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] (909–1171) caliphates.

=== Ottoman Hejaz and Portuguese era ===

In the 16th century, the Ottomans added the Red Sea and Persian Gulf coast (the Hejaz, [[Aseer]] and [[Eastern Arabia|Al-Ahsa]]) to the empire and claimed suzerainty over the interior. One reason was to [[Ottoman–Portuguese conflicts (1538–1560)|thwart Portuguese attempts]] to attack the Red Sea (hence the Hejaz) and the Indian Ocean.<ref name="Bernstein">Bernstein, William J.

Ibn Saud avoided involvement in the Arab Revolt and instead continued his struggle with the Al Rashid.

After the conquest of the Hejaz, the Ikhwan leadership's objective switched to expansion of the Wahhabist realm into the British protectorates of Transjordan, Iraq and Kuwait, and began raiding those territories. This met with Ibn Saud's opposition, as he recognized the danger of a direct conflict with the British. At the same time, the Ikhwan became disenchanted with Ibn Saud's domestic policies which appeared to favour modernization and the increase in the number of non-Muslim foreigners in the country. As a result, they turned against Ibn Saud and, after a two-year struggle, were defeated in 1929 at the [[Battle of Sabilla]], where their leaders were massacred.<ref>{{cite book |title=Inside the Kingdom |first=Robert |last=Lacey |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-09-953905-6 |pages=15–16|publisher=Arrow }}</ref> On Ibn Saud's behalf, [[Faisal bin Abdulaziz al Saud|Prince Faisal]] declared the unification on 23 September 1932, and the two kingdoms of Hejaz and Nejd were unified as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.<ref name="Britannica history" /> That date is now a national holiday called [[Saudi National Day]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pmu.edu.sa/News/News.aspx?ID=866 |title=History of Saudi Arabia.

However, the large influx of [[foreign workers in Saudi Arabia]] in the oil industry increased the pre-existing propensity for [[xenophobia]].

It led to rapid technological (but not cultural) modernization, urbanization, mass public education, and the creation of new media. This and the presence of increasingly large numbers of foreign workers greatly affected traditional Saudi norms and values. Although there was a dramatic change in the social and economic life of the country, political power continued to be monopolized by the royal family<ref name="Britannica history" /> leading to discontent among many Saudis who began to look for wider participation in government.{{sfn|Abir|1993|p=114}}

In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia and [[Kuwait]] spent $25 billion in support of [[Saddam Hussein]] in the [[Iran–Iraq War]] (1980–1988);<ref>Robert Fisk (2005) ''[[The Great War For Civilisation]]''. Fourth Estate. p. 23. {{ISBN|978-1-4000-7517-1}}</ref> however, Saudi Arabia condemned the [[invasion of Kuwait]] in 1990 and asked the United States to intervene.<ref name="Britannica history" /> King Fahd allowed American and coalition troops to be stationed in Saudi Arabia. He invited the Kuwaiti government and many of its citizens to stay in Saudi Arabia, but expelled citizens of [[Yemen]] and [[Jordan]] because of their governments' support of [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]]. In 1991, Saudi Arabian forces were involved both in bombing raids on Iraq and in the land invasion that helped to liberate Kuwait, which became known as the [[Gulf War]] (1990–1991).<ref name="BBC timeline" />

Saudi Arabia's relations with the West was one of the issues that led to [[List of militant incidents in Saudi Arabia|an increase in Islamist terrorism]] in Saudi Arabia, as well as Islamist terrorist attacks in Western countries by Saudi nationals. [[Osama bin Laden]] was a Saudi citizen (until stripped of his citizenship in 1994) and was responsible for the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] in East Africa and the 2000 [[USS Cole bombing|USS ''Cole'' bombing]] near the port of [[Aden]], Yemen. 15 of [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|the hijackers]] involved in the [[September 11 attacks]] were Saudi nationals.<ref>{{cite book |title=Saudi Arabia: Background and U.S. Relations |first=Christopher |last=Blanchard |publisher=United States Congressional Research Service|year=2009 |pages=5–6}}</ref> Many Saudis who did not support the Islamist terrorists were nevertheless deeply unhappy with the government's policies.<ref>[[#Hegghammer|Hegghammer]], p. 31</ref>

Islamism was not the only source of hostility to the government. Although extremely wealthy by the 21st century, Saudi Arabia's economy was near stagnant. High taxes and a growth in unemployment have contributed to discontent and have been reflected in a rise in civil unrest, and discontent with the royal family. In response, a number of limited reforms were initiated by King Fahd. In March 1992, he introduced the "[[Basic Law of Saudi Arabia|Basic Law]]", which emphasized the duties and responsibilities of a ruler. In December 1993, the Consultative Council was inaugurated. It is composed of a chairman and 60 members—all chosen by the King. Fahd made it clear that he did not have democracy in mind, saying: "A system based on elections is not consistent with our Islamic creed, which [approves of] government by consultation [shūrā]."<ref name="Britannica history"/>

In 1995, Fahd suffered a stroke, and the Crown Prince, [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]], became ''de facto'' regent; however, his authority was hindered by conflict with Fahd's full brothers (known, with Fahd, as the "[[Sudairi Seven]]").<ref>[[#Al-Rasheed|Al-Rasheed]], p. 212</ref>
