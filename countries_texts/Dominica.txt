=== Geologic history ===
Dominica first emerged from the sea during the [[Oligocene]] Epoch approximately 27 million years ago, making it one of the last Caribbean islands to be formed by [[Volcanism|volcanic activity]].{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

=== Pre-colonial period and early European contact ===

Dominica's precolonial indigenous inhabitants were the [[Island Carib]] people, who are thought to have driven out the previous [[Arawak]] population.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Dominica |title=Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica |access-date=29 June 2019 |archive-date=12 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231012123836/https://www.britannica.com/place/Dominica |url-status=live }}</ref> However, this may be a partial misconception as ancestral Kalinago narratives mention the two groups coexisting and intermarrying. The Arawak were not the primary indigenous group. It is believed that before them were a group of paleo-Indians who arrived towards the end of the late Pleistocene period.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

In 1493, [[Christopher Columbus]] first spotted the island during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|second voyage]] to the Americas. Because he saw the island on a Sunday (November 3, 1493), Columbus named the island Dominica (Latin for 'Sunday').<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> Some Spanish colonisers settled there. But, as European explorers and settlers entered the region, indigenous refugees from surrounding islands settled in Dominica and pushed out the Spanish settlers. The Spanish instead settled other areas that were easier to control.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

=== French colony ===
{{Main|French West Indies}}

Spain had little success in colonising Dominica. In 1632, the French [[Compagnie des Îles de l'Amérique]] claimed it and other ''"Petites Antilles"'' for [[Kingdom of France|France]], but no physical occupation took place.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> Between 1642 and 1650, French missionary [[Raymond Breton]] became the first regular European visitor to the island.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

In 1660, the French and English agreed that Dominica and [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] should not be settled, but instead left to the Carib people as neutral territory.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> However, its natural resources attracted expeditions of English and French foresters, who began harvesting timber.<ref name="bn">"Background note: Dominica". [[U.S. Department of State]] (July 2008). {{PD-notice}}</ref> In 1690, the French established their first permanent settlements. French woodcutters from [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]] began to set up timber camps to supply the French islands with wood, and they gradually became permanent settlers. They brought the first enslaved Africans from West Africa to ''Dominique'', as they called it in French.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

In 1715, a revolt of "poor white" smallholders in the north of Martinique, known as La Gaoulé,<ref>P.C. Emmer & BW Highman, (1999) ''General History of the Caribbean: Methodology and Historiography of the Caribbean,'' volume 6, [https://books.google.com/books?id=E12cpltazYgC&lpg=PA637 p. 637]</ref> caused settlers to migrate to southern Dominique, where they set up [[smallholding]]s. Meanwhile, French families and others from Guadeloupe settled in the north. In 1727, the first French commander, [[M. Le Grand]], took charge of the island with a basic French government. Dominique formally became a [[colony]] of France, and the island was divided into districts or "quarters".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lennoxhonychurch.com/article.cfm?Id=394 |title=Important Dates in Dominica's History |publisher=Lennox Honychurch |date=1990-07-05 |access-date=2013-09-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830091704/http://www.lennoxhonychurch.com/article.cfm?Id=394 |archive-date=30 August 2013}}</ref> The French had already developed plantation agriculture on Martinique and Guadeloupe, where they cultivated [[sugarcane]] with enslaved African workers. In Dominique they gradually developed coffee plantations. Because of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the general population came to consist primarily of black-African slaves.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

In 1761, during the [[Seven Years' War]] in Europe, a [[British expedition against Dominica]], led by [[Andrew Rollo, 5th Lord Rollo|Andrew Rollo]], conquered the island and several other Caribbean islands. In 1763, France lost the war and ceded the island to Great Britain in 1763 under the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]].<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> The same year, the British established a [[legislative assembly]], with only European colonists represented. French remained the official language, but [[Antillean Creole]], which had developed from it, was spoken by most of the population.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

In 1778 the French, with the active co-operation of the population, began the [[Invasion of Dominica (1778)|re-capture of Dominica]].<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> This was ended in 1783 by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|second Treaty of Paris]], which returned the island to British control, but the island population, especially those considered {{Lang|fr|gens de couleur libres}} ({{Lit|free people of colour}}), resisted British restrictions. The British retained control throughout French invasions in 1795 and 1805,<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/><ref name="bn" /> the first taking place during the period of the [[Haitian Revolution]], which gained the independence of Haiti (formerly Saint-Domingue, France's richest Caribbean colony).{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

Great Britain established a small colony in 1805. It used Dominica as part of the [[Atlantic slave trade|Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade]], by which slaves were imported and sold as labour in the islands as part of a trade that included producing and shipping sugar and coffee as commodity crops to Europe. The best documented slave plantation on the island is Hillsborough Estate, which had 71 male and 68 female slaves.  The [[Quarry Bank Mill|Greg]] family were notable: Thomas Hodgson, a brother-in-law, owned a slave ship, and Thomas Greg and his son John Greg were part-owners of [[sugar plantation]]s in Dominica.  In January 1814, 20 slaves absconded from Hillsborough. They were recorded as recaptured and punished with 100 lashes applied to the males and 50 for the females. The slaves reportedly said that one of their people had died in the plantation hospital, and they believed he had been poisoned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD/GBR/0115/RCMS+266|title=Janus: Dominica Estate documents|website=janus.lib.cam.ac.uk|access-date=19 September 2017|archive-date=20 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920044851/https://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0115%2FRCMS%20266|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1831, reflecting a liberalisation of official British racial attitudes, the Brown Privilege Bill<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/antislaverymont00englgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/antislaverymont00englgoog/page/n279 211] |title=Anti-Slavery Monthly Reporter, volume 3|publisher=London Society for the Mitigation and Abolition of Slavery in the British Dominions |author=London Society for the Abolition of Slavery throughout the British Dominions|year=1831}}</ref> conferred political and social rights on [[free black]]s (mostly [[free people of colour]], who generally were of [[mixed race]], with African and European ancestry). With the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]], Britain ended the institution of slavery throughout [[British Empire|its empire]], except in India.<ref name=SectionLXIV>{{cite web |url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Legis_07.htm |title=Slavery Abolition Act 1833; Section LXIV |date=28 August 1833 |access-date=3 June 2008 |archive-date=24 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524010152/http://www.pdavis.nl/Legis_07.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

With freedom came enfranchisement. In 1835, the first three men of African descent were elected to the legislative assembly of Dominica. Many slaves from the neighbouring French colonial islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique fled to Dominica. In 1838, Dominica became the first colony of the [[British West Indies]] to have an elected legislature controlled by an ethnic African majority. Most of these legislators had been free people of colour and smallholders or merchants before the abolition of slavery. Their economic and social views were different from the interests of the small, wealthy English [[plantation|planter]] class. Reacting to a perceived threat to their power, the planters lobbied for more direct British rule.<ref name=bn/>

In 1865, after much agitation and tension, the colonial office replaced the elective assembly with one made up of one-half members who were elected and one-half who were appointed. Planters, who were allied with colonial administrators, outmanoeuvred the elected legislators on many occasions. In 1871, Dominica became part of the [[British Leeward Islands]]. The political power of the elected assembly progressively eroded. [[Crown colony]] government was re-established in 1896.

In [[World War I]], many Dominicans, mainly the sons of small farmers, volunteered to fight in Europe for the British Empire. After the war, an upsurge of political consciousness throughout the Caribbean led to the formation of the [[List of historical autonomist and secessionist movements#British West Indies|Representative Government Association]]. Marshalling public frustration with the lack of a voice in the government of Dominica, this group won one-third of the popularly elected seats of the legislative assembly in 1924, and one-half in 1936. In 1940, administration of Dominica was transferred from the [[British Leeward Islands]] to the [[British Windward Islands]].<ref name=bn/> During [[World War II]], some Dominicans volunteered in British and Caribbean forces. Thousands of [[Free French]] refugees from Martinique and Guadeloupe escaped to Dominica from the [[Vichy France|Vichy]]-controlled French islands, staying in [[Roseau]] and other villages.

Until 1958, Dominica was governed as part of the [[British Windward Islands]]. Caribbean islands sought independence from 1958 to 1962, and Dominica became a province of the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]] in 1958.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/><ref name=bn/> After the federation dissolved in 1962, Dominica became an associated state of the United Kingdom in 1967, and formally took responsibility for its internal affairs.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> On 3 November 1978, Dominica was granted independence as a [[republic]], led by Prime Minister [[Patrick John]].<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/><ref name=bn/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1978/1031/contents/made|title=The Dominica Termination of Association Order 1978|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=1 July 2018|archive-date=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702011323/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1978/1031/contents/made|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Post-independence ===
In mid-1979, political discontent with founding prime minister Patrick John's administration climaxed in a civilian coup and ended in the passage of a [[motion of no confidence]] against John in the House of Assembly, Dominica's legislature, collapsing his administration. An Interim Government was formed under Dominica's second Prime Minister [[Oliver Seraphin]];<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> Seraphin's main task was to prepare the country for fresh general elections constitutionally due in 1980, hence the unofficial title "Interim Prime Minister". Seraphin organised and led a splinter of the Dominica Labour Party—the Democratic Labour Party—into the 1980 general election and lost mainly because his nearly 13 month-long premiership was dominated by the effects of Category Five [[Hurricane David]], which caused 56 deaths and untold damage across the island.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/><ref name="tcr3">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1979-prelim/david/prelim03.gif|title=Hurricane David Preliminary Report, Page 3|last=Lawrence|first=Miles|year=1979|publisher=National Hurricane Center|access-date=5 October 2010|archive-date=9 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230309235432/https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1979-prelim/david/prelim03.gif|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Hurricane Allen]] the following year caused further damage.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> After the [[1980 Dominican general election|1980 election]], Seraphin's government was replaced by one led by the [[Dominica Freedom Party]] (DFP) under Prime Minister [[Eugenia Charles]]; she was the Caribbean's first female prime minister.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbGcAQAAQBAJ&q=eugenia+charles+pulmonary&pg=PA210|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 2005–2008|last=Goldman|first=Lawrence|publisher= Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199671540|pages=210|language=en}}</ref>

In 1981, Charles's government was threatened with two attempted coups. The first was led by [[Frederick Newton]], commander of the [[Military of Dominica]], who organised an attack on the police headquarters in Roseau which resulted in the death of a police officer.<ref name=coup>{{cite news|title=Ex-Commander Hanged For Dominica Coup Role|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/09/world/around-the-world-ex-commander-hanged-for-dominica-coup-role.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 August 1986|access-date=26 August 2009|archive-date=22 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222203135/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/09/world/around-the-world-ex-commander-hanged-for-dominica-coup-role.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Newton and five other soldiers were found guilty in the attack and sentenced to death in 1983; the sentences of the five accomplices were later commuted to life in prison, but Newton was executed in 1986.<ref name=coup/> A second occurred later in the year when the country was threatened with a takeover by [[mercenaries]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-3376.html |title=Caribbean Islands – Regional Security Threats, 1970–81 |publisher=Country-data.com |access-date=2010-06-27 |archive-date=31 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231141341/http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-3376.html |url-status=live }}</ref> led by [[Mike Perdue]] and [[Wolfgang Droege]] in [[Operation Red Dog]].

[[File:President Ronald Reagan meets with Prime Minister Eugenia Charles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eugenia Charles]], Prime Minister 1980–95, discussing the [[United States invasion of Grenada|situation in Grenada]] in 1983 with US President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]

The Charles government supported the 1983 American [[invasion of Grenada]], earning Dominica praise from the US government of [[Ronald Reagan]], and an increase in financial aid.<ref>Woodward, Bob, ''Veil: the Secret Wars of the CIA 1981-1987'', New York: Simon and Schuster, 1987, pp. 290, 300.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>

By the middle of the 1980s, the economy had begun to recover,<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> before weakening again due to a decrease in [[banana]] prices. Eugenia Charles won the [[1985 Dominican general election|1985]] general election, becoming the first incumbent Dominica Prime Minister to be popularly re-elected. The continuing downturn in the economy and the tight grip by Eugenia Charles on Dominica politics gave rise to a self-titled "Third Force" political formation in 1988, which disrupted the traditional two-party arrangement of governing DFP and opposition DLP. The formation soon formalised as the [[UWP (Dominica)|United Workers' Party]] (UWP) and selected as its leader [[Edison James]], the former general manager of the Dominica Banana Marketing Company. This was a strategic selection: he had prestige among banana farmers, and support from his origins in the East Coast, which had begun to feel alienated by the West Coast elites in Roseau, Dominica's capital.<ref name=bn/> Eugenia Charles again won the [[1990 Dominican general election|1990]] general election, the first incumbent Dominica prime minister to win three consecutive general elections, but the UWP's emergence had reduced her party's majority in Parliament to one. It was, therefore, no great surprise when Eugenia Charles gave up political leadership of the Dominica Freedom Party in 1993 and did not contest the 1995 general election in any capacity. No longer benefitting from her leadership, the Dominica Freedom Party lost the [[1995 Dominican general election|1995 election]] to the UWP, and James became prime minister.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> He attempted to diversify the Dominican economy away from over-reliance on bananas. The crop was largely destroyed by [[Hurricane Luis]] in 1995,<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> and James was unable to restore the banana industry to its former selling price and prestige. Moreover, his administration became embroiled in opposition charges of official corruption.

In the [[2000 Dominican general election|31 January 2000 general election]], the UWP were defeated by a coalition of the DLP, led by left-leaning [[Rosie Douglas|Roosevelt B. "Rosie" Douglas]], and the DFP led by former trade union leader [[Charles Savarin]]; Douglas became prime minister.
