Traditionally, archaeologists have estimated that the earliest settlers arrived in successive waves in [[Outrigger canoe|outrigger canoes]] from [[South Kalimantan|South Borneo]], possibly throughout the period between 350&nbsp;BCE and 550&nbsp;CE, while others are cautious about dates earlier than 250 CE.

After reuniting Imerina, and now seated at the [[Rova of Antananarivo]], Andrianampoinimerina rapidly expanded his rule over neighbouring principalities.

Radama's successor, Queen [[Ranavalona I]] (1828–61), responded to increasing political and cultural encroachment on the part of Britain and France by issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of [[Christianity in Madagascar]] and pressuring most foreigners to leave the territory. The Queen made heavy use of the traditional practice of ''[[Corvée|fanompoana]]'' (forced labor as tax payment) to complete public works projects and develop a standing army of between 20,000 and 30,000 Merina soldiers, whom she deployed to pacify outlying regions of the island and further expand the Kingdom of Merina to encompass most of Madagascar. Residents of Madagascar could accuse one another of various crimes, including theft, Christianity and especially witchcraft, for which the ordeal of ''[[tangena]]'' was routinely obligatory.

Huge mining and forestry concessions were granted to large companies. Native chiefs loyal to the French administration were also granted part of the land. Forced labor was introduced in favor of the French companies and peasants were encouraged, through taxation, to work for wages (especially in the colonial concessions) to the detriment of small individual farms. However, the colonial period was accompanied by movements fighting for independence: the Menalamba, the [[Vy Vato Sakelika]], the [[Democratic Movement for Malagasy Renovation]] (MDRM). In 1927, major demonstrations were organized in Antananarivo, notably on the initiative of the communist activist {{Interlanguage link|François Vittori|fr}}, who was imprisoned as a result. The 1930s saw the Malagasy anti-colonial movement gain further momentum. Malagasy trade unionism began to appear underground and the [[Communist Party of the Madagascar region]] was formed. But in 1939, all the organizations were dissolved by the administration of the colony, which opted for the [[Vichy regime]]. The MDRM was accused by the colonial regime of being at the origin of the 1947 insurrection and was pursued by violent repression.<ref>Jacques Tronchon. L'insurrection malgache de 1947.

[[File:Philibert_Tsiranana_1962.jpg|thumb|[[Philibert Tsiranana]], the first [[List of Presidents of Madagascar|president of Madagascar]] (1960–1972)]]
Since regaining independence, Madagascar has transitioned through four republics with corresponding revisions to its constitution. The [[Malagasy Republic|First Republic]] (1960–72), under the leadership of French-appointed President [[Philibert Tsiranana]], was characterized by a continuation of strong economic and political ties to France. Many high-level technical positions were filled by French expatriates, and French teachers, textbooks and curricula continued to be used in schools around the country. Popular resentment over Tsiranana's tolerance for this "neo-colonial" arrangement inspired a [[Rotaka|series of farmer and student protests]] that overturned his administration in 1972.<ref name="LOC2" />

[[Gabriel Ramanantsoa]], a major general in the army, was appointed interim president and prime minister that same year, but low public approval forced him to step down in 1975. Colonel [[Richard Ratsimandrava]], appointed to succeed him, was assassinated six days into his tenure. General [[Gilles Andriamahazo]] ruled after Ratsimandrava for four months before being replaced by another military appointee: Vice Admiral [[Didier Ratsiraka]], who ushered in the Marxist–Leninist [[Democratic Republic of Madagascar|Second Republic]] that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993.<ref>{{cite web |title=Élection présidentielle à Madagascar: les Ratsiraka, une famille divisée |url=https://www.lechodusud.com/post/%C3%A9lection-pr%C3%A9sidentielle-%C3%A0-madagascar-les-ratsiraka-une-famille-divis%C3%A9e |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230826105935/https://www.lechodusud.com/post/%C3%A9lection-pr%C3%A9sidentielle-%C3%A0-madagascar-les-ratsiraka-une-famille-divis%C3%A9e |archive-date=26 August 2023 |access-date=26 August 2023 |work=[[L'Écho du Sud]] |language=fr}}</ref>

This period saw a political alignment with the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures stemming from the [[1973 oil crisis]], resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and a sharp decline in living standards,<ref name="LOC2" /> and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, [[World Bank]] and various bilateral donors in exchange for their bailout of the nation's broken economy.<ref name="ISS2">{{cite journal |last=Marcus |first=Richard |date=August 2004 |title=Political change in Madagascar: populist democracy or neopatrimonialism by another name? |url=http://www.issafrica.org/publications/papers/political-change-in-madagascar-populist-democracy-or-neopatrimonialism-by-another-name |journal=Occasional Paper No. 89 |publisher=Institute for Security Studies |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040907223329/http://www.iss.org.za/pubs/papers/89/Paper89.htm |archive-date=7 September 2004 |access-date=15 February 2012}}</ref>

Ratsiraka's dwindling popularity in the late 1980s reached a critical point in 1991 when presidential guards opened fire on unarmed protesters during a rally. Within two months, a transitional government had been established under the leadership of [[Albert Zafy]] (1993–96), who went on to win the 1992 presidential elections and inaugurate the [[Third Republic of Madagascar|Third Republic]] (1992–2010).<ref name="crisisgroup2">{{cite web |title=Madagascar: La Crise a un Tournant Critique? |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/southern-africa/madagascar/166%20Madagascar%20a%20un%20tournant%20critique.ashx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725204902/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/southern-africa/madagascar/166%20Madagascar%20a%20un%20tournant%20critique.ashx |archive-date=25 July 2011 |access-date=25 November 2010 |work=International Crisis Group |language=fr}}</ref> The new [[Constitution of Madagascar|Madagascar constitution]] established a multi-party democracy and a separation of powers that placed significant control in the hands of the National Assembly.

He was consequently impeached in 1996, and an interim president, [[Norbert Ratsirahonana]], was appointed for the three months prior to the next presidential election. Ratsiraka was then voted back into power on a platform of decentralization and economic reforms for a second term which lasted from 1996 to 2001.<ref name="ISS2" />

The contested [[Malagasy presidential election, 2001|2001 presidential elections]] in which then-mayor of Antananarivo, [[Marc Ravalomanana]], eventually emerged victorious, caused a seven-month standoff in 2002 between supporters of Ravalomanana and Ratsiraka. The negative economic impact of the political crisis was gradually overcome by Ravalomanana's progressive economic and political policies, which encouraged investments in education and ecotourism, facilitated foreign direct investment, and cultivated trading partnerships both regionally and internationally. National GDP grew at an average rate of 7&nbsp;percent per year under his administration.
