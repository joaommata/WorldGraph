{{Main|History of the Bahamas}}

===Pre-Hispanic era===
The first inhabitants of the Bahamas were the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] people, who moved into the uninhabited southern islands from [[Hispaniola]] and Cuba sometime between AD 500 and 800, having migrated there from mainland [[South America]]; they came to be known as the [[Lucayan people]]. An estimated 30,000 Lucayans inhabited the Bahamas at the time of [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in 1492.<ref>{{cite book|title=The people who discovered Columbus: the prehistory of the Bahamas|last=Keegan|first=William F.|date=1992|publisher=University Press of Florida|others=Jay I.

Columbus' first landfall in what was to Europeans a "New World" was on an island he named San Salvador (known to the Lucayans as ''[[Guanahani]]''). While there is a general consensus that this island lay within the Bahamas, precisely which island Columbus landed on is a matter of scholarly debate. Some researchers believe the site to be present-day [[San Salvador Island]] (formerly known as Watling's Island), situated in the southeastern Bahamas, whilst an alternative theory holds that Columbus landed to the southeast on [[Samana Cay]], according to calculations made in 1986 by ''[[National Geographic]]'' writer and editor [[Joseph Judge]], based on Columbus' log. On the landfall island, Columbus made first contact with the Lucayans and exchanged goods with them, claiming the islands for the [[Crown of Castile]], before proceeding to explore the larger isles of the [[Greater Antilles]].<ref name="Britannica, Bahamas">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/the-Bahamas|title=Encyclopædia Britannica – The Bahamas|access-date=22 July 2019|archive-date=26 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210426222152/https://www.britannica.com/place/The-Bahamas|url-status=live}}</ref>

The 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] theoretically divided the new territories between the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], placing the Bahamas in the Spanish sphere; however, they did little to press their claim on the ground. The Spanish did, however, exploit the native Lucayan peoples, many of whom were enslaved and sent to Hispaniola for use as forced labour.<ref name="Britannica, Bahamas"/> The slaves suffered harsh conditions and most died from contracting [[Infectious disease|diseases]] to which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]; half of the Taíno died from [[smallpox]] alone.<ref>[http://www.edweek.org/login.html?source=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/10/09/06columb.h11.html&destination=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/10/09/06columb.h11.html&levelId=2100 "Schools Grapple With Columbus' Legacy: Intrepid Explorer or Ruthless Conqueror?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728201853/https://www.edweek.org/login.html?source=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.edweek.org%2Few%2Farticles%2F1991%2F10%2F09%2F06columb.h11.html&destination=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.edweek.org%2Few%2Farticles%2F1991%2F10%2F09%2F06columb.h11.html&levelId=2100 |date=28 July 2020 }}, ''Education Week'', 9 October 1991</ref> As a result of these depredations the population of the Bahamas was severely diminished.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dumene|first1=Joanne E.|year=1990|title=Looking for Columbus|url=http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/DUMENE01.ART|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919070618/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/DUMENE01.ART|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 September 2008|journal=Five Hundred Magazine|volume=2|issue=1|pages=11–15}}</ref>

===Arrival of the English===
The English had expressed an interest in the Bahamas as early as 1629. However, it was not until 1648 that the first English settlers arrived on the islands. Known as the [[Eleutherian Adventurers]] and led by [[William Sayle]], they migrated from [[Bermuda]] seeking greater religious freedom. These English [[Puritans]] established the first permanent European settlement on an island which they named [[Eleuthera]], Greek for ''free''. They later settled [[New Providence]], naming it Sayle's Island. Life proved harder than envisaged however, and many – including Sayle – chose to return to Bermuda.<ref name="Britannica, Bahamas"/> To survive, the remaining settlers [[Wrecking (shipwreck)#The Bahamas|salvaged goods from wrecks]].

In 1670 [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] granted the islands to the [[Lords Proprietors]] of the [[Province of Carolina|Carolinas]] in North America. They rented the islands from the king with rights of trading, tax, appointing [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations|governors]], and administering the country from their base on New Providence.<ref name="Anglican">{{cite web|year=2009|url=http://bahamas.anglican.org/history.php|title=Diocesan History|publisher=Anglican Communications Department|access-date=7 May 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505100933/http://bahamas.anglican.org/history.php|archive-date=5 May 2009}}</ref><ref name="Britannica, Bahamas"/> Piracy and attacks from hostile foreign powers were a constant threat.

During the [[American War of Independence]] in the late 18th century, the islands became a target for US naval forces. Under the command of Commodore [[Esek Hopkins]], [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]], the US Navy occupied Nassau in 1776, before being evacuated a few days later. In 1782 a Spanish fleet appeared off the coast of Nassau, and the city [[Capture of the Bahamas (1782)|surrendered without a fight]]. Later, in April 1783, on a visit made by Prince William of the United Kingdom (later [[King William IV]]) to [[Luis de Unzaga]] at his residence in the Captaincy General of Havana, they made prisoner exchange agreements and also dealt with the preliminaries of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], in which the recently conquered Bahamas would be exchanged for [[Spanish Florida|East Florida]], which would still have to conquer the city of [[St. Augustine, Florida]] in 1784 by order of Luis de Unzaga; after that, also in 1784, the Bahamas would be declared a British colony.<ref>Cazorla, Frank, Baena, Rose, Polo, David, Reder Gadow, Marion (2019) The Governor Louis de Unzaga (1717–1793) Pioneer in the birth of the United States and liberalism, Foundation Malaga, pages 21, 154–155, 163–165, 172, 188–191</ref>

The [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] abolished slave trading to [[British possessions]], including the Bahamas. The United Kingdom pressured other slave-trading countries to also abolish slave-trading, and gave the [[Royal Navy]] the right to intercept ships carrying slaves on the high seas.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Falola|first1=Toyin|last2=Warnock|first2=Amanda|title=Encyclopedia of the Middle Passage|date=2007|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=9780313334801|pages=xxi, xxxiii-xxxiv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UjRYKePKrB8C&pg=PR21|access-date=22 February 2021|archive-date=13 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813212758/https://books.google.com/books?id=UjRYKePKrB8C&pg=PR21|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Lovejoy">{{cite book|last=Lovejoy|first=Paul E.|title=Transformations in Slavery: A History of Slavery in Africa|page=[https://archive.org/details/transformationsi0000love/page/290 290]|location=New York|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=0521780128|url=https://archive.org/details/transformationsi0000love/page/290}}</ref> Thousands of Africans liberated from slave ships by the Royal Navy were resettled in the Bahamas.

In the 1820s during the period of the [[Seminole Wars]] in Florida, hundreds of North American slaves and African Seminoles escaped from [[Cape Florida]] to the Bahamas. They settled mostly on northwest [[Andros Island]], where they developed the village of [[Red Bays, The Bahamas|Red Bays]]. From eyewitness accounts, 300 escaped in a mass flight in 1823, aided by Bahamians in 27 [[sloop]]s, with others using canoes for the journey.

These incidents, in which a total of 447 enslaved people belonging to US nationals were freed from 1830 to 1842, increased tension between the United States and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. They had been co-operating in patrols to suppress the international slave trade. However, worried about the stability of its large domestic slave trade and its value, the United States argued that the United Kingdom should not treat its domestic ships that came to its colonial ports under duress as part of the international trade. The United States worried that the success of the ''Creole'' slaves in gaining freedom would encourage more slave revolts on merchant ships.

The early decades of the 20th century were ones of hardship for many Bahamians, characterised by a stagnant economy and widespread poverty. Many eked out a living via subsistence agriculture or fishing.<ref name="Britannica, Bahamas"/>

In August 1940 the [[Edward VIII|Duke of Windsor]] (formerly King Edward VIII) was appointed [[Governor of the Bahamas]]. He arrived in the colony with his wife, [[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor]]. Although disheartened at the condition of Government House, they "tried to make the best of a bad situation".<ref name="Windsor installed">[[#Higham|Higham]], pp. 300–302</ref> He did not enjoy the position, and referred to the islands as "a third-class British colony".<ref>Bloch, Michael (1982).

The Duke was praised at the time for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands. A 1991 biography by Philip Ziegler, however, described him as contemptuous of the Bahamians and other non-European peoples of the Empire. He was praised for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] in June 1942, when there was a "full-scale riot".<ref name="Windsor unrest">[[#Higham|Higham]], pp. 331–332</ref> Ziegler said that the Duke blamed the trouble on "mischief makers – [[communists]]" and "men of Central European [[Jewish]] descent, who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of draft".<ref name="ziegler">[[Philip Ziegler|Ziegler, Philip]] (1991).

Shortly after independence, the Bahamas joined the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] on 22 August 1973,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bahamas Joins IMF, World Bank|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=23 August 1973|page=C2|url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/148399257|access-date=10 July 2022|archive-date=10 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220710174032/https://www.proquest.com/docview/148399257|id={{ProQuest|148399257}} |url-status=live}}</ref> and later the [[United Nations]] on 18 September 1973.<ref>{{cite news|title=2 Germanys Join U.N. as Assembly Opens 28th Year|first=Robert|last=Alden|work=The New York Times|date=19 September 1973|page=1|url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/119811597|access-date=10 July 2022|archive-date=28 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210628094138/https://www.proquest.com/docview/119811597/|id={{ProQuest|119811597}} |url-status=live}}</ref>

Politically, the first two decades were dominated by Pindling's PLP, who went on to win a string of electoral victories. Allegations of corruption, links with drug cartels and financial malfeasance within the Bahamian government failed to dent Pindling's popularity. Meanwhile, the economy underwent a dramatic growth period fuelled by the twin pillars of tourism and [[offshore finance]], significantly raising the [[standard of living]] on the islands. The Bahamas' booming economy led to it becoming a beacon for immigrants, most notably from [[Haiti]].<ref name="Britannica, Bahamas"/>
