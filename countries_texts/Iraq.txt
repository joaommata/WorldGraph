Within its borders lies the ancient land of [[Sumer]], which emerged between 6000 and 5000 BC during the [[Neolithic]] [[Ubaid period]].<ref name="Kandela-2000" /> Sumer is recognised as the world's earliest civilisation, marking the beginning of urban development, written language, and monumental architecture.<ref name="Kandela-2000" /> Iraq's territory also includes the heartlands of the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]], [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Neo-Sumerian]], [[Babylonia]]n, [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]], and [[Neo-Babylonian]] empires, which dominated Mesopotamia and much of the [[Ancient Near East]] during the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages.<ref name="Kandela-2000" />

The Iraq of antiquity was an innovation stronghold, producing early [[List of languages by first written accounts|written languages]], [[Sumerian literature|literary works]], and significant advancements in [[Babylonian astronomy|astronomy]], [[Babylonian mathematics|mathematics]], [[Babylonian law|law]], and [[Assyro-Babylonian literature#Philosophy|philosophy]]. This era of indigenous rule ended in 539 BC when the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] under [[Cyrus the Great]], who declared himself the "[[King of Babylon]]". The city of [[Babylon]], the ancient seat of Babylonian power, became one of the key capitals of the Achaemenid Empire. Ancient Iraq, known as the Mesopotamia, is home to world's first Jewish diaspora community, which emerged during the Babylonian exile.

The Babylonians were defeated by the Persian Empire, under the leadership of [[Cyrus the Great]]. Following the fall of Babylon, the [[Achaemenid Empire]] took control of the Mesopotamian region. Enslaved Jews were freed from the Babylonian captivity, though many remained in the land and thus the Jewish community grew in the region. Iraq is the location of numerous Jewish sites, which are also revered by the Muslims and Christians.

In the following centuries, the regions constituting modern Iraq came under the control of several empires, including the [[Seleucid Empire|Greeks]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], and [[Roman Empire|Romans]], establishing new centres like [[Seleucia]] and [[Ctesiphon]]. By the [[3rd century]] AD, the region fell under Persian control through the [[Sasanian Empire]], during which time Arab tribes from [[South Arabia]] migrated into Lower Mesopotamia, leading to the formation of the Sassanid-aligned [[Lakhmid kingdom]].

[[File:Abbasid Caliphate 850AD.png|thumb|[[Abbasid Caliphate]] with capitals in Baghdad and [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]] c. 850]]
The Arabic name ''al-ʿIrāq'' likely originated during this period. The Sasanian Empire was eventually [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquered]] by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in the 7th century, bringing Iraq under Islamic rule after the [[Battle of al-Qadisiyyah]] in 636. The city of [[Kufa]], founded shortly thereafter, became a central hub for the Rashidun dynasty until their [[First Fitna|overthrow]] by the [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyads]] in 661. Karbala is considered as one of the holiest cities in Shia Islam, following the [[Battle of Karbala]], which took place in 680.

With the rise of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in the mid-8th century, Iraq became the centre of Islamic rule, with [[Baghdad]], founded in 762, serving as the capital. Baghdad flourished during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], becoming a global hub for culture, science, and intellectualism. However, the city's prosperity declined following the [[Buwayhid]] and [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuq]] invasions in the 10th century and suffered further with the [[Siege of Baghdad|Mongol invasion]] of 1258.

=== Early Modern Period: Ottoman Iraq (1534-1920) ===
{{Main|Ottoman Iraq}}
Iraq was conquered by [[Sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] in 1534 and became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Iraq was a major frontier of the [[Ottoman–Persian Wars|Ottoman–Safavid wars]], with Baghdad changing hands several times until the [[Treaty of Zuhab]] in 1639 confirmed Ottoman control.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Finkel |first=Caroline |title=Osman's Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire |publisher=Basic Books |year=2007 |isbn= |location=New York |page=203}}</ref> Administratively, Iraq was organised into the provinces of [[Baghdad Eyalet|Baghdad]], [[Basra Eyalet|Basra]], [[Mosul Eyalet|Mosul]], and [[Shahrizor Eyalet|Shahrizor]], which the Ottomans collectively referred to as Hıtta-i Irakiyye (“the Iraq region”).<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.devletarsivleri.gov.tr/cdn/file/download?fileId=37 |title=Musul – Kerkük ile İlgili Arşiv Belgeleri (1525–1919) |publisher=T.C.

From 1749 to 1831, Iraq was ruled by a [[Mamluk dynasty (Iraq)|Mamluk dynasty]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] origin with considerable autonomy while maintaining nominal allegiance to the Ottoman sultan.

Iraq remained under Ottoman control until the [[World War I|First World War]], when the British launched the [[Mesopotamian campaign]]. The campaign led to the [[Fall of Baghdad (1917)|occupation of Baghdad]] in 1917, and in 1920 Ottoman Iraq was formally dissolved with the establishment of the [[Mandate for Mesopotamia|British Mandate of Mesopotamia]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fantauzzo |first=Justin |year=2017 |title=The Finest Feats of the War?

=== Modern Iraq ===
{{Main|Mandatory Iraq|Kingdom of Iraq}}
[[File:Nouri_Al-Saeed,_1950s.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nuri al-Said|Nuri Pasha al-Said]] (1888–1958) served eight terms as [[Prime Minister of Iraq|prime minister]] during [[Mandatory Iraq]] and the [[Kingdom of Iraq|Hashemite Kingdom]]]]
Iraq's modern history began in the wake of World War I, as the region emerged from the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name="TK" /> Arab forces, inspired by the promise of independence, had helped dismantle the Ottoman hold on the Middle East, but the dream of a united, sovereign Arab state was soon dashed.<ref name="TK" /> Despite agreements made with [[Hussein bin Ali, King of Hejaz|Hussein bin Ali]], the [[Sharif of Mecca|Sharif of Makkah]], the European powers had different plans for the region. Following the British withdrawal of support for a [[Arab state|unified Arab state]], Hussein's son, [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]], briefly declared the [[Kingdom of Syria]] in 1920, encompassing parts of what are now [[Lebanon]], [[Palestine]], [[Jordan]], and [[Syria]].<ref name="TK" /> However, the kingdom was short-lived, crushed by local opposition and the military might of France, which had been granted a [[Mandatory Syria|mandate over Syria]].<ref name="TK" />

In Iraq, under British mandate, tensions were rising as local forces increasingly resisted foreign control.<ref name="TK" /> A [[Iraqi Revolt|rebellion erupted]], challenging British authority, and the need for a new strategy became clear.<ref name="TK" /> In 1921, the [[Cairo Conference (1921)|Cairo Conference]], led by British officials including [[Winston Churchill]] and [[T. E. Lawrence]], decided that Faisal, now exiled in [[London]], would become the [[king of Iraq]].<ref name="TK" /> This decision was seen as a way to maintain British influence in the region while placating local demands for leadership.<ref name="TK" /> Upon his coronation, he focused on unifying a land formerly divided into three [[Ottoman provinces]]—[[Mosul Province, Ottoman Empire|Mosul]], [[Baghdad Province, Ottoman Empire|Baghdad]], and [[Basra vilayet|Basra]].<ref name="TK" /> He worked hard to gain the support of Iraq's diverse population, including both [[Sunnis]] and [[Shiites]], and paid special attention to the country's Shiite communities, symbolically choosing the date of his coronation to coincide with [[Eid al-Ghadir|Eid al-Ghadeer]], a key day for Shiite Muslims.<ref name="TK" />

His reign laid the foundations of modern Iraq.<ref name="TK" /> Faisal worked to establish key state institutions and fostered a sense of national identity.<ref name="TK" /> His education reforms included the founding of [[Ahl al-Bayt University]] in Baghdad, and he encouraged the migration of Syrian exiles to Iraq to serve as doctors and educators.<ref name="TK" /> Faisal also envisioned infrastructural links between Iraq, Syria, and [[Emirate of Transjordan|Jordan]], including plans for a railway and an [[Kirkuk–Haifa oil pipeline|oil pipeline to the Mediterranean]].<ref name="TK" /> Although Faisal succeeded in securing greater autonomy for Iraq, British influence remained strong, particularly in the country's oil industry.<ref name="TK" /> In 1930, [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930|Iraq signed a treaty with Britain]] that gave the country a measure of political independence while maintaining British control over key aspects, including military presence and oil rights.<ref name="TK" /> By 1932, Iraq gained formal independence, becoming a member of the [[League of Nations]].<ref name="TK" /> Faisal's reign was marked by his efforts to balance the pressures of external influence and internal demands for sovereignty.<ref name="TK" /> He was admired for his diplomatic skill and his commitment to steering Iraq towards self-determination.<ref name="TK" /> Untimely, he died from a heart attack on 8 September 1933, leaving his son [[Ghazi of Iraq|Ghazi]] to inherit the throne.<ref name="TK" /> King Ghazi's reign was brief and turbulent, as Iraq was impacted by numerous coup attempts.<ref name="TK" /> He died in a motor accident in 1939, passing the throne to his young son, [[Faisal II]], who ascended to the throne at just 3 years old.<ref name="TK" /> Faisal II's uncle, [[Abd al-Ilah|Crown Prince Abdullah]], assumed regency until the young king came of age.<ref name="TK" />

On 1 April 1941, [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] and members of the [[Golden Square (Iraq)|Golden Square]] staged a [[1941 Iraqi coup d'état|coup d'état]] and installed a [[Nazism|pro-German]] and [[Fascism|pro-Italian]] government.<ref name="TK" /> During the subsequent [[Anglo-Iraqi War]], the [[United Kingdom]] invaded Iraq for fear that the government might cut oil supplies to [[Western nations]] because of its links to the [[Axis powers]].<ref name="TK" /> The war started on 2 May, and the British, together with loyal [[Assyrian Levies]], defeated the forces of Al-Gaylani, forcing an armistice on 31 May.<ref name="TK" /> Regency of King Faisal II began in 1953.<ref name="TK" /> The hopes for Iraq's future under Faisal II were high, but the nation remained divided.<ref name="TK" /> Iraq's Sunni-dominated monarchy struggled to reconcile the diverse ethnic and religious groups, particularly the Shiite, Assyrian, Jewish and Kurdish populations, who felt marginalised.<ref name="TK" /> In 1958, these tensions culminated in a military coup, inspired by the revolutionary wave sweeping across the Arab world, particularly the [[1952 Egyptian revolution]].<ref name="RF" />

Brigadier General and [[Iraqi nationalism|nationalist]] [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] led a coup d'état known as the [[14 July Revolution]] in 1958.<ref name="RF" /> This revolt was strongly anti-imperial and anti-monarchical in nature and had strong socialist elements.<ref name="RF" /> King [[Faysal II|Faisal II]], Prince [[Abd al-Ilah]], and [[Nuri al-Sa'id]], along with the royal family were killed brutally.<ref name="RF" /> Qasim controlled Iraq through military rule and in 1958 he began a process of forcibly reducing surplus land owned by a few citizens and having the state redistribute the land.<ref name="RF" /> In 1959, [[Abd al-Wahab al-Shawaf]] led an uprising in Mosul against Qasim. The uprising was crushed by the government forces.<ref name="RF" /> He claimed [[Kuwait]] as part of Iraq, when the former was granted independence in 1961.<ref name="RF" /> The [[Operation Vantage|United Kingdom deployed its army]] on the [[Iraq–Kuwait border]], which forced Qasim to back down.<ref name="RF" /> He was overthrown by the Ba'ath Party in [[Ramadan Revolution|February 1963 coup]].<ref name="IA" /> However internal division within Ba'athist factions caused another coup in November, which brought Colonel Abdul Salam Arif to power.<ref name="IA" /> The new regime recognised Kuwait's independence.<ref name="IA" /> After the latter's death in 1966, he was succeeded by his brother, [[Abdul Rahman Arif]].<ref name="IA" /> Under his rule, Iraq participated in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967.<ref name="IA" />

{{Main|Occupation of Iraq (2003–2011)|Iraq War|History of Iraq (2011–present)}}
After the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]], [[George W. Bush]] began planning the overthrow of Saddam in what is now widely regarded as a [[Rationale for the Iraq War|false pretense]].<ref name="www.cfr.org" /> Saddam's Iraq was included in Bush's "[[axis of evil]]". The [[United States Congress|US Congress]] passed [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002|joint resolution]], which authorised the use of armed force against Iraq.<ref name="www.cfr.org" /> In November 2002 the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441|resolution 1441]].<ref name="www.cfr.org" /> On 20 March 2003, the US-led coalition invaded Iraq, as part of [[global war on terror]].<ref name="www.cfr.org" /> Within weeks, coalition forces occupied much of Iraq, with the Iraqi Army adopting guerrilla tactics to confront coalition forces.<ref name="www.cfr.org" /> Following the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|fall of Baghdad]] in the first week of April, Saddam's regime had completely lost control of Iraq.<ref name="www.cfr.org">{{Cite web |title=Timeline: The Iraq War |url=https://www.cfr.org/timeline/iraq-war |access-date=28 July 2024 |website=www.cfr.org}}</ref> A [[Firdos Square statue destruction|statue of Saddam was toppled]] in Baghdad, symbolising the end of his rule.<ref name="www.cfr.org" />

====Insurgency and Civil war====
The [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] began disbanding the Ba'ath Army and expelling Ba'athists from the new government.<ref name="www.cfr.org" /> The insurgents fought against the coalition forces and the newly installed government.<ref name="www.cfr.org" /> Saddam was captured and executed.<ref name="www.cfr.org" /> The Shia–Sunni civil war took place from 2006 to 2008.<ref name="www.cfr.org" /> The coalition forces were accused of war crimes such as the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib torture]], the [[Fallujah killings of April 2003|Fallujah massacre]], the [[Mahmudiyah rape and killings]] and the [[Mukaradeeb wedding party massacre]].<ref name="www.cfr.org" /> Following the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007–2011)|withdrawal of US troops]] in 2011, the occupation ceased and war ended. The war in Iraq has resulted in [[Casualties of the Iraq War|between 151,000 and 1.2 million Iraqis being killed]].<ref name="www.cfr.org" />

The subsequent efforts to rebuild the country amidst sectarian violence was galvanised by continuing discontent over [[Nouri al-Maliki]]'s government, which led to [[2012–2013 Iraqi protests|protests]]. In 2013, taking advantage of the ensuing chaos and popular discontent against the Iraqi government, Ba'athist and other Sunni militants ([[Al Qaida]] and [[Islamic State|ISIS]]) launched a number of attacks against the government during what is known as the [[Anbar campaign (2013–2014)|Anbar campaign]]. What followed, was a large scale [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|offensive]] by ISIS in [[Mosul]], which marked the beginning of the rapid [[Territory of the Islamic State|territorial expansion]] of the group, initiating [[War in Iraq (2013–2017)|full-scale war in Iraq]]. Sunni insurgents belonging to the Islamic State group seized control of large swathes of land including several major cities, like [[Tikrit]], [[Fallujah]] and Mosul, creating hundreds of thousands of [[internally displaced persons]] amid reports of atrocities by ISIS fighters. An estimated 500,000 civilians fled from Mosul. Around 5,000 Yazidis were killed in the genocide by ISIS, as a part of the war. In June 2014, Iraq's leading Shii Grand Ayatollah, [[Ali al-Sistani]] issued a [[Fatwa]] calling on able-bodied men to join the Armed Forces to fight against ISIS. Even though the Fatwa specifically instructed Iraqis to join the official Armed Forces of the country (such as the Army or the Police), it nevertheless resulted in the creation of the [[Popular Mobilisation Forces]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tcf.org/content/commentary/the-man-who-saved-iraq/ |title=The Man Who Saved Iraq |publisher=The Century Foundation}}</ref> During that time, the government of Iraq, headed by [[Haider al-Abadi]] requested the international community to assist Iraq against ISIS, resulting in the creation of the [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–2021)|American-led Coalition against ISIS]]. Meanwhile, in an attempt to counter US influence, [[Khomeinism|Khomeinist]] anti-US militias prompted [[Iranian intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|Iranian intervention]], which resulted in the latter expanding its influence. The Iraqi armed forces, supported by the US-led coalition, as well as the Popular Mobilisation Forces, [[Peshmerga]] and other allied anti-ISIS militias then initiated a counter-offensive to retake and liberate ISIS-held territory. In December 2017, when ISIS had lost all its territory in Iraq, the government declared victory.

====2019-2021 protests====
{{main|2019–2021 Iraqi protests}}
One of the main causes for popular discontent in Iraq is the lack of reliable electricity infrastructure and clean water. The electrical grid faces systemic pressures due to climate change, fuel shortages, and an increase in demand.<ref name="nbcnews.com" /><ref name="DW" /><ref name="Rodgers-2023" /> Corruption remains endemic throughout Iraqi governance while the United States-endorsed sectarian political system has driven increased levels of violent terrorism and sectarian conflicts.<ref name="nytimes.com" /><ref name="Karam" /><ref name="Rodgers-2023" /> Climate change is driving wide-scale droughts while water reserves are rapidly depleting.<ref name="Lukas" /> Nationwide protests erupted in Iraq in October 2019, demanding systemic reform, and the end of the party-based quota system as well as the disarmament of non-state militias and end to foreign interference. Despite heavy repression, hundreds of deaths, and widespread injuries, the movement remained united around calls for institutional reform and increased accountability.
