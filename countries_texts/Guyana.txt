===Before colonisation===
What is now Guyana has been inhabited for millennia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caribbean.loopnews.com/content/discoverguyana-indigenous-peoples-guyana|title=#DiscoverGuyana: Indigenous Peoples in Guyana {{pipe}} Loop Caribbean News|website=Loop News|access-date=18 September 2023|archive-date=28 June 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240628023001/https://caribbean.loopnews.com/content/discoverguyana-indigenous-peoples-guyana|url-status=live}}</ref> Nine [[Indigenous peoples in Guyana|indigenous]] tribes reside in Guyana: the [[Wai-wai people|Wai Wai]], [[Macushi]], [[Patamona people|Patamona]], [[Lokono]], [[Kalina people|Kalina]], [[Wapishana]], [[Pemon]], [[Akawaio people|Akawaio]], and [[Warao people|Warao]]. Many of these peoples practised [[shifting agriculture]] alongside [[hunting]]. Historians speculate that the Arawaks and Caribs originated in the South American hinterland and migrated northward, first to the present-day Guianas and then to the Caribbean islands. The Arawak, mainly cultivators, hunters, and fishermen, migrated to the Caribbean islands before the Carib and settled throughout the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amerindian.gov.gy/discover/tribes/index.html|title=Ministry of Amerindian Affairs – Georgetown, Guyana|publisher=Amerindian.gov.gy|access-date=30 March 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602173603/http://www.amerindian.gov.gy/discover/tribes/index.html|archive-date=2 June 2013}}</ref>

===Colonial period===
Although [[Christopher Columbus]] was the first European to sight Guyana during his third voyage (in 1498), and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] wrote an account in 1596, the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to establish colonies: [[Pomeroon (colony)|Pomeroon]] (1581), [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] (1616), [[Berbice]] (1627), and [[Demerara]] (1752). After France invaded the Dutch Republic ([[Batavian Republic|1795]]), the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] assumed control in 1796, with the Dutch and British signing the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]] in London that ceded [[Demerara-Essequibo]] and Berbice to Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.san.beck.org/13-1a-SouthAmerica.html#a11|title=South America 1744–1817 by Sanderson Beck|access-date=24 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101025206/http://www.san.beck.org/13-1a-SouthAmerica.html#a11|archive-date=1 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1831, the united colonies of Demerara-Essequibo and separate colony of Berbice together became a single British colony known as [[British Guiana]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-03-11 |title=Guyana - Colonialism, Independence, Culture {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Guyana/History |access-date=2025-03-13 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>

Since its independence in 1824, Venezuela has claimed the area of land to the west of the [[Essequibo River]]. [[Simón Bolívar]] wrote to the British government warning against the Berbice and Demerara settlers settling on land which the Venezuelans, as assumed heirs of Spanish claims on the area dating to the 16th century, claimed was theirs. In 1899, an international tribunal ruled that the land belonged to Great Britain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XXVIII/331-340.pdf|title=Award regarding the Boundary between the Colony of British Guiana and the United States of Venezuela, decision of 3 October 1899<!-- Bot generated title -->|access-date=2 February 2020|archive-date=30 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200730180322/https://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XXVIII/331-340.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> From the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]], the British inherited [[Dutch colonisation of the Guianas|Dutch territory]] which included lands between the [[Orinoco river|Orinoco]] and [[Courantyne River|Courantyne]] rivers.

===Independence===
Guyana achieved independence from the United Kingdom as a dominion on 26 May 1966 and became a republic on 23 February 1970, remaining a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hope |first=Kempe Ronald |date=1985 |title=Electoral politics and political development in post-independence Guyana |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0261379485900319 |journal=Electoral Studies |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=57–68 |doi=10.1016/0261-3794(85)90031-9 |issn=0261-3794|url-access=subscription }}</ref> Shortly after independence, [[Venezuela]] began to take diplomatic, economic, and military action against Guyana to enforce its [[Guyana–Venezuela territorial dispute|territorial claim to the Essequibo region]].<ref name=":56">{{Cite journal|last=Ince|first=Basil A.|date=1970|title=The Venezuela-Guyana Boundary Dispute in the United Nations|journal=Caribbean Studies|volume=9|issue=4|pages=5–26}}</ref> Five months after Guyana's independence, in October 1966, Venezuelan troops crossed the international border and seized [[Ankoko Island]] which has been under occupation ever since.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://guyanachronicle.com/2018/04/06/guyana-wants-icj-to-order-venezuela-off-ankoko|title=Guyana wants ICJ to order Venezuela off Ankoko|date=6 April 2018|website=The Guyana Chronicle|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> Venezuelan troops quickly made military installations and an airstrip.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Latin America and Caribbean Contemporary Record: 1982-1983, Volume 2|last=Hopkins|first=Jack W.|publisher=Holmes & Meier Publishers|year=1984|isbn=9780841909618}}</ref>

Following independence, [[Forbes Burnham]] of the [[People's National Congress Reform|People's National Congress]] rose to power, quickly becoming a repressive authoritarian leader.<ref name="bulkan2021">{{cite journal|last1=Bulkan|first1=Arif|last2=Trotz|first2=Alissa|date=2021|title=Oil Fuels Guyana's Internecine Conflict|journal=[[Current History]]|volume=120|issue=823|pages=71–77|doi=10.1525/curh.2021.120.823.71|doi-access=free|issn=0011-3530}}</ref> Politics became divided on race with the Afro-Guyanese supporting Burnham's [[People's National Congress Reform|People's National Congress]] and the Indo-Guyanese supporting [[Cheddi Jagan]]'s [[People's Progressive Party/Civic|People's Progressive Party]], in what became known as ''aapan [[Jāti|jaat]]'' politics, loosely translated from [[Caribbean Hindustani#Guyanese Hindustani|Guyanese Hindustani]] as "for your own kind".

Guyana was elected three times as a member of the [[UN Security Council]] in 1975–76, 1982–83 and 2024–25.

In 1978, a total of 918 people died at the [[Jonestown|Jonestown mass murder-suicide]] led by American cult leader [[Jim Jones]] at a remote settlement in northwest Guyana.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Inside the Jonestown massacre - CNN.com|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/11/12/jonestown.factsheet/index.html|access-date=2022-09-27|website=CNN|archive-date=27 September 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220927223540/https://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/11/12/jonestown.factsheet/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Former U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] visited Guyana to lobby for the resumption of free elections. On 5 October 1992, a new National Assembly and regional councils were elected in the first Guyanese election since 1964 to be internationally recognised as free and fair. [[Cheddi Jagan]] of the PPP was elected and sworn in as president on 9 October 1992.<ref name="ciawfguy">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/guyana/|title=Guyana|website=The World Factbook|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|access-date=12 July 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230619025448/https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/guyana/|archive-date=19 June 2023|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="bulkan2021" /> This reversed the monopoly that Afro-Guyanese traditionally had over Guyanese politics. The poll was marred by violence however.

In May 2008, President [[Bharrat Jagdeo]] was a signatory to the [[UNASUR Constitutive Treaty]] of the Union of South American Nations. The Guyanese government officially ratified the treaty in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://guyanachronicle.com/2016/12/08/unasur-indifference-to-guyana/|title=UNASUR indifference to Guyana|website=Guyana Chronicle|date=9 December 2016|access-date=2 April 2021|archive-date=17 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417173233/https://guyanachronicle.com/2016/12/08/unasur-indifference-to-guyana/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2015, major oil reserves were discovered off the coast by [[ExxonMobil]].

In March 2020, President [[David A. Granger]] narrowly lost the [[2020 Guyanese general election|snap elections]], following Granger's government loss of a vote of no confidence back in 2018. Granger refused to accept the results, but eventually five months later, [[Irfaan Ali]] of the [[People's Progressive Party/Civic]] was sworn in as the new president because of allegations of fraud and irregularities.<ref>{{cite news|title=Guyana swears in Irfaan Ali as president after long stand-off|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-53637085|work=BBC News|date=3 August 2020|access-date=2 April 2021|archive-date=3 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803201857/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-53637085|url-status=live}}</ref>
