At the time, people used containers made of stone, gyps, and burnt lime ([[White Ware|Vaisselle blanche]]). The discovery of [[obsidian]] tools from [[Anatolia]] are evidence of early trade. The ancient cities of [[Hamoukar]] and [[Emar]] played an important role during the late Neolithic and Bronze Age. Archaeologists have demonstrated that civilization in Syria was one of the most ancient on earth, perhaps preceded by only that of [[Mesopotamia]].

By the 21st century BC, Hurrians settled in the northern east parts of Syria while the rest of the region was dominated by the [[Amorites]]. Syria was called the Land of the Amurru (Amorites) by their Assyro-Babylonian neighbors. The Northwest Semitic [[Amorite language]] is the earliest attested of the [[Canaanite languages]]. [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] reemerged during this period until conquered by [[Hammurabi]] of Babylon. [[Ugarit]] also arose during this time, circa 1800 BC, close to modern [[Latakia]]. [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] was a Semitic language loosely related to the Canaanite languages and developed the [[Ugaritic alphabet]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0_KnI588AnkC&pg=PA22|title=The Early Alphabet|first=John F.|last=Healey|page=22|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-07309-8}}</ref> considered to be the world's earliest known alphabet.

The Egyptians initially occupied much of the south, while the Hittites and the Mitanni occupied much of the north. However, Assyria eventually gained the upper hand, destroying the Mitanni Empire and annexing huge swathes of territory previously held by the Hittites and Babylon.

Around the 14th century BC, various [[Semitic people]] appeared in the area, such as the semi-nomadic [[Suteans]] who came into an unsuccessful conflict with Babylonia to the east, and the [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] speaking [[Arameans]] who subsumed the earlier Amorites. They too were subjugated by Assyria and the Hittites for centuries. The Egyptians fought the Hittites for control over western Syria; the fighting reached its zenith in 1274 BC with the [[Battle of Kadesh]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOxnM3WJYJgC&pg=PA475|title=The Philosophy of Historiography|first=John|last=Lange|year=2006|publisher=Open Road Integrated Media, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-61756-132-0|page=475}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EClaAtUb2TAC&pg=PA23|title=Ramses II and His Time|first=Immanuel|last=Velikovsky|page=23|isbn=978-1-906833-74-9|year=2010|publisher=Paradigma}}</ref> The west remained part of the Hittite empire until its destruction {{c.|1200 BC}},<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1A0OgvXfHlQC&pg=PA24|title=Ugarit in Retrospect|first=Douglas|last=Frayne|page=23,24,25|isbn=978-0-931464-07-2|year=1981|publisher=Eisenbrauns}}</ref> while eastern Syria largely became part of the Middle Assyrian Empire,<ref>Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq, 3rd ed., Penguin Books, London, 1991, p.381</ref> who also annexed much of the west during the reign of [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] 1114–1076 BC. With the destruction of the Hittites and the decline of Assyria in the late 11th century BC, the Aramean tribes gained control of much of the interior, founding states such as [[Bit Bahiani]], [[Aram-Damascus]], [[Hamath]], [[Aram-Rehob]], [[Aram-Naharaim]], and [[Luhuti]]. From this point, the region became known as [[Aramea]] or [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]. There was also a synthesis between the Semitic Arameans and the remnants of the Indo-European Hittites, with the founding of a number of [[Syro-Hittite]] states centered in north central Aram (Syria) and south central Asia Minor (modern Turkey), including [[Palistin]], [[Carchemish]] and [[Sam'al]].

A [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] group known as the [[Phoenicians]] came to dominate the coasts of Syria, (and also Lebanon and northern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]) from the 13th century BC, founding [[city states]] such as [[Amrit]], [[Simyra]], [[Arwad]], [[Arab al-Mulk|Paltos]], [[Latakia#Ancient settlement and founding|Ramitha]], and [[Tell Sukas|Shuksi]].<ref>Meir Edrey (2019).

Germany: Ugarit-Verlag – Buch- und Medienhandel Münster. pp. 23–24. {{ISBN|978-3-86835-282-5}}</ref> From these coastal regions, they eventually spread their influence throughout the [[Mediterranean]], including building colonies in [[Malta]], Sicily, the [[Iberian peninsula]], and the coasts of North Africa and most significantly, founding the major city-state of [[Carthage]] in the 9th century BC, which was much later to become the center of a major empire, rivaling the [[Roman Republic]].

Syria and the western half of [[Near East]] then fell to the vast [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (911 BC – 605 BC). The Assyrians introduced [[Imperial Aramaic]] as the [[lingua franca]] of their empire. This language was to remain dominant in Syria and the entire [[Near East]] until after the [[Islamic]] conquest in the 7th and 8th centuries AD, and was to be a vehicle for the spread of Christianity.<ref>Bedford, Peter R.

During the fall of Assyria, the [[Scythians]] ravaged and plundered much of Syria. The last stand of the Assyrian army was at [[Carchemish]] in northern Syria in 605 BC. The Assyrian Empire was followed by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (605 BC – 539 BC). During this period, Syria became a battle ground between Babylonia and another former Assyrian colony, that of Egypt. The Babylonians, like their Assyrian relations, were victorious over Egypt.

[[File:The story of the ancient nations - a text-book for high schools (1912) (14766210391).jpg|thumb|[[Antioch]] in Syria became the capital of the Hellenistic [[Seleucid Empire]] in 240 BC]]
Lands that constitute modern-day Syria were part of the Neo-Babylonian Empire and had been annexed by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 539 BC. Led by [[Cyrus the Great]], the Achaemenid Persians retained [[Imperial Aramaic]] as one of the diplomatic languages of their empire, as well as the Assyrian name for the new [[satrapy]] of Aram/Syria [[Eber-Nari]]. Syria was conquered by the [[Macedonian Empire]] which was ruled by [[Alexander the Great]] {{c.|330 BC}} and consequently became [[Coele-Syria]] province of the [[Seleucid Empire]] (323 BC – 64 BC), with the Seleucid kings styling themselves "King of Syria" and the city of Antioch being its capital starting from 240 BC. Thus, it was the Greeks who introduced the name "Syria" to the region. Originally an Indo-European corruption of "Assyria" in northern Mesopotamia (Iraq), the Greeks used this term to describe not only Assyria itself but also the lands to the west which had for centuries been under Assyrian dominion.<ref name="Rollinger" /> Thus in the [[Greco-Roman]] world both the [[Arameans]] of Syria and the [[Old Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]] of Mesopotamia (modern day [[Iraq]]) to the east were referred to as "Syrians" or "Syriacs", despite these being distinct peoples in their own right, a confusion which would continue into the modern world. Eventually parts of southern [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] Syria were taken by the [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Hasmonean dynasty]] upon the slow disintegration of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] Empire.

Syria briefly came under [[Armenians|Armenian]] control from 83 BC, with the conquests of the Armenian king [[Tigranes the Great]], who was welcomed as a savior from the Seleucids and Romans by the Syrian people. However, [[Pompey the Great]], a general of the [[Roman Empire]], rode to Syria and captured Antioch and turned Syria into a [[Roman Syria|Roman province]] in 64 BC, thus ending Armenian control over the region which had lasted two decades. Syria prospered under Roman rule, being strategically located on the [[Silk Road]], which gave it massive wealth and importance, making it the battleground for the rivaling Romans and Persians.

[[Palmyra]], a rich and sometimes powerful native Aramaic-speaking kingdom, arose in northern Syria in the 2nd century; the Palmyrene established a trade network that made the city one of the richest in the Roman Empire. In the late 3rd century the Palmyrene king [[Odaenathus]] defeated the Persian emperor [[Shapur I]] and controlled the entirety of the Roman East while his successor and widow [[Zenobia]] established the [[Palmyrene Empire]], which briefly conquered Egypt, Syria, Palestine, much of Asia Minor, Judah and Lebanon, before being finally brought under Roman control in 273.

Prior to the [[Early Muslim conquests|Arab Islamic Conquest]] in the 7th century, the bulk of the population were Arameans, but Syria was also home to [[Greek people|Greek]] and Roman ruling classes, Assyrians still dwelt in the north east, Phoenicians along the coasts, and Jewish and Armenian communities were also extant in major cities, with Nabateans and pre-Islamic [[Arabs]] such as the [[Lakhmids]] and [[Ghassanids]] dwelling in the deserts of southern Syria. [[Syriac Christianity]] had taken hold as the major religion, although others still followed [[Judaism]], [[Mithraism]], [[Manicheanism]], [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman Religion]], [[Canaanite Religion]] and [[Mesopotamian Religion]].

Syrians held considerable power during the [[Severan dynasty]]. The matriarch of the family and empress of Rome as wife of emperor [[Septimius Severus]] was [[Julia Domna]], a Syrian from the city of [[Emesa]] (modern day [[Homs]]), [[Royal family of Emesa|whose family]] held hereditary rights to the priesthood of the god [[El-Gabal]]. Her great nephews, also Arabs from Syria, would also become Roman emperors, the first being [[Elagabalus]] and the second his cousin [[Alexander Severus]]. Another Roman emperor who was a Syrian was [[Philip the Arab]] (Marcus Julius Philippus), who was born in [[Arabia Petraea|Roman Arabia]]. He was emperor from 244 to 249<ref name="Cavendish Corporation 2006 183" /> and ruled briefly during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. During his reign, he focused on his home town of Philippopolis (modern day [[Shahba]]) and began many construction projects to improve the city, most of which were halted after his death.

Syria is significant in the [[history of Christianity]]; Saul of Tarsus, better known as the [[Apostle Paul]], was [[Conversion of Paul the Apostle|converted on the road to Damascus]] and emerged as a significant figure in the Christian Church at Antioch in ancient Syria.

By 640, Syria [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|was conquered]] by the [[Rashidun army]] led by [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]]. In the mid-7th century, the [[Umayyad dynasty]] placed the capital of the empire in Damascus. The country's power declined during later Umayyad rule; this was mainly through totalitarianism, corruption and the resulting revolutions. The Umayyad dynasty was overthrown in 750 by the [[Abbasid dynasty]], which moved the capital of empire to [[Baghdad]].

Sections of Syria were held by French, English, Italian and German overlords between 1098 and 1189 during the [[Crusades]] and were known collectively as the [[Crusader states]], among which the primary one in Syria was the [[Principality of Antioch]]. The coastal mountainous region was occupied in part by the [[Nizaris|Nizari Ismailis]], the so-called [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], who had intermittent confrontations and truces with the Crusader States. Later in history when "the Nizaris faced renewed Frankish hostilities, they received timely assistance from the Ayyubids."<ref>Farhad Daftary. ''A Short History of the Ismailis.'' 1998, Edinburg, UK. Edinburg University Press. Page 146.</ref> After a century of Seljuk rule, Syria was largely conquered (1175–1185) by the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] liberator [[Saladin|Salah ad-Din]], founder of the [[Ayyubid]] dynasty of Egypt. [[Siege of Aleppo (1260)|Aleppo fell]] to the [[Mongols]] of [[Hulegu]] in January 1260; Damascus fell in March, but then Hulegu was forced to break off his attack to return to China to deal with a succession dispute.

A few months later, the [[Mamluk]]s arrived with an army from Egypt and defeated the Mongols in the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in [[Galilee]]. The Mamluk leader, [[Baibars]], made Damascus a provincial capital. When he died, power was taken by [[Qalawun]]. In the meantime, an emir named [[Sunqur al-Ashqar]] had tried to declare himself ruler of Damascus, but he was defeated by Qalawun on 21 June 1280 and fled to northern Syria. Al-Ashqar, who had married a Mongol woman, appealed for help from the Mongols. The Mongols of the [[Ilkhanate]] took Aleppo in October 1280, but Qalawun persuaded Al-Ashqar to join him, and they fought against the Mongols on 29 October 1281 in the [[Second Battle of Homs]], which was won by the Mamluks.<ref>{{cite book|title=Timeframe AD 1200–1300: The Mongol Conquests|publisher=Time-Life Books|year=1989|isbn=978-0-8094-6437-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mongolconquestst00time/page/59 59–75]|url=https://archive.org/details/mongolconquestst00time/page/59}}</ref> In 1400, the Muslim [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turco-Mongol]] conqueror [[Tamurlane]] invaded Syria, in which he [[Sack of Aleppo (1400)|sacked Aleppo]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1433425|title=Battle of Aleppo|publisher=Everything2.com|date=22 February 2003|access-date=25 January 2013|archive-date=26 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626194212/http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1433425|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Siege of Damascus (1400)|captured Damascus]] after defeating the Mamluk army.

In 1516, the [[Ottoman Empire]] invaded the [[Mamluk Sultanate|Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt]], conquering Syria and incorporating it into its empire. The Ottoman system was not burdensome to Syrians because the Turks respected Arabic as the language of the [[Quran]] and accepted the mantle of defenders of the faith. Damascus was made the major entrepot for [[Mecca]], and as such it acquired a holy character to Muslims, because of the beneficial results of the countless pilgrims who passed through on the [[hajj]].<ref name="Syria – Ottoman Empire">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/syria/7.htm|title=Syria – Ottoman|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|access-date=25 January 2013|archive-date=5 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105005145/http://countrystudies.us/syria/7.htm|url-status=live}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>

Ottoman administration followed a system that led to peaceful coexistence. Each ethno-religious minority—Arab [[Shia Muslim]], Arab [[Sunni Muslim]], [[Syriac Orthodox]], [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Maronite Christians]], [[Assyrian Christians]], [[Armenians]], [[Kurds]] and [[Jews]]—constituted a [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]].<ref>a b Stanford J. Shaw, "Dynamics of Ottoman Society and administration", in "History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey"</ref> The religious heads of each community administered all personal status laws and performed certain civil functions as well.<ref name="Syria – Ottoman Empire" /> In 1831, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]] renounced his loyalty to the empire and overran [[Ottoman Syria]], capturing Damascus. His short-term rule over the domain attempted to change the demographics and social structure of the region: he brought thousands of Egyptian villagers to populate the plains of [[southern Syria]], rebuilt [[Jaffa]] and settled it with veteran Egyptian soldiers aiming to turn it into a regional capital, and he crushed peasant and Druze rebellions and deported non-loyal tribesmen. By 1840, however, he had to surrender the area back to the Ottomans. From 1864, [[Tanzimat]] reforms were applied on Ottoman Syria, carving out the provinces (vilayets) of [[Aleppo Vilayet|Aleppo]], [[Sanjak of Zor|Zor]], [[Beirut Vilayet|Beirut]] and [[Damascus Vilayet]]; [[Mutasarrifate of Mount Lebanon]] was created, and soon after the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]] was given a separate status.

During [[World War I]], the Ottoman Empire entered the conflict as a [[Central Powers|Central Power]]. It ultimately suffered defeat and loss of control of the entire [[Near East]] to the [[British Empire]] and [[French colonial empire|French Empire]]. During the conflict, genocide against indigenous Christian peoples was carried out by the Ottomans and their allies in the form of the [[Armenian genocide]] and [[Sayfo|Assyrian genocide]], of which [[Deir ez-Zor]] in Ottoman Syria was the final destination of these death marches.<ref>"Pouring a People into the Desert:The "Definitive Solution" of the Unionists to the Armenian Question", Fuat Dundar, ''A Question of Genocide'', ed.

Initially, the two territories were separated by a border that ran in an almost straight line from Jordan to Iran. However, the discovery of oil in the region of [[Mosul]] just before the end of the war led to yet [[1918 Clemenceau–Lloyd George Agreement (Middle East)|another negotiation with France in 1918]] to cede this region to the British zone of influence, which was to become Iraq. The fate of the intermediate province of Zor was left unclear; its [[Occupation of Zor|occupation by Arab nationalists resulted in its attachment to Syria]]. This border was recognized internationally when Syria became a [[League of Nations]] mandate in 1920<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/III_-_Protmand_modifie_mandat.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626065208/http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/III_-_Protmand_modifie_mandat.pdf|archive-date=26 June 2008|title=Mandat Syrie-Liban|access-date=25 January 2013|language=fr}}</ref> and has not changed to date.

In 1920, a short-lived independent [[Arab Kingdom of Syria|Kingdom of Syria]] was established under [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal I]] of the [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] family. However, his rule over Syria ended after only a few months, following the [[Battle of Maysalun]]. French troops occupied Syria later that year after the [[San Remo conference]] proposed that the [[League of Nations]] put Syria under a French mandate. General Gouraud had according to his secretary de Caix two options: "Either build a Syrian nation that does not exist... by smoothing the rifts which still divide it" or "cultivate and maintain all the phenomena, which require our arbitration that these divisions give". De Caix added "I must say only the second option interests me". This is what Gouraud did.<ref>{{cite book|first=James|last=Barr|title=a line in the sand.

In 1925, [[Sultan al-Atrash]] led [[Great Syrian Revolt|a revolt]] that broke out in the [[Jabal al-Druze|Druze Mountain]] and spread to engulf the whole of Syria and parts of Lebanon. Al-Atrash won several battles against the French, notably the [[Battle of al-Kafr]] on 21 July 1925, the [[Battle of al-Mazraa]] on 2–3 August 1925, and the battles of Salkhad, [[al-Musayfirah]] and Suwayda. France sent thousands of troops from Morocco and Senegal, leading the French to regain many cities, although resistance lasted until the spring of 1927. The French sentenced al-Atrash to death, but he had escaped with the rebels to Transjordan and was eventually pardoned. He returned to Syria in 1937 after the signing of the Syrian-French Treaty.

Syria and France negotiated a [[Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence (1936)|treaty of independence]] in September 1936, and [[Hashim al-Atassi]] was the first president to be elected under the first incarnation of the modern republic of Syria. However, the treaty never came into force because the French Legislature refused to ratify it. With the fall of France in 1940 during [[World War II]], Syria came under the control of [[Vichy France]] until the British and Free French occupied the country in the [[Syria-Lebanon campaign]] in July 1941. Continuing pressure from Syrian nationalists and the British [[Levant Crisis|forced the French]] to evacuate their troops in April 1946, leaving the country in the hands of a republican government that had been formed during the mandate.<ref name="USDOS">{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/syria/85051.htm|title=Background Note: Syria|work=[[United States Department of State]], Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, May 2007|access-date=21 May 2019|archive-date=22 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722082421/https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/syria/85051.htm|url-status=live}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>

Syria seceded from the union with Egypt on 28 September 1961, after a [[1961 Syrian coup d'état|coup]] and terminated the political union.

==== Land reform ====
Agrarian reform measures were introduced which consisted of three interrelated programs: legislation regulating the relationship between agriculture laborers and landowners; legislation governing the ownership and use of private and state domain land and directing the economic organization of peasants; and measures reorganizing agricultural production under state control.<ref>Heydemann, Steven. Authoritarianism in Syria. Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1999. Print. Pg.110</ref> Despite high levels of inequality in land ownership these reforms allowed for more progress in redistribution of land from 1958 to 1961 than any other reforms in Syria's history, since independence.

The first law passed (Law 134; passed 4 September 1958) was in response to concern about peasant mobilization and expanding peasants' rights.<ref name="Heydemann, Steven 19992">Heydemann, Steven. Authoritarianism in Syria. Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1999.

==== Rise and fall of Islamic State and factional escalation ====

[[File:Destroyed_neighborhood_in_Raqqa.png|thumb|IS's capital [[Raqqa]] suffered extensive damage during the [[Battle of Raqqa (2017)|battle of Raqqa]] in June–October 2017]]
Taking an advantage of ongoing civil war, the [[Islamic State|Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]] (ISIS) won many battles against the rebel factions and the Syrian government in 2014. ISIS was able to seize control of large parts of Eastern Syria, prompting a United States-led coalition to launch an [[War against the Islamic State|aerial bombing campaign]] against ISIS, while providing [[US intervention in the Syrian civil war|ground support]] and supplies to the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] (SDF), a Kurdish-dominated coalition led by the [[People's Defense Units]] (YPG).

In August 2016, Turkey launched a [[Turkish involvement in the Syrian civil war|multi-pronged invasion]] of northern Syria, in response to the creation of the Kurdish-led [[Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria|Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria]], also known as Rojava, while also fighting ISIS and government forces in the process. During this time, Turkey helped establish the [[Syrian National Army]] (SNA) out of remnants of the Free Syrian Army. [[Iranian intervention in the Syrian civil war|Iran]] and later Russia also [[Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war|intervened]] in the civil war on behalf of the Assad government to help defeat ISIS and attack both SDF and SNA. The ISIS eventually lost its territory after the [[Fall of Mosul|fall of IS in Mosul]] and increasingly resorted to more terror bombings and insurgency operations that continues in present.

==== Rebel offensive and fall of the Ba'athist regime ====

In December 2024, violence flared up once again.

The strikes, which targeted population centers and several hospitals in [[Idlib insurgency|rebel-held]] city of [[Idlib]], resulted in at least 25 deaths according to the White Helmets rescue group. NATO issued a joint statement calling for the protection of civilians and critical infrastructure to prevent further displacement and ensure humanitarian access. They stressed the urgent need for a Syrian-led political solution, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2254, which advocates for dialogue between the Syrian government and opposition forces.
