Several cities were founded along the coast by [[Phoenicia]]ns. Trading outposts and colonies were established by [[Greek colonisation|Greeks]] in the East. Eventually, Phoenician-[[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] expanded inland towards the meseta. Due to the bellicose inland tribes, the Carthaginians settled on the coasts of the Iberian Peninsula.

During the [[Second Punic War]], roughly between 210 and 205&nbsp;BCE, the expanding [[Roman Republic]] captured Carthaginian trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast.

Hispania, the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula, served as a granary for the Roman market, and its harbours exported gold, [[wool]], [[olive oil]], and wine. Agricultural production increased with the introduction of irrigation projects, some of which remain in use. Emperors [[Hadrian]], [[Trajan]], [[Theodosius I]], and the philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] were born in Hispania.{{efn|The poets [[Martial]], [[Quintilian]] and [[Lucan]] were also born in Hispania.}} Christianity was introduced into Hispania in the 1st century CE, and it became popular in the cities in the 2nd century.<ref name="country" /> Most of Spain's present languages and religions, as well as the basis of its laws, originate from this period.<ref name="hispania" /> Starting in 170 CE, incursions of North-African [[Mauri]] in the province of [[Hispania Baetica|Baetica]] took place.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://repositorio.iaph.es/bitstream/11532/327602/1/Contribuci%C3%B3n%20al%20estudio%20de%20las%20invasiones%20mauritanas.pdf|chapter=Contribución al estudio de las invasiones mauritanas de la Bética en el siglo II|first=Carlos|last=Alonso Villalobos|year=1984|publisher=Sociedad Española de Estudios Clásicos|title=Actas del II Congreso Andaluz deEstudios Clásicos|volume=II|access-date=5 July 2022|archive-date=5 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220705191228/https://repositorio.iaph.es/bitstream/11532/327602/1/Contribuci%C3%B3n%20al%20estudio%20de%20las%20invasiones%20mauritanas.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]], together with the [[Sarmatian]] [[Alans]], entered the peninsula after 409, weakening the Western Roman Empire's jurisdiction over Hispania. The Suebi established a kingdom in north-western Iberia. The Vandals established themselves in the south of the peninsula by 420, before crossing over to North Africa in 429. As the western Roman empire disintegrated, the social and economic base became greatly simplified. The successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire, including Christianity and assimilation into the evolving Roman culture.

The [[Byzantine]]s established an occidental province, [[Spania]], in the south, with the intention of reviving Roman rule throughout Iberia. Eventually, however, Hispania was reunited under [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic rule]].

=== Muslim era and ''Reconquista'' ===
{{See also|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Al-Andalus|Reconquista}}
From 711 to 718, as part of the expansion of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] which had [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|conquered North Africa]] from the [[Byzantine Empire]], nearly all of the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by Muslims from across the Strait of Gibraltar, resulting in the collapse of the Visigothic Kingdom. Only a small area in the mountainous north of the peninsula stood out of the territory seized during the initial invasion. The [[Kingdom of Asturias|Kingdom of Asturias-León]] consolidated upon this territory. Other Christian kingdoms, such as [[kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] in the mountainous north, eventually surged upon the consolidation of counties of the Carolingian ''[[Marca Hispanica]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rinehart|first1=Robert|last2=Seeley|first2=Jo Ann Browning|title=A Country Study: Spain – Castile and Aragon|publisher=Library of Congress Country Series|year=1998|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+es0016)|access-date=9 August 2008|archive-date=22 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922142215/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+es0016)|url-status=live}}</ref> For several centuries, the fluctuating frontier between the Muslim and Christian-controlled areas of the peninsula was along the [[Ebro]] and [[Douro]] valleys.

Muslim strongholds in the [[Guadalquivir Valley]] such as Córdoba (1236) and [[Seville]] (1248) fell to Castile in the 13th century. The [[County of Barcelona]] and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] entered in a dynastic union and gained territory and power in the Mediterranean.

Through exploration and conquest or royal marriage alliances and inheritance, the [[Spanish Empire]] expanded across vast areas in the Americas, the Indo-Pacific, Africa as well as the European continent, including holdings in the Italian Peninsula, the [[Low Countries]] and the [[Franche-Comté]]. The so-called [[Age of Discovery]] featured explorations by sea and by land, the opening-up of new [[trade route]]s across oceans, conquests and the beginnings of European [[colonialism]]. [[Precious metal]]s, spices, luxuries, and previously unknown plants brought to the metropole played a leading part in transforming the European understanding of the globe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Hugh|author-link=Hugh Thomas (writer)|title = Rivers of gold: the rise of the Spanish Empire|publisher=George Weidenfeld & Nicolson|year=2003|location=London|page=passim|isbn=978-0-297-64563-4}}</ref>

The cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. The expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the Americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from Europe devastated American indigenous populations. The rise of [[humanism]], the [[Counter-Reformation]] and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the [[School of Salamanca]], which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as [[international law]] and human rights.
Spain's 16th-century maritime supremacy was demonstrated by the victory over the [[Ottoman Empire]] at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571 and over Portugal at the [[Battle of Vila Franca do Campo|Battle of Ponta Delgada]] in 1582, and then after the setback of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588, in a series of victories against [[England]] in the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)|Anglo-Spanish War of 1585–1604]]. In the middle decades of the 17th century, Spain's maritime power went into a long decline with mounting defeats against the [[Dutch Republic]] ([[Battle of the Downs]]) and then England in the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1654–1660)|Anglo-Spanish War of 1654–1660]]. By the 1660s, Spain was struggling to defend its overseas possessions from pirates and privateers.

The 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the Spanish empire. The predominant economic policy was an interventionist one, and the State also pursued policies aiming towards infrastructure development as well as the abolition of internal customs and the reduction of export tariffs.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/5589876.pdf|chapter=El Despotismo Ilustrado en España: entre la continuidad y el cambio|author-link=Carlos Martínez Shaw|first=Carlos|last=Martínez Shaw|title=El Siglo de las Luces: III Centenario del Nacimiento de José de Hermosilla (1715-1776)|year=2016|isbn=978-84-608-8037-0|page=14|publisher=Sociedad Extremeña de Historia|access-date=13 April 2022|archive-date=19 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220419023430/https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/5589876.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> Projects of agricultural colonisation with new settlements took place in the south of mainland Spain.{{Sfn|Martínez Shaw|2016|pp=14; 23}} [[Enlightenment in Spain|Enlightenment]] ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom's elite and monarchy.

In 1793, Spain went to war against the revolutionary new [[First French Republic|French Republic]] as a member of [[War of the First Coalition|the first Coalition]]. The subsequent [[War of the Pyrenees]] polarised the country in a reaction against the [[Francization|gallicised]] elites and following defeat in the field, peace was made with France in 1795 at the [[Peace of Basel]] in which Spain lost control over two-thirds of the island of [[Hispaniola]]. In 1807, a secret treaty between [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against Britain and Portugal. French troops entered the country to invade Portugal but instead occupied Spain's major fortresses. The Spanish king abdicated and a puppet kingdom satellite to the French Empire was installed with [[Joseph Bonaparte]] as king.

The [[Dos de Mayo Uprising|2 May 1808 revolt]] was one of many uprisings across the country against the French occupation.<ref>David A. Bell.

During the war, in 1810, a revolutionary body, the [[Cortes of Cádiz]], was assembled to coordinate the effort against the Bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution.<ref>{{cite book|author= Alvar Ezquerra, Jaime|title=Diccionario de historia de España|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l4JQIkW1yrsC&pg=PA209|year=2001|publisher=[[Ediciones Akal]]|isbn=978-84-7090-366-3|page=209}} Cortes of Cádiz (1812) was the first parliament of Spain with sovereign power</ref> It met as one body, and its members represented the entire Spanish empire.<ref>{{cite book|title=Independence of Spanish America|last=Rodríguez|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://www.google.es/search?tbm=bks&hl=es&q=%22It+met+as+one+body%2C+and+its+members+represented+the+entire+Spanish+world%22&btnG=|quote=It met as one body, and its members represented the entire Spanish world|access-date=20 June 2013|archive-date=10 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200310230600/https://www.google.es/search?tbm=bks&hl=es&q=%22It+met+as+one+body%2C+and+its+members+represented+the+entire+Spanish+world%22&btnG=|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1812, a [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|constitution]] for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared, but after the fall of the Bonapartist regime, the Spanish king dismissed the Cortes Generales, set on ruling as an [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]].

The French occupation of mainland Spain created an opportunity for overseas [[Criollo people|''criollo'']] elites who resented the privilege towards [[Peninsulars|Peninsular elites]] and demanded [[retroversion of the sovereignty to the people]]. Starting in 1809 the American colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence, leading to the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] that put an end to the metropole's grip over the [[Spanish Main]]. [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Attempts to re-assert control]] proved futile with opposition not only in the colonies but also in the Iberian peninsula and army revolts followed. By the end of 1826, the only American colonies Spain held were [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]] and [[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]]. The Napoleonic War left Spain economically ruined, deeply divided and politically unstable. In the 1830s and 1840s, [[Carlism]] (a reactionary legitimist movement supportive of an alternative Bourbon branch), fought against the government forces supportive of Queen [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]]'s dynastic rights in the [[Carlist Wars]]. Government forces prevailed, but the conflict between [[Progressive Party (Spain)|''progressives'']] and ''[[Moderate Party (Spain)|moderates]]'' ended in a weak early constitutional period. The 1868 [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Glorious Revolution]] was followed by the 1868–1874 progressive ''[[Sexenio Democrático]]'' (including the short-lived [[First Spanish Republic]]), which yielded to a stable monarchic period, the [[Restoration (Spain)|Restoration]] (1875–1931).<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eX7cXu4N2AUC&pg=PA33|page=33|title=Elecciones y cultura política en España e Italia (1890–1923)|editor-first=Rosa Ana|editor-last=Gutiérrez|editor-first2=Rafael|editor-last2=Zurita|editor-first3=Renato|editor-last3=Camurri|publisher=[[University of Valencia|Universitat de València]]|location=Valencia|year=2003|isbn=84-370-5672-1|chapter=Caciquismo y mundo rural durante la Restauración|first=Salvador|last=Cruz Artacho|access-date=13 September 2020|archive-date=12 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230912033420/https://books.google.com/books?id=eX7cXu4N2AUC&pg=PA33|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the Philippines and Cuba. In 1895 and 1896 the [[Cuban War of Independence]] and the [[Philippine Revolution]] broke out and eventually<!--For whatever reasons; it is not for here to go into long explanations!--> the United States became involved. The [[Spanish–American War]] was fought from April to August 1898 and resulted in Spain losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of North Africa. ''El Desastre'' (the Disaster), as the war became known in Spain, gave added impetus to the [[Generation of '98]]. Although the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity, the 20th century brought little social peace. Spain played a minor part in the [[scramble for Africa]]. It remained neutral [[Spain during World War I|during World War I]]. The heavy losses suffered by the colonial troops in conflicts in northern Morocco against Riffians forces brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy.

Industrialisation, the development of railways and incipient capitalism developed in several areas of the country, particularly in [[Barcelona]], as well as [[labour movement]] and socialist and anarchist ideas. The [[1870 Barcelona Workers' Congress]] and the [[1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition]] are good examples of this. In 1879, the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] was founded. A trade union linked to this party, [[Unión General de Trabajadores]], was founded in 1888. In the anarcho-syndicalist trend of the labour movement in Spain, [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] was founded in 1910 and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] in 1927. Catalanism and Vasquism, alongside other nationalisms and regionalisms in Spain, arose in that period: the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] formed in 1895 and [[Regionalist League of Catalonia]] in 1901. Political corruption and repression weakened the democratic system of the constitutional monarchy of a two-parties system.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oligarquía y caciquismo, Colectivismo agrario y otros escritos: (Antología)|last=Costa|first=Joaquín|author-link=Joaquín Costa}}</ref> The July 1909 [[Tragic Week (Spain)|Tragic Week]] events and repression exemplified the social instability of the time.

After a period of Crown-supported dictatorship from 1923 to 1931, the first elections since 1923, largely understood as a plebiscite on Monarchy, took place: the [[1931 Spanish local elections|12 April 1931 municipal elections]]. These gave a resounding victory to the Republican-Socialist candidacies in large cities and provincial capitals, with a majority of monarchist councilors in rural areas. The king left the country and the proclamation of the Republic on 14 April ensued, with the formation of a provisional government. A [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|constitution]] for the country was passed in October 1931 following the [[1931 Spanish general election|June 1931 Constituent general election]], and a series of cabinets presided by [[Manuel Azaña]] supported by republican parties and the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] followed. In the election held in 1933 the right triumphed and in 1936, the left. During the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] there was a great political and social upheaval, marked by a sharp radicalisation of the left and the right. Instances of political violence during this period included the burning of churches, the [[Sanjurjada|1932 failed coup d'état led by José Sanjurjo]], the [[Revolution of 1934]] and numerous attacks against rival political leaders. On the other hand, it is also during the Second Republic when important reforms to modernise the country were initiated: a democratic constitution, agrarian reform, restructuring of the army, political decentralisation and [[Women's suffrage|women's right to vote]].

=== Civil War and Francoist dictatorship ===
{{Main|Spanish Civil War|Spanish Revolution of 1936|Francoist Spain}}

[[File:Reemplazo republicano.jpg|thumb|Republican volunteers at [[Teruel]], 1936]]
[[File:Meeting at Hendaye (en.wiki).jpg|thumb|right|Spanish leader [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] at the [[Meeting at Hendaye]], 1940]]

The Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936: on 17 and 18 July, part of the military [[Spanish coup of July 1936|carried out a coup d'état]] that triumphed in only part of the country. The situation led to a civil war, in which the territory was divided into two zones: one [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|under the authority of the Republican government]], that counted on outside support from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Mexico]] (and from [[International response to the Spanish Civil War#International Brigades|International Brigades]]), and the other controlled by the putschists (the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist or rebel faction]]), most critically supported by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]]. The Republic was not supported by the Western powers due to the British-led policy of [[non-intervention]]. General [[Francisco Franco]] was sworn in as the supreme leader of the rebels on 1 October 1936. An uneasy relationship between the Republican government and the grassroots anarchists who had initiated a partial [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|social revolution]] also ensued.

The civil war was viciously fought and there were [[Spanish Civil War#Atrocities|many atrocities committed by all sides]]. The [[Spanish Civil War|war]] claimed the lives of over 500,000 people and caused the flight of up to a half-million citizens from the country.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_corrisedrespondent/2809025.stm Spanish Civil War fighters look back]{{Dead link|date=December 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, BBC News, 23 February 2003</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/3998443/Relatives-of-Spaniards-who-fled-Franco-granted-citizenship.html|title=Relatives of Spaniards who fled Franco granted citizenship|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 December 2008|access-date=18 January 2014|location=London|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723074619/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/3998443/Relatives-of-Spaniards-who-fled-Franco-granted-citizenship.html|archive-date=23 July 2013 }}</ref> On 1 April 1939, five months before the beginning of [[World War II]], the rebel side led by Franco emerged victorious, imposing a dictatorship over the whole country. Thousands were imprisoned after the civil war in [[Francoist concentration camps]].

The regime remained nominally "[[neutrality (international relations)|neutral]]" for much of the Second World War, although it was [[Spain in World War II|sympathetic]] to [[Axis Powers|the Axis]] and provided the Nazi [[Wehrmacht]] with [[Blue Division|Spanish volunteers in the Eastern Front]]. The only legal party under Franco's dictatorship was the [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS]] (FET y de las JONS), formed in 1937 upon the merging of the Fascist [[Falange Española de las JONS]] and the Carlist traditionalists and to which the rest of right-wing groups supporting the rebels also added. The name of "[[Movimiento Nacional]]", sometimes understood as a wider structure than the FET y de las JONS proper, largely imposed over the later's name in official documents along the 1950s.

After the war Spain was politically and economically isolated, and was kept out of the United Nations. This changed in 1955, during the [[Cold War]] period, when it became strategically important for the US to establish a military presence on the Iberian Peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the Soviet Union into the Mediterranean basin. US Cold War strategic priorities included the dissemination of American educational ideas to foster modernisation and expansion.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Óscar |first1=Martín García |title=Soft Power, Modernization, and Security: US Educational Foreign Policy Toward Authoritarian Spain in the Cold War |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=May 2023 |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=198–220 |doi=10.1017/heq.2023.5|s2cid=258190145 |hdl=10251/201668 |hdl-access=free  | issn = 0018-2680 }}</ref> In the 1960s, Spain registered an [[Spanish miracle|unprecedented rate of economic growth]] which was propelled by [[Spanish miracle#Industrialization|industrialisation]], a mass internal migration from rural areas to [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and the creation of a mass tourism industry. Franco's rule was also characterised by [[Francoist Spain#Fascism and authoritarianism|authoritarianism]], [[Francoist Spain#Spanish nationalism|promotion of a unitary national identity]], [[National Catholicism]], and [[Language policies of Francoist Spain|discriminatory language policies]].

During the 1980s the democratic restoration made possible a growing open society. New cultural movements based on freedom appeared, like [[La Movida Madrileña]]. In May 1982 Spain joined [[NATO]], followed by [[1986 Spanish NATO membership referendum|a referendum]] after a strong social opposition. That year the [[Spanish Socialist Workers Party]] (PSOE) came to power, the first left-wing government in 43 years. In 1986 Spain joined the [[European Economic Community]], which later became the [[European Union]]. The PSOE was replaced in government by the [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]] (PP) in 1996 after scandals around participation of the government of [[Felipe González]] in the [[GAL (paramilitary group)|Dirty war against ETA]].

===Economic prosperity and crash===

On 1 January 2002, Spain fully adopted the [[euro]], and Spain experienced strong economic growth, well above the EU average during the early 2000s. However, well-publicised concerns issued by many economic commentators at the height of the boom warned that extraordinary property prices and a high foreign trade deficit were likely to lead to a painful economic collapse.<ref>{{cite news|author=Pfanner, Eric|date=11 July 2002|title=Economy reaps benefits of entry to the 'club': Spain's euro bonanza|work=International Herald Tribune |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-a10_18.html?scp=1&sq=Economy%20reaps%20benefits%20of%20entry%20to%20the%20%27club%27%20:%20Spain%27s%20euro%20bonanza&st=cse|access-date=9 August 2008|url-status=live|archive-date=1 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501090321/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-a10_18.html?scp=1&sq=Economy%20reaps%20benefits%20of%20entry%20to%20the%20%27club%27%20:%20Spain%27s%20euro%20bonanza&st=cse}} See also: {{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=9118701|title=Spain's economy / Plain sailing no longer|newspaper=The Economist|date=3 May 2007|access-date=9 August 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613212911/http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=9118701|archive-date=13 June 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>
