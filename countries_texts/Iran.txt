==== Achaemenid Empire ====
{{Main|Achaemenid Empire}}
[[File:Achaemenid Empire at its greatest extent according to Oxford Atlas of World History 2002.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Achaemenid Empire]], or the First Persian Empire, at its greatest extent]]

The [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenids]] united all [[Persians|Persian]] tribes under [[Cambyses I]]. Under his son, [[Cyrus the Great]], the Achaemenids defeated the Medes and established the [[Achaemenid Empire]],{{Sfn|Middleton|2015|p=148}} the largest-ever Iranian state.{{Sfn|Shenkar|2014|p=5}} Cyrus conquered the [[Lydia]]n and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] empires, creating an empire far larger than Assyria. His son, [[Cambyses II]] ({{Reign}}530–522 BC), conquered the last major power of the region, [[ancient Egypt]], causing the collapse of its [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|twenty-sixth dynasty]].

After the death of Cambyses II, [[Darius the Great]] ({{Reign}}522–486) ascended the throne by overthrowing the Achaemenid monarch [[Bardiya]]. Darius' first capital was at Susa, and he started the building program at [[Persepolis]]. He improved the extensive road system, and during his reign the first recorded mentions are made of the [[Royal Road]], a highway from Susa to [[Sardis]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/forgottenempire/persia/darius.html |title=Forgotten Empire— the world of Ancient Persia |publisher=The British Museum |year=2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423012310/http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/forgottenempire/persia/darius.html |archive-date=23 April 2007 |access-date=16 March 2023}}</ref>

In 499 BC, [[Classical Athens|Athens]] supported a revolt in [[Miletus]], resulting in the sacking of Sardis. This led to the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], which lasted the first half of the 5th century BC. In the [[First Persian invasion of Greece]], Persian general [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] re-subjugated Thrace and made Macedon a full part of Persia.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|p=345}} Darius' successor [[Xerxes I]] ({{Reign}}486–465) launched the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]]. At a crucial moment in the war, about half of mainland Greece was overrun by the Persians, including territories to the north of the Isthmus of [[Corinth]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Carey |first1=Brian Todd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3OSfBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT32 |title=Warfare in the Ancient World |last2=Allfree |first2=Joshua B. |last3=Cairns |first3=John |date=19 January 2006 |publisher=Pen and Sword |isbn=978-1-84884-630-2 |language=en}}</ref>{{Sfn|Aeschylus|2009|p=18}} This was reversed by a Greek victory following the battles of [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]] and [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], during which Persia lost its footholds in Europe, and withdrew from it.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|pp=135–138, 342–345}}

The empire entered a period of decline. From 334 BC to 331 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] defeated [[Darius III]] ({{Reign}}336–330 BC) in the battles of [[Battle of the Granicus|Granicus]], [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] and [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]], swiftly conquering the Achaemanid Empire by 331 BC. Alexander's empire collapsed after his death; his general, [[Seleucus I Nicator]], tried to take control of Iran, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Syria]], and [[Anatolia]]. His empire was the [[Seleucid Empire]].

[[File:The Sasanian Empire at its apex under Khosrow II.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Sasanian Empire]] at its greatest extent {{Circa|620}}, under the reign of [[Khosrow II]]]]

The [[Parthian Empire]] endured for five centuries, but civil wars destabilized it. Parthian power evaporated when [[Ardashir I]] revolted against the Arsacids and killed their last ruler, [[Artabanus IV of Parthia|Artabanus IV]], in 224 AD. Ardashir established the [[Sasanian Empire]], which ruled Iran and much of [[Near East]] before the [[Early Muslim conquests|Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century AD.{{Sfn|Shahbazi|2005}}

At their zenith, the Sasanians controlled all of modern-day Iran and Iraq and parts of the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|Arabian Peninsula]], as well as the [[Caucasus]], the [[Levant]], and parts of [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Khosrow II (590–628 CE) |url=https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/23003#:~:text=It%20was%20under%20Khosrow%20II,the%20early%20seventh%20century%20CE. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240619204859/https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/23003#:~:text=It%20was%20under%20Khosrow%20II,the%20early%20seventh%20century%20CE. |archive-date=19 June 2024 |access-date=27 February 2025 |language=en |url-status=live}}</ref> The strong economic conditions left by Parthians allowed the Sasanians to build a powerful and distinctive economic state whose reputation spread well beyond its political frontiers and time.{{Sfn|Gyselen|1997}} The Sasanian Empire was characterized by a complex and centralized government bureaucracy and the revitalization of [[Zoroastrianism]] as a legitimizing and unifying ideal.{{Sfn|Eiland|2004|p=81}}

=== Medieval period ===
After the fall of the Sasanian Empire in 651, the [[Arabs]] of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] adopted many Persian customs, especially the administrative and the court mannerisms. Arab provincial governors were either Persianized [[Arameans]] or ethnic Persians; Persian remained the official language of the caliphate until the adoption of Arabic toward the end of the 7th century.{{Sfn|Hawting|1986|p=63–64}} However, Iran was still not entirely under Arab control; the [[Daylam]] region was under the control of the [[Daylamites]], [[Tabaristan]] was under [[Dabuyid dynasty|Dabuyid]] and [[Paduspanids|Paduspanid]] control, and [[Mount Damavand]] under [[Masmughans of Damavand|Masmughan]] control. Arabs had invaded these regions several times but the regions' inaccessible terrain prevented a decisive result. The most prominent ruler of the Dabuyids, [[Farrukhan the Great]] ({{Reign}}712–728), managed to hold his domains during his long struggle against the Arab general [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]], who was defeated by a combined Daylamite–Dabuyid army and forced to retreat from Tabaristan.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|pp=312–313}}

==== Iranian Intermezzo ====
{{Main|Iranian Intermezzo}}
[[File:Saffarids 900ad.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Saffarid dynasty]] in 900 AD]]
[[File:Iran circa 1000AD.png|thumb|upright=1.2|A map of Iranian dynasties in the mid 10th-century]]

Anti-Umayyad insurrections were supported by non-Arab Islamic converts, who were resentful over being relegated to lower social standing. In 747–750, one of these insurrections grew into the [[Abbasid revolution]], in which descendants of Muhammad's uncle, [[Abbas ibn Ali|Abbas]], overthrew the Umayyads.{{Sfn|Osman|2014|pp=62–63}} The political authority of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid caliphs]] diminished over the course of the 9th and 10th centuries.{{Sfn|Lorentz|2007|p=xxviii}} This led to the establishment of several independent Iranian dynasties,{{Sfn|Lorentz|2007|p=xxviii}} the ousting of Arab rulers from their scattered bastions across the country, and an Iranian cultural renaissance.{{Sfn|Mahendrarajah|2019}} The period between the collapse of Abbasid authority and the conquest of Iran by the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]] in the 11th century is referred to as the "[[Iranian Intermezzo]]."{{Sfn|Mahendrarajah|2019}}

The Iranian Intermezzo saw the rise and fall of several major and minor dynasties.{{Sfn|Mahendrarajah|2019}} Among the most important of these overlapping dynasties were the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (821–873); the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarids]] in [[Sistan]] (861–1003); and the [[Samanid Empire|Samanids]] (819–1005), originally at [[Bukhara]]. The Samanids eventually ruled an area from central Iran to Pakistan. By early 10th century, the Abbasids almost lost control to the growing Iranian faction known as the [[Buyid dynasty]] (934–1062). Since much of the Abbasid administration had been Persian, the Buyids were quietly able to assume real power in Baghdad. The Buyids were defeated in the mid-11th century by the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuq Turks]], who continued to exert influence over the Abbasids. From the empire's inception, the Seljuk rulers minted coins with the title ''šāhānšāh'' ({{Literal translation|King of Kings}}) in its Persian form,{{sfn|Barthold|1962|p=108}} perhaps adopting it from the Buyids.{{Sfn|Blair|1992|p=6}} The Seljuk Empire fractured after the death of [[Ahmad Sanjar]] in 1157.

The [[Islamization of Iran]] was a long process. As Persian Muslims consolidated their rule, the Muslim population rose from approximately 40% in the mid-9th century to close to 90% by the end of the 11th century. Historian [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] suggests that the rapid increase in conversion was aided by the Persian nationality of the rulers.<ref>Nasr, Hoseyn; Islam and the pliqht of modern man</ref> Although Persians adopted the religion of their conquerors, over the centuries they worked to protect and revive their distinctive language and culture, a process known as [[Persianization]].

Over the following decades, further conquests followed, culminating in the [[Siege of Baghdad|fall of Baghdad]] and end of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]'s rule in 1258.{{Sfn|Lane|2012|p=250}}[[File:MongolMap.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Ilkhanate was one of the four major [[Division of the Mongol Empire|divisions of the Mongol Empire]] after the death of Genghis Khan]]
After the death of [[Möngke Khan]], the [[Mongol Empire]] was fractured by civil war, both over the succession of the next Great Khan and between nomadic traditionalists and the new settled princes of China and the Middle East. [[Kublai Khan]] was eventually universally recognized, but the empire was irreversibly fragmented.{{Sfn|Lane|2012|p=250}} In much of the southwest of the empire, including Iran, power fell to [[Hulegu Khan]],{{Sfn|Rossabi|2002|p=32}} who had been made a deputy there under Möngke Khan.{{Sfn|Lane|2012|p=250}} Hulegu was accepted as a legitimate ruler in Iran and was legitimized through a ''[[fatwa]]'' issued by the Shia scholar [[Ali ibn Tawus al-Hilli]].{{Sfn|Lane|2012|pp=253–254, 256}} Iran experienced a cultural renaissance under [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanid]] rule.{{Sfn|Lane|2012|pp=253–254, 256}} [[Ghazan Khan]] converted to Islam in the late 13th century, turning the state further away from the other Mongol realms.{{Sfn|Rossabi|2002|p=32}}

After Ghazan's nephew [[Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan|Abu Said]] died in 1335, the Ilkhanate lapsed into civil war and was divided between several petty dynasties – most prominently the [[Jalayirids]], [[Muzaffarids (Iran)|Muzaffarids]], [[Sarbadars]] and [[Kartids]]. The mid-14th-century [[Black Death]] killed about 30% of the country's population.<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/interrogatory/kelly200509140843.asp Q&A with John Kelly on The Great Mortality on National Review Online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109165503/http://www.nationalreview.com/interrogatory/kelly200509140843.asp |date=9 January 2009 }}.</ref>

[[File:Safavid Empire 1501 1722 AD.png|thumb|[[Safavid Iran]] (1501–1722) at its greatest extent]]

The [[Safavid Iran|Safavid Empire]], founded by [[Ismail I]] (r. 1505–1524), is often considered the beginning of modern Iranian history.{{Sfn|Matthee|2008}} While Safavid Iran predated the concept of the nation-state as such, it established the basis for the modern state of Iran.{{Sfn|Matthee|2008}}{{Sfn|Brown|2011|p=432}} The [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] dynastic period was one of the most important Iranian history, as it reunified Iran as a cohesive entity under native rule and established Shia Islam as the [[State religion|official religion]].{{Sfn|Savory|Karamustafa|1998|p=}} The Safavids ruled from 1501 to 1722, and experienced a brief restoration from 1729 to 1736.

The Safavid state had a complex bureaucratic system of checks and balances, which ensured transparency and prevented fraud. However, this system was intended not to equalize power between branches of government, but to ensure total power of the shah. Legitimized by his bloodline as a [[sayyid]], or descendant of Muhammad, the shah monitored the actions of government officials through reports provided by the superintendent of each department. [[Jean Chardin]], French merchant and eventual ambassador to Iran, wrote that the Safavid shahs ruled their land with an iron fist and often in a [[Despotism|despotic]] manner.<ref>Ferrier, R. W.; A Journey to Persia: Jean Chardin's Portrait of a Seventeenth-century Empire; pp. 71–71.</ref>[[File:Afsharid Iran 1741.png|thumb|The [[Afsharid Iran]] at its greatest extent in 1741–1745 under [[Nader Shah]]]]
Complex rivalries in the region of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] led to the Afghan [[Hotak dynasty]] invading Iran. In 1722, this conflict led to the collapse of the Safavid Empire after the [[siege of Isfahan]].{{Sfn|Matthee|2008}}{{Sfn|Aghaie|2012|p=306}} The brief interlude between 1722 and the rise of the [[Qajar dynasty]] in 1789–1796 was marked by widespread political turmoil in Iran and several rival attempts to establish power over the country. The Safavids failed to regain power and the Hotaks failed to establish control. The rival [[Afsharid Iran|Afsharid]] and [[Zand dynasty|Zand]] dynasties were established by [[Nader Shah]] ({{Reign}}1736–1747) and [[Karim Khan Zand|Karim Khan]] ({{Reign}}1751–1779), respectively.{{Sfn|Aghaie|2012|p=306}}

==== Nader Shah and the shifting balance of power ====

Nader Shah has been described as "the last great Asiatic military conqueror," and compared by some historians to Napoleon and Alexander the Great.<ref>''Cambridge History of Iran'' Vol. 7, p. 59.</ref>{{sfn|Axworthy|2008|p=xvii}} His numerous campaigns created a great empire that, at its maximum extent, briefly encompassed all or part of modern-day Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Georgia, India, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Oman, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, the [[North Caucasus]], and the [[Persian Gulf]].

Nader Shah's death was followed by a [[Division of the Afsharid Empire|period of anarchy]] in Iran as rival army commanders fought for power. Nader's own family, the Afsharids, lost all but a small domain in Khorasan. The Zand family seized control of much of Iran in the 1750s.{{Sfn|Baker|2005|p=13}} The Zand rulers never proclaimed themselves to be ''shah''s, but as [[regent]]s of Iran.{{Sfn|Baker|2005|p=13}}''{{Sfn|Perry|2000}}'' They first staked their claim to power on behalf of the Safavid puppet [[Ismail III]] ({{Reign}}1750–1773) and then on behalf of the Iranian people.{{Sfn|Baker|2005|p=13}}''{{Sfn|Perry|2000}}''

==== Rise of the Qajar dynasty and foreign interference ====
The Qajar dynasty gradually increased in power as they clashed with the Afsharids and the Zands for control of the land, culminating in [[Agha Mohammad Shah]] proclaiming himself ruler in 1789.{{sfn|Perry|1984}} Agha Mohammad defeated the Zand dynasty in 1794 and was officially crowned in 1796.{{Sfn|Baker|2005|p=13}}{{sfn|Perry|1984}} Shortly thereafter, he captured and deposed the Afsharid Shahrokh Shah, reunifying Iran under a single ruler.{{sfn|Perry|1984}}

In the 19th century, Iran lost significant territories in the [[Caucasus]] to the [[Russian Empire]] following the [[Russo-Persian Wars]].{{Sfn|Dowling|2014|p=728–729}} Meanwhile, [[United Kingdom|Britain]] became involved in [[southern Iran]] to counter Russia's presence in the north, which posed a threat to [[British India]].{{sfn|Amanat|2002}} Amid this struggle for power, drought, shifting agricultural priorities, and poor governance culminated in the [[Persian famine of 1870–1872|Great Persian Famine of 1870–1871]].

==== World War II and post-occupation instability ====
Due in part to Nazi Germany's [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]], the Iranian government expected Germany to win the war and establish a powerful force on the Russian-Iranian border. Iran rejected British and Soviet demands to expel German residents from its borders. In response, the two [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] invaded in August 1941 and easily overwhelmed the weak Iranian army in [[Operation Countenance]]. Iran became the major conduit of Allied [[Lend-Lease]] aid to the Soviet Union. The purpose was to secure Iranian oil fields and ensure Allied supply lines through the [[Persian Corridor]]. Iran remained officially neutral. Reza Shah was deposed during the subsequent occupation and replaced with his young son [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]].<ref>Richard Stewart, ''Sunrise at Abadan: the British and Soviet invasion of Iran, 1941'' (1988).</ref> At the 1943 [[Tehran Conference]], the Allied "Big Three"—[[Joseph Stalin]], [[Franklin D.

In 1951, under Prime Minister [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]], the Iranian parliament voted to nationalize the British-owned oil industry, leading to the [[Abadan Crisis]]. Despite British pressure, including an economic blockade, nationalization continued. Mosaddegh was removed from power in 1952 but was quickly re-appointed by the Shah, due to a popular uprising in support of the premier. He forced the Shah into a brief exile in August 1953 after a failed military coup by [[Imperial Guard (Iran)|Imperial Guard]] Colonel [[Nematollah Nassiri]].

On 19 August, a successful [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|coup]] was headed by retired army general [[Fazlollah Zahedi]], aided by the US ([[CIA]])<ref name=BBC>{{cite news |title=CIA documents acknowledge its role in Iran's 1953 coup |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23762970 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=20 August 2013 |archive-date=9 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210309131918/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23762970 |url-status=live}}</ref> and the British ([[MI6]]), known as Operation Ajax and Operation Boot to the respective agencies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kinzer |first=Stephen |title=The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and Their Secret World War |publisher=Times Books |location=New York |year=2013}}</ref> The coup—with a [[black propaganda]] campaign  against Mosaddegh<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gölz |first=Olmo |date=1 January 2019 |title=Gölz "The Dangerous Classes and the 1953 Coup in Iran: On the Decline of 'lutigari' Masculinities."

[[Fazlollah Zahedi|Zahedi]] succeeded him as prime minister and suppressed opposition to the Shah, specifically from the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] and the communist [[Tudeh Party]].

From that time until the revolution, Iran was ruled as an autocracy under the Shah, with strong American support. Iran initiated economic, social, agrarian, and administrative reforms to modernize the country, which became known as the [[White Revolution]]. Many Islamic leaders criticized these initiatives, and the land reform had mixed results.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/White-Revolution |title=White Revolution (Iran) &#124; History, Significance, & Effects &#124; Britannica |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=3 December 2022}}</ref> By 1978, the Shah had become wildly unpopular among the Iranian people.

On 31 March 1979, a [[1979 Iranian Islamic Republic referendum|referendum]] was held on whether to transition from a government of monarchy to an [[Islamic republic]].

Iraqi leader [[Saddam Hussein]] attempted to take advantage of the disorder of the revolution, the weakness of the Iranian military and the revolution's antagonism against Western governments. On 22 September 1980, the Iraqi army [[Iraqi invasion of Iran|invaded Iran]] at [[Khuzestan province|Khuzestan]], precipitating the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. The attack took revolutionary Iran by surprise. Although Hussein's forces made early advances, Iranian forces pushed the Iraqi army back into Iraq by 1982.
