The [[Sasanian Empire]] turned [[Caucasian Albania]] into a [[vassal state]] in 252, while King [[Urnayr]] officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Christianity: The Biography: 2000 Years of Global History|last=Shaw|first=Ian|publisher=Zondervan Academic|year=2017|isbn=978-0-310-53628-4}}</ref> Despite Sassanid rule, Caucasian Albania remained an entity in the region until the 9th century, while fully subordinate to Sassanid Iran, and retained its monarchy. Despite being one of the chief vassals of the Sasanian emperor, the Albanian king had only a semblance of authority, and the Sasanian [[marzban]] (military governor) held most civil, religious, and military authority.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Ehsan Yarshater]] |date=1983 |title=The Cambridge history of Iran, Volume 1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=141 |isbn=978-0-521-20092-9}}</ref>

In the first half of the 7th century, Caucasian Albania, as a vassal of the Sasanians, came under nominal Muslim rule with the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] repulsed both the Sasanians and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] from the [[South Caucasus]] and turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state after Christian resistance led by King [[Juansher]] was suppressed in 667. The power vacuum left by the decline of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the [[Sallarid dynasty|Sallarids]], [[Sajid dynasty|Sajids]], and [[Shaddadids]]. At the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by the waves of migrating [[Oghuz Turks]] from Central Asia, who adopted a [[Turkoman (ethnonym)|Turkoman]] [[ethnonym]] at the time.<ref>Barthold, V.V. ''Sochineniya''; p. 558: "Whatever the former significance of the Oghuz people in Eastern Asia, after the events of the 8th and 9th centuries, it focuses more and more on the West, on the border of the Pre-Asian cultural world, which was destined to be invaded by the Oghuz people in the 11th century, or, as they were called only in the west, by the Turkmen."</ref> The first of these Turkic dynasties established was the [[Seljuk Empire]], which entered the area by 1067.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPrjCwAAQBAJ&q=Tughril+and+Chaghri+Seljuk+Empire&pg=PA6|title=Court and Cosmos: The Great Age of the Seljuqs|last1=Canby|first1=Sheila R.|last2=Beyazit|first2=Deniz|last3=Rugiadi|first3=Martina|last4=Peacock|first4=A.

[[File:Map Safavid persia.png|thumb|Having ended the rule of the [[Shirvanshahs]] in 1538, [[Tahmasp I]] established [[Shirvan]] (in present-day Azerbaijan) as an administrative unit of the [[Safavid Iran]].]]
[[Shirvanshahs]], the local dynasty of Arabic origin that was later Persianized, became a vassal state of [[Timurid Empire]] of [[Timur]] and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the [[Golden Horde]] [[Tokhtamysh]]. Following Timur's death, two independent and rival Turkoman states emerged: [[Qara Qoyunlu]] and [[Aq Qoyunlu]]. The Shirvanshahs returned, maintaining for numerous centuries to come a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals as they had done since 861. In 1501, the [[Safavid dynasty]] of Iran subdued the Shirvanshahs and gained its possessions.

Returning to Tehran in the spring of 1795, he assembled a force of some 60,000 cavalries and infantry and in Shawwal Dhul-Qa'da/May, set off for Azarbaijan, intending to conquer the country between the rivers Aras and Kura, formerly under Safavid control. This region comprised a number of khanates of which the most important was ''Qarabagh'', with its capital at Shusha; Ganja, with its capital of the same name; Shirvan across the Kura, with its capital at Shamakhi; and to the north-west, on both banks of the Kura, Christian Georgia (Gurjistan), with its capital at Tiflis.
