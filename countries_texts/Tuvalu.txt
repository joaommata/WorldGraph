===Prehistory===
The [[History of the Polynesian people|origins of the people of Tuvalu]] are addressed in the theories regarding the migration into the Pacific that began about 3,000 years ago. During pre-European-contact times, there was frequent canoe voyaging between the nearer islands including Samoa and [[Tonga]].<ref name=Howe>{{cite book |last=Howe |first=Kerry |title=The Quest for Origins |year=2003 |publisher=Penguin |location=New Zealand |isbn=0-14-301857-4 |pages=68, 70}}</ref> Eight of the nine islands of Tuvalu were inhabited. This explains the origin of the name, Tuvalu, which means 'eight standing together' in [[Tuvaluan language|Tuvaluan]] (compare to ''*walu'' meaning 'eight' in [[Proto-Austronesian language#Numerals|Proto-Austronesian]]). Possible evidence of human-made fires in the [[Caves of Nanumanga]] suggests humans may have occupied the islands for thousands of years.

An important [[Tuvaluan mythology|creation myth in the islands of Tuvalu]] is the story of ''te Pusi mo te Ali'' (the Eel and the Flounder), who are said to have created the [[islands of Tuvalu]]. ''Te Ali'' (the [[Bothidae|flounder]]) is believed to be the origin of the flat [[atoll]]s of Tuvalu and ''te Pusi'' (the [[Moray eel|eel]]) is the model for the [[coconut]] palms that are important in the lives of Tuvaluans. The stories of the ancestors of the Tuvaluans vary from island to island.

Tuvalu was first sighted by Europeans on 16 January 1568, during the voyage of [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira|Álvaro de Mendaña]] from Spain, who sailed past [[Nui (atoll)|Nui]] and charted it as ''Isla de Jesús'' (Spanish for "Island of Jesus") because the previous day was the feast of the [[Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus|Holy Name]].

[[Whaling|Whalers]] began roving the Pacific, although they visited Tuvalu only infrequently because of the difficulties of landing on the atolls.

For less than a year between 1862 and 1863, Peruvian ships engaged in the so-called "[[blackbirding]]" trade, by which they recruited or impressed workers, combed the smaller islands of [[Polynesia]] from [[Easter Island]] in the eastern Pacific to Tuvalu and the southern atolls of the Gilbert Islands (now Kiribati). They sought recruits to fill the extreme labour shortage in Peru.<ref>Maude, H.E.

Trading companies became active in Tuvalu in the mid-19th century; the trading companies engaged white ([[palagi]]) traders who lived on the islands. John (also known as Jack) O'Brien was the first European to settle in Tuvalu; he became a trader on Funafuti in the 1850s. He married Salai, the daughter of the paramount chief of Funafuti.

The Ellice Islands were administered as a [[British protectorates|British Protectorate]] from 1892 to 1916, as part of the [[British Western Pacific Territories]] (BWPT), by a [[Resident Commissioner]] based in the Gilbert Islands. The administration of the BWPT ended in 1916, and the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] Colony was established, which existed until October 1975.

===Second World War===
During the [[Pacific War|Second World War]], as a [[Crown colony|British colony]] the Ellice Islands were aligned with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] of the war. Early in the war, the [[Japanese occupation of the Gilbert Islands|Japanese invaded and occupied]] [[Butaritari|Makin]], [[Tarawa]] and other islands in what is now [[Kiribati]].
