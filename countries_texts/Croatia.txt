The Roman period ends with [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] and [[Croat]] invasions in the late 6th and first half of the 7th century and the destruction of almost all Roman towns. Roman survivors retreated to more favourable sites on the coast, islands, and mountains.

There's some uncertainty about the [[Origin hypotheses of the Croats|ethnogenesis of Croats]]. The most accepted theory, the Slavic theory, proposes migration of [[White Croats]] from [[White Croatia]] during the [[Migration Period]]. Conversely, the Iranian theory proposes [[Sarmatian]]-[[Alans|Alanic]] origin of Proto-Croats, based on [[Tanais Tablets]] containing [[Ancient Greek]] inscriptions of given names ''Χορούαθος'', ''Χοροάθος'', and ''Χορόαθος'' (Khoroúathos, Khoroáthos, and Khoróathos) and their interpretation as [[anthroponym]]s related to the [[Names of the Croats and Croatia|Croatian ethnonym]].<ref name="Nikšić-Heršak">{{cite journal |journal=Migracijske i Etničke Teme |issn=1333-2546 |publisher=Institute for Migration and Ethnic Studies |date=September 2007 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=251–268 |first1=Emil |last1=Heršak |first2=Boris |last2=Nikšić |language=hr |title=Hrvatska etnogeneza: pregled komponentnih etapa i interpretacija (s naglaskom na euroazijske/nomadske sadržaje) |trans-title=Croatian Ethnogenesis: A Review of Component Stages and Interpretations (with Emphasis on Eurasian/Nomadic Elements) |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=28729&lang=en}}</ref>

The Venetians controlled most of Dalmatia by 1428, except the [[city-state of Dubrovnik]], which became independent. [[Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War|Ottoman conquests]] led to the 1493 [[Battle of Krbava field]] and the 1526 [[Battle of Mohács]], both ending in decisive Ottoman victories. King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] died at Mohács, and in 1527, the [[Croatian Parliament met in Cetin]] and chose Ferdinand I of the [[House of Habsburg]] as the new ruler of Croatia, under the condition that he protects Croatia against the Ottoman Empire while respecting its political rights.<ref name="Povijest-saborovanja" />{{sfn|Frucht|2005|p=|pp=422–423}}

Following the decisive Ottoman victories, Croatia was split into civilian and military territories in 1538. The military territories became known as the [[Croatian Military Frontier]] and were under direct Habsburg control. Ottoman advances in Croatia continued until the 1593 [[Battle of Sisak]], the first decisive Ottoman defeat, when borders stabilised.{{sfn|Frucht|2005|p=|pp=422–423}} During the [[Great Turkish War]] (1683–1698), [[Slavonia]] was regained, but western [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], which had been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest, remained outside Croatian control.{{sfn|Frucht|2005|p=|pp=422–423}} The present-day border between the two countries is a remnant of this outcome.

The [[Croatian–Ottoman wars|Ottoman wars]] drove demographic changes. During the 16th century, Croats from western and northern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], [[Lika]], [[Krbava]], the area between the rivers [[Una (Sava)|Una]] and [[Kupa]], and especially from western [[Slavonia]], migrated towards [[Austria]].
