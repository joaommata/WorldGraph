{{Main|History of South Sudan}}

The [[Nilotic]] people of South Sudan—the [[Dinka people|Dinka]], [[Anuak people|Anyuak]], [[Bari people|Bari]], [[Acholi people|Acholi]], [[Nuer people|Nuer]], [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]], [[Kaligi people|Kaligi]] (Arabic Feroghe), and others—first entered South Sudan sometime before the tenth century, coinciding with the fall of [[medieval Nubia]]. From the 15th to the 19th century, tribal migrations, largely from the area of [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]], brought the Anyuak, Dinka, Nuer, and Shilluk to their modern locations in Bahr El Ghazal and the Upper Nile Region, while the Acholi and Bari settled in [[Equatoria]]. The [[Zande people|Zande]], [[Mundu people|Mundu]], [[Avukaya]] and [[Baka people (Congo and South Sudan)|Baka]], who entered South Sudan in the 16th century, established the region's largest state of Equatoria Region.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

Of South Sudan's ethnic, groups the Dinka are the largest, the Nuer the second-largest, the Zande the third-largest, and the Bari the fourth-largest. They are found in the [[Maridi]], [[Yambio]], and Tombura districts in the [[tropical rainforest]] belt of [[Western Equatoria]], the Adio of Azande client in [[Yei]], [[Central Equatoria]], and [[Western Bahr el Ghazal]]. In the 18th century, the Avungara [[Sib (anthropology)|sib]] rose to power over the rest of Azande society, a domination that continued into the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Helen Chapin Metz|editor-link=Helen Chapin Metz|title=Sudan: A Country Study|chapter-url=http://countrystudies.us/sudan/11.htm|series=Area handbook series|year=1991|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-8444-0750-0|chapter=The Turkiyah, 1821–85|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/sudancountrystud00metz_0}}</ref> British policies favouring Christian missionaries, such as the Closed District Ordinance of 1922 (see [[History of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]), and geographical barriers such as the swamplands along the [[White Nile]] curtailed the spread of Islam to the south, thus allowing the southern tribes to retain much of their political and religious institutions.

British colonial policy in Sudan had a long history of emphasising the development of the Arabised north and largely ignoring the non-Arabised south, which lacked schools, hospitals, roads, bridges, and other basic infrastructure. After Sudan's first independent elections in 1958, the continued neglect of the southern region by the [[Khartoum]] government led to uprisings, revolts, and the longest civil war on the continent.<ref>Matthew LeRiche, Matthew Arnold.

The Azande/Zande have had good relations with their neighbours, namely the [[Moru people|Moru]], Mundu, [[Pojulu people|Pöjulu]], Avukaya, Baka, and the small groups in Bahr el Ghazal, due to the expansionist policy of their king [[Gbudwe]], in the 18th century. In the 19th century, the Azande fought the French, the [[Belgium|Belgians]] and the [[Muhammad Ahmed|Mahdists]] to maintain their independence. [[Ottoman Egypt]], under the rule of [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail Pasha]], first attempted to control the region in the 1870s, establishing the province of [[Equatoria]] in the southern portion. Egypt's first appointed governor was [[Samuel Baker]], commissioned in 1869, followed by [[Charles George Gordon]] in 1874, and by [[Emin Pasha]] in 1878.<ref name="Levering Lewis 1995">{{cite book|last=Levering Lewis|first=David|title=The Race to Fashoda|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|place=New York|year=1995}}</ref>

The [[Muhammad Ahmed|Mahdist Revolt]] of the 1880s destabilised the nascent province, and Equatoria ceased to exist as an Egyptian outpost in 1889. Important settlements in Equatoria included [[Lado District|Lado]], [[Gondokoro]], [[Dufile]], and [[Wadelai]]. European colonial manoeuvrings in the region came to a head in 1898, when the [[Fashoda Incident]] occurred at present-day [[Kodok]]; Britain and France almost went to war over the region.<ref name="Levering Lewis 1995" /> Britain then treated South Sudan as a distinct entity with a different stage of development than the North. This policy was legalised in 1930 by the announcement of the Southern Policy. In 1946, without consulting Southern opinion, the British administration reversed its Southern Policy and began instead to implement a policy of uniting the North and the South.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.africabib.org/rec.php?RID=111593646|title=The 1947 Juba Conference|author=Kenneth Okeny|journal=Northeast African Studies|jstor=43660336|year=1991|volume=13|issue=1|pages=39–58|access-date=18 July 2023|archive-date=18 July 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230718204019/https://www.africabib.org/rec.php?RID=111593646|url-status=live}}</ref>

The region has been negatively affected [[South Sudanese wars of independence|by two civil wars]] since Sudanese independence: from 1955 to 1972, the Sudanese government fought the [[Anyanya]] rebel army (Anya-Nya is a term in the [[Madi language (Sudan and Uganda)|Madi]] language which means "snake venom")<ref>Matthew LeRiche, Matthew Arnold.

As a result, the country suffered serious neglect, a lack of infrastructure development, and major destruction and displacement. More than 2.5 million people have been killed, and millions more have become [[refugee]]s both within and outside the country.

South Sudan has an estimated population of 12.7 million people in 2024,<ref>{{Citation |title=South Sudan |date=2025-10-01 |work=The World Factbook |url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/south-sudan/#people-and-society |access-date=2025-10-31 |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |language=en}}</ref> but, given the lack of a census in several decades, this estimate may be severely distorted.

===Independence (2011)===
[[File:A South Sudanese girl at independence festivities (5926735716).jpg|thumb|upright|A South Sudanese girl at independence festivities]]

Between 9 and 15 January 2011, as a consequence of the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]], the [[2011 South Sudanese independence referendum|South Sudanese independence referendum]] was held to determine whether South Sudan should become an independent country, separate from Sudan. Following that, 98.83% of those who took part in the referendum voted for separation or independence.<ref>{{cite news|work=USA Today|title=Over 99 pct in Southern Sudan vote for secession|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2011-01-30-2052877353_x.htm|access-date=30 January 2011|date=30 January 2011|first=Maggie|last=Fick|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202151710/http://www.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2011-01-30-2052877353_x.htm|archive-date=2 February 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> And on 23 January 2011, members of a steering committee on post-independence governing told reporters that upon independence the land would be named the Republic of South Sudan "out of familiarity and convenience".

===2025 tensions===
In early March, [[2025 Nasir clashes|clashes]] between the Army and the rebel [[Nuer White Army]] in the town of [[Nasir, South Sudan|Nasir]] left dozens dead. On 26 March 2025, Vice-President Riek Machar was arrested on orders of President Salva Kiir claiming he had instigated and supported the White Army, despite the White Army denying any ties. The arrest was met by a response from the [[SPLM-IO]] stating such an act violates the ceasefire that ended the South Sudanese civil war in 2020. Machar's arrest was accompanied by the mass sacking of his supporters, and the arrival of a unit from the [[Ugandan armed forces]] invited into the country by Kiir to help fight against the White Army.<ref name="CNN March 30">{{cite web |last1=Princewill |first1=Nimi |title=The world's youngest country fought for decades to govern itself.
