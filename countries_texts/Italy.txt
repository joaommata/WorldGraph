The Italian Peninsula, named ''Italia'', was consolidated into a unified entity during Roman expansion, the conquest of new territories often at the expense of the [[Samnite Wars|other Italic tribes]], [[Roman–Etruscan Wars|Etruscans]], [[Roman–Gallic wars|Celts]], and [[Pyrrhic War|Greeks]]. A permanent association, with most of the local tribes and cities, was formed, and Rome began the conquest of Western Europe, North Africa, and the [[History of the Middle East#Greek and Roman Empire|Middle East]]. In the wake of [[Julius Caesar]]'s assassination in 44 BC, Rome grew into a massive empire stretching from [[Roman Britain|Britain]] to the borders of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Persia]], engulfing the whole Mediterranean basin, in which Greek, Roman, and other cultures merged into a powerful civilisation.

During the 1400s and 1500s, Italy was the birthplace and heart of the [[Renaissance]]. This era marked the transition from the medieval period to the modern age and was fostered by the wealth accumulated by merchant cities and the patronage of dominant families.<ref name="strathern">Strathern, Paul ''The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance'' (2003)</ref> Italian polities were now regional states effectively ruled by princes, in control of trade and administration, and their courts became centres of the arts and sciences. These princedoms were led by political dynasties and merchant families, such as the [[Medici]] of Florence. After the end of the [[Western Schism]], newly elected [[Pope Martin V]] returned to the [[Papal States]] and restored Italy as the sole centre of Western Christianity. The [[Medici Bank]] was made the credit institution of the Papacy, and significant ties were established between the Church and new political dynasties.<ref name="strathern"/><ref>[http://www.florentine-society.ru/Medici_Chapel_Mysteries.htm Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, ''Michelangelo: Mysteries of Medici Chapel'', SLOVO, Moscow, 2006]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511133416/http://www.florentine-society.ru/Medici_Chapel_Mysteries.htm|date=11 May 2011}}. {{ISBN|5-8505-0825-2}}.</ref>

In the arts, the Italian Renaissance exercised a dominant influence on European art for centuries, with artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Botticelli]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Giotto]], [[Donatello]], and [[Titian]], and architects such as [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Andrea Palladio]], and [[Donato Bramante]]. Italian [[List of Italian explorers|explorers]] and navigators from the maritime republics, eager to find an alternative route to the Indies to bypass the Ottomans, offered their services to monarchs of Atlantic countries and played a key role in ushering the [[Age of Discovery]] and colonisation of the Americas.

A defensive alliance known as the [[Italic League]] was formed between Venice, Naples, Florence, Milan, and the Papacy. [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo ''the Magnificent'' de Medici]] was the Renaissance's greatest patron, his support allowed the League to [[Siege of Otranto|abort invasion]] by the Turks. The alliance, however, collapsed in the 1490s; the invasion of [[Charles VIII of France]] initiated a series of wars in the peninsula. During the [[High Renaissance]], popes such as [[Julius II]] (1503–1513) fought for control of Italy against foreign monarchs; [[Paul III]] (1534–1549) preferred to mediate between the European powers to secure peace. In the middle of such conflicts, the Medici popes [[Leo X]] (1513–1521) and [[Clement VII]] (1523–1534) faced the [[Protestant Reformation]] in Germany, England and elsewhere.

In 1559, at the end of the [[Italian wars]] between France and the Habsburgs, about half of Italy (the southern Kingdoms of [[kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], and the [[Duchy of Milan]]) was under Spanish rule, while the other half remained independent (many states continued to be formally part of the Holy Roman Empire). The Papacy launched the [[Counter-Reformation]], whose key events include: the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563); adoption of the [[Gregorian calendar]]; the [[Jesuit China mission]]; the [[French Wars of Religion]]; end of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648); and the [[Great Turkish War]]. The Italian economy declined in the 1600s and 1700s.

During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1700–1714), Austria acquired most of the Spanish domains in Italy, namely Milan, Naples and Sardinia; the latter was given to the House of Savoy in exchange for Sicily in 1720. Later, a branch of the Bourbons ascended to the throne of Sicily and Naples. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], north and central Italy were reorganised as [[Sister Republics]] of France and, later, as a [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]].<ref>Napoleon Bonaparte, "The Economy of the Empire in Italy: Instructions from Napoleon to Eugène, Viceroy of Italy", ''Exploring the European Past: Texts & Images'', Second Edition, ed.

=== Unification ===
{{Main|Unification of Italy}}
The [[birth of the Kingdom of Italy]] was the result of efforts of Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the [[House of Savoy]] to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire [[Italian Peninsula]].

Sardinia's constitution was extended to all of Italy in 1861, and provided basic freedoms for the new state; but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied classes. The new kingdom was governed by a parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberals. As northern Italy quickly industrialised, southern and northern rural areas remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions to migrate and fuelling [[Italian diaspora|a large and influential diaspora]]. The [[Italian Socialist Party]] increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment.

Mussolini banned political parties and curtailed personal liberties, establishing a dictatorship. These actions attracted international attention and inspired similar dictatorships in [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Francoist Spain]].

For this reason the fascists engaged in [[interventionist foreign policy]]. In 1935, Mussolini [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded Ethiopia]] and founded [[Italian East Africa]], resulting in international isolation. Italy withdrew from the [[League of Nations]]. Italy then [[Pact of Steel|allied with Nazi Germany]] and the [[Tripartite Pact|Empire of Japan]], and strongly supported [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In April 1939, Italy [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded Albania]].

Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. At this date, France practically had lost the [[Battle of France]].
At different times, Italians advanced in [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|British Somaliland]], [[Italian invasion of Egypt|Egypt]], the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]], and eastern fronts.

On 3 September, Italy signed the [[Armistice of Cassibile]],<!-- it became effective on 8 Sept---> ending its war with UK and USA. The Germans, with the assistance of Italian fascists, succeeded in taking control of north and central Italy ([[Operation Achse]]]). The country remained a battlefield, with the Allies moving up from the south.

In the north, the Germans set up the [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI), a Nazi [[puppet state]] and [[collaborationist]] regime with Mussolini installed as leader after he was [[Gran Sasso raid|rescued]] by German paratroopers. What remained of the Italian troops was organised into the [[Italian Co-belligerent Army]], which fought alongside the Allies, while other Italian forces, loyal to Mussolini, opted to fight alongside the Germans in the [[National Republican Army]]. German troops, with RSI collaboration, committed massacres and deported thousands of Jews to death camps.
