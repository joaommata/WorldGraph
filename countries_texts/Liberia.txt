The presence of [[Oldowan]] artifacts in West Africa was confirmed by [[Michael Omolewa]], attesting to the presence of ancient humans.<ref name="Omolewa">{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=Omolewa |date=1986 |title=Certificate history of Nigeria |url=https://www.africabib.org/s/rec.php?RID=406720584 |publisher=Longman |isbn=978-0-582-58518-8 |access-date=July 26, 2020 |archive-date=April 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414143441/https://www.africabib.org/s/rec.php?RID=406720584 }}</ref>

Undated [[Acheulean]] ([[Early Stone Age]]) artifacts are well documented across [[West Africa]]. The emerging [[chronometric dating|chronometric record]] of the [[Middle Stone Age]] (MSA) indicates that [[lithic core|core]] and [[flake tool|flake]] technologies have been present in West Africa since at least the [[Chibanian]] (~780–126 thousand years ago or [[kiloannus|ka]]) in northern, open [[Sahel]]ian zones, and that they persisted until the [[Late Pleistocene|Terminal Pleistocene]]/[[Holocene]] boundary (~12&nbsp;ka) in both northern and southern zones of West Africa. This makes them the youngest examples of such MSA technology anywhere in Africa. The presence of MSA populations in forests remains an open question. Technological differences may correlate with various [[Afrotropical realm|ecological zones]]. [[Later Stone Age]] (LSA) populations evidence significant technological diversification, including both [[Microlitic industry|microlith]]ic and [[Stone tool#Neolithic industries|macrolithic]] traditions.<ref name="Scerri">{{cite journal |last1=Eleanor |first1=Scerri |date=1986 |title=T Certificate history of Nigeria |url=https://www.africabib.org/s/rec.php?RID=406720584 |journal=AfricanBib |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.013.137 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414143441/https://www.africabib.org/s/rec.php?RID=406720584 |archive-date=April 14, 2021 |access-date=July 26, 2020}}</ref>

The record shows that [[aceramic]] and [[ceramic]] LSA assemblages in West Africa overlap chronologically, and that changing densities of [[microlithic industries]] from the coast to the north are geographically structured. These features may represent social networks or some form of cultural diffusion allied to changing ecological conditions.<ref name="Scerri"/>

Microlithic industries with ceramics became common by the [[Northgrippian|Mid-Holocene]], coupled with an apparent intensification of wild food exploitation. Between ~4–3.5&nbsp;ka, these societies gradually transformed into food producers, possibly through contact with northern pastoralists and agriculturalists, as the environment became more arid. Hunter-gatherers have survived in the more forested parts of West Africa until much later, attesting to the strength of ecological boundaries in this region.<ref name="Scerri"/>

=== Mande expansion ===
The [[Pepper Coast]], also known as the Grain Coast, has been inhabited by indigenous peoples of Africa at least as far back as the 12th century. [[Mande peoples|Mande]]-speaking people expanded from the north and east, forcing many smaller ethnic groups southward toward the Atlantic Ocean. The [[Dei people|Dei]], [[Bassa (Liberia)|Bassa]], [[Kru people|Kru]], [[Gola (ethnic group)|Gola]], and [[Kissi people|Kissi]] were some of the earliest documented peoples in the area.<ref name=introprof>{{cite journal |last1=Dunn-Marcos |first1=Robin |last2=Kollehlon |first2=Konia T. |last3=Ngovo |first3=Bernard |last4=Russ |first4=Emily |editor-last=Ranar |editor-first=Donald A. |date=April 2005 |title=Liberians: An Introduction to their History and Culture |journal=Culture Profile |issue=19 |publisher=Center for Applied Linguistics |access-date=July 23, 2011|url=http://www.cal.org/co/liberians/liberian_050406_1.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625062344/http://www.cal.org/co/liberians/liberian_050406_1.pdf|archive-date=June 25, 2008|pages=5–6}}</ref>

This influx of these groups was compounded by the decline of the [[Mali Empire]] in 1375 and the [[Songhai Empire]] in 1591. As inland regions underwent [[desertification]], inhabitants moved to the wetter coast. These new inhabitants brought skills such as cotton [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]], cloth [[weaving]], iron [[smelting]], [[rice]] and [[sorghum]] cultivation, and social and political institutions from the Mali and Songhai empires.<ref name=introprof /> Shortly after the [[Mane people|Mane]] conquered the region, the [[Vai people]] of the former Mali Empire immigrated into the [[Grand Cape Mount County]] region. The ethnic Kru opposed the influx of Vai, forming an alliance with the Mane to stop further influx of Vai.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jesse N. Mongrue M.

People along the coast built [[canoe]]s and traded with other West Africans from [[Cap-Vert]] to the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]].

=== Early colonization ===
{{main|Colony of Liberia}}

Between 1461 and the late 17th century, [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], and [[British people|British]] traders had contacts and trading posts in the region. The Portuguese named the area ''Costa da Pimenta'' ("Pepper Coast") but it later came to be known as the [[Grain Coast]], due to the abundance of [[melegueta pepper]] grains.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Grain Coast Definition & Meaning |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/grain-coast |access-date=October 18, 2023 |website=Dictionary.com |language=en |archive-date=November 1, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231101145334/https://www.dictionary.com/browse/grain-coast |url-status=live }}</ref> The traders would barter commodities and goods with local people.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Syfert |first=Dwight N. |date=April 1977 |title=The Liberian Coasting Trade, 1822–1900 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-african-history/article/abs/liberian-coasting-trade-18221900/889FDC6F143C53CE5BA593314D85A4A3 |journal=The Journal of African History |language=en |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=217–235 |doi=10.1017/S0021853700015504 |issn=1469-5138|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

In the United States, there was a movement to settle [[African Americans]], both free-born and formerly enslaved, in Africa. This was partially because they faced racial discrimination in the form of political disenfranchisement and the denial of civil, religious, and social rights.<ref>Howard Brotz, ed., African American Social & Political Thought 1850–1920 (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 1996), 38–39.</ref> It was also partially because slave owners and politicians feared uprisings and rebellions of enslaved peoples. They believed these uprising would be motivated by a desire to achieve the freedoms experienced by formerly enslaved peoples, specifically freedom from violence and reunions with separated family.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Spicer |first=Christina |date=2016 |title=The Perpetual Paradox: A Look into Liberian Colonization |journal=The Ascendant Historian |volume=3 |pages=36–52 |via=University of Victoria}}</ref>

Formed in 1816, the [[American Colonization Society]] (ACS) was made up mostly of [[Quakers]] and slaveholders. Quakers believed black people would face better chances for freedom in Africa than in the U.S.<ref name="AFP">[http://www.fcnl.org/issues/item.php?item_id=731&issue_id=75 "Background on conflict in Liberia"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214051143/http://www.fcnl.org/issues/item.php?item_id=731&issue_id=75 |date=February 14, 2007 }}, Friends Committee on National Legislation, July 30, 2003</ref><ref name="Sale">Maggie Montesinos Sale (1997).

According to historian Henryatta Ballah, indigenous Liberian cosmology was centralized around the existence of a supreme being and its worship through specific deities and ancestral spirits that they believed acted as intermediaries between themselves and the supreme being. Certain pieces of land were considered to be part of the spiritual land and were central to Indigenous Liberians' resistance to their loss of land through colonization. Americo-Liberians and the American Colonization Society sought to eradicate all forms of Indigenous religious practices as a form of forced assimilation and to aid in their acquisition of land and political power. The term "witchcraft" was used to describe all Indigenous cosmologies in Liberia and many missionaries described these religious practices as the most barbaric practices of all "native tribes". These ideas about Indigenous Liberian cosmologies drove large-scale assimilation in the country beginning in the 1820s and continuing for decades.<ref>{{Citation |last=Ballah |first=Henryatta L. |title=Witchcraft in Liberia |date=April 17, 2024 |encyclopedia=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of African History |url=https://oxfordre.com/africanhistory/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-1466 |access-date=May 8, 2025 |language=en |doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.013.1466 |isbn=978-0-19-027773-4|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

The Americo-Liberian settlers did not relate well to the indigenous peoples they encountered, especially those in communities of the more isolated areas. The colonial settlements were raided by the [[Kru people|Kru]] and [[Grebo people|Grebo]] from their inland chiefdoms. Encounters with indigenous people in rural areas often became violent. Believing themselves different from and culturally and educationally superior to the indigenous peoples, the Americo-Liberians developed as an elite minority that created and held on to political power. The Americo-Liberian settlers adopted clothing such as [[hoop skirt]]s and [[tailcoat]]s and generally viewed themselves as culturally and socially superior to indigenous Africans.<ref name="Smithsonian">{{cite journal|last1=MacDougall|first1=Clair|title=These Abandoned Buildings Are the Last Remnants of Liberia's Founding History|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/liberia-created-former-slaves-fading-into-history-180959503/|journal=[[Smithsonian Magazine]]|date=July–August 2016|access-date=June 23, 2021|archive-date=April 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210420194225/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/liberia-created-former-slaves-fading-into-history-180959503/|url-status=live}}</ref> Indigenous people did not enjoy birthright citizenship in their own land until 1904.<ref name="Constitutional History">{{cite news |title=Constitutional history of Liberia |url=http://constitutionnet.org/country/liberia |access-date=July 1, 2020 |website=Constitutionnet.org |archive-date=April 28, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210428153518/https://constitutionnet.org/country/liberia |url-status=live }}</ref>

The leadership of the new nation consisted largely of the [[Americo-Liberian]]s, who at the beginning established political and economic dominance in the coastal areas that the ACS had purchased; they maintained relations with the United States and contacts in developing these areas and the resulting trade. Their passage of the 1865 Ports of Entry Act prohibited foreign commerce with the inland tribes, ostensibly to "encourage the growth of civilized values" before such trade was allowed in the region.<ref name=volume/> <!--How? -->

In the early 1900s, Liberia's export trade and merchant class largely collapsed. After the partition of Africa between the European powers in the 1800s, American businesses abandoned trade with Liberia and turned to other countries in the Americas for tropical commodities. This abrupt change coupled with Liberia's weak trading links between Britain and France caused Liberia to sink into 'economic insignificance.'<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Sullivan |first1=Jo |last2=Webster |first2=J.

At the beginning of the 20th century Germany was the only major country with an interest in Liberian trade. By 1914, Germany owned one of the two banks in Liberia as these trade routes strengthened. At the beginning of the first World War, the British Navy cut off German trade with Liberia, effectively severing all Liberian trade. In 1917, Liberia declared war on Germany following the U.S. in the hopes of receiving financial aid from the Allied Powers, specifically the United States.<ref name=":2" /> The [[German bombing of Monrovia]] was the only battle in which Liberia was directly involved in [[World War I]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gillispie |first=William |date=January 2, 2018 |title=Colonialism in global conflict: Liberia's entry and participation in World War One |journal=First World War Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=111–129 |doi=10.1080/19475020.2018.1520137 |issn=1947-5020}}</ref> Subsequently, it was [[List of participants to Paris Peace Conference, 1919–1920#Other national representatives|one of 32 nations]] to take part in the [[Versailles Peace Conference]] in 1919, which ended the war and established the [[League of Nations]]; Liberia was among the few African and non-Western nations to participate in the conference and the founding of the league.<ref name="Heffinck">{{cite web |last1=Heffinck |first1=Ariane |title=Liberia: A Nation in Recovery |url=https://una-gp.org/2014/02/17/liberia-a-nation-in-recovery/ |website=una-gp.org |publisher=United Nations Association of Philadelphia |access-date=August 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107000113/https://una-gp.org/2014/02/17/liberia-a-nation-in-recovery/ |archive-date=November 7, 2018 }}</ref>

Though aid from the United States was promised to Liberia in the amount of $5 million, the US Congress refused to sanction an official loan after the end of the First World War. When this aid did not come and trade continued to dwindle, Liberia was forced to borrow from the Bank of British West Africa, furthering its debt from the $800,000 it owed in 1904. These financial difficulties helped pave the way for multinational foreign investment companies, specifically those interested in rubber, to make their way into Liberia in the 1920s.<ref name=":2" />

In the early 1920s, the British Empire controlled 67 percent of rubber output. As a result of the depression of 1921–1922, rubber prices fell. In order to protect British plantations, the British Empire placed export duties on rubber. In response, Firestone Tire and Rubber Company looked to begin a rubber plantation in Liberia. Liberia's precarious financial situation and tensions with European powers following the first World War put them at risk for a losing conflict with the United Kingdom and France. Because of this, Liberia agreed to a 99-year lease on one million acres of land in exchange for Firestone's aid in the liquidation of Liberia's indebtedness. This eased tensions with the European banks to whom Liberia owed money and allowed Liberia to focus economically on infrastructure and defense. Despite this exchange, Liberia and its peoples were hesitant about the agreement due to Firestone's proposed extensive involvement in the Liberian economy and government. Regardless of opposition, Liberia was unable to separate Firestone's involvement in the country's financial and governmental sectors due to the company's financial aid and Liberia's debt. Liberia eventually agreed to Firestone's terms at the urging of the United States government.<ref name=":2" />

The onset of the 1929 depression in the United States caused an extreme drop in the price of rubber, significantly lowering rubber plantations' expected revenue. In light of this, Liberia sought to relieve itself of its repayment obligations to Firestone. Firestone was not responsive to the Liberians' requests, and in December 1932 Liberia unilaterally suspended repayment. Work on the plantation was suspended, and Firestone called on the U.S. government to send a warship to Monrovia. The dispute was settled in 1935, with Firestone advancing $650,000 to Liberia and gaining exemption from the export tax and from personal income tax on its expatriate employees for the rest of the time it took to repay the loan.<ref name=":2" />

Firestone was confronted with labor force issues within its Liberia plantations. The Liberian people had, up to that point, largely participated in subsistence agriculture and did not participate in a market economy. This made it difficult for Firestone to develop a wage-labor force. In response, the company attempted to redesign Liberia's economic and labor system through impressment, tax systems designed to pry labor out of the traditional economy by creating need for cash income, and forced labor. Because of Firestone's existence as the only major employer besides the Liberian government, these exploitative systems existed until they were abolished in the 1970s. However, scholars such as Animesh Ghoshal argue that these colonial structures still exist today in different forms.<ref name=":2" />

Soon after, allegations of [[modern slavery]] in Liberia led the League of Nations to establish the [[Cuthbert Christy#Christy commission|Christy Commission]]. Findings included government involvement in widespread "forced or compulsory labour".

In the mid-20th century, Liberia gradually began to modernize with American assistance. During [[World War II]], the United States made major infrastructure improvements to support its military efforts in Africa and Europe against Germany. It built the [[Freeport of Monrovia]] and [[Roberts International Airport]] under the [[Lend-Lease]] program before its entry into the Second World War.<ref name="opendoor">{{cite journal |last1=Marinelli |first1=Lawrence |year=1964 |title=Liberia's Open Door Policy |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=91–98 |doi=10.1017/s0022278x00003694|s2cid=153385644 }}</ref>

In 1944, President Tubman announced his "Open Door" policy. This policy, which encouraged foreign investment, gave Liberia an attractive climate for foreign investment and increased involvement of multinational foreign investment in the country. Despite this, Firestone remained and still remains one of the largest influences on the Liberian economy. This influence has raised concerns in regards to the effects of foreign investment on Liberia's political and economic policies. Economists such as Elliot Berg have stated that economic growth may be confined to export goods with foreign producers, which removes some of Liberia's economic autonomy.<ref name=":2" /> In international affairs, it was a founding member of the [[United Nations]], a vocal critic of [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]],<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899287,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028154941/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899287,00.html|archive-date=October 28, 2010|title=Africa: A Vote on Apartheid|magazine=Time|date=July 29, 1966|access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref> a proponent of African independence from European colonial powers, and a supporter of [[Pan-Africanism]].
