=== Medieval Nepal ===
[[File: Sinja_Valley, Karnali.jpg| thumb|upright=0.8|[[Sinja Valley]], thought to be the place of origin of the [[Khas]]as and the [[Nepali language]], was at the heart of the Khas Malla empire.]]
In the 11th century, a [[Khasa Kingdom|powerful empire]] of [[Khas people]] emerged in western Nepal whose territory at its highest peak included much of western Nepal as well as parts of western Tibet and [[Uttarakhand]] of India. By the 14th century, the empire had splintered into loosely associated {{transliteration|ne|[[Baise rajya]]s}}, literally 22 states) as they were counted. The rich culture and language of the Khas people spread throughout Nepal and as far as Indo-China in the intervening centuries; [[Khas language|their language]], later renamed the Nepali language, became the lingua franca of Nepal as well as much of North-east India.<ref name=leo/>

In south-eastern Nepal on the border with Bihar, [[Simraungadh (medieval city)|Simraungadh]] was the capital of the [[Karnats of Mithila]] around 1100 AD, and the unified Tirhut stood as a powerful kingdom for more than 200 years,<ref name=Darnal/> even ruling over Kathmandu for a time.{{sfn|Landon|1928|pp=32–33}} After another 300 years of Muslim rule, Tirhut came under the control of the [[Senas of Makwanpur]].<ref name=Darnal>{{cite journal |last=Darnal|first=Prakash|date=31 December 2018|title=A Review of Simarongarh's History on Its Nexus Areas with References of Archaeological Evidences|journal=Dhaulagiri Journal of Sociology and Anthropology|language=en|volume=12|pages=18–26|doi=10.3126/dsaj.v12i0.22176|issn=1994-2672|doi-access=free}}</ref> In the eastern hills, a confederation of Kirat principalities ruled the area between Kathmandu and [[Bengal]].

[[File:Patan Durbar Square-2644.jpg| thumb|left|upright=0.8| [[Patan Durbar Square]], one of the three palace squares in the Kathmandu Valley, was built by the Mallas in the 17th century. The Durbar Squares are a culmination of over a millennium of development in Nepali art and architecture.]]
In the Kathmandu valley, the [[Malla (Nepal)|Mallas]], who make several appearances in Nepalese history since ancient times, had established themselves in Kathmandu and Patan by the middle of the 14th century. The Mallas ruled the valley first under the suzerainty of Tirhut but established independent reign by late 14th century as Tirhut went into decline. In the late 14th century, [[Jayasthiti Malla]] introduced widespread socio-economic reforms, principal of which was the caste system. By dividing the indigenous non-Aryan Buddhist population into castes modelled after the four [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna system]] of Hinduism, he provided an influential model for the Sanskritisation and Hinduisation of the indigenous non-Hindu tribal populations in all principalities throughout Nepal. By the middle of the 15th century, Kathmandu had become a powerful empire which, according to [[William Kirkpatrick (East India Company officer)|Kirkpatrick]], extended from Digarchi or [[Shigatse]] in Tibet to Tirhut and [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] in India.{{sfn|Landon|1928|p=39}} 

In the late 15th century, Malla princes divided their kingdom in four – Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur in the valley and Banepa to the east. The competition for prestige among these brotherly kingdoms saw the flourishing of art and architecture in central Nepal, and the building of famous [[Kathmandu Durbar Square|Kathmandu]], [[Patan Durbar Square|Patan]] and [[Bhaktapur Durbar Square]]s; their division and mistrust led to their fall in the late 18th century, and ultimately, the unification of Nepal into a modern state.<ref name=leo/>{{sfn|Landon|1928|pp=52–61}}

Apart from one destructive sacking of Kathmandu valley in the mid 14th century,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Petech |first=Luciano |url=https://ia902904.us.archive.org/29/items/mediaevalhistoryofnepallucianopetech_643_f/Mediaeval%20History%20of%20Nepal%20%20Luciano%20Petech.pdf |title=Medieval History of Nepal |publisher=Fondata Da Giuseppe Tucci |year=1984 |edition=2nd |location=Italy |pages=125}}</ref> Nepal remains largely untouched by the [[Muslim invasion of India]] that began in the 11th century. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal period]] saw an influx of high-caste Hindus from India into Nepal. They soon intermingled with the Khas people and by the 16th century, there were about 50 Rajput-ruled principalities in Nepal, including the 22 (Baisi) states and, to their east in west-central Nepal, 24 [[Chaubisi rajya|''Chaubisi'' states]]. There emerged a view that Nepal remained the true bastion of unadulterated Hinduism at a time when Indian culture had been influenced by centuries of Mughal, followed by [[British Raj|British rule]]. [[Gorkha Kingdom|Gorkha]], one of the Baisi states, emerged as an influential and ambitious kingdom with a reputation for justice, after it codified the first Hinduism-based laws in the Nepalese hills.<ref name=leo/>

In the mid-18th century, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], a [[Gurkha|Gorkha]] king, set out to put together what would become present-day Nepal. He embarked on his mission by securing the neutrality of the bordering mountain kingdoms. After several bloody battles and sieges, notably the [[Battle of Kirtipur]], he managed to conquer the Kathmandu Valley in 1769.<ref>{{cite periodical |author= Father Giuseppe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vSsoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA307 |title=Account of the Kingdom of Nepal |magazine=Asiatick Researches |place=London | publisher=Vernor and Hood |year=1799 |page=308 |access-date=<!-- 2 July 2015 -->|volume=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016233414/https://books.google.com/books?id=vSsoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA307 |archive-date=16 October 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>
The Gorkha control reached its height when the [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] and [[Garhwal Kingdom]]s in the west to [[Sikkim]] in the east came under Nepalese control. A dispute with [[Tibet]] over the control of mountain passes and inner Tingri valleys of Tibet prompted the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Emperor]] of China to start the [[Sino-Nepalese War|Sino-Nepali War]] compelling the Nepali to retreat to their own borders in the north.{{sfn|Landon|1928|pp=68–69}} The rivalry between the Kingdom of Nepal and the [[East India Company]] over the control of states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War|Anglo-Nepali War]] (1815–16). At first, the British underestimated the Nepali and were soundly defeated until committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing. Thus began the reputation of [[Gurkha]]s as fierce and ruthless soldiers. The war ended in the [[Sugauli Treaty]], under which Nepal ceded recently captured lands.{{sfn|Landon|1928|pp=75–80}}<ref name=leo/>

Factionalism inside the royal family led to a period of instability. In 1846, a plot was discovered revealing that the reigning queen had planned to overthrow Jung Bahadur Kunwar, a fast-rising military leader. This led to the [[Kot massacre]]; armed clashes between military personnel and administrators loyal to the queen led to the execution of several hundred princes and chieftains around the country. Bir Narsingh Kunwar emerged victoriously and founded the [[Rana dynasty]], and came to be known as [[Jung Bahadur Rana]]. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Ranas were staunchly pro-British and assisted them during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] (and later in both World Wars). In 1860 some parts of the western Terai region were gifted to Nepal by the British as a friendly gesture because of its military help to sustain British control in India during the rebellion (known as ''[[Naya Muluk]]'', new country). In 1923, the [[United Kingdom]] and Nepal formally signed [[Nepal–Britain Treaty of 1923|an agreement of friendship]] that superseded the Sugauli Treaty of 1816.<ref name="auto">{{cite book |first1=andrea matles |last1=savada |first2=george lawrence |last2=harris |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/93012226/ |title=Nepal and Bhutan : country studies |work=The Library of Congress |access-date=26 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630034937/https://www.loc.gov/item/93012226/ |archive-date=30 June 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Contemporary history ===
In the late 1940s, newly emerging pro-democracy movements and political parties in Nepal were critical of the Rana autocracy. Following the success of [[Indian Independence Movement]] which Nepalese activists had taken part in, with India's support and cooperation of King Tribhuvan, [[Nepali Congress]] was successful in toppling the Rana regime, establishing a parliamentary democracy. After a decade of power wrangling between the king and the government, [[Mahendra of Nepal|King Mahendra]] (ruled 1955–1972) scrapped the democratic experiment in 1960, and a "partyless" [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] system was made to govern Nepal. The political parties were banned and politicians imprisoned or exiled.{{sfn|Hutt|2004|pp=3–7}} The Panchayat rule modernised the country, introducing reforms and developing infrastructure, but curtailed liberties and imposed heavy [[Censorship in Nepal|censorship]].

On 19 February 2025, a public holiday commemorating the [[1951 Nepalese revolution|1951 Revolution]], Shah delivered a video speech which discussed widespread frustrations with the ruling communist government. While he stopped short of explicitly calling for a restoration of the monarchy, the speech's emphasis on unity and sacrifice was interpreted by some as hinting at a possible royal revival.<ref>{{Cite news |date=25 February 2025 |title=What's behind former King Gyanendra Shah's video message creating waves in Nepal's politics – is a comeback possible? |url=https://english.nepalnews.com/s/long-reads/whats-behind-former-king-gyanendra-shahs-video-message-creating-waves-in-nepals-politics-is-a-comeback-possible/ |work=Nepal News |access-date=5 September 2025}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=18 February 2025 |title=Former King Gyanendra urges Nepalis to unite in effort to save the nation |url=https://english.nepalnews.com/s/nation/former-king-gyanendra-urges-nepalis-to-unite-in-effort-to-save-the-nation/ |work=Nepal News |access-date=5 September 2025}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=11 March 2025 |title=Political storm brews as Gyanendra Shah's message challenges major parties' ideals |url=https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/11/443245/ |work=Khabarhub |access-date=5 September 2025}}</ref> 

On 9 March 2025, thousands of supporters welcomed Shah as he arrived in Kathmandu.<ref name=":0" /> A spokesperson for the pro-monarchy [[Rastriya Prajatantra Party]] stated the turnout "shows how frustrated the people are with the present government, and they are in search of an alternative to the present system."<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Nepal's monarchy: Is a royal revival on the horizon? – DW – 03/28/2025 |url=https://www.dw.com/en/nepals-monarchy-is-a-royal-revival-on-the-horizon/a-72069781 |access-date=1 April 2025 |website=dw.com |language=en}}</ref>

In September 2025, [[2025_Nepalese_Gen_Z_protests|widespread protests]] over a social media ban and economic inequality led to rioting that killed or injured dozens of people, damaged Parliament and other buildings, and brought about the resignation of Prime Minister [[KP Sharma Oli]], who fled the country. In response to the crisis, the [[Nepali Army|Nepali army]] assumed control of nationwide security and engaged in talks with protest leaders, who selected former chief justice [[Sushila Karki]] as interim prime minister.<ref name="h103">{{cite web | last=Scarr | first=Charlotte | title=Nepal parliament set on fire after PM resigns over anti-corruption protests | website=BBC Home | date=9 September 2025 | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m4vjwrdwgo | access-date=11 September 2025}}</ref>
