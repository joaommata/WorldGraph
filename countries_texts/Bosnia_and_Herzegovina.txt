===Early history===
Bosnia has been inhabited since at least the [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic era]]. Notably, the [[Badanj Cave]] near [[Stolac]] features one of the oldest known cave engravings, depicting an animal figure believed to be a horse, dating back to approximately 13,000 to 12,000 BC.<ref>{{harvnb|Shpuza|2022|p=553}}; {{harvnb|Zindel|Lippert|Lahi|Kiel|2018|p=346}}; {{harvnb|Bejko|Morris|Papadopoulos|Schepartz|2015|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Hammond|Wilkes|2012|p=726}}; {{harvnb|Dausse|2015|p=28}}.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Palaeolithic site of Badanj |url=https://hwr.ba/culture-and-heritage/palaeolithic-site-of-badanj/ |access-date=2025-04-05 |website=hwr.ba |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Cave art at Badanj |url=https://www.centarzakrs.ba/bh/speleologija/42-cave-art-at-badanj.html |access-date=2025-04-05 |website=www.centarzakrs.ba}}</ref> During the [[Neolithic|Neolithic period]], significant cultures such as the [[Butmir]] and [[Kakanj]] emerged along the [[Bosna (river)|Bosna River]]. The Butmir culture, flourishing around 5100 to 4500 BC, is renowned for its distinctive ceramics and anthropomorphic figurines. Excavations near [[Sarajevo]] have uncovered intricately decorated pottery and realistic human figurines from this culture.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |title=Butmir near Sarajevo |url=https://zemaljskimuzej.ba/en/predmeti/lokaliteti/butmir-near-sarajevo |access-date=2025-04-05 |website=Zemaljski muzej Bosne i Hercegovine |language=en}}</ref>

From the 8th century BCE, Illyrian tribes evolved into kingdoms. The most notable Illyrian kingdoms and dynasties were those of [[Bardylis|Bardylis of the Dardani]] and of [[Agron of Illyria|Agron of the Ardiaei]] who created the last and best-known Illyrian kingdom. Agron ruled over the Ardiaei and had extended his rule to other tribes as well.

From the 7th century BCE, bronze was replaced by iron, after which only jewelry and art objects were still made out of bronze.<ref name="geography">{{cite book |last1=Gekić |first1=Haris |last2=Bidžan-Gekić |first2=Aida |last3=Drešković |first3=Nusret |last4=Mirić |first4=Ranko |last5=Reményi |first5=Péter |title=The Geography of Bosnia and Herzegovina: Between East and West |date=2022 |publisher=Springer Nature |isbn=9783030985233 |pages=138–139 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BVuEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA138}}</ref> Illyrian tribes, under the influence of [[Hallstatt culture]]s to the north, formed regional centers that were slightly different. Parts of Central Bosnia were inhabited by the [[Daesitiates]] tribe.<ref name="geography" /> The Iron Age [[Glasinac-Mati culture]] is associated with the [[Autariatae]] tribe.<ref name="geography" />

A very important role in their life was the cult of the dead, which is seen in their careful burials and burial ceremonies, as well as the richness of their burial sites.<ref name="geography" /> In northern parts, there was a long tradition of cremation and burial in shallow graves, while in the south the dead were buried in large stone or earth [[Tumulus|tumuli]] (natively called ''gromile'') that in Herzegovina were reaching monumental sizes, more than 50 m wide and 5 m high.{{cn|date=May 2025}} ''Japodian tribes'' had an affinity to decoration (heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, and large bronze [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulas]], as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze foil).{{cn|date=May 2025}}

In the 4th century BCE, the first invasion of [[Celts]] is recorded. They brought the technique of the [[Potter's wheel|pottery wheel]], new types of fibulas and different bronze and iron belts. They only passed on their way to Greece, so their influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina is negligible. Celtic migrations displaced many [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria|Illyrian tribes]] from their former lands, but some Celtic and Illyrian tribes mixed. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears the region was populated by a number of different peoples speaking distinct languages.{{cn|date=May 2025}}

In the [[Neretva Delta]] in the south, there were important [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] influences of the Illyrian [[Daorson|Daors]] tribe.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tomašević |first1=Nebojša |title=Treasures of Yugoslavia: An Encyclopedic Touring Guide |date=1983 |publisher=Yugoslaviapublic |pages=306–307}}</ref> Their capital was ''Daorson'' in Ošanići near [[Stolac]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Aličić |first1=Ahmed S. |title=Herzegovina |date=1981 |publisher=NIRO "Privredni vjesnik" |page=194}}</ref> Daorson, in the 4th century BCE, was surrounded by [[megalith]]ic, 5 m high stonewalls (as large as those of [[Mycenae]] in Greece), composed of large trapezoid stone blocks. Daors made unique bronze coins and sculptures.

Conflict between the Illyrians and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] started in 229&nbsp;BCE, but Rome did not complete its annexation of the region until AD&nbsp;9. It was precisely in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina that Rome fought one of the most difficult battles in its history since the [[Punic Wars]], as described by the Roman historian [[Suetonius]].<ref>[[Suetonius]], Tiberius 16,17</ref> This was the Roman campaign against [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], known as {{Lang|la|[[Bellum Batonianum]]}}.<ref>Miller, Norma.

Following the split of the Empire between 337 and 395 AD, Dalmatia and Pannonia became parts of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The region was conquered by the [[Ostrogoths]] in 455 AD. It subsequently changed hands between the [[Alans]] and the [[Huns]]. By the 6th century, Emperor [[Justinian I]] had reconquered the area for the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Slavs overwhelmed the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries. Illyrian cultural traits were adopted by the South Slavs, as evidenced in certain customs and traditions, and placenames.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ardian, Adzanela (Axhanela)|url=https://www.academia.edu/2490281|title=Illyrian Bosnia and Herzegovina-an overview of a cultural legacy|date=2004|publisher=Centre for Balkan Studies, Online Balkan Centre|access-date=4 December 2017|archive-date=19 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210819001829/https://www.academia.edu/2490281|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Middle Ages===

The [[Early Slavs]] raided the Western Balkans, including Bosnia, in the 6th and early 7th century (amid the [[Migration Period]]), and were composed of small tribal units drawn from a single Slavic confederation known to the Byzantines as the ''[[Sclaveni]]'' (whilst the related ''[[Antes people|Antes]]'', roughly speaking, colonized the eastern portions of the Balkans).<ref name="Columbia University Press">{{cite book|title=Bosnia and Hercegovina: A Tradition Betrayed|author= Robert J.

According to Noel Malcolm, the tribal Croats "settled in an area roughly corresponding to modern Croatia, and probably also including most of Bosnia proper, apart from the eastern strip of the Drina valley" while the tribal Serbs settled an area "corresponding to modern south-western Serbia (later known as [[Raška (region)|Raška]]), and gradually extended their rule into the territories of [[Duklja]] and [[Zachlumia|Hum]]".{{sfn|Malcolm|2002|p=8|ps=: The Serbs settled in an area corresponding to modern south-western Serbia (a territory which later in the middle ages became known as Raška or Rascia), and gradually extended their rule into the territories of Duklje or Dioclea (Montenegro) and Hum or Zachumlje (Herzegovina).

The rest of Bosnia seems to have been territory between Serb and Croatian rule.}}

Bosnia is also believed to be first mentioned ''as a land (horion Bosona)'' in Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus' ''De Administrando Imperio'' in the mid 10th century, at the end of a chapter entitled ''Of the Serbs and the country in which they now dwell''.{{sfn|Basic|2009|p=123}} This has been scholarly interpreted in several ways and used especially by the Serb national ideologists to prove Bosnia as originally a "Serb" land.{{sfn|Basic|2009|p=123}} Other scholars have asserted the inclusion of Bosnia in the chapter to merely be the result of Serbian Grand Duke [[Časlav of Serbia|Časlav]]'s temporary rule over Bosnia at the time, while also pointing out Porphyrogenitus does not say anywhere explicitly that Bosnia is a "Serb land".{{sfn|Basic|2009|p=123–28}} In fact, the very translation of the critical sentence where the word ''Bosona'' (Bosnia) appears is subject to varying interpretation.{{sfn|Basic|2009|p=123}} In time, Bosnia formed a unit under its own [[Kulin Ban|ruler]], who called himself Bosnian.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=53}} Bosnia, along with other territories, became part of [[Duklja]] in the 11th century, although it retained its own nobility and institutions.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=223}}

[[File:Medieval Bosnian State Expansion-en.svg|thumb|Bosnia in the Middle Ages spanning the [[Banate of Bosnia]] and the succeeding [[Kingdom of Bosnia]]]]

In the [[High Middle Ages]], political circumstance led to the area being contested between the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the Byzantine Empire. Following another shift of power between the two in the early 12th century, Bosnia found itself outside the control of both and emerged as the [[Banate of Bosnia]] (under the rule of local ''[[Ban (title)|bans]]'').{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}<ref>{{cite book|title=Paul Mojzes.

In response to Hungarian attempts to use church politics regarding the issue as a way to reclaim sovereignty over Bosnia, Kulin held a council of local church leaders to renounce the heresy and embraced Catholicism in 1203. Despite this, Hungarian ambitions remained unchanged long after Kulin's death in 1204, waning only after an unsuccessful invasion in 1254. During this time, the population was called ''Dobri [[Bošnjani]]'' ("Good Bosnians").<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0rIGA0rluO0C&pg=PA71|title=''Bosnia and Hercegovina: A Tradition Betrayed''|author=Robert J.

Bosnian history from then until the early 14th century was marked by a power struggle between the [[Šubić family|Šubić]] and [[Kotromanić dynasty|Kotromanić]] families. This conflict came to an end in 1322, when [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia|Stephen II Kotromanić]] became ''Ban''. By the time of his death in 1353, he was successful in annexing territories to the north and west, as well as Zahumlje and parts of Dalmatia. He was succeeded by his ambitious nephew [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko]] who, following a prolonged struggle with nobility and inter-family strife, gained full control of the country in 1367. By the year 1377, Bosnia was elevated into a kingdom with the coronation of Tvrtko as the first [[List of rulers of Bosnia|Bosnian King]] in Mile near [[Visoko during the Middle Ages|Visoko]] in the Bosnian heartland.<ref name="Mile">{{cite web|url=http://www.aneks8komisija.com.ba/main.php?id_struct=6&lang=1&action=view&id=1341|title=Declared as national monument |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116053150/http://www.aneks8komisija.com.ba/main.php?id_struct=6&lang=1&action=view&id=1341 |archive-date=16 January 2009}}</ref><ref name=An>Anđelić Pavao, Krunidbena i grobna crkva bosanskih vladara u Milima (Arnautovićima) kod Visokog.

Following his death in 1391, however, Bosnia fell into a long period of decline. The [[Ottoman Empire]] had started its [[Ottoman wars in Europe|conquest of Europe]] and posed a major threat to the [[Balkans]] throughout the first half of the 15th century. Finally, after decades of political and social instability, the Kingdom of Bosnia ceased to exist in 1463 after its conquest by the Ottoman Empire.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina – Ottoman Bosnia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina|access-date=2020-09-02|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|archive-date=3 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403215257/https://www.britannica.com/place/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina|url-status=live}}</ref>

There was a general awareness in medieval Bosnia, at least amongst the nobles, that they shared a joint state with Serbia and that they belonged to the same ethnic group. That awareness diminished over time, due to differences in political and social development, but it was kept in Herzegovina and parts of Bosnia which were a part of Serbian state.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Isailovović|first=Neven|date=2018|title=Pomeni srpskog imena u srednjovjekovnim bosanskim ispravama|journal=Srpsko pisano nasljeđe i istorija srednjovjekovne Bosne i Huma|pages=276}}</ref>

===Ottoman Empire===

The [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ottoman conquest of Bosnia]] marked a new era in the country's history and introduced drastic changes in the political and cultural landscape. The Ottomans incorporated Bosnia as an integral province of the Ottoman Empire with its historical name and territorial integrity.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buzov |first1=Snježana |editor1-last=Koller |editor1-first=Markus |editor-first2=Kemal H. |editor-last2=Karpat |chapter=Ottoman Perceptions of Bosnia as Reflected in the Works of Ottoman Authors who Visited or Lived in Bosnia |date=2004 |title=Ottoman Bosnia: A History in Peril |pages=83–92 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=978-0-2992-0714-4}}</ref> Within Bosnia, the Ottomans introduced a number of key changes in the territory's socio-political administration; including a new landholding system, a reorganization of administrative units, and a complex system of social differentiation by class and religious affiliation.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

Following Ottoman occupation, there was a steady flow of people out of Bosnia and a large number of abandoned villages in Bosnia are mentioned in the Ottoman registers,<ref name="ReferenceA">Bosnia: A Short History , Chapter: Islamicization of Bosnia</ref> while those who stayed eventually became [[Muslims]]. Many Catholics in Bosnia fled to neighboring Catholic lands in the early Ottoman occupation.<ref>Bosnia: a short history p. 55</ref> The evidence indicates that the early Muslim conversions in Ottoman Bosnia in the 15th–16th century were among the locals who stayed rather than mass Muslim settlements from outside Bosnia.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In Herzegovina, many [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] people had also embraced Islam.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> By the late 16th and early 17th century, Muslims are considered to have become an absolute majority in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Albanian Catholic priest [[Pjetër Mazreku]] reported in 1624 that there were 450,000 Muslims, 150,000 Catholics and 75,000 Eastern Orthodox in Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

There was a lack of [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] activity in Bosnia proper in the pre-Ottoman period.<ref>Bosnia: A Short History p. 71</ref> An Orthodox Christian population in Bosnia was introduced as a direct result of Ottoman policy.<ref name="Bosnia: A Short History p. 55">Bosnia: A Short History p. 55</ref> From the 15th century and onwards, Orthodox Christians (Orthodox [[Vlachs]] and non-Vlach Orthodox Serbs) from Serbia and other regions settled in Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref>Bosnia: A Short History p. 71–73, p. 79–80</ref> Favored by the Ottomans over the Catholics, many Orthodox churches were allowed to be built in Bosnia by the Ottomans.<ref>Bosnia: A Short History p. 71–73</ref><ref name="Bosnia: A Short History p. 55"/> Quite a few Vlachs also became Islamized in Bosnia, and some (mainly in Croatia) became Catholics.<ref>Bosnia: A Short History, Chapter: Serbs and Vlachs</ref>

The four centuries of Ottoman rule also had a drastic impact on Bosnia's population make-up, which changed several times as a result of the empire's conquests, frequent wars with European powers, forced and economic migrations, and epidemics. A native Slavic-speaking Muslim community emerged and eventually became the largest of the ethno-religious groups due to a lack of strong Christian church organizations and continuous rivalry between the Orthodox and Catholic churches, while the indigenous [[Bosnian Church]] disappeared altogether (ostensibly by conversion of its members to Islam). The Ottomans referred to them as ''kristianlar'' while the Orthodox and Catholics were called ''gebir'' or ''kafir'', meaning "unbeliever".{{sfn|Velikonja|2003|pp=29–30}} The Bosnian [[Franciscans]] (and the Catholic population as a whole) were protected by official imperial decrees and in accordance and the full extent of Ottoman laws; however, in effect, these often merely affected arbitrary rule and behavior of powerful local elite.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

As the Ottoman Empire continued its rule in the Balkans ([[Rumelia]]), Bosnia was somewhat relieved of the pressures of being a frontier province and experienced a period of general welfare. A number of cities, such as [[Sarajevo]] and [[Mostar]], were established and grew into regional centers of trade and urban culture and were then visited by Ottoman traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]] in 1648. Within these cities, various Ottoman Sultans financed the construction of many works of [[Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian architecture]] such as the country's first library in Sarajevo, [[Madrasa|madrassas]], a school of [[Sufi philosophy]], and a clock tower (''Sahat Kula''), bridges such as the [[Stari Most]], the [[Emperor's Mosque]] and the [[Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque]].<ref name="Syed Akhtar Usmani 2011 p. 473">{{cite book | last1=Syed | first1=M.H. | last2=Akhtar | first2=S.S. | last3=Usmani | first3=B.D. | title=Concise History of Islam | publisher=Vij Books India Private Limited | series=Na | year=2011 | isbn=978-93-82573-47-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eACqCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA473 | access-date=2021-06-22 | page=473 | archive-date=14 February 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220214150454/https://books.google.com/books?id=eACqCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA473 | url-status=live }}</ref>

However, by the late 17th century the Empire's military misfortunes caught up with the country, and the end of the [[Great Turkish War]] with the [[treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699 again made Bosnia the Empire's westernmost province. The 18th century was marked by further military failures, numerous revolts within Bosnia, and several outbreaks of plague.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Koller |first1=Markus |title=Bosnien an der Schwelle zur Neuzeit : eine Kulturgeschichte der Gewalt |date=2004 |publisher=Oldenbourg |location=Munich |isbn=978-3-486-57639-9}}</ref>
The Porte's efforts at modernizing the Ottoman state were met with distrust growing to hostility in Bosnia, where local aristocrats stood to lose much through the proposed [[Tanzimat]] reforms. This, combined with frustrations over territorial, political concessions in the north-east, and the plight of [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[Muslims|Muslim]] refugees arriving from the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] into [[Bosnia Eyalet]], culminated in a partially unsuccessful revolt by [[Husein Gradaščević]], who endorsed a Bosnia Eyalet autonomous from the authoritarian rule of the Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]], who persecuted, executed and abolished the [[Janissary|Janissaries]] and reduced the role of autonomous [[Pasha]]s in Rumelia. Mahmud II sent his [[Grand vizier]] to subdue Bosnia Eyalet and succeeded only with the reluctant assistance of [[Ali Pasha Rizvanbegović]].<ref name="Imamović, Mustafa 1996"/> Related rebellions were extinguished by 1850, but the situation continued to deteriorate.

New nationalist movements appeared in Bosnia by the middle of the 19th century. Shortly after Serbia's breakaway from the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century, Serbian and Croatian nationalism rose up in Bosnia, and such nationalists made irredentist claims to Bosnia's territory. This trend continued to grow in the rest of the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hajdarpasic |first1=Edin |title=Whose Bosnia?

Agrarian unrest eventually sparked the [[Herzegovina uprising (1875–1877)|Herzegovinian rebellion]], a widespread peasant uprising, in 1875. The conflict rapidly spread and came to involve several Balkan states and Great Powers, a situation that led to the [[Congress of Berlin]] and the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

At the Congress of [[Berlin]] in 1878, the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Foreign Minister [[Gyula Andrássy]] obtained the occupation and administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and he also obtained the right to station garrisons in the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], which would remain under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administration until 1908, when the Austro-Hungarian troops withdrew from the Sanjak.

Although Austro-Hungarian officials quickly came to an agreement with the Bosnians, tensions remained and a mass emigration of Bosnians occurred.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} However, a state of relative stability was reached soon enough and Austro-Hungarian authorities were able to embark on a number of social and administrative reforms they intended would make Bosnia and Herzegovina into a "model" colony.

[[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg rule]] had several key concerns in Bosnia. It tried to dissipate the South Slav nationalism by disputing the earlier Serb and Croat claims to Bosnia and encouraging identification of Bosnian or [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] identity.{{sfn|Hajdarpasic|2015|p=161–165}} Habsburg rule also tried to provide for modernisation by codifying laws, introducing new political institutions, establishing and expanding industries.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sugar |first1=Peter |title=Industrialization of Bosnia-Hercegovina : 1878–1918 |date=1963 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle}}</ref>

Austria–Hungary began to plan the annexation of Bosnia, but due to international disputes the issue was not resolved until the [[Bosnian Crisis|annexation crisis]] of 1908.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=94}} Several external matters affected the status of Bosnia and its relationship with Austria–Hungary. [[May Coup (Serbia)|A bloody coup]] occurred in Serbia in 1903, which brought a radical anti-Austrian government into power in [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=140}} Then in 1908, the revolt in the Ottoman Empire raised concerns that the [[Istanbul]] government might seek the outright return of Bosnia and Herzegovina. These factors caused the Austro-Hungarian government to seek a permanent resolution of the Bosnian question sooner, rather than later.

Taking advantage of the turmoil in the Ottoman Empire, Austro-Hungarian diplomacy tried to obtain provisional Russian approval for changes over the status of Bosnia and Herzegovina and published the annexation proclamation on 6 October 1908.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=227}} Despite international objections to the Austro-Hungarian annexation, Russians and their client state, Serbia, were compelled to accept the Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in March 1909.

In 1910, Habsburg Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] proclaimed the first constitution in Bosnia, which led to relaxation of earlier laws, elections and formation of the [[Diet of Bosnia|Bosnian parliament]] and growth of new political life.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keil|first1=Soeren|title=Multinational Federalism in Bosnia and Herzegovina|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages=61–62}}</ref>

Following World War I, Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the South Slav [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (soon renamed Yugoslavia). Political life in Bosnia and Herzegovina at this time was marked by two major trends: social and economic unrest over [[Distribution (economics)|property redistribution]] and the formation of several political parties that frequently changed coalitions and alliances with parties in other Yugoslav regions.<ref name="Riedlmayer"/>

The dominant ideological conflict of the Yugoslav state, between Croatian regionalism and Serbian centralization, was approached differently by Bosnia and Herzegovina's major [[ethnic group]]s and was dependent on the overall political atmosphere.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} The political reforms brought about in the newly established Yugoslav kingdom saw few benefits for the Bosnian Muslims; according to the 1910 final census of land ownership and population according to religious affiliation conducted in Austria-Hungary, Muslims owned 91.1%, Orthodox Serbs owned 6.0%, Croat Catholics owned 2.6% and others, 0.3% of the property. Following the reforms, Bosnian Muslims were dispossessed of a total of 1,175,305 hectares of agricultural and forest land.<ref>{{cite web|author=Danijela Nadj|url=http://www.hic.hr/books/seeurope/010e-semiz.htm|title=An International Symposium "Southeastern Europe 1918–1995"|publisher=Hic.hr|access-date=14 June 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822164923/http://www.hic.hr/books/seeurope/010e-semiz.htm|archive-date=22 August 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>

Although the initial split of the country into 33 [[oblast]]s erased the presence of traditional geographic entities from the map, the efforts of Bosnian politicians, such as [[Mehmed Spaho]], ensured the six oblasts carved up from Bosnia and Herzegovina corresponded to the six sanjaks from Ottoman times and, thus, matched the country's traditional boundary as a whole.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

The establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, however, brought the redrawing of administrative regions into [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia#Subdivisions|banates]] or ''[[Banovina (region)|banovinas]]'' that purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines, removing any trace of a Bosnian entity.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} Serbo-Croat tensions over the structuring of the Yugoslav state continued, with the concept of a separate Bosnian division receiving little or no consideration.

The [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement|Cvetković-Maček Agreement]] that created the [[Banovina of Croatia|Croatian banate]] in 1939 encouraged what was essentially a [[partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] between Croatia and Serbia.<ref name="Imamović, Mustafa 1996"/> However the rising threat of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]] forced Yugoslav politicians to shift their attention. Following a period that saw attempts at appeasement, the signing of the [[Tripartite Pact|Tripartite Treaty]], and a [[Yugoslav coup d'état|coup d'état]], Yugoslavia was finally invaded by Germany on 6 April 1941.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

Starting in 1941, Yugoslav communists under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito organized their own multi-ethnic resistance group, the Partisans, who fought against both [[Axis powers|Axis]] and Chetnik forces. On 29 November 1943, the [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] (AVNOJ) with Tito at its helm held a founding conference in [[Jajce]] where Bosnia and Herzegovina was reestablished as a republic within the Yugoslav federation in its Habsburg borders.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Redžić |first1=Enver |title=Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Second World War |date=2005 |publisher=Frank Cass |location=London |pages=225–227}}</ref> During the entire course of [[World War II in Yugoslavia]], 64.1% of all Bosnian Partisans were Serbs, 23% were Muslims and 8.8% Croats.<ref name="anubih.ba-Hoare">{{cite web |author1=Marko Attila Hoare |author1-link=Marko Attila Hoare |title=The Great Serbian threat, ZAVNOBiH and Muslim Bosniak entry into the People's Liberation Movement |url=https://publications.anubih.ba/bitstream/handle/123456789/52/Zbornik%20ZAVNOBiH%20sve%2015-04-2019-4-115-130.pdf?sequence=7&isAllowed=y |website=anubih.ba |publisher=Posebna izdanja ANUBiH |access-date=21 December 2020 |pages=123 |language=en |archive-date=1 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210201071114/https://publications.anubih.ba/bitstream/handle/123456789/52/Zbornik%20ZAVNOBiH%20sve%2015-04-2019-4-115-130.pdf?sequence=7&isAllowed=y |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Military success eventually prompted the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to support the Partisans, resulting in the successful [[Maclean Mission]], but Tito declined their offer to help and relied on his own forces instead.

Due to its central geographic position within the Yugoslav federation, post-war Bosnia was selected as a base for the development of the military defense industry. This contributed to a large concentration of arms and military personnel in Bosnia; a significant factor in [[Bosnian War|the war that followed the break-up of Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} However, Bosnia's existence within Yugoslavia, for the large part, was relatively peaceful and very prosperous, with high employment, a strong industrial and export oriented economy, a good education system and social and medical security for every citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Several international corporations operated in Bosnia—[[Volkswagen]] as part of TAS (car factory in Sarajevo, from 1972), [[Coca-Cola]] (from 1975), SKF Sweden (from 1967), [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] (a tobacco factory in Sarajevo), and [[Holiday Inn]] hotels. Sarajevo was the site of the [[1984 Winter Olympics]].

During the 1950s and 1960s, Bosnia was a political backwater of Yugoslavia. In the 1970s, a strong Bosnian political elite arose, fueled in part by Tito's leadership in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and Bosnians serving in Yugoslavia's diplomatic corps. While working within the Socialist system, politicians such as [[Džemal Bijedić]], [[Branko Mikulić]] and [[Hamdija Pozderac]] reinforced and protected the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name="Stojic">Stojic, Mile (2005).

A second round followed on 25 November, resulting in a [[Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina|national assembly]] where communist power was replaced by a coalition of three ethnically based parties.<ref name="phron1">{{cite web|url=http://phron.org/Reference/Books/Balkans%20-%20post%20communist%20history.pdf |title=The Balkans: A post-Communist History|access-date=14 June 2006 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701210204/http://phron.org/Reference/Books/Balkans%20-%20post%20communist%20history.pdf |archive-date=1 July 2014}}</ref> Following [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]]'s declarations of independence from Yugoslavia, a significant split developed among the residents of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the issue of whether to remain within Yugoslavia (overwhelmingly favored by Serbs) or seek independence (overwhelmingly favored by [[Muslims (ethnic group)|Muslims]] and Croats).<ref name="The Princeton Encyclopedia of Self-Determination 1995">{{cite web | title=Bosnia – Herzegovina | website=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Self-Determination | date=1995-11-21 | url=https://pesd.princeton.edu/node/201 | access-date=2021-06-22 | archive-date=24 June 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624203925/https://pesd.princeton.edu/node/201 | url-status=live }}</ref>

The Serb members of parliament, consisting mainly of the [[Serb Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Serb Democratic Party]] members, abandoned the central parliament in Sarajevo, and formed the [[National Assembly (Republika Srpska)|Assembly of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 24 October 1991, which marked the end of the three-ethnic coalition that governed after the elections in 1990. This Assembly established the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in part of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992. It was renamed [[Republika Srpska (1992–1995)|Republika Srpska]] in August 1992. On 18 November 1991, the party branch in Bosnia and Herzegovina of the ruling party in the Republic of Croatia, the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ), proclaimed the existence of the [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia|Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]] in a separate part of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the [[Croatian Defence Council]] (HVO) as its military branch.<ref name="ICTY: Prlić et al.
