{{Main|History of Switzerland}}
The state of Switzerland took its present form with the adoption of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] in 1848. Switzerland's precursors established a defensive alliance in 1291, forming a loose [[confederation]] that persisted for centuries.

The earliest known tribes formed the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and [[La Tène culture]]s, named after the archaeological site of La Tène on the north side of [[Lake Neuchâtel]]. La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late [[Iron Age]] from around 450 BC,<ref name="Early" /> possibly influenced by [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] civilisations. One of the most prominent La Tène tribes were the [[Helvetii]], who primarily occupied the [[Swiss Plateau]], alongside the [[Rhaetians]] in the eastern regions. Facing pressures from Germanic tribes, in 58 BC, the Helvetii, influenced by [[Orgetorix]], a wealthy aristocrat, decided to abandon the Swiss Plateau for better opportunities in western Gallia. After Orgetorix's mysterious death, the tribe continued their migration but was decisively defeated by Julius Caesar's armies at the [[Battle of Bibracte]], in present-day eastern France. Following their defeat, the Helvetii were forced by Caesar to return to their original lands, where they were subjected to stringent restrictions on their autonomy and movements.<ref name="Early" /> In 15 BC, [[Tiberius]] (later the second Roman emperor) and his brother [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] conquered the Alps, integrating them into the [[Roman Empire]]. The area occupied by the Helvetii first became part of Rome's [[Gallia Belgica]] province and then of its [[Germania Superior]] province. The eastern portion of modern Switzerland was integrated into the [[Roman province]] of [[Raetia]]. Sometime around the start of the [[Common Era]], the Romans maintained a large camp called [[Vindonissa]], now a ruin at the confluence of the [[Aare]] and [[Reuss (river)|Reuss]] rivers, near the town of [[Windisch, Switzerland|Windisch]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Trumm |first=Judith |title=Vindonissa |url=https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/articles/012287/2015-04-22/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220503210248/https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/articles/012287/2015-04-22/ |archive-date=3 May 2022 |access-date=3 May 2022 |website=[[Historical Dictionary of Switzerland]] |language=de}}</ref>

The first and second century AD was an age of prosperity on the Swiss Plateau. Towns such as [[Aventicum]], [[Iulia Equestris]] and [[Augusta Raurica]] reached a remarkable size, while hundreds of agricultural estates ([[Villae rusticae]]) were established in the countryside.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last1=Zschokke |first1=Heinrich |url=http://archive.org/details/historyswitzerl00zschgoog |title=The history of Switzerland, for the Swiss people |last2=Zschokke |first2=Emil |last3=Shaw |first3=Francis George |date=1855 |publisher=New York, C.

Around 260 AD, the fall of the [[Agri Decumates]] territory north of the [[Rhine]] transformed today's Switzerland into a frontier land of the Empire. Repeated raids by the [[Alamanni]] tribes provoked the ruin of the Roman towns and economy, forcing the population to shelter near Roman fortresses, like the [[Castrum Rauracense]] near Augusta Raurica. The Empire built another line of defence at the north border (the so-called Donau-Iller-Rhine-Limes). At the end of the fourth century, the increased Germanic pressure forced the Romans to abandon the linear defence concept. The Swiss Plateau was finally open to [[Germanic tribes]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], from the end of the fourth century, the western extent of modern-day Switzerland was part of the territory of the [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Kings of the Burgundians]], who introduced the French language to the area. The [[Alemanni]] settled the Swiss Plateau in the fifth century and the [[valleys of the Alps]] in the eighth century, forming [[Alemannia]]. Modern-day Switzerland was then divided between the kingdoms of Alemannia and [[Burgundy]].<ref name="Early" /> The entire region became part of the expanding [[Frankish Empire]] in the sixth century, following [[Clovis I]]'s victory over the Alemanni at [[Tolbiac]] in 504 AD, and later Frankish domination of the Burgundians.<ref name="Nationsencyclopedia-Hist">{{Cite web |title=Switzerland history |url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Switzerland-HISTORY.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301050628/http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Switzerland-HISTORY.html |archive-date=1 March 2014 |access-date=27 November 2009 |website=Nations Encyclopedia}}</ref><ref name="Nationsonline">{{Cite web |title=Brief History of Switzerland |url=http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/History/Switzerland-history.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508043011/http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/History/Switzerland-history.htm |archive-date=8 May 2014 |access-date=27 November 2009 |website=Nations Online}}</ref>

Throughout the rest of the sixth, seventh and eighth centuries, Swiss regions continued under Frankish hegemony ([[Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] dynasties) but after its extension under [[Charlemagne]], the [[Frankish Empire]] was divided by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843.<ref name="Early" /> The territories of present-day Switzerland became divided into [[Middle Francia]] and [[East Francia]] until they were reunified under the [[Holy Roman Empire]] around 1000&nbsp;AD.<ref name="Early" />

In the 10th century, as the rule of the Carolingians waned, [[Magyars]] destroyed [[Basel]] in 917 and [[St. Gallen]] in 926. In response, [[Henry the Fowler]], the then ruler of East Francia, decreed the fortification of key settlements to defend against these invasions. Large villages and towns, including strategic locations like Zurich and St.Gallen, were fortified. This initiative led to the development of what were essentially early urban strongholds and city governments in Eastern Switzerland.<ref name=":1" />

By 1200, the Swiss Plateau comprised the dominions of the houses of [[House of Savoy|Savoy]], [[Zähringer]], [[Habsburg]], and [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]].<ref name="Early" /> Some regions ([[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]], later known as {{lang|de|[[Waldstätte]]n}}) were accorded the [[Imperial immediacy]] to grant the empire direct control over the mountain passes. With the extinction of its male line in 1263, the Kyburg dynasty fell in AD 1264. The Habsburgs under [[Rudolph I of Germany|King Rudolph I]] (Holy Roman Emperor in 1273) laid claim to the Kyburg lands and annexed them, extending their territory to the eastern Swiss Plateau.<ref name="Nationsencyclopedia-Hist" />

=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===

{{Main|Old Swiss Confederacy}}

[[File:Bundesbrief.jpg|thumb|right|The 1291 ''Bundesbrief'' (federal charter)]]

The Old Swiss Confederacy was an alliance among the valley communities of the central Alps. The Confederacy was governed by [[Swiss nobility|nobles]] and [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patricians]] of various cantons who facilitated management of common interests and ensured peace on mountain trade routes. The [[Federal Charter of 1291]] is considered the confederacy's founding document, even though similar alliances likely existed decades earlier. The document was agreed among the [[Medieval commune|rural communes]] of [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], and [[Unterwalden]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Greanias |first=Thomas |title=Geschichte der Schweiz und der Schweizer |publisher=Schwabe |year=2004 |isbn=978-3-7965-2067-9 |location=Basel |oclc=255970548}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2023}}<ref name="Brief">{{Cite web |title=A Brief Survey of Swiss History |url=http://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/reps/ocea/vaus/infoch/chhist.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626222448/http://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/reps/ocea/vaus/infoch/chhist.html |archive-date=26 June 2009 |access-date=22 June 2009 |publisher=Federal Department of Foreign Affairs}}</ref>

By 1353, the three original [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] had joined with the cantons of [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]] and [[Canton of Zug|Zug]] and the [[Lucerne]], [[Zurich]] and [[Bern]] city-states to form the "Old Confederacy" of eight states that obtained through the end of the 15th century.<ref name="Brief" /> The expansion led to increased power and wealth for the confederation. By 1460, the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the Rhine to the Alps and the [[Jura mountains]], and the [[University of Basel]] was founded (with a faculty of medicine) establishing a tradition of chemical and medical research. This increased after victories against the Habsburgs ([[Battle of Sempach]], [[Battle of Näfels]]), over [[Charles the Bold]] of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] during the 1470s, and the success of the [[Swiss mercenaries]]. The Swiss victory in the [[Swabian War]] against the [[Swabian League]] of [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in 1499 amounted to ''de facto'' independence within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref name="Brief" /> In 1501, Basel<ref>{{Cite web |title=Der Basler Bundesbrief vom 9.

The Confederacy acquired a reputation of invincibility during these earlier wars, but [[Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy|expansion of the confederation]] suffered a setback in 1515 with the Swiss defeat in the [[Battle of Marignano]]. This ended the so-called "heroic" epoch of Swiss history.<ref name="Brief" /> The success of [[Zwingli]]'s [[Reformation in Switzerland|Reformation]] in some cantons led to inter-cantonal religious conflicts in 1529 and 1531 ([[Wars of Kappel]]). It was not until more than one hundred years after these internal wars that, in 1648, under the [[Peace of Westphalia]], European countries recognised Switzerland's independence from the Holy Roman Empire and its [[neutral country|neutrality]].<ref name="Nationsencyclopedia-Hist" /><ref name="Nationsonline" />

During the [[Early Modern Switzerland|Early Modern]] period of Swiss history, the growing authoritarianism of the patriciate families<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Bertholet |first1=Auguste |url=https://www.sgeaj.ch/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/bertholet-kapossy-la-physiocratie-et-la-suisse-2023.pdf |title=La Physiocratie et la Suisse |last2=Kapossy |first2=Béla |publisher=Slatkine |year=2023 |isbn=9782051029391 |location=Geneva |language=fr}}</ref> combined with a financial crisis in the wake of the [[Thirty Years' War]] led to the [[Swiss peasant war of 1653]]. In the background to this struggle, the conflict between [[Roman Catholicism in Switzerland|Catholic]] and [[Protestantism in Switzerland|Protestant]] cantons persisted, erupting in further violence at the [[First War of Villmergen]], in 1656, and the [[Toggenburg War]] (or Second War of Villmergen), in 1712.<ref name="Brief" />

=== Napoleonic era ===
{{Main|Switzerland in the Napoleonic era|Helvetic Republic|Act of Mediation}}

[[File:Acte de Médiation mg 0643.jpg|thumb|The Act of Mediation was Napoleon's attempt at a compromise between the [[Ancien Régime]] and a Republic.]]
In 1798, the [[French Revolution|revolutionary French]] government invaded Switzerland and imposed a new unified constitution.<ref name="Brief" /> This centralised the government of the country, effectively abolishing the cantons: moreover, [[Mülhausen]] left Switzerland and the [[Valtellina]] valley became part of the [[Cisalpine Republic]]. The new regime, known as the Helvetic Republic, was highly unpopular. An invading foreign army had imposed and destroyed centuries of tradition, making Switzerland nothing more than a French [[satellite state]]. The fierce French suppression of the [[Nidwalden]] Revolt in September 1798 was an example of the oppressive presence of the [[French Army]] and the local population's resistance to the occupation.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

When war broke out between France and its rivals, Russian and [[Habsburg monarchy|Austrian]] forces invaded Switzerland. The Swiss refused to fight alongside the French in the name of the Helvetic Republic. In 1803 [[Napoleon]] organised a meeting of the leading Swiss politicians from both sides in Paris. The [[Act of Mediation]] was the result, which largely restored Swiss autonomy and introduced a Confederation of 19 cantons.<ref name="Brief" /> Henceforth, much of Swiss politics would concern balancing the cantons' tradition of self-rule with the need for a central government.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Linder |first1=Wolf |last2=Vatter |first2=Adrian |date=2001 |title=Institutions and outcomes of Swiss federalism: The role of the cantons in Swiss politics |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402380108425435 |journal=[[West European Politics]] |language=en |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=95 |doi=10.1080/01402380108425435 |issn=0140-2382 |access-date=11 June 2024 |archive-date=22 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230622141822/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402380108425435 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription }}</ref>

In 1815, the [[Congress of Vienna]] fully re-established Swiss independence, and the European powers recognised permanent Swiss neutrality.<ref name="Nationsencyclopedia-Hist" /><ref name="Nationsonline" /><ref name="Brief" /> Swiss troops served foreign governments until 1860 when they fought in the [[Siege of Gaeta (1860)|siege of Gaeta]]. The treaty allowed Switzerland to increase its territory, with the admission of the cantons of [[Valais]], [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]] and [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]]. Switzerland's borders saw only minor adjustments thereafter.<ref>{{HDS|7841|Swiss border ("Les principales rectifications postérieures à 1815 concernent la vallée des Dappes en 1862 (frontière Vaud-France, env. 7,5 km2), la valle di Lei en 1952 (Grisons-Italie, 0,45 km2), l'Ellhorn en 1955 (colline revendiquée par la Suisse pour des raisons militaires, Grisons-Liechtenstein) et l'enclave allemande du Verenahof dans le canton de Schaffhouse en 1967.")}}.

=== Federal state ===
{{Main|Restoration and Regeneration (Switzerland)|Switzerland as a federal state}}
[[File:Bern, Federal Palace, 1857.jpg|thumb|The first [[Federal Palace]] in Bern (1857). One of the three cantons presiding over the [[Tagsatzung]] (former legislative and executive council), Bern was chosen as the permanent seat of federal legislative and executive institutions in 1848, in part because of its closeness to the French-speaking area.<ref name="Bundesstadt" />]]

The restoration of power to the patriciate was only temporary. After a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes, such as the [[Züriputsch]] of 1839, civil war (the ''[[Sonderbundskrieg]]'') broke out in 1847 when some Catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance (the ''Sonderbund'').<ref name="Brief" /> The war lasted less than a month, causing fewer than 100 casualties, most of which were through [[friendly fire]]. The Sonderbundskrieg had a significant impact on the psychology and society of Switzerland.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}{{who|date=September 2022}}

The war convinced most Swiss of the need for unity and strength. Swiss from all strata of society, whether Catholic or Protestant, from the liberal or conservative current, realised that the cantons would profit more from merging their economic and religious interests.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Thus, while the rest of Europe saw [[revolutions of 1848|revolutionary uprisings]], the Swiss drew up a constitution that provided for a [[Swiss Federal Constitution|federal layout]], much of it inspired by the [[United States Constitution|American example]]. This constitution provided central authority while leaving the cantons the right to self-government on local issues. Giving credit to those who favoured the power of the cantons (the Sonderbund Kantone), the national assembly was divided between an [[upper house]] (the [[Swiss Council of States|Council of States]], two representatives per canton) and a [[lower house]] (the [[National Council of Switzerland|National Council]], with representatives elected from across the country). [[Referendum]]s were made mandatory for any amendments.<ref name="Nationsonline" /> This new constitution ended the legal power of [[Swiss nobility#Current situation|nobility in Switzerland]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Noblesse en Suisse |url=http://www.diesbach.com/sghcf/n/noblesse.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192147/http://www.diesbach.com/sghcf/n/noblesse.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |access-date=22 October 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Gotthard Eröffnungszug Bellinzona.jpg|thumb|left|Inauguration in 1882 of the [[Gotthard rail tunnel]] connecting the southern canton of Ticino, the longest in the world at the time]]
A single system of weights and measures was introduced, and in 1850 the [[Swiss franc]] became the Swiss [[single currency]], complemented by the WIR franc in 1934.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The WIR, the supplementary Swiss currency since 1934 |url=https://www.theeconomyjournal.eu/texto-diario/mostrar/758830/wir-moneda-complementaria-suiza-activo-desde-1934 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210612070424/https://www.theeconomyjournal.eu/texto-diario/mostrar/758830/wir-moneda-complementaria-suiza-activo-desde-1934 |archive-date=12 June 2021 |access-date=12 June 2021 |website=The Economy Journal |language=en}}</ref> Article 11 of the constitution forbade sending troops to serve abroad, marking the end of foreign service. It came with the expectation of serving the [[Holy See]], and the Swiss were still obliged to serve [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies]] with Swiss Guards present at the [[Siege of Gaeta (1860)|siege of Gaeta in 1860]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

An important clause of the constitution was that it could be entirely rewritten, if necessary, thus enabling it to evolve as a whole rather than being modified one amendment at a time.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Ducrest |first1=Jean Pierre |title=Histoire de la Suisse |last2=Dorand |first2=Michel |publisher=Editions Fragnière |year=1987 |oclc=702317703}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2023}}

This need soon proved itself when the rise in population and the [[Industrial Revolution]] that followed led to calls to modify the constitution accordingly. The population rejected an early draft in 1872, but modifications led to its acceptance in 1874.<ref name="Brief" /> It introduced the [[Referendum#Switzerland|facultative referendum]] for laws at the federal level. It also established federal responsibility for defence, trade, and legal matters.

In 1891, the constitution was revised with uncommonly strong elements of [[direct democracy]], which remain unique today.<ref name="Brief" />
