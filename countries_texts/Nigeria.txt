[[Kainji Dam]] excavations showed ironworking by the 2nd century BC. The transition from [[Neolithic]] times to the [[Iron Age]] was accomplished without intermediate [[Bronze Age|bronze]] production. Some have suggested the technology moved west from the [[Nile Valley]]. But the [[Iron metallurgy in Africa|Iron Age]] in the [[Niger River]] valley and the forest region appears to predate the introduction of metallurgy in the upper savanna by more than 800 years, as well as predating it in the Nile Valley. More recent research suggests that iron metallurgy was developed independently in [[Africa]].<ref name="Tylecote 1975 see below">Tylecote 1975 (see below)</ref><ref name="Eggert 2014 51–59">{{cite book|title=Nok: African Sculpture in Archaeological Context|last=Eggert|first=Manfred|publisher=Africa Magna Verlag Press|year=2014|editor-last=Breunig|editor-first=P|location=Frankfurt, Germany|pages=51–59|chapter=Early iron in West and Central Africa}}</ref><ref name="Eggert 2014 53–54">{{cite book|title=Nok: African Sculpture in Archaeological Context|last=Eggert|first=Manfred|publisher=Africa Magna Verlag Press|year=2014|isbn=9783937248462|editor-last=Breunig|editor-first=P|location=Frankfurt, Germany|pages=53–54|chapter=Early iron in West and Central Africa|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBn1BQAAQBAJ&q=Nok+Breunig&pg=PA38}}</ref><ref name="Holl-2020#2">{{cite journal|last1=Holl |first1=Augustin F.

===Early history ===
{{Main|History of Nigeria before 1500}}
The ''[[Kano Chronicle]]'' highlights an ancient history dating to around 999 AD of the [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa]] [[Sahelian kingdoms|Sahelian city-state]] of [[Kingdom of Kano|Kano]], with other major Hausa cities (or [[Hausa Bakwai]]) of [[Daura]], [[Hadejia|Biram]], [[Kingdom of Katsina|Katsina]], [[Kingdom of Zazzau]], [[Rano]], and [[Gobir]] all having recorded histories dating back to the 10th century. With the spread of Islam from the 7th century AD, the area became known as ''[[Sudan (region)|Sudan]]'' or as ''Bilad Al Sudan'' (English: Land of the Blacks). Since the populations were partially affiliated with the Arab Muslim culture of [[North Africa]], they began [[trans-Saharan trade]] and were referred to by the Arabic speakers as ''Al-Sudan'' (meaning "The Blacks") as they were considered an extended part of the [[Muslim world]]. There are early historical references by medieval Arab and Muslim historians and geographers which refer to the [[Kanem–Bornu Empire]] as the region's major centre for Islamic civilization.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

In the 16th century, [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorers]] were the first [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] to begin important, direct trade with the peoples of southern Nigeria, at the port they named Lagos (formerly Eko) and in [[Calabar]] along the region [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]. Europeans traded goods with peoples at the coast; coastal trade with Europeans also marked the beginnings of the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref name="diverse-slavery">{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=April A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H26pO3vwmHoC&pg=PA54|title=Nigeria's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2003|isbn=978-1-57607-682-8|pages=44–54|access-date=29 March 2015}}</ref> The port of Calabar on the historical [[Bight of Biafra]] (now commonly referred to as the Bight of Bonny) became one of the largest slave-trading posts in West Africa in this era.

In the north, the incessant fighting amongst the Hausa city-states and the decline of the [[Kanem–Bornu Empire|Bornu Empire]] allowed the Fulani people to gain headway into the region. Until this point, the Fulani, a [[nomad]]ic ethnic group, primarily traversed the semi-desert [[Sahel]]ian region north of Sudan with cattle and avoided trade and intermingling with the Sudanic peoples. At the beginning of the 19th century, [[Usman dan Fodio]] led [[Fulani War|a successful jihad]] against the [[Hausa Kingdoms]], founding the centralised [[Sokoto Caliphate]]. This empire, with Arabic as its official language, grew rapidly under his rule and that of [[List of Sultans of Sokoto|his descendants]], who sent out [[Fula jihads|invading armies]] in every direction. The vast landlocked empire connected the east with the western Sudan region and made inroads down south conquering parts of the Oyo Empire (modern-day [[Kwara State|Kwara]]), and advanced towards the [[Yorubaland|Yoruba heartland]] of [[Ibadan]], to reach the Atlantic Ocean. The territory controlled by the empire included much of modern-day northern and central Nigeria. The sultan sent out emirs to establish [[suzerainty]] over the conquered territories and promote Islamic civilization; the emirs in turn became increasingly rich and powerful through trade and slavery. By the 1890s, the largest [[Slavery in Africa|slave population]] in the world, about two million, was concentrated in the territories of the Sokoto [[Caliphate]]. The use of slave labour was extensive, especially in agriculture.<ref>Shillington, Kevin, ''[[Encyclopedia of African History]]''. (U of Michigan Press, 2005) p. 1401.</ref> By the time of its break-up in 1903 into various European colonies, the Sokoto Caliphate was one of the largest pre-colonial African states.<ref>Adam, Abba Idris, "Re-inventing Islamic Civilization in the Sudanic Belt: The Role of Sheikh Usman Dan Fodio."

A changing legal imperative (the outlawing of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] in 1807) and economic imperative (a desire for political and social stability) led most European powers to support the widespread cultivation of agricultural products, such as the palm, for use in European industry. The slave trade continued after the ban, as illegal smugglers purchased slaves along the coast from native slavers. Britain's [[West Africa Squadron]] sought to intercept the smugglers at sea. The [[Saro people|rescued slaves]] were taken to [[Freetown]], a colony in West Africa originally established by [[John Clarkson (abolitionist)|Lieutenant John Clarkson]] for the resettlement of slaves freed by Britain in North America after the [[American Revolutionary War]].

=== British colonization and independence ===
{{Main|Colonial Nigeria|3 = Federation of Nigeria}}
[[File:Flag of Lagos Colony (1888–1906).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Lagos Colony]]]]
Britain intervened in the Lagos kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave-trade-friendly [[Kosoko|Oba Kosoko]], helping to install the amenable Oba [[Akitoye]] and signing the [[Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852|Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos]] on 1{{nbsp}}January 1852. [[United Kingdom|Britain]] annexed Lagos as a [[crown colony]] in August 1861 with the [[Lagos Treaty of Cession]]. British missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland. In 1864, [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther]] became the first African [[Church of Nigeria|bishop of the Anglican Church]].<ref>[[Derek R. Peterson|Peterson, Derek R.]], ed., ''Abolitionism and imperialism in Britain, Africa, and the Atlantic'' (Ohio University Press, 2010).</ref> In 1885, British claims to a West African [[sphere of influence]] received recognition from other European nations at the [[Berlin Conference]]. The following year, it chartered the [[Royal Niger Company]] under the leadership of Sir [[George Taubman Goldie]]. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the company had vastly succeeded in subjugating the independent southern kingdoms along the [[Niger River]], the British conquered [[Benin Empire|Benin]] in 1897, and, in the [[Anglo-Aro War]] (1901–1902), defeated other opponents. The defeat of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule. In 1900, the company's territory came under the direct control of the British government and established the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate]] as a British [[protectorate]] and part of the [[British Empire]].

By 1902, the British had begun plans to move north into the Sokoto Caliphate. British General Lord [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Frederick Lugard]] was tasked by the [[Colonial Office]] to implement the agenda. Lugard used rivalries between many of the emirs in the southern reach of the caliphate and the central Sokoto administration to prevent any defence as he worked towards the capital. As the British approached the city of [[Sokoto (city)|Sokoto]], Sultan [[Muhammadu Attahiru I]] organized a quick defence of the city and fought the advancing British-led forces. The British force quickly won, sending Attahiru I and thousands of followers on a [[Mahdi]]st ''[[Hegira|hijra]]''. In the northeast, the decline of the [[Kanem–Bornu Empire|Bornu Empire]] gave rise to the British-controlled [[Borno Emirate]] which established [[Abubakar Garbai of Borno]] as ruler.

[[File:Emir of Kano-1911.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Abbas (Emir of Kano)|Emir of Kano]] with cavalry, 1911]]
In 1903, the British victory in the [[Battle of Kano (1903)|Battle of Kano]] gave them a logistical edge in [[Battle of Kwatarkwashi|pacifying the heartland of the Sokoto Caliphate]] and parts of the former Bornu Empire. On 13 March 1903, at the grand market square of Sokoto, the last [[Sokoto Grand Vizier|vizier of the caliphate]] officially conceded to British rule.  The British appointed [[Muhammadu Attahiru II]] as the new caliph. Lugard abolished the caliphate but retained the title ''sultan'' as a symbolic position in the newly organized [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]]. This remnant became known as "[[Sokoto Sultanate Council]]". In June 1903, the British defeated the remaining northern forces of Attahiru. The caliphate forces in the south continued to resist the British and Germans in the [[Adamawa Wars]]. By 1906, resistance to British rule in the area had been quelled. 

On 1 January 1914, the British formally united the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate]] and the [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]] into the [[Colonial Nigeria|Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria]]. Administratively, Nigeria remained divided into the Northern and Southern Protectorates and [[Lagos Colony]]. Inhabitants of the southern region sustained more interaction, economic and cultural, with the British and other Europeans owing to the coastal economy.<ref>Falola, Toyin, and Matthew M. Heaton, ''A History of Nigeria'' (2008), pp. 85–109.</ref> Christian missions established Western educational institutions in the protectorates.

By the mid-20th century following [[World War II]], a [[Decolonisation of Africa|wave for independence]] was sweeping across Africa, in response to the growth of Nigerian nationalism and demands for independence, successive constitutions legislated by the British government moved Nigeria toward self-government on a representative and increasingly federal basis. By the eve of independence in 1960, regional differences in modern educational access were marked. The legacy, though less pronounced, continues to the present day. The balance between north and south was also expressed in Nigeria's political life. For instance, northern Nigeria did not outlaw slavery until 1936 whilst in other parts of Nigeria, slavery was abolished soon after colonialism.<ref>{{cite web |title=The end of slavery |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page56.shtml |access-date=28 May 2011 |work=The Story of Africa |publisher=BBC News |archive-date=23 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200723083115/http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page56.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="slave-trade" />[[File:Stamp Cameroons 2d-600px.jpg|thumb|1953 postage stamp with portrait of Queen [[Elizabeth II]]]][[File:Nnamdi Azikiwe PC (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Nnamdi Azikiwe]], first President of Nigeria (1963–1966)|upright]]

=== Early republic and civil war ===
{{Main|First Nigerian Republic|Nigerian Civil War|}}

At Nigeria's independence, the [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]] gained more seats in parliament than the southerner [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern]] and [[Western Region of Nigeria|Western]] regions combined—this would cement Northern dominance in Nigerian politics for years to come. Resentment among southern politicians precipitated into political chaos in the country. [[Obafemi Awolowo]], Premier of Western Region, was accused of attempting to overthrow the government. This followed a period of conflict between the AG regional government and the central government. In spite of the flimsiness of the evidence presented by the government's prosecutors, he was convicted. With incarceration of Awolowo, [[Samuel Akintola]] took over as the premier of Western Region. Because Akintola was an ally of Ahmadu Bello, the undisputed strong man of Nigeria, Akintola was criticized as being a tool of the North.<ref>John de St. Jorre, ''The Nigerian Civil War'' (Hodder and Stroughto Publishers: London, 1972, p. 30</ref> As premier of the West, Akintola presided over the most chaotic era in Western Region—one which earned it the nickname "[[Wild West|the Wild-Wild West]]". However, as late as Thursday, 13 January 1966, Balewa had announced that the federal government was not going to intervene in the West.<ref>John de St. Jorre, ''The Nigerian Civil War'' (Hodder and Stoughton Publishers: London, 1972) p. 30.</ref> However, the very next day, Akintola, premier of the West met with his ally Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto, premier of the North and party boss of NPC party to which Balewa belonged.<ref name="Jorre, p. 30">John de St. Jorre, ''The Nigerian Civil War'', p. 30.</ref> At the same time a top-level security conference in Lagos was taking place which was attended by most of the country's senior army officiers. All of this activity created rumors that the Balewa government would be forced to crack down on lawlessness in the West using military might.<ref name="Jorre, p. 30" />
The disequilibrium and perceived corruption of the electoral and political process led to two [[Coup d'état|military coups]] in 1966.

Following the war, Nigeria enjoyed an [[oil boom]] in the 1970s, during which the country joined [[OPEC]] and received huge oil revenues. Despite these revenues, the military government did little to improve the [[standard of living]], help small and medium businesses, or invest in infrastructure. As oil revenues fueled the rise of federal subsidies to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns.<ref>Watts, Michael (1987) ''State, Oil and Agriculture in Nigeria'', Institute of International Studies, University of California, {{ISBN|0-87725-166-5}}.</ref>

=== Military dictatorship and coups ===
{{main|Military dictatorship in Nigeria|Military coups in Nigeria}}

The military carefully planned the return to civilian rule putting in place measures to ensure that political parties had broader support than witnessed during the first republic. In 1979, five political parties competed in a series of elections in which Alhaji [[Shehu Shagari]] of the [[National Party of Nigeria]] (NPN) was elected president. All five parties won representation in the National Assembly. On 1 October 1979, Shehu Shagari was sworn in as the first [[President of Nigeria|President and Commander-in-Chief]] of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Obasanjo peacefully transferred power to Shagari, becoming the first head of state in Nigerian history to willingly step down.[[File:Shehu Shagari 1980-10-07.jpg|thumb|[[Shehu Shagari]] was the first elected [[President of Nigeria]] from 1979 to 1983.|upright]]In [[1983 Nigerian presidential election|August 1983]], Shagari and the NPN were returned to power in a landslide victory, with a [[1983 Nigerian parliamentary election|majority of seats in the National Assembly]] and control of 12 state governments. But the elections were marred by violence, and allegations of widespread vote-rigging and electoral malfeasance led to legal battles over the results. There were also uncertainties, such as in the first republic, that political leaders may be unable to govern properly.

The [[1983 Nigerian coup d'état|1983 military coup d'état]] was coordinated by key officers of the Nigerian military and led to the overthrow of the government and the installation of Major General [[Muhammadu Buhari]] as head of state. The military coup of Muhammadu Buhari shortly after the regime's re-election in 1984 was generally viewed as a positive development.<ref>"Nigeria, Military Faces Daunting Challenges", AP Press International, 3{{nbsp}}March 1984.

However, Babangida annulled the elections, leading to massive civilian protests that effectively shut down the country for weeks. In August 1993, Babangida finally kept his promise to relinquish power to a civilian government but not before appointing [[Ernest Shonekan]] head of an [[Cabinet of Ernest Shonekan|interim national government]].<ref>Bilski, Andrew, "Broken Promises", ''Maclean'', 6 September 1993.</ref> Babangida's regime has been considered the most corrupt and responsible for creating a culture of corruption in Nigeria.<ref>Diamond, Larry; [[Kirk-Greene, Anthony]]; [[Oyeleye Oyediran]] (1997) ''Transition without End: Nigerian Politics and Civil Society Under Babangida'', Vantage Publishers, {{ISBN|978-2458-54-6}}.</ref>

Shonekan's interim government, the shortest in the political history of the country, was overthrown in a [[1993 Nigerian coup d'état|coup d'état of 1993]] led by General [[Sani Abacha]], who used military force on a wide scale to end the crisis of the Third Republic.

Abacha looted money to offshore accounts in Western European banks and maintained his grip on power through arrests and bribing generals and politicians. His successor, General [[Abdulsalami Abubakar]], adopted a new constitution on 5 May 1999, which provided for multiparty elections.
