===Ancient history and settlement===
{{main|History of the Maldives#Early Age}}

In the 6th–5th century BCE, Maldives already had their kingdoms.<ref name=":12" /> The country has an established history of over 2,500 years according to historical evidence and legends.<ref>{{Cite book |title=ދިވެހީންގެ އަސްލު |publisher=ދިވެހިތާރީޚަށް ޚިދުމަތްކުރާ ޤައުމީ މަރުކަޒު |year=1998 |location=Maldives |pages=3 |language=dv}}</ref>

The ''[[Mahāvaṃsa]]'' (300 BCE) has records of people from Sri Lanka emigrating to Maldives.<ref name=":12" /> Assuming that cowrie shells come from Maldives, historians believe that there may have been people living in Maldives during the [[Indus Valley civilisation]] (3300{{ndash}}1300 BCE).<ref>{{Cite book |title=ދިވެހީންގެ އަސްލު |publisher=ދިވެހިތާރީޚަށް ޚިދުމަތްކުރާ ޤައުމީ މަރުކަޒު |language=dv}}</ref> Several artefacts show the presence of [[Hinduism]] in the country before the Islamic period.<ref name=":12" />

According to the book {{transliteration|ar|Kitāb fi āthār Mīdhu al-qādimah}} ({{lang|ar|كتاب في آثار ميذو القديمة}}) (''On the Ancient Ruins of [[Meedhoo (Addu)|Meedhoo]]''), written in the 17th century in Arabic by Allama Ahmed Shihabuddine (Allama Shihab al-Din) of [[Meedhoo (Addu)|Meedhoo]] in Addu Atoll, the first settlers of Maldives were people known as Dheyvis.<ref name=":12" /> They came from the [[Kalibangan|Kalibanga]] in India.<ref name=":12" /> The time of their arrival is unknown but it was before Emperor [[Ashoka|Asoka]]'s kingdom in 269–232 BCE. Shihabuddin's story tallies remarkably well with the recorded history of South Asia and that of the copperplate document of Maldives known as [[Lōmāfānu|Loamaafaanu]].<ref name=":12" />

The ancient history of Maldives is told in copperplates, ancient scripts carved on coral artefacts, traditions, language, and different ethnicities of Maldivians.<ref name=":12" /> The ''Maapanansa'',<ref name=":12" /> the copper plates on which were recorded the history of the first [[List of sultans of the Maldives|Kings of Maldives]] from the Solar Dynasty, were lost quite early on.

A 4th-century notice written by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (362 CE) speaks of gifts sent to the Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] by a deputation from the nation of Divi. The name Divi is very similar to Dheyvi who were the first settlers of Maldives.<ref name=":12" />

The first Maldivians did not leave any archaeological artefacts. Their buildings were probably built of wood, palm fronds, and other perishable materials, which would have quickly decayed in the salt and wind of the tropical climate. Moreover, chiefs or headmen did not reside in elaborate stone palaces, nor did their religion require the construction of large temples or compounds.<ref>Kalpana Ram (1993). ''Mukkuvar Women''. Macquarie University.</ref>

Comparative studies of Maldivian oral, linguistic, and cultural traditions confirm that the first settlers were people from the southern shores of the neighbouring [[Indian subcontinent]],<ref name="autogenerated2">Xavier Romero-Frias, ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom''</ref> including the [[Giraavaru people]], mentioned in ancient legends and local folklore about the establishment of the capital and kingly rule in Malé.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ellis |first=Royston |author-link=Royston Ellis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zSjhruMm748C&q=Giraavaru+people&pg=PA36 |title=Maldives |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides |year=2008 |isbn=9781841622668 |access-date=16 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210114164457/https://books.google.com/books?id=zSjhruMm748C&q=Giraavaru+people&pg=PA36 |archive-date=14 January 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>

A strong underlying layer of [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] and [[North Indian culture|North Indian]] cultures survives in Maldivian society, with a clear [[Elu]] substratum in the language, which also appears in place names, kinship terms, poetry, dance, and religious beliefs.<ref name="Maloney, Clarence">{{Cite web |last=Maloney |first=Clarence |title=Where Did the Maldives People Come From? |url=http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn5/insouasi/maloney.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020129221500/http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn5/insouasi/maloney.html |archive-date=29 January 2002 |access-date=22 June 2008 |website=[[International Institute for Asian Studies]]}}</ref> The North Indian system was brought by the original [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] from [[Sri Lanka]].

===Buddhist period===
{{main|History of the Maldives#Buddhist period|Buddhism in the Maldives}}{{More citations needed|date=April 2025}}[[File:Loamaafaanu.jpg|thumb|[[Isdhoo (Laamu Atoll)|Isdhoo]] Lōmāfānu is the oldest [[Lōmāfānu|copper-plate]] book to have been discovered in Maldives to date. The book was written in 1194&nbsp;CE (590&nbsp;AH) in the Evēla form of the [[Dhivehi Writing Systems|Divehi akuru]], during the reign of [[Dhinei of the Maldives|Siri Fennaadheettha Mahaa Radun (Dhinei Kalaminja)]].]]

Despite being just mentioned briefly in most history books, the 1,400&nbsp;year-long Buddhist period has a foundational importance in the history of Maldives. It was during this period that the culture of Maldives both developed and flourished, a culture that survives today. The Maldivian [[Dhivehi language|language]], early Maldive scripts, architecture, ruling institutions, customs, and manners of the Maldivians originated at the time when Maldives were a Buddhist kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Maloney |first=Clarence |title=People of the Maldive Islands |publisher=Orient Longman}}</ref>

Buddhism probably spread to Maldives in the 3rd&nbsp;century&nbsp;BCE at the time of Emperor [[Ashoka]]'s expansion and became the dominant religion of the people of Maldives until the 12th&nbsp;century. Archeological evidence from an ancient Buddhist monastery in [[Kaashidhoo (Kaafu Atoll)|Kaashidhoo]] has been dated between 205 and 560 AD, based on the radiocarbon dating of shell deposits unearthed from the foundations of [[stupa]]s and other structures in the monastery.<ref name="mikkelsen2000">{{cite journal |last=Mikkelsen |first=Egil |year=2000 |title=Archaeological Excavations of a Monastery at Kaashidhoo.

===Islamic period===
{{See also|History of the Maldives#Islamic Period|Islam in Maldives|List of Maldivian monarchs|Sultanate of Maldives}}
The importance of the Arabs as traders in the Indian Ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why the last Buddhist king of Maldives, [[Dhovemi of the Maldives|Dhovemi]], converted to Islam in 1153 (or 1193). Adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad al-Adil, he initiated a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the [[Sultanate of Maldives|sultanate]] became elective. The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was, ''Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of Maldives'' which came with the style ''[[Highness]]''.

A Moroccan traveller named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari is traditionally cited for this conversion.<ref name=":2" /> According to the story told to [[Ibn Battutah]], a mosque was built with the inscription: 'The Sultan Ahmad Shanurazah accepted Islam at the hand of Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari.'<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Battutah |first=Ibn |title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah |date=2002 |publisher=Picador |isbn=9780330418799 |location=London |pages=235–236, 320}}</ref><ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZF2spo9BKacC The Adventures of Ibn Battuta: A Muslim Traveller of the Fourteenth Century] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412233846/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZF2spo9BKacC |date=12 April 2016 }}''</ref> The folk tale regarding the spread of Islam by al-Barbari involved a local belief to an oceanic deity named [[Rannamaari]]. According to the legend, Rannamaari demanded sacrifice of a female virgin each month from the locals.

Some scholars have suggested the possibility of Ibn Battuta misreading Maldive texts, and having a bias towards the North African, Maghrebi narrative of this Shaykh, instead of the Persian origins account that was known as well at the time.<ref>{{Citation |last=Honchell |first=Stephanie |title=Sufis, Sea Monsters, and Miraculous Circumcisions: Comparative Conversion Narratives and Popular Memories of Islamization |page=5 |year=2018 |url=https://humanities.uct.ac.za/sites/default/files/content_migration/humanities_uct_ac_za/309/files/Paper%2520-%2520Sufis%2520Sea%2520Monsters%2520and%2520Miraculous%2520Circumcisions.pdf |publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] and the [[University of Cape Town]] |quote=In reference to Ibn Battuta's Moroccan theory of this figure, citation 8 of this text mentions, that other accounts identify Yusuf Al Barbari as East African or Persian.

Following the Islamic concept that before Islam there was the time of [[Jahiliyyah|Jahiliya]] (ignorance), in the history books used by Maldivians the [[#Introduction of Islam|introduction of Islam]] at the end of the 12th century is considered the cornerstone of the country's history.

In particular, he was angered at the local women going about with no clothing above the waist— a cultural epithet of the region at the time- was seen as a violation of Middle Eastern Islamic rules of modesty—and the locals taking no notice when he complained.<ref>Jerry Bently, ''Old World Encounters Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 126''.</ref>

Compared to the other areas of South Asia, the conversion of Maldives to Islam happened relatively late. Maldives remained a Buddhist kingdom for another 500 years. Arabic became the prime language of administration (instead of Persian and Urdu), and the [[Maliki]] school of jurisprudence was introduced, both hinting at direct contact with the core of the Arab world.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

Middle Eastern seafarers had just begun to take over the Indian Ocean trade routes in the 10th century and found Maldives to be an important link in those routes as the first landfall for traders from [[Basra]] sailing to Southeast Asia. Trade involved mainly [[cowrie shells]]—widely used as a form of currency throughout Asia and parts of the East African coast—and coir fibre. The [[Bengal Sultanate]], where cowrie shells were used as legal tender, was one of the principal trading partners of Maldives. The Bengal–Maldives cowry shell trade was the largest shell currency trade network in history.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Boomgaard |first=P. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXphAAAAQBAJ |title=Linking Destinies: Trade, Towns and Kin in Asian History |date=1 January 2008 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004253995 |access-date=23 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106131821/https://books.google.com/books?id=TXphAAAAQBAJ |archive-date=6 January 2017 |url-status=live |via=Google Books}}</ref>

The other essential product of Maldives was [[coir]], the fibre of the dried [[coconut]] [[husk]], resistant to saltwater. It stitched together and rigged the [[dhow]]s that plied the Indian Ocean. Maldivian coir was exported to [[Sindh]], [[China]], [[Yemen]], and the [[Persian Gulf]].

===Protectorate period===
[[File:ConstantinoBraganca.jpg|thumb|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese presence]] in Maldives was established in 1558, by order of [[Constantino of Braganza]], Viceroy of [[Portuguese India]].]]

In 1558, the Portuguese established a small garrison with a {{lang|pt|Viador}} ({{transliteration|dv|Viyazoaru}}), or overseer of a [[factory (trading post)]] in Maldives, which they administered from their main colony in [[Goa]]. Their attempts to forcefully impose Christianity with the threat of death provoked a local revolt led by [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu al-Auzam|Muhammad Thakurufaanu al-A'uẓam]], his two brothers, and [[Dhuvaafaru]] Dhandahele, who fifteen years later drove the Portuguese out of Maldives. This event is now commemorated as [[Qaumee Dhuvas]] ({{Literal translation|National Day}}). It is celebrated on the 1st of [[Rabi' al-Awwal]], the third month of [[Islamic Calendar|Hijri]] (Islamic) calendar.<ref name="qaumiyyath">{{Cite web |title=As-Sultan Al-Ghaazee Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al-Auzam |url=https://www.qaumiyyath.gov.mv/docs/whitepapers/history/Mohamed%20Thakurufaanu.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231111100308/http://www.qaumiyyath.gov.mv/docs/whitepapers/history/Mohamed%20Thakurufaanu.pdf |archive-date=11 November 2023 |access-date=11 November 2023 |website=National Centre for Linguistic and Historical Research}}</ref>

In the mid-17th century, the Dutch, who had replaced the Portuguese as the dominant power in [[Ceylon]], established hegemony over Maldivian affairs without involving themselves directly in local matters, which were governed according to centuries-old Islamic customs.

The British expelled the Dutch from Ceylon in 1796 and included Maldives as a [[British protectorate]]. The status of Maldives as a British protectorate was officially recorded in an 1887 agreement in which the sultan [[Muhammad Mueenuddeen II]] accepted British influence over Maldivian external relations and defence while retaining home rule, which continued to be regulated by [[Muslim]] traditional institutions in exchange for an [[Maldivian annual tribute|annual tribute]]. The status of the islands was akin to other British protectorates in the Indian Ocean region, including [[Zanzibar]] and the [[Trucial States]].

In the British period, the Sultan's powers were taken over by the Chief Minister, much to the chagrin of the British Governor-General who continued to deal with the ineffectual Sultan. Consequently, Britain encouraged the development of a [[constitutional monarchy]], and the first Constitution was proclaimed in 1932. However, the new arrangements favoured neither the Sultan nor the Chief Minister, but rather a young crop of British-educated reformists. As a result, angry mobs were instigated against the Constitution which was publicly torn up.

Maldives remained a British crown protectorate until 1953 when the sultanate was suspended and the First Republic was declared under the short-lived presidency of [[Mohamed Amin Didi]]. While serving as prime minister during the 1940s, Didi nationalised the fish export industry. As president, he is remembered as a reformer of the education system and an advocate of [[women's rights]]. Conservatives in Malé ousted his government, and during a riot over food shortages, Didi was beaten by a mob and died on a nearby island.

Beginning in the 1950s, the political history in Maldives was largely influenced by the British military presence on the islands. In 1954, the restoration of the sultanate perpetuated the rule of the past. Two years later, the United Kingdom obtained permission to reestablish its wartime [[RAF Gan]] airfield in the southernmost Addu Atoll, employing hundreds of locals. In 1957, however, the new prime minister, [[Ibrahim Nasir]], called for a review of the agreement. Nasir was challenged in 1959 by a local secessionist movement in the three southernmost atolls that benefited economically from the British presence on [[Gan (Addu Atoll)|Gan]]. This group cut ties with Maldives government and formed an independent state, the [[United Suvadive Republic]] with [[Abdullah Afeef]] as president and [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]] as its capital. One year later the Suvadive Republic was scrapped after Nasir sent gunboats from Malé with government police, and Abdullah Afeef went into exile. Meanwhile, in 1960 Maldives allowed the United Kingdom to continue to use both the [[RAF Gan|Gan]] and the Hithadhoo facilities for thirty years, with the payment of £750,000 from 1960 to 1965 for Maldives' economic development. The base was closed in 1976 as part of the larger British withdrawal of permanently stationed forces '[[East of Suez]]'.<ref name="gan.philliptsmall.me.uk">{{Cite web |last=Geary |first=Peter |date=17 May 1971 |title=The Sun never sets on the British Empire |url=http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919212227/http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |archive-date=19 September 2013 |access-date=2 April 2013 |website=gan.philliptsmall.me.uk}}</ref>

When the British became increasingly unable to continue their colonial hold on Asia and were losing their colonies to the indigenous populations who wanted freedom, on 26 July 1965 an agreement was signed on behalf of the Sultan by Ibrahim Nasir Rannabandeyri Kilegefan, Prime Minister, and on behalf of the British government by [[Michael Walker (diplomat)|Sir Michael Walker]], British Ambassador-designate to the Maldive Islands, which formally ended the British authority on the defence and external affairs of Maldives.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Davies |first1=Laura |title=Maldives at Fifty: penning a chapter in history |url=https://blogs.fcdo.gov.uk/lauradavies/2015/07/26/maldives-at-fifty-penning-a-chapter-in-history/ |website=Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office |date=26 July 2015 |access-date=26 July 2015 |archive-date=25 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210425135723/https://blogs.fcdo.gov.uk/lauradavies/2015/07/26/maldives-at-fifty-penning-a-chapter-in-history/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The islands thus achieved independence, with the ceremony taking place at the British High Commissioner's Residence in [[Colombo]].

[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] began his 30-year role as president in 1978, winning six consecutive elections without opposition. His election was seen as ushering in a period of political stability and economic development given Maumoon's priority to develop the poorer islands. Tourism flourished and increased foreign contact spurred development. However, Maumoon's rule was controversial, with some critics saying Maumoon was an autocrat who quelled dissent by limiting freedoms and practising political favouritism.<ref name="cnn_sinking">{{Cite news |date=11 November 2008 |title=Sinking island nation seeks new home |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/11/maldives.president/index.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206023636/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/11/maldives.president/index.html |archive-date=6 December 2008 |access-date=12 November 2008 |publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref>
