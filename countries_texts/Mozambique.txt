From the late first millennium AD, vast [[Indian Ocean trade]] networks extended as far south as present day [[Vilankulo]], as evidenced by the ancient port town of [[Chibuene]].<ref name="Sinclair2">{{cite journal|last1=Sinclair|first1=Paul|last2=Ekblom|first2=Anneli|last3=Wood|first3=Marilee|title=Trade and Society on the Southeast African Coast in the Later First Millennium AD: the Case of Chibuene|journal=Antiquity|year=2012|volume=86|issue=333|pages=723–737|doi=10.1017/S0003598X00047876|s2cid=160887653}}</ref> Beginning in the 9th century, a growing involvement in Indian Ocean trade led to the development of numerous port towns along the entire East African coast, including modern day Mozambique. Largely autonomous, these towns broadly participated in the incipient [[Swahili culture]]. Islam was often adopted by urban elites, facilitating trade. In Mozambique, [[Sofala]], [[Angoche]], and Mozambique Island were regional powers by the 15th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rathee|first=D.|date=2021|title=Hunt for Oil in Offshore Angoche, Mozambique|journal=Fifth EAGE Eastern Africa Petroleum Geoscience Forum|pages=1–5|publisher=European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers|doi=10.3997/2214-4609.2021605026|s2cid=236669258}}</ref>

The towns traded with merchants from both the African interior and the broader Indian Ocean world. Particularly important were the gold and ivory caravan routes. Inland states like the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]] and [[Kingdom of Mutapa]] provided the coveted gold and ivory, which were then exchanged up the coast to larger port cities like [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] and [[Mombasa]].<ref>Newitt, Malyn.

The [[Island of Mozambique]], after which the country is named, is a small coral island at the mouth of Mossuril Bay on the [[Nacala]] coast of northern Mozambique, and was first explored by Europeans in the late 15th century.

When Portuguese explorers reached Mozambique in 1498, Arab-trading settlements had existed along the coast and outlying islands for several centuries.<ref name="gupta">{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=Pamila|title=Portuguese decolonization in the Indian Ocean world: History and ethnography|date=2019|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|location=London|isbn=978-1-350-04365-7}}{{rp|page=27}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite book|last1=Isaacman|first1=Allen|last2=Peterson|first2=Derek|chapter=Making the Chikunda: Military Slavery and Ethnicity in Southern Africa, 1750–1900|editor1-last=Brown|editor1-first=Christopher Leslie|editor2-last=Morgan|editor2-first=Philip D.|title=Arming Slaves: From Classical Times to the Modern Age|date=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-13485-8|pages=95–119|doi=10.12987/yale/9780300109009.003.0005}}</ref> From about 1500, Portuguese trading posts and forts displaced the Arabic commercial and military hegemony, becoming regular ports of call on the new European sea route to the east,<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/><ref name="EBmoz"/> the first steps in what was to become a process of colonisation.<ref name="EBmoz">{{cite book|last1=Sheldon|first1=Kathleen Eddy|last2=Penvenne|first2=Jeanne Marie|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Mozambique|access-date=7 June 2021|language=en|chapter=Mozambique: Arrival of the Portuguese|archive-date=5 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210205083321/https://www.britannica.com/place/Mozambique|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Newitt">{{cite journal|last1=Newitt|first1=Malyn|title=Mozambique Island: The Rise and Decline of an East African Coastal City, 1500–1700|journal=Portuguese Studies|date=2004|volume=20|pages=21–37|doi=10.1353/port.2004.0001|jstor=41105216|s2cid=245842110|issn=0267-5315}}</ref>

The voyage of [[Vasco da Gama]] around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1498 marked the Portuguese entry into trade, politics, and society of the region. The Portuguese gained control of the Island of Mozambique and the port city of Sofala in the early 16th century, and by the 1530s, small groups of Portuguese traders and prospectors seeking gold penetrated the interior regions. Here they set up garrisons and trading posts at [[Sena, Mozambique|Sena]] and [[Tete, Mozambique|Tete]] on the Zambezi and tried to gain exclusive control over the gold trade.<ref name="auto"/>

In the central part of the Mozambique territory, the Portuguese attempted to legitimise and consolidate their trade and settlement positions through the creation of ''[[prazo]]s''.<ref name="auto" /> These land grants tied emigrants to their settlements, and inland Mozambique was largely left to be administered by ''prazeiros'', the grant holders, while central authorities in Portugal concentrated their direct exercise of power on, in their view, the more important Portuguese possessions in Asia and the Americas.<ref name="auto" /><ref name="Isaac2000">{{cite journal|last1=Isaacman|first1=Allen|title=Chikunda transfrontiersmen and transnational migrations in pre-colonial South Central Africa, c. 1850–1900|journal=Zambezia|date=2000|volume=27|issue=2|page=109|hdl=10520/AJA03790622_4|url=https://hdl.handle.net/10520/AJA03790622_4|access-date=7 June 2021|archive-date=18 May 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240518175519/https://journals.co.za/doi/abs/10.10520/AJA03790622_4|url-status=live}}</ref> Slavery in Mozambique pre-dated European-contact. African rulers and chiefs dealt in enslaved people, first with Arab Muslim traders, who sent the enslaved to Middle East Asia cities and plantations, and later with Portuguese and other European traders. In a continuation of the trade, slaves were supplied by warring local African rulers, who raided enemy tribes and sold their captives to the ''prazeiros''. The authority of the ''prazeiros'' was exercised and upheld amongst the local population by armies of these enslaved men, whose members became known as ''[[Chikunda]]''.<ref name="auto"/> Continuing emigration from Portugal occurred at comparatively low levels until late in the nineteenth century, promoting "Africanisation".<ref name="auto" /> While ''prazos'' were originally intended to be held solely by Portuguese colonists, through intermarriage and the relative isolation of ''prazeiros'' from ongoing Portuguese influences, the ''prazos'' became African-Portuguese or African-Indian.<ref name="auto"/><ref name="EBmoz"/>

Although Portuguese influence gradually expanded, its power was limited and exercised through individual settlers and officials who were granted extensive autonomy. The Portuguese were able to wrest much of the coastal trade from Arab Muslims between 1500 and 1700, but, with the Arab Muslim seizure of Portugal's key foothold at [[Fort Jesus]] on [[Mombasa Island]] (now in Kenya) in 1698, the pendulum began to swing in the other direction. As a result, investment lagged while [[Lisbon]] devoted itself to the more lucrative trade with India and the Far East and to the colonisation of Brazil.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>

The [[Mazrui]] and [[History of Oman|Omani Arabs]] reclaimed much of the Indian Ocean trade, forcing the Portuguese to retreat south. Many ''prazos'' had declined by the mid-19th century, but several of them survived. During the 19th century other European powers, particularly the British ([[British South Africa Company]]) and the French (Madagascar), became increasingly involved in the trade and politics of the region around the Portuguese East African territories.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Austin|first=Gareth|date=1 March 2010|title=African Economic Development and Colonial Legacies|url=http://journals.openedition.org/poldev/78|journal=International Development Policy {{!}} Revue internationale de politique de développement|language=en|issue=1|pages=11–32|doi=10.4000/poldev.78|issn=1663-9375|doi-access=free|access-date=28 January 2021|archive-date=21 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210121082142/https://journals.openedition.org/poldev/78|url-status=live}}</ref>

By the early 20th century the Portuguese had shifted the administration of much of Mozambique to large private companies, like the [[Mozambique Company]], the [[Zambezia Company]] and the [[Niassa Company]], controlled and financed mostly by British financiers such as [[Solomon Joel]], which established railroad lines to their neighbouring colonies (South Africa and [[Rhodesia]]). Although slavery had been legally abolished in Mozambique, at the end of the 19th century the chartered companies enacted a forced labour policy and supplied cheap—often forced—African labour to the mines and [[plantation]]s of the nearby British colonies and South Africa.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/> The Zambezia Company, the most profitable chartered company, took over several smaller ''prazeiro'' holdings and established military outposts to protect its property.

Due to their unsatisfactory performance and the shift, under the [[corporatist]] [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|''Estado Novo'']] regime of [[Oliveira Salazar]], toward stronger state control of the [[Portuguese Empire]]'s economy, the companies' concessions were not renewed when they ran out. This was what happened in 1942 with the Mozambique Company, which, however, continued to operate in the agricultural and commercial sectors as a corporation, and had already happened in 1929 with the termination of the Niassa Company's concession.

The [[Mueda massacre]] of 16 June 1960 resulted in the death of [[Makonde people|Makonde]] protestors, which provoked the struggle of independence from Portuguese rule of Mozambique.

As [[communism|communist]] and [[Decolonization|anti-colonial]] ideologies spread out across Africa, many clandestine political movements were established in support of Mozambican independence. These movements claimed that since policies and development plans were primarily designed by the ruling authorities for the benefit of Mozambique's Portuguese population, little attention was paid to Mozambique's tribal integration and the development of its native communities.<ref>Dinerman, Alice (26 September 2007). [https://web.archive.org/web/20150424020524/http://www.ipri.pt/publicacoes/revista_ri/artigo_rri.php?ida=173 Independence redux in postsocialist Mozambique]. ipri.pt</ref> According to the official guerrilla statements, this affected a majority of the indigenous population who suffered both state-sponsored discrimination and enormous social pressure. As a response to the guerrilla movement, the Portuguese government from the 1960s and principally the early 1970s initiated gradual changes with new socioeconomic developments and egalitarian policies.<ref>{{Cite web|title=piri piri {{!}} BOOK OF DAYS TALES|url=https://www.bookofdaystales.com/tag/piri-piri/|access-date=28 January 2021|website=www.bookofdaystales.com|archive-date=1 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210301040145/https://www.bookofdaystales.com/tag/piri-piri/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Front for the Liberation of Mozambique ([[FRELIMO]]) initiated a guerrilla campaign against Portuguese rule in September 1964. This conflict—along with the two others already initiated in the other Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] and [[Portuguese Guinea]]—became part of the so-called [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961–1974). From a military standpoint, the Portuguese regular army maintained control of the population centres while the guerrilla forces sought to undermine their influence in rural and tribal areas in the north and west. As part of their response to FRELIMO, the Portuguese government began to pay more attention to creating favourable conditions for social development and economic growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HegjL_5tD6o|title=CD do Diário de Notícias – Parte 08|date=8 July 2007|via=YouTube|access-date=2 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317125157/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HegjL_5tD6o|archive-date=17 March 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Independence (1975) ===
FRELIMO took control of the territory after ten years of sporadic warfare, as well as Portugal's own return to democracy after the fall of the authoritarian [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|''Estado Novo'']] regime in the [[Carnation Revolution]] of April 1974 and the failed [[coup of 25 November 1975]]. Within a year, most of the 250,000 Portuguese in Mozambique had left—some expelled by the government of the nearly independent territory, some left the country to avoid possible reprisals from the unstable government—and Mozambique became independent from Portugal on 25 June 1975.<ref>Keesing's Contemporary Archives, page 27245.</ref> A law had been passed on the initiative of the relatively unknown [[Armando Guebuza]] of the FRELIMO party, ordering the Portuguese to leave the country in 24 hours with only {{convert|20|kg|lb|abbr=off}} of luggage.

This conflict characterised the first decades of Mozambican independence, combined with sabotage from the neighbouring states of [[Rhodesia]] and South Africa, ineffective policies, failed central planning, and the resulting economic collapse.

From 2013 to 2019, a low-intensity [[RENAMO insurgency (2013–2021)|insurgency by RENAMO]] occurred, mainly in the country's central and northern regions. On 5 September 2014, Guebuza and Dhlakama signed the Accord on Cessation of Hostilities, which brought the military hostilities to a halt and allowed both parties to concentrate on the general elections to be held in October 2014. However, after the general elections, a new political crisis emerged. RENAMO did not recognise the validity of the election results and demanded the control of six provinces – Nampula, Niassa, Tete, Zambezia, Sofala, and Manica – where they claimed to have won a majority.<ref name=":02">{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/19787524|title=Provincial Autonomy: The Territorial Dimension of Peace in Mozambique|first=Natália|last=Bueno|journal=GIGA Focus|access-date=23 August 2016|archive-date=13 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813172002/https://www.academia.edu/19787524|url-status=live}}</ref> About 12,000 refugees fled to [[Malawi]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/07/mozambican-refugees-stuck-160713073920585.html|title=Mozambican refugees stuck between somewhere and nowhere|publisher=Al Jazeera|access-date=23 July 2016|date=22 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723161013/http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/07/mozambican-refugees-stuck-160713073920585.html|archive-date=23 July 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders]], and [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that government forces had torched villages and carried out [[summary execution]]s and [[Wartime sexual violence|sexual abuses]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/06/mozambiques-invisible-civil-war-renamo-frelimo-dhlakama-nyusi/|title=Mozambique's Invisible Civil War|publisher=foreign policy|access-date=6 May 2016|date=22 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507095840/http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/06/mozambiques-invisible-civil-war-renamo-frelimo-dhlakama-nyusi/|archive-date=7 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>
