While information is limited about the political system of Timor during this period, the island had developed an interconnected series of polities governed by customary law. Small communities, centred around a particular sacred house, were part of wider ''sucos'' (or principalities), which were themselves part of larger kingdoms led by a ''liurai''. Authority within these kingdoms was held by [[Dyad (sociology)|two individuals]], with the worldly power of the ''liurai'' balanced by the spiritual power of a ''rai nain'', who was generally associated with the primary sacred house of the kingdom. These polities were numerous and saw shifting alliances and relations, but many were stable enough that they survived from initial European documentation in the 16th century until the end of Portuguese rule.<ref name="Lundhal2019"/>{{rp|11–15}}

From perhaps the thirteenth century, the island exported [[sandalwood]],<ref name="Lundhal2019"/>{{rp|267}} which was valued both for its use in crafting and as a source of perfume.<ref name="Villiers1994"/> Timor was included in Southeast Asian, Chinese, and Indian trading networks by the fourteenth century, exporting sandalwood,<ref name="Schwarz1994">{{cite book|last=Schwarz|first=A.|year=1994|title=A Nation in Waiting: Indonesia in the 1990s|page=[https://archive.org/details/nationinwaitingi00schw/page/198 198–199]|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-1-86373-635-0|url=https://archive.org/details/nationinwaitingi00schw/page/198}}</ref> honey, and wax.

Early Portuguese presence on Timor was very limited; trade was directed through Portuguese settlements on nearby islands. Only in the 17th century did they establish a more direct presence on the island, a consequence of being driven out of other islands by the Dutch.<ref name="Lundhal2019"/>{{rp|267}} After Solor was lost in 1613, the Portuguese moved to [[Flores]]. In 1646, the capital moved to [[Kupang]] on Timor's west, before Kupang too was lost to the Dutch in 1652. The Portuguese then moved to [[Lifau]], in what is now Timor-Leste's [[Oecusse]] exclave.<ref name="Paulino2011"/>{{rp|90}} Effective European occupation in the east of the island only began in 1769, when the city of [[Dili]] was founded, although actual control remained highly limited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lusotopie.sciencespobordeaux.fr/carneiroSousa.rtf|title=The Portuguese Colonization and the Problem of East Timorese Nationalism|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123193421/http://www.lusotopie.sciencespobordeaux.fr/carneiroSousa.rtf|archive-date=23 November 2006}}</ref> A definitive [[Indonesia–Timor-Leste border|border]] between the Dutch and Portuguese parts of the island was established by the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in 1914 and remains the international boundary between the successor states Indonesia and Timor-Leste, respectively.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Deeley |first=Neil |title=The International Boundaries of East Timor |year=2001 |pages=8}}</ref>

For the Portuguese, East Timor remained little more than a neglected trading post, with minimal investment in infrastructure and education, until the late nineteenth century. Even when Portugal established actual control over the interior of its colony, investment remained minimal.<ref name="Lundhal2019"/>{{rp|269, 273}} Sandalwood continued to be the main export crop and coffee exports became significant in the mid-nineteenth century.<ref name="Villiers1994">{{cite journal |last1=Villiers |first1=John |title=The Vanishing Sandalwood of Portuguese Timor |journal=Itinerario |date=July 1994 |volume=18 |issue=2 |doi=10.1017/S0165115300022518 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/itinerario/article/abs/vanishing-sandalwood-of-portuguese-timor/29971F19F8EDC85DF7D8F866EA3DEA13 |pages=89–93 |s2cid=162012899 |access-date=23 October 2022 |archive-date=23 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221023111224/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/itinerario/article/abs/vanishing-sandalwood-of-portuguese-timor/29971F19F8EDC85DF7D8F866EA3DEA13 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription }}</ref>

At the beginning of the twentieth century, a faltering domestic economy prompted the Portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies, which was met with East Timorese resistance.<ref name="Schwarz1994"/> The colony was seen as an economic burden during the [[Great Depression]] and received little support or management from Portugal.<ref name="Lundhal2019"/>{{rp|269}}

During World War II, Dili was occupied by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1941, and later by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] beginning in 1942. The mountainous interior of the colony became the scene of a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla campaign]], known as the [[Battle of Timor (1942–43)|Battle of Timor]]. Waged by East Timorese volunteers and Allied forces against the Japanese, the struggle killed between 40,000 and 70,000 East Timorese civilians.<ref name=ASNCE>{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/army/asnce/history.htm|title=Department of Defence (Australia), 2002, "A Short History of East Timor"|access-date=3 January 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103133824/http://www.defence.gov.au/army/asnce/history.htm|archive-date=3 January 2006 }} {{Retrieved|access-date=3 January 2007}}</ref> The Japanese eventually drove the last of the Australian and Allied forces out in early 1943.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://museum.wa.gov.au/debt-of-honour/operations-and-evacuation-24th |title=Operations and Evacuation of the 2/4th |publisher=Western Australian Museum |access-date=23 October 2022 |archive-date=23 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221023150750/https://museum.wa.gov.au/debt-of-honour/operations-and-evacuation-24th |url-status=live }}</ref> Portuguese control resumed, however, after Japanese surrender at the end of World War II.<ref name="Levi1946">{{cite journal |last1=Levi |first1=Werner |title=Portuguese Timor and the War |journal=Far Eastern Survey |date=17 July 1946 |volume=15 |issue=14 |pages=221–223 |doi=10.2307/3023062 |jstor=3023062 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3023062 |access-date=23 October 2022 |archive-date=23 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221023150749/https://www.jstor.org/stable/3023062 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription }}</ref>
