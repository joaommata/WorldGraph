=== Muslim and Portuguese influence (9th–16th centuries) ===
[[Arab]] traders provided the first written accounts of The Gambia area in the ninth and tenth centuries. During the tenth century, Muslim merchants and scholars established communities in several West African commercial centres. Both groups established trans-Saharan trade routes. They carried out a large export trade of local people taken captive in raids and sold as [[slaves]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gambia, The (10/02) |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/gambiathe/26367.htm |access-date=2024-11-07 |website=U.S. Department of State}}</ref> Gold and ivory were also exported, and the trade routes were used to import manufactured goods to these areas.

By the 11th or 12th century, the rulers of kingdoms such as [[Takrur]] (a monarchy centred on the [[Senegal River]] just to the north), ancient Ghana and [[Gao]] had converted to Islam. They had appointed to their courts Muslims who were literate in the [[Arabic language]].<ref>Easton, P.

The Portuguese reached this area by sea in the mid-15th century and began to dominate overseas trade.

=== English and French administration (17th–19th centuries) ===
In 1588, the claimant to the [[Portuguese throne]], [[António, Prior of Crato]], sold exclusive trade rights on the [[Gambia River]] to English merchants. [[Letters patent]] from [[Queen Elizabeth I]] confirmed the grant. In 1618, King [[James I of England]] granted a charter to an English company for trade with The Gambia and the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]]). Between 1651 and 1661, some parts of The Gambia – St. Andrew's Island in the Gambia River, including Fort Jakob, and St. Mary Island (modern day Banjul) and [[Fort Jillifree]] – came under the rule of the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]], a vassal state of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in what is now [[Latvia]], having been bought by Prince [[Jacob Kettler]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Yevstratyev |first=O. |date=2018 |title=Chronological Dating of the Duchy of Courland's Colonial Policy |url=https://www.lvi.lu.lv/lv/LVIZ_2018_files/3_numurs/O_Yevstratyev_Chronological_LVIZ_2018_3.pdf |journal=Latvijas Vēstures Institūta Žurnāls |volume=3 |pages=34–72 |doi=10.22364/lviz.108.02 |access-date=22 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223074148/https://www.lvi.lu.lv/lv/LVIZ_2018_files/3_numurs/O_Yevstratyev_Chronological_LVIZ_2018_3.pdf |archive-date=23 February 2019 |url-status=live |doi-access=free }}</ref> The colonies were formally ceded to England in 1664.

During the late 17th century and throughout the 18th century, the [[British Empire]] and the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] struggled continually for political and commercial supremacy in the regions of the Senegal River and the Gambia River. The British Empire occupied The Gambia when an expedition led by [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Augustus Keppel]] landed there following the [[capture of Senegal]] in 1758. The 1783 [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] gave Great Britain possession of the Gambia River, but the French retained a tiny enclave at [[Albreda]] on the river's north bank. This was finally ceded to the United Kingdom in 1856.

Slave ships intercepted by the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[West Africa Squadron]] in the Atlantic were also returned to The Gambia, with people who had been slaves released on [[MacCarthy Island]] far up The Gambia River where they were expected to establish new lives.<ref name="xyz">{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3060072 |jstor=3060072 |title=Guests of the Crown: Convicts and Liberated Slaves on McCarthy Island, the Gambia |journal=The Geographical Journal |volume=160 |issue=2 |pages=136–142 |year=1994 |last=Webb |first=Patrick |bibcode=1994GeogJ.160..136W |author-link=Patrick Webb (nutritionist) }}</ref> The British established the military post of Bathurst (now [[Banjul]]) in 1816.

=== Contemporary (1965–present) ===

==== Independence and formation of the republic ====
The Gambia achieved [[Gambia Independence Act 1964|independence]] on 18 February 1965, as a [[constitutional monarchy]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of the Gambia|Queen of The Gambia]], represented by the [[Governor-General of The Gambia|Governor-General]]. Shortly thereafter, the national government held a [[1965 Gambian republic referendum|referendum]] proposing that the country become a [[republic]]. This referendum failed to receive the two-thirds majority required to amend the constitution, but the results won widespread attention abroad as testimony to The Gambia's observance of secret balloting, honest elections, civil rights, and liberties.<ref name=Biz/>

On 24 April 1970, The Gambia became a [[Republic within the Commonwealth]], following a second [[1970 Gambian Republic referendum|referendum]]. Prime Minister Sir [[Dawda Kairaba Jawara]] assumed the office of [[President of the Gambia|President]], an [[Executive Presidency|Executive Post]], combining the offices of [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] which he held since 1962.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Drammeh |first=Seedy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zxzREAAAQBAJ&dq=1970+Prime+Minister+Sir+Dawda+Kairaba+Jawara&pg=PA119 |title=Rethinking Irregular Migration: Causes, Course, Consequences and Corrective Measures |date=14 June 2018 |publisher=African Books Collective |isbn=978-9983-960-42-6 |access-date=4 April 2024 |archive-date=28 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240728053709/https://books.google.com/books?id=zxzREAAAQBAJ&dq=1970+Prime+Minister+Sir+Dawda+Kairaba+Jawara&pg=PA119#v=onepage&q=1970%20Prime%20Minister%20Sir%20Dawda%20Kairaba%20Jawara&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> President Sir Dawda Jawara was re-elected five times.<ref name=ucdp>UCDP Conflict Encyclopedia</ref>

[[1981 Gambian coup attempt|An attempted coup]] on 29 July 1981 followed a weakening of the economy and allegations of corruption against leading politicians.<ref name=ucdp/> The coup attempt occurred while President Jawara was attending the Royal Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana in London and was carried out by a rogue group of leftists calling themselves the National Revolutionary Council, composed of [[Kukoi Samba Sanyang]]'s Socialist and Revolutionary Labour Party (SRLP) and elements of the Field Force, a paramilitary force which constituted the bulk of the country's armed forces.<ref name=ucdp/>

President Jawara requested military aid from [[Senegal]], which deployed 400 troops to The Gambia on 31 July. By 6 August, some 2,700 Senegalese troops had been deployed, defeating the rebel force.<ref name=ucdp/> Between 500 and 800 people were killed during the coup and the ensuing violence.<ref name=ucdp/>

In 1982, in the aftermath of the 1981 attempted coup, Senegal and The Gambia signed a treaty of confederation. The [[Senegambia Confederation]] aimed to combine the armed forces of the two states and to unify their economies and currencies. The Gambia permanently withdrew from the confederation in 1989.

In the [[1992 Gambian general election|general election of April 1992]], Dawda Jawara once again won a fifth term as president of The Gambia.

==== Following dissolution of the Senegambia Confederation ====
In 1994, the [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]] (AFPRC) [[1994 Gambian coup d'état|deposed the Jawara government]] and banned opposition political activity. Lieutenant [[Yahya Jammeh]], chairman of the AFPRC, became head of state. Jammeh was just 29 years old at the time of the coup. The AFPRC announced a transition plan to return to a democratic civilian government.{{cn|date=June 2025}}

The Provisional Independent Electoral Commission (PIEC) was established in December 1995 to conduct national elections and it supervised a referendum on a revised Constitution, the elections for president and the National Assembly by early January 1997.<ref name="Gambia IEC">{{cite web |title=History |url=https://iec.gm/about-iec/history/ |website=Independent Electoral Commission - IEC- The Gambia |access-date=10 September 2024}}</ref> In 1997 the {{Official website|url=https://iec.gm/|name=Independent Electoral Commission - IEC- The Gambia}} was established to replace the PIEC, responsible for the registration of voters and for the conduct of elections and referendums.<ref name="Gambia IEC"/>
