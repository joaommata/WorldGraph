The Ga-Dangme and Ewe migrated westward from south-western [[Nigeria]]. The Ewe, formerly known as Dogbo, migrated from Oyo area with their Gbe-speaking kinsmen (Adja, Fon, Phla/Phera and Ogun/Gun) and, in transition, settled at Ketou in Benin Republic, Tado in Togo, and Dogbo Nyigbo in Benin Republic, with Nortsie (a walled town in present-day Togo) as their final dispersal point. Their dispersal from Nortsie was necessitated by the high-handed rule of King Agorkorli (Agɔ Akɔli), who was the reigning monarch of the tribe at that time. The Ewe in Ghana speak three principal dialects: Anlo (along the coast), Tongu (along the Volta river) and Ewedome (in the hill country side). The [[Ga-Adangbe people|Ga-Dangme]] occupy the Greater Accra Region and parts of the Eastern Region, while the Ewe are found in the [[Volta Region]] as well as the neighbouring Togo, Benin Republic and Nigeria (around Badagry area).{{citation needed|date=April 2025}}
