The [[Chao Phraya River]] in what is now [[central Thailand]] had once been the home of the [[Mon people|Mon]] [[Dvaravati]] culture, which prevailed from the seventh century to the tenth century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wyatt|2003|p=18}}</ref> Samuel Beal discovered the polity among the Chinese writings on Southeast Asia as "Duoluobodi". During the early 20th century, archaeological excavations led by [[George Coedès]] found [[Nakhon Pathom Province]] to be a centre of Dvaravati culture. The two most important sites were Nakorn Pathom and U Thong (in modern [[Suphan Buri Province]]). The inscriptions of Dvaravati were in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Mon language|Mon]] using the script derived from the [[Pallava alphabet]] of the [[South India]]n Pallava dynasty.

It is believed that the Dvaravati borrowed [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] through its contacts with Sri Lanka, while the ruling class participated in [[Hindu]] rites. [[Dvaravati art]], including the Buddha sculptures and [[stupa]]s, showed strong similarities to those of the [[Gupta Empire]] of India. The eastern parts of the Chao Phraya valley were subjected to a more Khmer and Hindu influence as the inscriptions are found in Khmer and Sanskrit.<ref>Brown, Robert L. (1996). ''The Dvaravati wheels of law and the Indianization of South East Asia''. Leiden: E.J.Brill</ref>

Dvaravati was a network of city-states paying tribute to more powerful ones according to the [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala political model]]. Dvaravati culture expanded into [[Isan]] as well as south as far as the [[Kra Isthmus]]. Dvaravati culture lost its influence around the tenth century when they submitted to the more unified Lavo-Khmer polity.

Around the tenth century, the city-states of Dvaravati merged into the mandalas of: [[Lavo]] (modern [[Lopburi]]) and [[Suvarnabhumi]] (modern [[Suphan Buri]]). According to a legend in the Northern Chronicles, in 903, a king of [[Tambralinga]] invaded and took Lavo and installed a Malay prince on the Lavo throne. The Malay prince was married to a Khmer princess who had fled an Angkorian dynastic bloodbath. The son of the couple contested the Khmer throne and became [[Suryavarman I]] (1006–1050), thus bringing Lavo under Khmer domination through marital union. Suryavarman I also expanded into the [[Khorat Plateau]] (later styled "Isan"), constructing many temples.

[[File:ปราสาทปรางค์สามยอด2.jpg|thumb|240px|Wat [[Phra Prang Sam Yod]], a 13th-century Angkorian temple in [[Lopburi]].]]
After the [[Angkor]] lost Lavo to [[Suphannabhum]] princes in 1052, the younger prince [[Chandrachota]] claimed the throne. His son, [[Narai I]], moved Lavo's seat to [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya (city)|Ayodhya]] in the 1080s. This resulted in the throne of Lavo's Lavaburi being vacant from 1087 to 1106 (or ruled by unknown kings), [[Si Satchanalai]] king, [[Kesariraja]] who is of [[Mon people|Mon]]'s [[Mueang Chaliang|Chaliang]] and [[Tai people|Tai]]'s [[Chiang Saen]] lineages, took over the seat. An attempt to re-expand influence to Lavo by the Angkor occurred in 1181 when [[Jayavarman VII]] appointed his lineage Narupatidnavarman to govern Lavapura.<ref name=indra>{{cite web|url=https://www.matichonacademy.com/tour-story/%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%81-%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0-%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B9%E0%B9%88-%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B0%E0%B9%82|title=จาก 'ลวะปุระ' สู่ 'เมืองละโว้' ลูกหลวงแห่งเมืองพระนคร|trans-title=From 'Lavapura' to 'Lavo City', the frontier city of the capital of Phra Nakhon|author=ศานติ ภักดีคำ|language=th|access-date=6 November 2023}}</ref> Due to this political pressure, a Tai ruler Sri Thammasokkarat

Ayutthaya was a patchwork of self-governing principalities and tributary provinces owing allegiance to the King of Ayutthaya under the [[Mandala (political model)|mandala system]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Higham |first=Charles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ifNH4uK0LAC&pg=PA355 |title=The Archaeology of Mainland Southeast Asia |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1989 |isbn=0-521-27525-3 |access-date=6 September 2009 |archive-date=28 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240328150350/https://books.google.com/books?id=-ifNH4uK0LAC&pg=PA355#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live}}</ref>{{rp|355}} Its initial expansion was through conquest and political marriage.

Before the end of the 15th century, Ayutthaya invaded the Khmer Empire three times and sacked its capital [[Angkor]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=เกษตรศิริ |first=ชาญวิทย์ |title=อยุธยา: ประวัติศาสตร์และการเมือง |date=2005 |publisher=โรงพิมพ์มหาวิทยาลัยธรรมศาสตร์ |isbn=978-974-91572-7-5}}</ref>{{rp|26}} Ayutthaya then became a regional power in place of the Khmer. Constant interference of Sukhothai effectively made it a vassal state of Ayutthaya and it was finally incorporated into the kingdom. [[Borommatrailokkanat]] brought about bureaucratic reforms which lasted into the 20th century and created a system of social hierarchy called ''[[sakdina]]'', where male commoners were conscripted as [[corvée]] labourers for six months a year.<ref name="Wyatt 20132">{{Cite book |last=Wyatt |first=David K. |title=Thailand: A Short History |date=2013 |publisher=มูลนิธิโครงการตำราสังคมศาสตร์และมนุษยศาสตร์, มูลนิธิโตโยต้าประเทศไทย |isbn=978-616-7202-38-9 |language=th |translator-last=ละอองศรี |translator-first=กาญจนี |trans-title=ประวัติศาสตร์ไทยฉบับสังเขป}}</ref>{{rp|107}} Ayutthaya was interested in the [[Malay Peninsula]] but failed to conquer the [[Malacca Sultanate]], which was supported by the Chinese [[Ming dynasty]].<ref name="LePoer 1989" />{{rp|11, 13}}

European contact and trade started in the early-16th century, with the [[Duarte Fernandes|envoy]] of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] duke [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1511.

Rivalry for supremacy over Chiang Mai and the Mon people pitted Ayutthaya against the Burmese Kingdom. Several wars with its ruling [[Taungoo dynasty]] starting in the 1540s in the reign of [[Tabinshwehti]] and [[Bayinnaung]] were ultimately ended with the [[Burmese–Siamese War (1568–70)|capture of the capital in 1570]].<ref name="Wyatt 20132"/>{{rp|146–7}} Then a brief period of vassalage to Burma until [[Naresuan]] proclaimed independence in 1584 followed.<ref name="Baker 2014">{{Cite book |last1=Baker |first1=Christopher |title=A History of Thailand |last2=Phongpaichit |first2=Pasuk |date=2014 |publisher=C.O.S Printers Pte Ltd |isbn=978-1-107-42021-2 |location=Singapore}}</ref>{{rp|11}}

Ayutthaya sought to improve relations with European powers for many successive reigns. The kingdom especially prospered during cosmopolitan [[Narai]]'s reign (1656–1688), when some European travellers regarded Ayutthaya as an Asian great power, alongside China and India.<ref name="Baker 2017" />{{rp|ix}} However, growing French influence later in his reign was met with nationalist sentiment and eventually led to the [[Siamese revolution of 1688]].<ref name="Wyatt 20132"/>{{rp|185–6}} Despite the revolution, overall relations remained stable, with French missionaries still actively preaching Christianity.<ref name="Wyatt 20132"/>{{rp|186}}

After a bloody period of dynastic struggle, Ayutthaya entered what has been called the Siamese "[[golden age]]", a relatively peaceful episode in the second quarter of the 18th century where [[Thai art|art]], [[Thai literature|literature]], and learning flourished. There were seldom foreign wars, apart from conflict with the [[Nguyễn lords]] for control of [[Cambodia]] starting around 1715.

{{main|Thonburi Kingdom}}
[[File:KingTaksin's coronation.jpg|thumb|right|[[Taksin the Great]] enthroned himself as a Thai king in 1767.]]
The capital and many of its territories lay in chaos after the war. The former capital was occupied by the [[Burma|Burmese]] garrison army and five local leaders declared themselves overlords, including the lords of Sakwangburi, [[Phitsanulok]], [[Pimai]], [[Chanthaburi]], and [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]]. [[Taksin|Chao Tak]], a capable military leader, proceeded to make himself a lord by [[right of conquest]], beginning with the legendary sack of [[Chanthaburi]]. Based at Chanthaburi, Chao Tak raised troops and resources, and sent a fleet up the [[Chao Phraya]] to take the fort of [[Thonburi]]. In the same year, Chao Tak was able to retake Ayutthaya from the Burmese only seven months after the fall of the city.<ref>จรรยา ประชิตโรมรัน.

Chao Tak then crowned himself as [[Taksin]] and proclaimed [[Thonburi]] as temporary capital in the same year. He also quickly subdued the other warlords. His forces engaged in wars with Burma, Laos, and Cambodia, which successfully [[Burmese–Siamese War (1774–1775)|drove the Burmese out of Lan Na]] in 1775,<ref name="Wyatt 20132"/>{{rp|225}} [[Lao–Siamese War (1778–1779)|captured Vientiane]] in 1778<ref name="Wyatt 20132"/>{{rp|227–8}} and [[Siamese–Vietnamese War (1769–1773)|tried to install a pro-Thai king in Cambodia]] in the 1770s. In his final years there was a coup, supposedly caused by his "insanity", and eventually Taksin and his sons were executed by his longtime companion General [[Rama I|Chao Phraya Chakri]] (the future Rama I). He was the first king of the ruling [[Chakri dynasty]] and founder of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] on 6 April 1782.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rama I {{!}} Thai Monarch, Ayutthaya Dynasty {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rama-I |access-date=2025-05-26 |website=www.britannica.com |archive-date=24 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210124032752/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rama-I |url-status=live}}</ref>

{{Main|Thailand in World War II|History of Thailand (1932–1973)}}
[[File:Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram.jpg|thumb|200px|Field Marshal Plaek Pibulsonggram]]

A period of wasteful spending by [[Vajiravudh|King Vajiravudh]] followed by the [[Great Depression]] brought economic hardships on Thailand, with sharply falling rice prices, a significant reduction in public spending, eroded confidence in the monarchy, and discontent among aristocratic supporters all contributing to the destabilization of the [[Chakri dynasty]]. These conditions spurred on the bloodless [[Siamese revolution of 1932]], in which the [[Khana Ratsadon]] movement forced [[Prajadhipok|King Prajadhipok]] to sign the country's first constitution, thereby ending centuries of feudal and [[absolute monarchy]].<ref name="LePoer 1989" />{{rp|25}} Power was partially ceded to a [[Democracy|democratic]] government, but it would not last a year before the rise of significant military influence in Thai political affairs.

In 1933, [[Prime Minister of Thailand|Prime Minister]] [[Phraya Manopakorn Nitithada|Phraya Mano]] led a [[Boworadet rebellion|counter-revolutionary rebellion]] to reinstate an absolute monarchy under Prajadhipok.<ref name="Wyatt 20132"/>{{rp|446–8}} This was soon followed by a military coup that installed [[Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena|Phraya Phahon]] - a leader of the 1932 revolution - as Prime Minister. Prajadhipok's conflict with the government eventually led to his abdication, and the new military-led government selected [[Switzerland]]-raised [[Ananda Mahidol]] to be the new king.<ref name="Wyatt 20132"/>{{rp|448–9}}

The armed wing of Khana Ratsadon gradually came to dominate Siamese politics. Military strongman [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]], often known as "Phibun", became premier in 1938 and launched a [[Songsuradet rebellion|campaign of political repression]] that saw the execution of both Monarchists and pro-democracy [[Liberalism|Liberals]].<ref name="Wyatt 20132"/>{{rp|457}} His government adopted [[Thai nationalism|Thai nationalist]], pro-[[Westernisation]], anti-royalist, [[Irredentism|Irredentist]], [[Sinophobia|anti-Chinese]] and anti-French policies.<ref name="LePoer 1989" />{{rp|28}}

In 1939, Phibun changed the country's name from "Siam" to "Thailand". This coincided with the rise of [[Fascism|fascist ideology]] in Thailand, with the name change reflecting policies that prioritized the needs of [[Tai peoples|ethnic Thais]] over those of minorities like the [[Thai Chinese]]. Phibun was an admirer of [[Benito Mussolini]], and he imposed twelve [[Thai cultural mandates]] requiring citizens to obey nationalist norms such as saluting the flag, knowing the national anthem, speaking only Thai, and wearing Western clothing.

In October 1940, months after [[Battle of France|fall of France]] to [[Nazi Germany]], Phibun launched an opportunistic [[Franco-Thai War|invasion]] of [[French Indochina|French Indochinese]] territories [[Territorial losses of Thailand|lost]] to the [[France|French Empire]] during the reign of [[Chulalongkorn|King Chulalongkorn]]. The invasion was a success, with Thailand additionally gaining some [[Laos|Lao]] and [[Cambodia]]n territories.<ref name="Wyatt 20132"/>{{rp|462}}Japan, which had also been invading French Indochinese territories, brokered a ceasefire that forced France to give up several territories to Thailand.

On 8 December 1941, [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|the Japanese Empire launched an invasion of Thailand]], and fierce fighting broke out in Southern Thailand before Phibun ordered an [[armistice]] and joined the [[Axis powers]] just five hours later. Japan was granted free passage through Thai territory, and on 21 December Thailand and Japan signed a military alliance, with a secret protocol wherein the Japanese government agreed to help Thailand gain further territories throughout southeast Asia.<ref>Werner Gruhl, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ow5Wlmu9MPQC&pg=PA112 Imperial Japan's World War Two, 1931–1945] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240328150816/https://books.google.com/books?id=ow5Wlmu9MPQC&pg=PA112#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=28 March 2024}}'', Transaction Publishers, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0352-8}}</ref>

In June 1946, King Ananda was found dead under mysterious circumstances, and his younger brother [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] ascended to the throne.

[[File:ATrelations0018a-1.jpg|thumb|200px|King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] addresses a [[joint session of the United States Congress]], 1960.]]

This period of Liberal rule was brief, with Phibun launching another military coup to take power in 1947. In his second term as Prime Minister, Phibun pursued an alliance with the United States by undertaking a campaign of domestic [[anti-communism]], aiding the [[Korean War|US invasion of Korea]], and helping to establish the US-aligned [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO) in 1954.<ref name="Wyatt 20132"/>{{rp|493}} Following a tour of Europe and the US in 1955 where he was impressed by democratic practices like [[Freedom of speech in the United States|freedom of speech]], Phibun began to democratize Thai politics by allowing new political parties and trade unions to form, opening public forums, granting amnesty to former political opponents, and preparing Thailand for its first [[Election|free elections]]. However, these practices likely aroused opposition to Phibun's dictatorial legacy, and the US supported his final ouster in 1957.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Darling |first=Frank C. |date=1962 |title=American Policy in Thailand |journal=The Western Political Quarterly |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=93–110 |doi=10.2307/446100 |jstor=446100 |issn=0043-4078}}</ref>

Field Marshal [[Sarit Thanarat]] took power by coup in 1957, and he proceeded to reverse Phibun's democratic reforms and ban the Khana Ratsadon party from politics. His rule from 1959 to 1963 was autocratic; he built his legitimacy around the god-like status of the monarch and by channelling the government and public's loyalty to the king.<ref name="Wyatt 20132"/>{{rp|511}} Though Phibun had been criticized for his close relationship to the United States, Sarit also aligned himself with them and militarily supported the [[Vietnam War|United States invasion of Vietnam]] in 1961, leading a simultaneous campaign of [[Anti-communist mass killings#Thailand|anti-communist mass killings]] in Thailand that continued under his successor [[Thanom Kittikachorn]].<ref name="Wyatt 20132"/>{{rp|523}}

The Sarit and Thanom periods coincided with significant [[modernisation]] and [[Westernisation]] of Thai society. Rapid [[urbanisation]] occurred as the rural populace sought work in growing cities like [[Bangkok]]. Economic development and public education enabled the rise of an urban middle class.<ref name="Wyatt 20132"/>{{rp|534}} The growth of this economy based on [[wage labour]] rather than [[subsistence agriculture]] resulted in increased [[class consciousness]] and sympathies to the [[Communist Party of Thailand]],<ref name="Wyatt 20132"/>{{rp|528}} while university-educated students formed movements against the military dictatorship.

With new democratic institutions limited in their capability to solidify power and pass reforms, the three years after the uprising were marked by political and economic instability. Right-wing fears of a Communist takeover of Thailand grew following the captures of South Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos by Communist insurgents.

Free elections were once again held in September 1992, bringing the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] to power. Power passed between various neoliberal parties throughout the decade, who all had a hand in drafting the [[1997 constitution of Thailand|1997 "People's Constitution."]] Spurred on by the events of Black May, the constitution explicitly acknowledged several [[human rights]] and established several government and electoral accountability measures, including the creation of a fully-elected [[bicameral legislature]].

=== Shinawatra Era (2001–present) ===
{{Main|History of Thailand (2001–present)}}
The neoliberal government's attempt to [[Currency peg|peg]] the [[Thai baht]] to the [[United States dollar]] induced the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], crashing regional economies and ending nearly 40 years of uninterrupted economic growth in Thailand.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Warr |first=Peter |title=Thailand Beyond the Crisis |date=2007 |publisher=Routledge Curzon |isbn=978-1-134-54151-5}}</ref>{{rp|3}} To cover a shortage of foreign currency and investments, which had come primarily from Japan, [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]]'s government took out a $17 billion [[International Monetary Fund]] loan in US dollars.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Thailand Letter of Intent, August 14, 1997 |url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/loi/081497.htm |access-date=2025-08-17 |website=imf.org}}</ref> To satisfy the conditions of the loan, Thailand underwent a series of [[Austerity|austerity measures]] until the loan was repaid in 2003.

The crisis brought on the ascendancy of the populist [[Thai Rak Thai party]], whose base consisted primarily of indebted rural workers. Its prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] governed from 2001 until 2006. His policies were successful in reducing rural poverty<ref>{{Cite web |title=Thailand Economic Monitor, November 2005 |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTTHAILAND/Resources/Economic-Monitor/2005nov-econ-full-report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902021039/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTTHAILAND/Resources/Economic-Monitor/2005nov-econ-full-report.pdf |archive-date=2 September 2009 |access-date=19 February 2010}}</ref> and providing [[universal healthcare]].<ref>Na Ranong, Viroj, Na Ranong, Anchana, Universal Health Care Coverage: Impacts of the 30-Baht Health Care Scheme on the Rural Poor in Thailand, TDRI Quarterly Review, September 2006.</ref> However, Thaksin was viewed by opponents among the Thai upper and upper middle classes as a corrupt populist who was destroying the middle class in order to favour himself and the rural poor. Additionally, his rural poverty policies directly conflicted with King Bhumibol's recommendations, drawing the ire of royalists, a powerful faction in Thailand. Thaksin also faced crises in the form of the [[South Thailand insurgency]], which escalated starting from 2004, and the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] which claimed around 8,000 lives in Thailand.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-12-26 |title=Concerns arise over warning systems as Boxing Day marks 19 years since 2004 tsunami |url=https://www.nationthailand.com/thailand/general/40034141 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240519044456/https://www.nationthailand.com/thailand/general/40034141 |archive-date=19 May 2024 |access-date=2024-05-19 |website=nationthailand}}</ref>

Massive protests against Thaksin led by the [[reactionary]] [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] (PAD) started in his second term as prime minister, and the monarchy and the military eventually agreed to oust him. The [[2005–2006 Thai political crisis|crisis]] peaked in 2005 with a series of controversies surrounding Buddhist and monarchic institutions, and the army dissolved Thaksin's party with [[2006 Thai coup d'état|a coup d'état in 2006]] and banned over a hundred of its executives from politics. After the coup, a military government was installed for one year.'''<ref name=":22">{{Cite journal |last=Phongpaichit |first=Pasuk |date=December 2008 |title=Thailand: Fighting Over Democracy. |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=43 |issue=50 |pages=18–21}}</ref>'''<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Connors |first=Michael K. |date=28 November 2008 |title=Thailand-Four elections and a coup |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10357710802480717 |url-status=live |journal=Australian Journal of International Affairs |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=478, 483–484 |doi=10.1080/10357710802480717 |issn=1035-7718 |s2cid=154415628 |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230811000243/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10357710802480717 |archive-date=11 August 2023 |access-date=8 August 2023}}</ref>
