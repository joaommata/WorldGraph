After the [[Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913]], Kuwait was established as an autonomous ''[[kaza]],'' or district, of the Ottoman Empire and a ''[[de facto]]'' protectorate of Great Britain.

In 1919, Sheikh [[Salim Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah]] intended to build a commercial city in the south of Kuwait. This caused a diplomatic crisis with Najd, but Britain intervened, discouraging Sheikh Salim. In 1920, an attempt by the [[Ikhwan]] to build a stronghold in southern Kuwait led to the [[Battle of Hamdh]]. The Battle of Hamdh involved 2,000 [[Ikhwan]] fighters against 100 Kuwaiti [[cavalrymen]] and 200 Kuwaiti [[infantrymen]]. The battle lasted for six days and resulted in heavy but unknown casualties on both sides resulting in the victory of the Ikhwan forces and leading to the battle of Jahra around the Kuwait Red Fort. The [[Battle of Jahra]] happened as the result of the [[Battle of Hamdh]].

The [[Kuwait-Iraq 1973 Sanita border skirmish|Kuwait-Iraq 1973 Samita border skirmish]] evolved on 20 March 1973, when Iraqi army units occupied El-Samitah near the Kuwaiti border, which evoked an international crisis.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=178&dt=2472&dl=1345 |title=US diplomatic cable mentioning the incident |access-date=18 May 2024 |archive-date=16 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231216061759/https://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=178&dt=2472&dl=1345 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 6 February 1974, [[1974 attack on the Japanese Embassy in Kuwait|Palestinian militants occupied the Japanese embassy in Kuwait]], taking the ambassador and ten others hostage. The militants' motive was to support the [[Japanese Red Army]] members and Palestinian militants who were holding hostages on a Singaporean ferry in what is known as the [[Laju incident|''Laju'' incident]]. Ultimately, the hostages were released, and the guerrillas allowed to fly to [[Aden]]. This was the first time Palestinian guerrillas struck in Kuwait as the Al Sabah ruling family, headed by Sheikh Sabah Al-Salim Al-Sabah, funded the Palestinian resistance movement. Kuwait had been a regular endpoint for Palestinian [[aircraft hijacking|plane hijacking]] in the past and had considered itself safe.

[[Kuwait International Airport]] was opened in 1979 by the Al Hani Construction with a joint venture of [[Ballast Nedam]].
