The islands of the Caribbean were first settled around 6,000 years ago by hunter-gatherer peoples originating from Central America or northern South America. The [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan-speaking]] ancestors of the [[Taíno]] moved into the Caribbean from South America during the 1st millennium BCE, reaching Hispaniola by around 600 CE.<ref name=":13">{{Cite journal |last1=Fernandes |first1=Daniel M. |last2=Sirak |first2=Kendra A. |last3=Ringbauer |first3=Harald |last4=Sedig |first4=Jakob |last5=Rohland |first5=Nadin |last6=Cheronet |first6=Olivia |last7=Mah |first7=Matthew |last8=Mallick |first8=Swapan |last9=Olalde |first9=Iñigo |last10=Culleton |first10=Brendan J. |last11=Adamski |first11=Nicole |last12=Bernardos |first12=Rebecca |last13=Bravo |first13=Guillermo |last14=Broomandkhoshbacht |first14=Nasreen |last15=Callan |first15=Kimberly |date=February 4, 2021 |title=A genetic history of the pre-contact Caribbean |journal=Nature |language=en |volume=590 |issue=7844 |pages=103–110 |bibcode=2021Natur.590..103F |doi=10.1038/s41586-020-03053-2 |issn=0028-0836 |pmc=7864882 |pmid=33361817}}</ref> These Arawakan peoples engaged in farming, fishing,<ref name=Encarta>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563569_7/Dominican_Republic.html |title=Dominican Republic |encyclopedia=Encarta |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |access-date=June 6, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114170306/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563569_7/Dominican_Republic.html |archive-date=November 14, 2007 }}</ref> hunting and gathering,<ref name=LunaC/> and the widespread production of [[ceramic]] goods.<ref name=":13" />

Initially, after friendly relationships, the Taínos resisted the conquest, led by female Chief [[Anacaona]] of Xaragua and her ex-husband Chief [[Caonabo]] of Maguana, as well as Chiefs [[Guacanagaríx]], [[Guamá]], [[Hatuey]], and [[Enriquillo]].

By the time of the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] in 1697, which ceded the western one-third of the island to France, the population of Santo Domingo consisted of a few thousand whites, approximately 30,000 black slaves, and a few Taínos.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=341}} By 1789, the population had grown to 125,000, but Santo Domingo remained one of Spain's less wealthy and strategically important colonies in the New World.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=341}} The population composition of Santo Domingo sharply contrasted with that of the neighboring French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]]—the wealthiest colony in the Caribbean and whose population of half a million was 90% enslaved and four times as numerous as Santo Domingo.<ref name="google48">{{cite book |editor-last=Knight |editor-first=Franklin W. |title=General history of the Caribbean |date=1997 |publisher=Unesco |location=London |isbn=978-92-3-103146-5 |page=48 |edition=1. publ. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ppGJBmQVJjEC&pg=PR2 |access-date=April 30, 2015 |archive-date=January 11, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240111004217/https://books.google.com/books?id=ppGJBmQVJjEC&pg=PR2#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=firstcolony></ref>

In 1795, Spain ceded Santo Domingo to France by the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]] as a result of its defeat in the [[War of the Pyrenees]]. Saint-Domingue achieved independence as Haiti from France on January 1, 1804. In 1809, the French were expelled from the island and Santo Domingo returned to [[España Boba|Spanish rule]].{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=342}}

After a dozen years of discontent and failed independence plots by various opposing groups, including a [[1812 Mendoza and Mojarra conspiracy|failed 1812 revolt]] led by [[Freedman|freedmen]], Santo Domingo's former Lieutenant-Governor (top administrator), [[José Núñez de Cáceres]], declared the colony's independence from the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]] as [[Republic of Spanish Haiti|Spanish Haiti]], on November 30, 1821. This period is also known as the Ephemeral independence.<ref name="Bethell1986">{{cite book|author=H.

===First Republic (1844–1861)===
[[File:Flag of the Dominican Republic (up to 1844).svg|thumb|Original [[flag of the Dominican Republic]] (up to 1849)]]
In 1838, [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] founded a secret society called [[La Trinitaria (Dominican Republic)|La Trinitaria]], which sought the complete independence of Santo Domingo without any foreign intervention.<ref name="pons">{{cite book |first=Frank |last =Moya Pons| author-link =Frank Moya Pons | title = The Dominican Republic: A National History|edition= August 1, 1998|page= 543 |publisher = Markus Wiener Publishers; 2nd edition| isbn= 978-1-55876-191-9|year =1998}}</ref>{{rp|p147–149}} Also [[Francisco del Rosario Sánchez]] and [[Ramon Matias Mella]], despite not being among the founding members of La Trinitaria, were decisive in the fight for independence.

On February 27, 1844, the members of ''La Trinitaria'' declared independence from Haiti. They were backed by [[Pedro Santana]], a wealthy cattle rancher, who became general of the army of the nascent republic. The decades that followed were filled with tyranny, factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of government, and exile for political opponents. Archrivals Santana and [[Buenaventura Báez]] held power most of the time, both ruling arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new nation to a major power. The Dominican Republic's first [[Constitution of the Dominican Republic|constitution]] was adopted on November 6, 1844, and its population  in 1845 was approximately 230,000 people (100,000 whites; 40,000 blacks; and 90,000 mulattoes).{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=343}}

In March 1844, Haiti invaded but the Dominicans put up stiff opposition and inflicted heavy casualties on the Haitians.<ref name=Bethell>{{cite book|last1=Bethell|first1=Leslie|title=The Cambridge History of Latin America: Volume 3|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgehistory0000beth|url-access=registration|date=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgehistory0000beth/page/267 267]}}</ref> By April 15, Dominican forces had defeated the Haitian forces on both land and sea.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=344}} In early July 1844, Duarte was urged by his followers to take the title of President of the Republic. Duarte agreed, but only if free elections were arranged. However, Santana's forces took Santo Domingo on July 12, and they declared Santana ruler of the Dominican Republic. Santana then put Mella, Duarte, and Sánchez in jail. On February 27, 1845, Santana executed [[María Trinidad Sánchez]], heroine of La Trinitaria, and others for conspiracy.

After defeating a third Haitian invasion in April 1849 at the [[Battle of Las Carreras]], Santana marched on Santo Domingo and deposed president [[Manuel Jimenes]] (who had ousted Santana as president) in a [[coup d'état]]. At his behest, Congress elected Buenaventura Báez as president, but Báez was unwilling to serve as Santana's puppet. In November–December 1849, Dominican seamen raided the Haitian coasts, plundered seaside villages, as far as [[Dame-Marie, Grand'Anse|Dame Marie]], and butchered crews of captured enemy ships.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baur|first1=John E.|title=Faustin Soulouque, Emperor of Haiti His Character and His Reign |journal=The Americas |volume=6 |issue=2 |date=October 1949 |page=143 |doi=10.2307/978436|jstor=978436 |s2cid=210429049 | issn = 0003-1615}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A1dIAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA127|title=Littell's Living Age|first1=Eliakim|last1=Littell|first2=Robert S.|last2=Littell|date=September 4, 1850|publisher=T.

In 1861, after imprisoning, exiling, and executing many of his opponents and due to political and economic reasons, Santana asked Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] to retake control of the Dominican Republic. Spain, which had not come to terms with the loss of its mainland American colonies 40 years earlier, [[Annexation of the Dominican Republic to Spain|annexed the country]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Bulmer|editor1-first=Martin|editor2-last=Solomos|editor2-first=John|title=Gender, Race and Religion: Intersections and Challenges|date=2014|publisher=Routledge}}</ref> The island was occupied by 30,000 Spanish troops bolstered by battalions of Cuban and Puerto Rican volunteers and 12,000 Dominicans who aligned themselves with the Spanish forces.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=347}} The Haitian rebel [[Sylvain Salnave]], fearful of the reestablishment of Spain as colonial power, gave refuge and logistics to revolutionaries seeking to reestablish the independent nation.

Political strife again prevailed in the following years; warlords ruled, military revolts were extremely common, and the nation amassed debt.

===20th century (1900–1930)===
[[File:Alejandro Woss y Gil.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Alejandro Woss y Gil]] taking office in 1903]]
From 1902 on, short-lived governments were again the norm, with their power usurped by caudillos in parts of the country. Furthermore, the national government was bankrupt and, unable to pay its debts to European creditors, faced the threat of military intervention by France, [[German Empire|Germany]], and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].<ref name=cs9>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/9.htm |title=Dominican Republic&nbsp;– Renewed conflict, 1899–1916 |access-date=October 19, 2008 |work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division |archive-date=July 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706222617/http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/9.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> United States President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sought to prevent European intervention, largely to protect the routes to the future [[Panama Canal]]. He made a small military intervention to ward off European powers, to proclaim his famous [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], and also to obtain his 1905 Dominican agreement for U.S. administration of Dominican customs, which was the chief source of income for the Dominican government. A 1906 agreement provided for the arrangement to last 50 years. The United States agreed to use part of the customs proceeds to reduce the immense foreign debt of the Dominican Republic and assumed responsibility for said debt.<ref name=Encarta/><ref name=cs9/>

After six years in power, President [[Ramón Cáceres]] (who had himself assassinated Heureaux)<ref name=countrystudies/> was assassinated in 1911. The result was several years of great political instability and [[Dominican Civil War (1911–1912)|civil war]]. U.S. mediation by the [[William Howard Taft]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] administrations achieved only a short respite each time. A political deadlock in 1914 was broken after an ultimatum by Wilson telling the Dominicans to choose a president or see the U.S. impose one. A provisional president was chosen, and later the same year relatively free elections put former president (1899–1902) [[Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra]] back in power. With his former [[Secretary of War]] [[Desiderio Arias]] maneuvering to depose him and despite a U.S. offer of military aid against Arias, Jimenes resigned on May 7, 1916.<ref name="congress">{{cite web| title=Dominican Republic: Occupation by the United States, 1916–1924| work=Country Studies| publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division| url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/10.htm| access-date=May 29, 2007| archive-date=December 13, 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213215941/http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/10.htm| url-status=live}}</ref> Wilson thus ordered the U.S. occupation of the Dominican Republic.

The occupation regime kept most Dominican laws and institutions and largely pacified the general population. The occupying government also revived the Dominican economy, reduced the nation's debt, built a road network that at last interconnected all regions of the country, and created a professional National Guard to replace the warring partisan units.<ref name="congress"/> Additionally, with grass-roots support from local communities and assistance from both Dominican and US officials, the Dominican education system expanded significantly during US occupation.

Trujillo consolidated his power after [[Hurricane San Zenón]] devastated Santo Domingo in September 1930, killing 8,000 people. A few of the former caudillos initially opposed the new dictator. General Cipriano Bencosme led an uprising but was defeated and killed in November 1930 during a confrontation with the army near Puerto Plata. General Desiderio Arias was also unsuccessful, dying in combat near [[Mao, Dominican Republic|Mao]] in June of the following year.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1978|p=22}}

===Trujillo Era (1930–1961)===
[[File:Rafael L. Trujillo en la silla presidencial (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rafael Trujillo]] imposed a dictatorship of 31 years (1930–1961).]]
There was considerable economic growth during [[Rafael Trujillo]]'s long and iron-fisted regime, although a great deal of the wealth was taken by the dictator and other regime elements. There was progress in healthcare, education, and transportation, with the building of hospitals, clinics, schools, roads, and harbors. Trujillo also carried out an important housing construction program and instituted a pension plan. He finally negotiated an undisputed border with Haiti in 1935, and achieved the end of the 50-year customs agreement in 1941, well before it would have expired in 1956. He made the country debt-free in 1947.<ref name=Encarta/><ref name=Galvan>{{cite book |author=Javier A.

During [[World War II]], Trujillo symbolically sided with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. During the course of the war, German U-boats torpedoed and sank two Dominican merchant vessels—the ''San Rafael'' off the coast of Jamaica, and the ''[[SS Presidente Trujillo|Presidente Trujillo]]'' off [[Fort-de-France]]—along with four other Dominican-manned ships in the Caribbean. The country did not make a military contribution to the war, but Dominican sugar and other agricultural products supported the Allied war effort, and the Dominican Republic also accepted Jewish refugees [[Évian Conference|fleeing Nazi persecution]].

The arsenal at [[San Cristóbal Province|San Cristóbal]], operated under Trujillo's regime, produced rifles, machine guns, and ammunition.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=175}} Trujillo also formed a Foreign Legion of 3,000 mercenaries to attempt to overthrow [[Fidel Castro]] in Cuba. Major [[William Alexander Morgan|William Morgan]] agreed to lead the attack for $1 million, but Castro learned of the plot and instructed Morgan to go along with it and report back. Trujillo was tricked into believing that Morgan had captured [[Trinidad, Cuba|Trinidad]]. On August 13, 1959, a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] transport flying from the Dominican Republic carrying military advisors and supplies landed at Trinidad airport. Castro seized the aircraft and the ten occupants and arrested some 4,000 suspects throughout Cuba.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=240}} Earlier in June, Cuban soldiers and Cuban-trained Dominican guerrillas attempted an unsuccessful invasion of the Dominican Republic.<ref>{{cite web |title=Foreign Intervention by Cuba |url=https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP77M00144R000400100003-7.pdf |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)}}</ref> Between 1946 and 1949, the Dominican government purchased military aircraft and warships from the British government,<ref>{{cite web |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1951, The United Nations; The Western Hemisphere, Volume II |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1951v02/d786? |publisher=Office of the Historian}}</ref> which were used to defeat the invasion by air and sea.

On November 25, 1960, Trujillo's henchmen killed three of the four [[Mirabal sisters]], nicknamed ''Las Mariposas'' (The Butterflies). Along with their husbands, the sisters were conspiring to overthrow Trujillo in a violent revolt. The [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]] is observed on the anniversary of their deaths.

After its representatives confirmed Trujillo's complicity in the nearly successful assassination attempt, the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), for the first time in its history, decreed sanctions against a member state.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1978|p=28}} The OAS voted unanimously to condemn the Dominican Republic for its aggression and imposed an arms embargo.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=256}} The United States severed diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic on August 26, 1960, and in January 1961 suspended the export of trucks, parts, crude oil, gasoline and other petroleum products. U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] also took advantage of OAS sanctions to drastically cut purchases of Dominican sugar, the country's major export. This action ultimately cost the Dominican Republic almost $22,000,000 in lost revenues at a time when its economy was in a rapid decline.

===Post-Trujillo (1961–1996)===
[[File:Juan Bosch (1963).jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]], the first democratically elected president after Trujillo]] After the assassination, [[Ramfis Trujillo]], the dictator's son, remained in de facto control of the government for the next 6 months, as commander of the armed forces. Trujillo's brothers, Hector Bienvenido and Jose Arismendi Trujillo, returned to the country and plotted against President Balaguer. On November 18, 1961, as a planned coup became more evident, U.S. Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] issued a warning that the US would not "remain idle" if the Trujillos attempted to "reassert dictatorial domination". Following this warning, and the arrival of a 14-vessel U.S. naval task force within sight of Santo Domingo, Ramfis and his uncles fled the country on November 19. The OAS lifted its sanctions on January 4, 1962.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1978|p=62}}

In February 1963, a democratically elected government under leftist [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] took office but it was overthrown by a military coup in September. On April 24, 1965, a second military coup ousted the military-installed president [[Donald Reid Cabral]].{{sfn|Musicant|1990|p=363}} Despite tank assaults, [[strafing]], and aerial bombardment by the opposing Loyalists, the pro-Bosch Constitutionalists maintained control of most of the capital. By April 26, 5,000 armed civilians outnumbered the 1,500 original rebel military regulars. Radio Santo Domingo, now fully under rebel control, began to call for more violent actions and the killing of all police officers.

On April 28, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] deployed U.S. Marines from [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] to Santo Domingo to protect American citizens, with U.S. forces subsequently expanded to 24,000 troops.<ref name=nyt/> On April 30, two battalions of the [[82nd Airborne Division]] landed at [[San Isidro Air Base|San Isidro airfield]].

However, the Loyalists withdrew to San Isidro airfield instead.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=276}} On May 2, U.S. forces were authorized to link up, and the outgunned Constitutionalists retreated to the southeastern part of the city. A ceasefire was declared on May 5. The following day, U.S. diplomats persuaded the OAS to establish an [[Inter-American Peace Force]] to support American troops.
