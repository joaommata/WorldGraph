[[File:Vinca clay figure 02.jpg|thumb|130px|left|[[Vinča culture]] figurine, 4000–4500 BC]]
Archaeological evidence of [[Paleolithic]] settlements on the territory of present-day Serbia is scarce. A fragment of a hominid jaw found in [[Sićevo]] (Mala [[Balanica]]) is believed to be up to 525,000–397,000 years old.{{sfn|Roksandic|2011|pp=186–196}}

Approximately 6,500 BC, during the [[Neolithic]], the [[Starčevo culture|Starčevo]] and [[Vinča culture|Vinča]] cultures existed in the region of modern-day Belgrade. They dominated much of [[Southeast Europe]] as well as parts of [[Central Europe]] and [[Anatolia]]. Several important archaeological sites from this era, including [[Lepenski Vir]] and [[Vinča-Belo Brdo]], still exist near the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Chapman|1981|p=}}{{sfn|Srejović|1988|p=}}

During the [[Iron Age]], local tribes of [[Triballi]], [[Dardani]], and [[Autariatae]] were encountered by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] during their cultural and political expansion into the region, from the 5th up to the 2nd century BC. The Celtic tribe of [[Scordisci]] settled throughout the area in the 3rd century BC. It formed a tribal state, building several fortifications, including their capital at [[Singidunum]] (present-day Belgrade) and Naissos (present-day [[Niš]]).

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered much of the territory in the 2nd century BC. In 167 BC, the [[Roman province]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] was established; the remainder was conquered around 75 BC, forming the Roman province of [[Moesia#History|Moesia Superior]]; the modern-day [[Srem District|Srem]] region was conquered in 9 BC; and Bačka and Banat in 106 AD after the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]. As a result of this, contemporary Serbia extends fully or partially over several former Roman provinces, including [[Moesia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Praevalitana]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Dacia]], and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Seventeen Roman Emperors were born in the area of modern-day Serbia, second only to contemporary Italy.{{sfn|Kuzmanović|Mihajlović|2015|pp=416–432}} The most famous of these was [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian Emperor, who issued an edict ordering [[Edict of Milan|religious tolerance throughout the Empire]].

When the Roman Empire was divided in 395, most of Serbia remained under the [[Byzantine Empire]], and its northwestern parts were included in the [[Western Roman Empire]]. By the 6th century, [[South Slavs]] migrated into the Byzantine territory in large numbers.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1956|p=84}} They merged with the local [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanised]] population that was gradually assimilated.{{sfn|Stipčević|1977|p=76}}{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=38, 41}}{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=533}}

During the 11th and 12th century, [[Grand Principality of Serbia|Serbian state]] frequently fought with the neighbouring Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|pp=23&ndash;24}} Between 1166 and 1371, Serbia was ruled by the [[Nemanjić dynasty]], under whom the state was elevated to [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|a kingdom]] in 1217,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=38}} and an [[Serbian Empire|empire]] in 1346,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=64}} under [[Stefan Dušan]]. The [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] was organised as an [[Autocephaly|autocephalous]] archbishopric in 1219,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=28}} through the effort of [[Saint Sava|Sava]], the country's patron saint, and in 1346 it was raised to the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć|Patriarchate]]. Monuments of the Nemanjić period survive in many [[List of Serbian Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] (several being [[List of World Heritage Sites in Serbia|World Heritage sites]]) and [[List of fortifications in Serbia|fortifications]].

During these centuries the Serbian state (and influence) expanded significantly. The northern part (modern [[Vojvodina]]), was ruled by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The period after 1371, known as the [[Fall of the Serbian Empire]] saw the once-powerful state fragmented into several principalities, culminating in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389) against the rising [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|pp=84&ndash;85}} By the end of the 14th century, the Turks had conquered and ruled the territories south of the [[Šar Mountains]]. The political stronghold of Serbia shifted northwards, when the capital of the newly established [[Serbian Despotate]] was transferred to Belgrade in 1403,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=89}} before moving to [[Smederevo]] in 1430.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=90}} The Despotate was then under the double [[vassalage]] of Hungary and the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=101}} The fall of Smederevo on 20 June 1459, which marked the full conquest of the Serbian Despotate by the Ottomans, also symbolically signified the end of the Serbian state.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=108}}

In all Serbian lands conquered by the Ottomans, the native nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was [[Serfdom|enserfed]] to Ottoman rulers, while much of the clergy fled or were confined to the isolated monasteries. Under the Ottoman system, Serbs and Christians were considered an [[rayah|inferior class]] and subjected to heavy taxes, and a portion of the Serbian population experienced [[Islamization|Islamisation]]. Many Serbs were recruited during the [[devshirme]] system, a [[slavery in the Ottoman Empire|form of slavery]], in which boys from Balkan Christian families were [[Forced conversion|forcibly converted]] to [[Islam]] and trained for infantry units of the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] known as the [[Janissaries]].{{sfn|A ́goston|Masters|2010|p=383}}{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2001|p=251}}{{sfn|Rodriguez|1997|p=6}}{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=62}} The Serbian Patriarchate of Peć was extinguished in 1463,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=134}} but reestablished in 1557,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|pp=135&ndash;136}}{{sfn|Fotić|2008|pp=519–520}}{{sfn|Sotirović|2011|pp=143–169}} providing for limited continuation of Serbian cultural traditions within the Ottoman Empire, under the [[Millet system]].{{sfn|Runciman|1968|p=204}}{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=115}}

After the loss of statehood to the Ottoman Empire, Serbian resistance continued in northern regions (modern Vojvodina), under titular despots (until 1537), and popular leaders like [[Jovan Nenad]] (1526–1527). From 1521 to 1552, Ottomans conquered Belgrade and regions of Syrmia, Bačka, and Banat.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|pp=115, 119}} Wars and rebellions constantly challenged Ottoman rule. One of the most significant was the [[Banat Uprising]] in 1594 and 1595, which was part of the [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] (1593–1606) between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|pp=141–142}}{{sfn|Sotirović|2011|pp=163–164}} The area of modern Vojvodina endured a century-long Ottoman occupation before being ceded to the [[Habsburg monarchy]], partially by the [[Treaty of Karlovci]] (1699),{{sfn|Pešalj|2010|pp=29&ndash;42}} and fully by the [[Treaty of Požarevac]] (1718).{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=151}}

During the [[Great Turkish War|Habsburg-Ottoman war (1683–1699)]], much of Serbia switched from Ottoman rule to [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1686–91)|Habsburg control]] from 1688 to 1690.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=143}} However, the Ottoman army reconquered a large part of Serbia in the winter of 1689/1690, leading to a brutal massacre of the civilian population by uncontrolled [[Albanians|Albanian]] and [[Tatars|Tatar]] units. As a result of the persecutions, several tens of thousands of Serbs, led by the patriarch, [[Arsenije III Crnojević]], fled northwards to settle in [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Hungary]],{{sfn|Katić|2012|p=140}} an event known as the [[Great Migrations of the Serbs|Great Migration of 1690]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|pp=146–147}} In August 1690, following several petitions, the Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] formally granted Serbs from the Habsburg monarchy a first set of "privileges",{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|pp=143–144}}{{sfn|Todorović|2006|pp=7–8}} primarily to guarantee them freedom of religion.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=144}} As a consequence, the ecclesiastical centre of the Serbs also moved northwards, to the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]],{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=150}} and the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć was once-again abolished by the Ottomans in 1766.{{sfn|Jelavich|1983a|p=94}}{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=177}}

In 1718–39, the Habsburg monarchy occupied much of [[Central Serbia]] and established the [[Kingdom of Serbia (1718–39)|Kingdom of Serbia]] as [[crownland]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=151}} Those gains were lost by the [[Treaty of Belgrade]] in 1739, when the Ottomans retook the region.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=176}} Apart from territory of modern-day Vojvodina which remained under the Habsburg Empire, central regions of Serbia were occupied once again by the Habsburgs in [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788–92)|1788–1792]].

The [[Serbian Revolution]] for independence from the Ottoman Empire lasted eleven years, from 1804 until 1815.{{sfn|Jelavich|1983a|pp=193–204}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|pp=29–32}}{{sfn|Radosavljević|2010|pp=171–178}}{{sfn|Rajić|2010|pp=143–148}} During the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804–1813), led by vožd [[Karađorđe Petrović]], Serbia was independent for almost a decade before the Ottoman army was able to reoccupy the country.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|pp=179–183}} The [[Second Serbian Uprising]] began in 1815, led by [[Miloš Obrenović]]; it ended with a compromise between Serbian revolutionaries and Ottoman authorities.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|pp=190–196}} Serbia was one of the first nations in the Balkans to abolish [[feudalism]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=191}} The [[Akkerman Convention]] in 1826, the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] in 1829 and finally, the [[Hatt-i Sharif]], recognised the [[suzerainty]] of Serbia. The [[Sretenje Constitution|First Serbian Constitution]] was adopted on 15 February 1835, making the country one of the first to adopt a democratic constitution in Europe.{{sfn|Stavrianos|2000|pp=248–250}}{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=195}} 15 February is now commemorated as [[Statehood Day (Serbia)|Statehood Day]], a [[Public holidays in Serbia|public holiday]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fim.edu.rs/en/statehood-day-of-the-republic-of-serbia-2019/ |title=Statehood Day of the Republic of Serbia 2019 |website=School of Engineering Management (Belgrade) |access-date=12 February 2020 |archive-date=10 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220510073608/https://fim.edu.rs/en/statehood-day-of-the-republic-of-serbia-2019/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Following the clashes between the Ottoman army and Serbs in Belgrade in 1862,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|pp=214&ndash;215}} and under pressure from the [[Great Powers]], by 1867 the last Turkish soldiers left the Principality, making the country ''de facto'' independent.{{sfn|Jelavich|1983a|p=246}} By enacting a new constitution in 1869,{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=58}} without consulting the Porte, [[Jovan Ristic|Serbian diplomats]] confirmed the ''de facto'' independence of the country. In 1876, Serbia declared war on the Ottoman Empire, siding with the ongoing Christian uprisings in [[Uprising in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1875-1878)|Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and [[Bulgarian Uprising of 1876|Bulgaria]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|pp=63&ndash;64}}{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=224}}

The formal independence of the country was internationally recognised at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, which ended the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]]; this treaty, however, prohibited Serbia from uniting with other Serbian regions by placing Bosnia and Herzegovina under [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] occupation, alongside the occupation of the region of [[Raška (region)|Raška]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=225}} From 1815 to 1903, the principality was ruled by the [[House of Obrenović]], save for the rule of Prince [[Alexander Karađorđević, Prince of Serbia|Aleksandar Karađorđević]] between 1842 and 1858. In 1882, Principality of Serbia became the Kingdom of Serbia, ruled by [[Milan I of Serbia|King Milan I]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=70}} The [[House of Karađorđević]], descendants of the revolutionary leader Karađorđe Petrović, assumed power in 1903 following the [[May Overthrow]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=73}}
The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848 revolution in Austria]] led to the establishment of the autonomous territory of [[Serbian Vojvodina]]; by 1849, the region was transformed into the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=203}}

In the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912, the [[Balkan League]] defeated the Ottoman Empire and captured its [[Treaty of London, 1913|European territories]], which enabled territorial expansion of the Kingdom of Serbia into regions of Raška, [[Kosovo (region)|Kosovo]], [[Metohija]], and [[Vardarian Macedonia]]. The [[Second Balkan War]] soon ensued when Bulgaria turned on its former allies, but was defeated, resulting in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]].

The [[Assassination in Sarajevo|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] on 28 June 1914 in [[Sarajevo]] by [[Gavrilo Princip]], a member of the [[Young Bosnia]] organisation, led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia, on 28 July 1914, setting off World War I.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|pp=246–247}}

The [[Corfu Declaration]] was a formal agreement between the government-in-exile of the Kingdom of Serbia and the [[Yugoslav Committee]] (anti-Habsburg South Slav émigrés) that pledged to unify Kingdom of Serbia and [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] with Austria-Hungary's South Slav autonomous crown lands: [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]], [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], [[Slovenia]], Vojvodina (then part of the Kingdom of Hungary) and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in a post-war Yugoslav state.

As the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed, the territory of Syrmia united with Serbia on 24 November 1918.<ref name="Collection of Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum 1914" /> Just a day later, the [[Great People's Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs in Banat, Bačka and Baranja]] declared the unification of these regions ([[Banat]], [[Bačka]], and [[Baranya County (former)|Baranja]]) with Serbia.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.arhivyu.gov.rs/active/en/home/glavna_navigacija/leksikon_jugoslavije/konstitutivni_akti_jugoslavije/prvodecembarski_akt.html |title=Arhiv Jugoslavije – 1 December Act, 1 December 1918<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=14 August 2019 |archive-date=10 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220510073628/http://www.arhivyu.gov.rs/active/en/home/glavna_navigacija/leksikon_jugoslavije/konstitutivni_akti_jugoslavije/prvodecembarski_akt.html }}</ref>

Serb centralists and Croat autonomists clashed in the parliament, and most governments were fragile and short-lived. [[Nikola Pašić]], a conservative prime minister, headed or dominated most governments until his death. King Alexander established a [[6 January Dictatorship|dictatorship]] in 1929 with the aim of establishing the [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslav ideology]] and single [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav nation]], changed the name of the country to Yugoslavia. The effect of Alexander's dictatorship was to further alienate the non-Serbs living in Yugoslavia from the idea of unity.{{sfn|Stavrianos|2000|p=624}}

Alexander was assassinated in [[Marseille]], during an official visit in 1934 by [[Vlado Chernozemski]], member of the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization|IMRO]]. Alexander was succeeded by his eleven-year-old son [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]]. In August 1939 the [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement]] established an autonomous [[Banate of Croatia]] as a solution to Croatian concerns.

===World War II===
{{Main|World War II in Yugoslavia|The Holocaust in German-occupied Serbia|Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia}}

In 1941, in spite of Yugoslav attempts to remain neutral, the [[Axis powers]] invaded Yugoslavia. The territory of modern Serbia was divided between Hungary, Bulgaria, the Independent State of Croatia, Greater Albania and Montenegro, while the remainder was placed under the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|military administration]] of [[Nazi Germany]], with [[Government of National Salvation|Serbian puppet governments]] led by [[Milan Aćimović]] and [[Milan Nedić]] assisted by [[Dimitrije Ljotić]]'s fascist organisation [[Yugoslav National Movement]] (Zbor).

The Yugoslav territory was the scene of a civil war between [[Chetniks|royalist Chetniks]] commanded by [[Draža Mihailović]] and [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|communist partisans]] commanded by [[Josip Broz Tito]]. Axis auxiliary units of the [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] and the [[Serbian State Guard]] fought against both of these forces. The [[siege of Kraljevo]] was a major battle of the [[Uprising in Serbia (1941)|uprising in Serbia]], led by Chetnik forces against the Nazis. Several days after the battle began the German forces committed a massacre of approximately 2,000 civilians in an event known as the [[Kraljevo massacre]], in a reprisal for the attack.

[[Loznica|Draginac and Loznica massacre]] of 2,950 villagers in Western Serbia in 1941 was the first large execution of civilians in occupied Serbia by [[Nazi|German]]s, with [[Kragujevac massacre]] and [[Novi Sad Raid]] of Jews and Serbs by Hungarian fascists being the most notorious, with over 3,000 victims in each case.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=62}}<ref>{{cite news|title=The Kragujevac massacre |first=Karl |last=Savich |url=http://www.pogledi.rs/kragujevac/english/1e.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217101508/http://www.pogledi.rs/kragujevac/english/1e.php |archive-date=17 December 2012 }}</ref> After one year of occupation, around 16,000 [[Serbian Jews]] were murdered in the area, or around 90% of its pre-war Jewish population during [[The Holocaust in Serbia]].

The victory of the Communist Partisans resulted in the abolition of the monarchy and a subsequent constitutional referendum. A [[one-party state]] was soon established in Yugoslavia by the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist Party of Yugoslavia]].

Serbia's most powerful and influential politician in Tito-era Yugoslavia was [[Aleksandar Ranković]], one of the "big four" Yugoslav leaders. Ranković was later removed from the office because of the disagreements regarding Kosovo's [[nomenklatura]] and the unity of Serbia. Ranković's dismissal was highly unpopular among Serbs. Pro-decentralisation reformers in Yugoslavia succeeded in the late 1960s in attaining substantial decentralisation of powers, creating substantial autonomy in Kosovo and Vojvodina, and recognising a distinctive "[[Muslims (ethnicity)|Muslim]]" nationality. As a result of these reforms, there was a massive overhaul of Kosovo's nomenklatura and police, that shifted from being Serb-dominated to ethnic Albanian-dominated through firing Serbs on a large scale. Further concessions were made to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo in response to unrest, including the creation of the [[University of Pristina (1969–1999)|University of Pristina]] as an [[Albanian language]] institution. These changes created widespread fear among Serbs of being treated as [[second-class citizen]]s.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Melissa Katherine |last1=Bokovoy |first2=Jill A. |last2=Irvine |first3=Carol S. |last3=Lilly |title=State-society relations in Yugoslavia, 1945–1992 |location=Scranton, Pennsylvania |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=1997 |pages=295–296, 301}}</ref>

===Contemporary period===
On 21 May 2006, Montenegro held a [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum|referendum]] which showed 55.4% of voters in favour of independence, just above the 55% required by the referendum. This was followed on 5 June 2006 by Serbia's declaration of independence, marking the re-emergence of Serbia as an independent state. The [[National Assembly of Serbia]] declared Serbia to be the legal successor to the former state union.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5083690.stm|title=Montenegro gets Serb recognition|publisher=BBC|date=15 June 2006|access-date=5 February 2008|archive-date=5 June 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230605015301/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5083690.stm|url-status=live}}</ref>
