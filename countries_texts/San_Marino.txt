[[File:Marino als steinhauer.png|thumb|left|200x200px|Illustration of Saint Marinus, the founder of the Republic of San Marino and prominent cultural figure]]
According to accounts that were first recorded centuries after he is suggested to have lived,<ref>Edwards, Adrian, and Chris Michaelides. San Marino. Vol. 188. Abc-Clio Incorporated, 1996, 19.</ref><ref name=":4" /> [[Saint Marinus]] left the [[island of Rab]] in present-day [[Croatia]] with his lifelong friend Leo, and went to the city of [[Rimini]] as a stonemason. After the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] following his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby mountain [[Monte Titano]], where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and state of San Marino. According to William Miller, these accounts of the origin of San Marino "are a mixture of fables and miracles, but perhaps contain some grains of fact". The earliest historical evidence for a monastic community in San Marino dates to the 5th or 6th century AD, when a monk named Eugippus recorded that another monk had lived in a monastery in the area.<ref name=":4" />

In 1291, San Marino appealed to the bishop of Arezzo, Ildebrandino Guidi di Romena, against the contribution demands by the Vicario del [[Montefeltro]]. Jurist Palamede di Rimini decided in favour of San Marino and recognised its tax exemption from tributes demands of Montefeltro. In 1296, when Guglielmo Durante was the governor of Romagna, Sammarinesi appealed to [[Pope Boniface VIII]] against the further requests by the Montefeltro [[Podestà|podestas]] regarding tributes. Abbot Ranieri di Sant'Anastasio was assigned to judge the dispute. A long process was held using various witnesses and sources to determine San Marino tax's exemption status. The verdict was probably in favour of the autonomy of San Marino, as later the State did not pay taxes to the Montefeltro.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rossini|first=Giuseppe|date=1958|title=Un documento inedito della Repubblica di S.

After the [[Duchy of Urbino]] was annexed by the [[Papal States]] in 1625, San Marino became surrounded by the papal states. This led to its seeking the formal protection of the Papal States in 1631, but this never amounted to a ''de facto'' Papal control of the republic.<ref>Nevio and Annio Maria Matteimi ''The Republic of San Marino: Historical and Artistic Guide to the City and the Castles'', 2011, p. 21.</ref> The country was occupied on 17 October 1739 by the legate (Papal governor) of [[Ravenna]], Cardinal [[Giulio Alberoni]], but independence was restored by [[Pope Clement XII]] on 5 February 1740, the feast day of [[Agatha of Sicily|Saint Agatha]], after which she became a patron saint of the republic.<ref name="Annio Maria Matteimi 2011, p. 23">Nevio and Annio Maria Matteimi ''The Republic of San Marino: Historical and Artistic Guide to the City and the Castles'', 2011, p. 23.</ref>

The advance of [[Napoleon]]'s army in 1797 presented a brief threat to the independence of San Marino, but the country was saved from losing its liberty by one of its regents, [[Antonio Onofri]], who managed to gain the respect and friendship of Napoleon. Due to Onofri's intervention, Napoleon promised in a letter to [[Gaspard Monge]], a scientist and the commissary of the French Government for Science and Art, to guarantee and protect the independence of the Republic, even offering to extend its territory according to its needs. The offer was declined by the regents, fearing future retaliation from other states' [[revanchism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanmarinosite.com/eng/napoleone.html|title=From 1500 to beginning 1800, Napoleon in San Marino|publisher=Sanmarinosite.com|access-date=24 October 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518123316/http://www.sanmarinosite.com/eng/napoleone.html|archive-date=18 May 2009}}</ref><ref>''Histoire abrégée des traités de paix entre les puissances de l'Europe depuis la Paix de Westphalie'', Christophe-Guillaume Koch, ed., Paris, 1817, vol.

During the later phase of the [[Italian unification]] process in the 19th century, San Marino served as a refuge for many people persecuted because of their support for unification, including [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and his wife [[Anita Garibaldi|Anita]]. Garibaldi allowed San Marino to remain independent. San Marino and the [[Kingdom of Italy]] signed a Convention of Friendship in 1862.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:oht/law-oht-125-CTS-417.regGroup.1/law-oht-125-CTS-417?rskey=s2TBhg&result=8&prd=OPIL|title=Convention of Good Neighbourship between Italy and San Marino, signed at Turin, 22 March 1862|publisher=Oxford Public International Law|access-date=12 September 2022}}</ref> The government of San Marino made United States President [[Abraham Lincoln]] an honorary citizen.

===20th century onwards===
During [[World War I]], when Italy declared war on [[Austria-Hungary]] on 24 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral and Italy adopted a hostile view of Sammarinese neutrality, suspecting that San Marino could harbour Austrian spies who could be given access to its new radiotelegraph station. Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of [[Carabinieri]] in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not acquiesce. Two groups of ten volunteers joined the Italian forces in the fighting on the [[Italian front (World War I)|Italian front]], the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital. The existence of this hospital later caused Austria-Hungary to suspend diplomatic relations with San Marino.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.educazione.sm/scuola/servizi/CD_virtuali/lavori_scuole/sanmarino/prima_guerra_mondiale.htm|title=San Marino e la Prima Guerra Mondiale|publisher=Educazione.sm|access-date=24 October 2009}}</ref>

After the war, San Marino suffered from high rates of unemployment and inflation, leading to increased tension between the lower and middle classes. The latter, fearing that the moderate government of San Marino would make concessions to the lower class majority, began to show support for the [[Sammarinese Fascist Party]] ({{Lang|it|Partito Fascista Sammarinese}}, PFS), founded in 1922, and styled largely on their [[National Fascist Party|Italian counterpart]]. PFS rule lasted from 1923 to 1943, and during this time they often sought support from [[Benito Mussolini]]'s fascist government in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Valentina|title=World Wars and Fascism in San Marino|url=https://www.sanmarinosite.com/en/history/world-wars-fascism/|website=Sanmarinosite.com|date=13 October 2014|publisher=San Marino Site Turismo|access-date=28 February 2019}}</ref> During [[World War II]], San Marino remained neutral, although it was wrongly reported in an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that it had declared war on the [[United Kingdom]] on 17 September 1940.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://209.157.64.200/focus/chat/2591636/posts|title=Gales Scatter Nazi Channel Fleets; Italians Thrust Deeper into Egypt (9/18/40)|publisher=209.157.64.200|date=18 September 2010|access-date=16 September 2013|archive-date=24 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224030945/http://209.157.64.200/focus/chat/2591636/posts|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Sammarinese government later transmitted a message to the British government stating that they had not actually declared war.<ref>{{cite web|title=Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers, 1944, Europe, Volume IV|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1944v04/pg_292|website=Office of the Historian|publisher=(U.S.) Department of State|access-date=29 May 2022|pages=291–292|date=4 July 1944}}</ref>

On 28 July 1943, three days after the [[fall of the Fascist regime in Italy]], PFS rule collapsed and the new government declared neutrality in the conflict. The PFS regained power on 1 April 1944, but kept neutrality intact. On 26 June 1944, the [[bombing of San Marino]] happened. The country was bombed by four waves of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombers under the incorrect belief that San Marino had been occupied by German forces and was being used to amass stores and ammunition. The Sammarinese government declared on the same day that no military installations or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter.<ref>{{cite web|title=Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers, 1944, Europe, Volume IV|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1944v04/pg_290|website=Office of the Historian|publisher=(U.S.) Department of State|access-date=29 May 2022|pages=290–291|date=4 July 1944}}</ref> Nevertheless, smaller bombing raids continued until the 29th of August of that year, causing extensive damage to the city centre as well as the railway line connecting the country to nearby Rimini. San Marino accepted thousands of civilian refugees when Allied forces overran the [[Gothic Line]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanmarinosite.com/storia/guerremo.html|title=Guerre Mondiali e Fascismo nella storia di San Marino|publisher=Sanmarinosite.com|access-date=24 October 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410122359/http://www.sanmarinosite.com/storia/guerremo.html|archive-date=10 April 2014}}</ref> In September 1944, it was briefly occupied by German forces, who were defeated by the Allies in the [[Battle of San Marino]]. Allied troops occupied San Marino for two months before departing.<ref>{{Cite web|date=7 July 1961|title=San Marino (War Damage Claim)|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/1961-07-07/debates/d28b1681-a826-4458-9366-c223421b81b0/SanMarino(WarDamageClaim)|website=UK Parliament|quote="In February, 1952, the Government of San Marino agreed to limit their claim only to compensation for damage caused by the bombing on 26th June, 1944, as they considered—and still consider—that the damage which occurred after the bombardment on 26th June, 1944, was the responsibility of the German Armed Forces."}}</ref>

San Marino had the world's first democratically elected [[communism|communist]] government – a coalition between the [[Sammarinese Communist Party]] and the [[Sammarinese Socialist Party]], which held office between 1945 and 1957.<ref name="Desai2006">{{cite book|last1=Desai|first1=Manali|title=State Formation and Radical Democracy in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60m9znJQmmkC&pg=PA142|access-date=31 August 2013|date=2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-203-96774-4|page=142}}</ref><ref name="Mayne1999">{{cite book|last1=Mayne|first1=Alan James|title=From Politics Past to Politics Future: An Integrated Analysis of Current and Emergent Paradigms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MkTz6Rq7wUC&pg=PA59|access-date=31 August 2013|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96151-0|page=59}}</ref> The coalition lost power through the [[fatti di Rovereta]]. San Marino became a member of the [[Council of Europe]] in 1988 and of the [[United Nations]] in 1992. It is not a member of the [[European Union]], although it uses the [[euro]] as its currency (despite not legally being part of the [[Eurozone]]). Before the introduction of the euro, the country's currency was the [[Sammarinese lira]].
