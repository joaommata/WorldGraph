=== Early history ===
The area now called Kiribati has been inhabited by [[Austronesian peoples]] speaking the same [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic language]], from north to south, including the southernmost [[Nui (atoll)|Nui]], since sometime between 3000&nbsp;BC<ref name=cind>Macdonald, Barrie (2001) ''Cinderellas of the Empire: towards a history of Kiribati and Tuvalu'', Institute of Pacific Studies, [[University of the South Pacific]], Suva, Fiji, {{ISBN|982-02-0335-X}}, p. 1</ref> and 1300&nbsp;AD.{{sfn|Thomas|2003|p=5}} The area was not completely isolated; later, voyagers from [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], and [[Fiji]] introduced some [[Polynesia]]n and [[Melanesia]]n cultural aspects, respectively. Intermarriage and intense navigation between the islands tended to blur cultural differences and resulted in a significant degree of cultural homogenization.<ref name=brit/><ref>{{cite web |title=Background Note: Kiribati |url=http://www.mfep.gov.ki/Facts%20and%20Background.htm |website=Ministry of Finance and Economic Development |access-date=23 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014051525/http://www.mfep.gov.ki/Facts%20and%20Background.htm |archive-date=14 October 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Local oral historians chiefly in the form of lore keepers suggest that the area was first inhabited by a group of seafaring people from [[Melanesia]], who were described as being dark-skinned, frizzy-haired, and short in stature. These [[indigenous peoples]] were then visited by early [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] seafarers from the west, a place called Matang, orally described as being tall and fair-skinned.

Around AD 1300, a mass departure occurred from [[Samoa]] leading to the addition of Polynesian ancestry into the mix of most Gilbertese people.<ref>{{cite web |title=DNA offers a new look at how Polynesia was settled |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-genetics-how-polynesia-settled-migration-islands-pacific-ocean |website=ScienceNews |date=22 September 2021 |language=en |access-date=8 May 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Study gives Polynesia migrations new timelines |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/194538/study-gives-polynesia-migrations-new-timelinesn |website=rnz.co.nz |date=28 December 2010 |language=en |access-date=8 May 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Evolutionary history of modern Samoans |date=2020 |pmc=7196816 |language=en |last1=Harris |first1=D.

Around the 15th century, starkly contrasting systems of governance arose between the northern islands, primarily under chiefly rule (''uea''), and the central and southern islands, primarily under the rule of their council of elders (''unimwaane''). [[Tabiteuea]] could be an exception as the sole island that is known as maintaining a traditional [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] society.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tabiteuea Island |url=https://www.kiribatitourism.gov.ki/islands-to-explore/tabiteuea-island/ |website=kiribatitourism.gov.ki |language=en |access-date=8 May 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Tabiteuea North: its Social and Economic Organisation |url=https://ir.wgtn.ac.nz/items/7f332ba9-c7b3-4ed4-b00c-1a2a3409a418 |website=Victoria University of Wellington |date=1975 |language=en |access-date=8 May 2025 |last1=Geddes |first1=William Harold }}</ref>  

The name Tabiteuea stems from the root phrase ''Tabu-te-Uea'', meaning "chiefs are forbidden".<ref>But the organization of the political decisions was far more complex as described by Jean-Paul Latouche, in ''Qui veut prendre la parole ?'' (2003) by [[Marcel Detienne]].</ref> Civil war soon became a factor, with acquisition of land being the main form of conquest. Clans and chiefs began fighting over resources, stimulated by hatred and reignited blood feuds, which had their origins months, years, or even decades before.
The turmoil lasted well into the European visitation and colonial era, which led to certain islands decimating their foes with the help of guns and cannon-equipped ships that Europeans provided to some I-Kiribati leaders.<ref name="jps.auckland.ac.nz"/> 

The typical military arms of the I-Kiribati at this time were shark tooth-embedded wooden spears,<ref>{{cite web |title=At Harms Length: Shark Tooth Spears of the Gilbert Islands |url=https://www.bowers.org/index.php/collections-blog/at-harms-length-shark-tooth-spears-of-the-gilbert-islands |website=bowers.og |language=en |date=16 May 2019 |access-date=8 May 2025}}</ref> knives, and swords, and garbs of armour fashioned from dense coconut fibre.<ref>{{cite web |title=The art of armour in Kiribati |url=https://www.fg-art.org/en/artwork-of-the-month-archives/the-art-of-armour-in-kiribati |website=fg-art.org |language=en |date=November 2020 |access-date=8 May 2025}}</ref> They chiefly used these instead of the gunpowder and weapons of steel available at the time, because of the strong sentimental value of the equipment handed down through generations. Ranged weapons, such as bows, slings, and javelins, were seldom used; [[Culture of Kiribati#Kiribati traditional martial arts|hand-to-hand combat]] was a prominent skill still practised today, though seldom mentioned because of various taboos associated with it, secrecy being the primary one. [[Abemama]]'s High Chief [[Tembinok']] was the last of the dozens of expansionist chiefs of Gilbert Islands of this period,<ref>{{cite web |title=In Their Words: History and Society in Gilbertese Oral Tradition |url=https://fr.scribd.com/document/687185479/21221 |author=Kambati K.

In 1902, the [[Pacific Cable Station|Pacific Cable Board]] laid the first trans-Pacific telegraph cable from [[Bamfield]], British Columbia, to [[Fanning Island]] (Tabuaeran) in the Line Islands, and from Fiji to Fanning Island, thus completing the [[All Red Line]], a series of telegraph lines circumnavigating the globe completely within the British Empire. The location of Fanning Island, one of the closest formations to Hawaii, led to its annexation by the British Empire in 1888. Nearby candidates including [[Palmyra Island]] were not favoured due to the lack of adequate landing sites.<ref>{{cite web |title=Palmyra Atoll |url=https://www.smoketreemanor.com/palmyra-atoll/5/ |page=5 |website=smoketreemanor.com |date=17 March 2019 |language=en |access-date=8 May 2025}}</ref>

The United States eventually incorporated the Northern Line Islands into its territories, and did the same with the [[Phoenix Islands]], which lie between Gilberts and the Line Islands, including [[Howland Island|Howland]], [[Jarvis Island|Jarvis]], and [[Baker Island|Baker]] islands, thus causing a territorial dispute. That was eventually resolved and they finally became part of Kiribati under the [[Treaty of Tarawa]].<ref> That treaty was signed shortly after independence and ratified in 1983, with the United States relinquishing all claims to the sparsely-inhabited Phoenix Islands, and those of the Line Islands that are part of Kiribati territory.</ref>

[[Betio]] became an airfield and supply base. The expulsion of the Japanese forces in late 1943 involved one of the bloodiest battles in [[US Marine Corps]] history. Marines landed in November 1943 and the [[Battle of Tarawa]] ensued. As the headquarters of the colony, Banaba was bombed, evacuated and occupied by Japan in 1942 and not freed until 1945, after the massacre of all but one of the Gilbertese on the island by the Japanese forces. [[Funafuti]] then hosted the provisional headquarters of the colony from 1942 to 1946, when Tarawa returned to host the headquarters.<ref>{{cite web |title=HyperWar: Building the Navy's Bases in World War II: History of the Bureau of Yards and Docks and the Civil Engineer Corps, 1940-1946 |url=https://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Building_Bases/bases-24.html |language=en |access-date=10 May 2025}}</ref>

At the end of 1945, most of the remaining inhabitants of Banaba, repatriated from [[Kosrae]], [[Nauru]] and Tarawa, were relocated to [[Rabi Island]], an island of Fiji that the British government had acquired in 1942 for this purpose.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://journals.openedition.org/jso/7100|doi = 10.4000/jso.7100|title = Phosphate mining and the relocation of the Banabans to northern Fiji in 1945: Lessons for climate change-forced displacement|year = 2014|last1 = Edwards|first1 = Julia B.|journal = Journal de la Société des Océanistes|issue = 138–139|pages = 121–136|doi-access = free}}</ref>

Further military operations in the colony occurred in the late 1950s and early 1960s when [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] was used by the United States and United Kingdom for [[nuclear weapons testing]] including [[thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bombs]].<ref>[https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA136820.pdf] Operation Dominic I, United States Atmospheric Nuclear Weapons Test Personnel Review, Defense Nuclear Agency for the Department of Defense, 1962</ref>

Institutions of internal self-rule were established on Tarawa from about 1967. The Ellice Islands requested their separation from the rest of the colony in 1974 and were granted their own internal self-rule institutions. The separation entered into force on 1 January 1976. In 1978, the Ellice Islands became the independent state of [[Tuvalu]].<ref name="auto1">Ridgell, Reilly (1995) ''Pacific Nations and Territories: The Islands of Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia''. 3rd Edition.

A no-confidence vote provoked another [[1983 Kiribati parliamentary election|election in 1983]]. In the post-independence period, [[overcrowding]] has been an issue, at least in British and aid organisations' eyes. In 1988, an announcement was made that 4,700 residents of the main island group would be resettled onto less populated islands. In September 1994, [[Teburoro Tito]] from the opposition was elected president.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=East |first1=Roger |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5VO4AwAAQBAJ&dq=Teburoro+Tito+25+August+1953&pg=PA274 |title=Profiles of People in Power: The World's Government Leaders |last2=Thomas |first2=Richard J. |date=2014-06-03 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-63940-4 |language=en}}</ref>

In 1995, Kiribati unilaterally moved the [[International Date Line]] far to the east to encompass the Line Islands group, so that the country would no longer be divided by the date line. The move, which fulfilled one of President Tito's campaign promises, was intended to allow businesses across the expansive territory to keep the same business week. This also enabled Kiribati to become the first country to see the dawn of the [[third millennium]], an event of significance for tourism. Tito was re-elected in 1998. In 1999, Kiribati became a full member of the United Nations, 20 years after independence.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.un.org/webcast/ga/58/statements/kirieng031001.htm |title = Kiribati |publisher = United Nations |date = 1 October 2003 |access-date = 14 May 2010 }}</ref> In 2002, Kiribati passed a controversial law that enabled the government to shut down newspaper publishers. The legislation followed the launching of Kiribati's first successful non-government-run newspaper. President Tito was re-elected in 2003 but was removed from office in March 2003 by a no-confidence vote and replaced by a Council of State. [[Anote Tong]] of the opposition party [[Boutokaan Te Koaua]] was elected to succeed Tito in July 2003.

In June 2008, Kiribati officials asked Australia and New Zealand to accept Kiribati citizens as permanent refugees. Kiribati is expected to be the first country to lose all its land territory to [[climate change]]. In June 2008, Kiribati President Anote Tong said that the country had reached "the point of no return." He added, "To plan for the day when you no longer have a country is indeed painful but I think we have to do that."<ref>{{cite news |title=Leader of disappearing island nation says climate change an issue of survival, not economics |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/06/05/asia/AS-GEN-New-Zealand-World-Environment-Day.php |access-date=23 July 2020 |work=International Herald Tribune |agency=Associated Press|date=5 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605183737/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/06/05/asia/AS-GEN-New-Zealand-World-Environment-Day.php |archive-date=5 June 2008 |location=Wellington, New Zealand}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Kiribati's President: 'Our Lives Are at Stake' |url=https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=3002001 |access-date=23 July 2020 |work=ABC News |publisher=American Broadcasting Company |date=7 May 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Marks |first1=Kathy |title=Paradise lost: climate change forces South Sea islanders to seek sanctuary abroad |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/paradise-lost-climate-change-forces-south-sea-islanders-to-seek-sanctuary-abroad-841409.html |access-date=23 July 2020 |work=The Independent|date=6 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Nair |first1=Suchit |title=Tiny atoll in Pacific cries out for help |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/Tiny-atoll-in-Pacific-cries-out-for-help/articleshow/3104328.cms |access-date=23 July 2020 |work=The Times of India |date=6 June 2008 |location=Wellington/Christchurch}}</ref>

In January 2012, Anote Tong was re-elected for a third and last successive term.

In 2020, [[COVID-19 pandemic in Kiribati|Kiribati's response to the COVID-19 pandemic]], consistent with most of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Oceania|COVID-19 responses of Oceania island nations]], was to impose strict limits on tourism and commercial travel. Kiribati reported that it remained essentially COVID-free (two cases) until January 2022 when the first commercial international flight in two years included 36 passengers who tested positive. In 2024, 5,085 Coronavirus Cases were reported which causes 24 deaths, while 2,703 were reported to have recovered.
