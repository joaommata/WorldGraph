Evidence suggests that humans inhabited what is now Argentina as early as 21,000 years ago. In 2015, fossilised bones of a large, extinct armored mammal called ''[[Neosclerocalyptus]]'' were unearthed near [[Buenos Aires]]. These bones bore cut marks indicative of butchering with stone tools, implying human activity during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Butchered animal bones indicate earliest human presence in southern South America |work=Reuters |date=18 July 2024 |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/butchered-animal-bones-indicate-earliest-human-presence-southern-south-america-2024-07-17/ |last1=Bianco |first1=Miguel Lo }}</ref>{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|p=17}}  Further south, the [[Piedra Museo]] site in [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz Province]] has yielded human remains and artifacts dating back approximately 11,000 years.

Until the period of European colonisation, Argentina was relatively sparsely populated by a wide number of diverse cultures with different social organisations,{{sfn|Edwards|2008|p=12}} which can be divided into three main groups.{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|pp=18–19}} The first group are basic hunters and food gatherers without the development of [[pottery]], such as the [[Selkʼnam people|Selkʼnam]] and [[Yaghan people|Yaghan]] in the extreme south. The second group are advanced hunters and food gatherers which include the [[Puelche people|Puelche]], [[Querandí]] and Serranos in the centre-east; and the [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelche]] in the south—all of them conquered by the [[Mapuche]] spreading from [[Chile]]{{sfn|Edwards|2008|p=13}}—and the [[Kom people (South America)|Kom]] and [[Wichi]] in the north. The last group are farmers with pottery, such as the [[Charrúa]], [[Minuane]] and [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] in the northeast, with [[slash and burn agriculture|slash and burn]] semisedentary existence;{{sfn|Edwards|2008|p=12}} the advanced [[Diaguita]] sedentary [[trade|trading culture]] in the northwest, which was conquered by the [[Inca Empire]] around 1480; the [[Tonocoté]] and [[Comechingones|Hênîa and Kâmîare]] in the country's centre, and the [[Huarpe]] in the centre-west, a culture that raised [[llama]] cattle and was strongly influenced by the Incas.{{sfn|Edwards|2008|p=12}}

Europeans first arrived in the region with the 1502 voyage of [[Amerigo Vespucci (explorer)|Amerigo Vespucci]]. The Spanish navigators [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] and [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] visited the territory that is now Argentina in 1516 and 1526, respectively.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=128}} In 1536 [[Pedro de Mendoza]] founded the small settlement of [[Buenos Aires]], which was abandoned in 1541.{{sfn|Crow|1992|pp=129–32}}

Further colonisation efforts came from [[Paraguay]]—establishing the [[Governorate of the Río de la Plata]]—[[Peru]] and Chile.{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|pp=96–140}} [[Francisco de Aguirre (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguirre]] founded [[Santiago del Estero]] in 1553. [[Londres, Catamarca|Londres]] was founded in 1558; [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], in 1561; [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]], in 1562; [[San Miguel de Tucumán]], in 1565.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=353}} [[Juan de Garay]] founded [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] in 1573 and the same year [[Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera]] set up [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=134}} Garay went further south to re-found Buenos Aires in 1580.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=135}} [[San Luis, Argentina|San Luis]] was established in 1596.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=353}}

The [[Spanish Empire]] subordinated the economic potential of the Argentine territory to the immediate wealth of the silver and gold mines in [[Bolivia]] and Peru, and as such it became part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] until the creation of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] in 1776 with Buenos Aires as its capital.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=347}}

Buenos Aires repelled [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata|two ill-fated British invasions]] in 1806 and 1807.{{sfn|Crow|1992|p=421}} The ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the example of the first [[Atlantic Revolutions]] generated criticism of the [[absolutist monarchy]] that ruled the country. As in the rest of Spanish America, the overthrow of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] during the [[Peninsular War]] created great concern.{{sfn|Abad de Santillán|1971|pp=194ff}}

Beginning a process from which Argentina was to emerge as successor state to the Viceroyalty,{{sfnm|1a1=Levene|1y=1948|1p=11|1ps=: "[After the Viceroyalty became] a new period that commenced with the revolution of 1810, whose plan consisted in declaring the independence of a nation, thus turning the legal bond of vassalage into one of citizenship as a component of sovereignty and, in addition, organizing the democratic republic."|2a1=Sánchez Viamonte|2y=1948|2pp=196–97|2ps=: "The Argentine nation was a unity in colonial times, during the Viceroyalty, and remained so after the revolution of May 1810.

He secured the allegiance of escaped Filipinos in San Blas who defected from the Spanish to join the Argentine navy, due to common Argentine and Philippine grievances against Spanish colonisation.<ref>Delgado de Cantú, Gloria M.

Historian Pacho O'Donnell affirms that Hawaii was the first state that recognised Argentina's independence.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1998}} He was finally arrested in 1819 by Chilean patriots.

Revolutionaries split into two antagonist groups: the [[Unitarian Party|Centralists]] and the [[Federales (Argentina)|Federalists]]—a move that would define Argentina's first decades of independence.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=39–40}} The [[Assembly of the Year XIII]] appointed [[Gervasio Antonio de Posadas]] as Argentina's first [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata|Supreme Director]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=39–40}}

On 9 July 1816, the [[Congress of Tucumán]] formalised the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]],{{sfnm|1a1=Rock|1y=1987|1p=92|2a1=Lewis|2y=2003|2p=41}} which is now celebrated as Independence Day, a national holiday.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.argentina.gob.ar/interior/feriados |title=Feriados nacionales 2018 |trans-title=National Holidays 2018 |publisher=Argentina Ministry of the Interior |language=es |access-date=8 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709011015/https://www.argentina.gob.ar/interior/feriados |archive-date=9 July 2018 |url-status = live}}</ref> One year later General [[Martín Miguel de Güemes]] stopped royalists on the north.

Some of the most important figures of Argentine independence made a proposal known as the [[Inca plan]] of 1816, which proposed that the [[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]] (Present Argentina) should be a monarchy, led by a descendant of the [[Sapa Inca|Inca]]. Juan Bautista Túpac Amaru (half-brother of [[Túpac Amaru II]]) was proposed as monarch.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.perfil.com/noticias/elobservador/juan-bautista-tupac-amaru-el-rey-que-argentina-pudo-tener-0067.phtml |title=Juan Bautista Túpac Amaru: el rey que Argentina pudo tener |date=13 July 2016 |access-date=25 June 2021 |archive-date=23 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230923182044/https://www.perfil.com/noticias/elobservador/juan-bautista-tupac-amaru-el-rey-que-argentina-pudo-tener-0067.phtml |url-status=live }}</ref> Some examples of those who supported this proposal were [[Manuel Belgrano]], [[José de San Martín]] and [[Martín Miguel de Güemes]].

The 1820 [[Battle of Cepeda (1820)|Battle of Cepeda]], fought between the Centralists and the Federalists, resulted in the ''end of the Supreme Director rule''. In 1826 Buenos Aires enacted another [[Argentine Constitution of 1826|centralist constitution]], with [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] being appointed as the first president of the country. However, the interior provinces soon rose against him, forced his resignation and discarded the constitution.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=43}} Centralists and Federalists resumed the civil war; the latter prevailed and formed the [[Argentine Confederation]] in 1831, led by [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=45}} During his regime he faced a [[French blockade to the Río de la Plata|French blockade]] (1838–1840), the [[War of the Confederation]] (1836–1839), and an [[Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata|Anglo-French blockade]] (1845–1850), but remained undefeated and prevented further loss of national territory.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=46–47}} His trade restriction policies, however, angered the interior provinces and in 1852 [[Justo José de Urquiza]], another powerful [[caudillo]], [[Battle of Caseros|beat him out of power]]. As the new president of the Confederation, Urquiza enacted the [[liberalism|liberal]] and federal 1853 Constitution. [[State of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires seceded]] but was forced back into the Confederation after being defeated in the 1859 [[Battle of Cepeda (1859)|Battle of Cepeda]].{{sfn|Lewis|2003|pp=48–50}}

Overpowering Urquiza in the 1861 [[Battle of Pavón]], [[Bartolomé Mitre]] secured Buenos Aires' predominance and was elected as the first president of the reunified country. He was followed by [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] and [[Nicolás Avellaneda]]; these three presidencies set up the basis of the modern Argentine State.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. I|pp=363–541}}

Starting with [[Julio Argentino Roca]] in 1880, ten consecutive federal governments emphasised [[economic liberalism|liberal economic policies]]. The [[Immigration in Argentina|massive wave of European immigration]] they promoted—second only to the United States'—led to a near-reinvention of Argentine society and economy that by 1908 had placed the country as the seventh wealthiest{{sfn|Bolt|Van Zanden|2013}} developed nation{{sfn|Díaz Alejandro|1970|p=1}} in the world. Driven by this [[immigration]] wave and decreasing mortality, the Argentine population grew fivefold and the economy 15-fold:{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=18–30}} from 1870 to 1910, Argentina's [[wheat]] exports went from {{convert|100000|to|2500000|MT|ST|abbr=on}} per year, while frozen beef exports increased from {{convert|25000|to|365000|MT|ST|abbr=on}} per year,{{sfn|Mosk|1990|pp=88–89}} placing Argentina as one of the world's top five exporters.{{sfn|Cruz|1990|p=10}} Its railway mileage rose from {{convert|503|to|31104|km|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Díaz Alejandro|1970|pp=2–3}} Fostered by a new [[Argentine Law 1420|public, compulsory, free and secular education]] system, [[literacy]] quickly increased from 22% to 65%, a level higher than most [[Latin America]]n nations would reach even fifty years later.{{sfn|Cruz|1990|p=10}} Furthermore, real [[GDP]] grew so fast that despite the huge immigration influx, [[per capita income]] between 1862 and 1920 went from 67% of developed country levels to 100%:{{sfn|Díaz Alejandro|1970|pp=2–3}} In 1865, Argentina was already one of the top 25 nations by per capita income. By 1908, it had surpassed Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands to reach 7th place—behind Switzerland, New Zealand, Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Belgium. Argentina's per capita income was 70% higher than Italy's, 90% higher than Spain's, 180% higher than Japan's and 400% higher than [[Brazil]]'s.{{sfn|Bolt|Van Zanden|2013}} Despite these unique achievements, the country was slow to meet its original goals of industrialisation:{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

In 1912, President [[Roque Sáenz Peña]] enacted [[Saenz Peña Law|universal and secret male suffrage]], which allowed [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]], leader of the [[Radical Civic Union]] (or UCR), to win [[Argentine general election, 1916|the 1916 election]].

In 1930, Yrigoyen [[1930 Argentine coup d'état|was ousted from power]] by the military led by [[José Félix Uriburu]].

Uriburu ruled for two years; then [[Agustín Pedro Justo]] was elected in a [[Argentine general election, 1931|fraudulent election]], and signed a controversial [[Roca-Runciman Treaty|treaty with the United Kingdom]]. Argentina [[Argentina in World War II|stayed neutral during World War II]], a decision that had full British support but was rejected by the United States after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. In 1943 [[Revolution of '43|a military coup d'état]] led by [[Arturo Rawson|General Arturo Rawson]] toppled the constitutional government of [[Ramón Castillo]]. Under pressure from the United States, later Argentina declared war on the Axis Powers (on 27 March 1945, roughly a month before the [[end of World War II in Europe]]).

During the Rawson dictatorship a relatively unknown military colonel named [[Juan Perón]] was named head of the Labour Department. Perón quickly managed to climb the political ladder, being named defence minister in 1944. Being perceived as a political threat by rivals in the military and the conservative camp, he was forced to resign in 1945, and was arrested days later. He was finally released under mounting pressure from both his base and several allied unions.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

[[File:Juan_y_Eva_Oficial.jpg|thumb|alt=Juan Domingo Perón and his wife Eva Perón, 1947.|[[Juan Perón]] and his wife [[Eva Perón]], 1947]]

The [[Labour Party (Argentina)|Labour Party]] (later renamed [[Justicialist Party]]), the most powerful and influential party in Argentine history, came into power with the rise of Juan Perón to the presidency in 1946. He [[nationalization|nationalised]] strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full [[external debt]] and claimed he achieved nearly [[full employment]]. He pushed Congress to enact [[women's suffrage]] in 1947,{{sfn|Barnes|1978|p=3}} and developed a system of social assistance for the most vulnerable sectors of society.{{sfn|Barnes|1978|pp=113ff}} The economy began to decline in 1950 due in part to government expenditures and the [[protectionism|protectionist]] economic policies.<ref name=Reutuers2014>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-debt-chronology/chronology-argentinas-turbulent-history-of-economic-crises-idUSKBN0FZ23N20140730|title=Chronology: Argentina's turbulent history of economic crises|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=30 July 2014|access-date=19 December 2022|archive-date=19 December 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221219062714/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-debt-chronology/chronology-argentinas-turbulent-history-of-economic-crises-idUSKBN0FZ23N20140730|url-status=live}}</ref>

He also engaged in a campaign of political suppression. Anyone who was perceived to be a political dissident or potential rival was subject to threats, physical violence and harassment. The Argentine [[intelligentsia]], the middle-class, university students, and professors were seen as particularly troublesome. Perón fired over 2,000 university professors and faculty members from all major public education institutions.<ref name=auth>{{cite book |last=Rock |first=David |title=Authoritarian Argentina |publisher=University of California Press |year=1993}}</ref>

Perón tried to bring most trade and labour unions under his thumb, regularly resorting to violence when needed. For instance, the meat-packers union leader, [[Cipriano Reyes]], organised strikes in protest against the government after elected labour movement officials were forcefully replaced by Peronist puppets from the [[Justicialist Party|Peronist Party]].

Perón [[Argentine general election, 1951|managed to get reelected in 1951]]. His wife [[Eva Perón]], who played a critical role in the party, died of cancer in 1952. As the economy continued to tank, Perón started losing popular support, and came to be seen as a threat to the national process. The Navy took advantage of Perón's withering political power, and [[bombing of Plaza de Mayo|bombed the Plaza de Mayo]] in 1955. Perón survived the attack, but a few months later, during the [[Revolución Libertadora|Liberating Revolution]] coup, he was deposed and went into [[exile]] in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

=== Perón's return and death===
Following several years of military rule, [[Alejandro Agustín Lanusse]] was appointed president by the [[military junta]] in 1971. Under increasing political pressure for the return of democracy, Lanusse called for elections in 1973. Perón was banned from running but the Peronist party was allowed to participate.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-09-08 |title=Peronist {{!}} History, Facts, & Juan Peron {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Peronist |access-date=2025-10-14 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> The presidential elections were won by Perón's surrogate candidate, [[Hector Cámpora]], a left-wing Peronist, who took office on 25 May 1973. A month later, in June, Perón returned from Spain. One of Cámpora's first presidential actions was to grant amnesty to members of organisations that had carried out political assassinations and terrorist attacks, and to those who had been tried and sentenced to prison by judges. Cámpora's months-long tenure in government was beset by political and social unrest. Over 600 social conflicts, [[Strike action|strikes]], and [[Workers' self-management|factory occupations]] took place within a single month.<ref>{{cite book |first=Hugo |last=Moreno |title=Le désastre argentin.

Amid a state of political, social, and economic upheaval, Cámpora and Vice President Vicente Solano Lima resigned in July 1973, calling for new elections, but this time with Perón as the Justicialist Party nominee. Perón won the election with his wife [[Isabel Perón]] as vice president. Perón's third term was marked by escalating conflict between left and right-wing factions within the Peronist party, as well as the return of armed terror guerrilla groups such as the Guevarist [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|ERP]], leftist Peronist [[Montoneros]], and the state-backed far-right [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance|Triple A]]. After a series of heart attacks and signs of pneumonia in 1974, Perón's health deteriorated quickly. He suffered a final heart attack on Monday, 1 July 1974, and died at 13:15. He was 78 years old. After his death, [[Isabel Perón]], his wife and vice president, succeeded him in office. During her presidency, a military junta, along with the Peronists' far-right fascist faction, once again became the ''[[de facto]]'' [[head of state]]. Isabel Perón served as President of Argentina from 1974 until 1976, when she was ousted by the military. Her short presidency was marked by the collapse of Argentine political and social systems, leading to a constitutional crisis that paved the way for a decade of instability, left-wing terrorist guerrilla attacks, and state-sponsored terrorism.<ref name=Reutuers2014/><ref>{{cite web|last=de Onis|first=Juan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/02/archives/argentinas-terror-army-is-ahead.html|title=Argentina's Terror: Army Is Ahead|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 January 1977|access-date=19 December 2022|archive-date=19 December 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221219063400/https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/02/archives/argentinas-terror-army-is-ahead.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Adam|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/jorge-rafael-videla-argentine-junta-leader-dies-at-87/2013/05/17/f22ae8d0-2f5c-11e2-a30e-5ca76eeec857_story.html|title=Jorge Rafael Videla, Argentine junta leader, dies at 87|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=17 May 2013|access-date=19 December 2022|archive-date=10 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210410204418/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/jorge-rafael-videla-argentine-junta-leader-dies-at-87/2013/05/17/f22ae8d0-2f5c-11e2-a30e-5ca76eeec857_story.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=1984-04-24 |title=VICENTE SOLANO LIMA (Published 1984) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/24/obituaries/vicente-solano-lima.html |access-date=2025-09-23 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=1973-07-15 |title=Peron; A Takeover In Name As Well?; The World (Published 1973) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/15/archives/a-takeover-in-name-as-well-peron-the-world.html |access-date=2025-09-23 |language=en}}</ref>

The "Dirty War" ({{langx|es|Guerra Sucia|links=no}}) was part of [[Operation Condor]], which included the participation of other right-wing dictatorships in the [[Southern Cone]]. The Dirty War involved [[state terrorism]] in Argentina and elsewhere in the Southern Cone against political dissidents, with military and security forces employing urban and rural violence against left-wing guerrillas, political dissidents, and anyone believed to be associated with socialism or somehow contrary to the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic policies of the regime.<ref>''Political Violence and Trauma in Argentina'', Antonius C.

The exact chronology of the [[political repression|repression]] is still debated, yet the roots of the long political war may have started in 1969 when trade unionists were targeted for assassination by Peronist and Marxist paramilitaries. Individual cases of [[state-sponsored terrorism]] against Peronism and the left can be traced back even further to the [[Bombing of Plaza de Mayo]] in 1955. The [[Trelew massacre]] of 1972, the actions of the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] commencing in 1973, and [[Isabel Perón]]'s "annihilation decrees" against left-wing guerrillas during ''[[Operativo Independencia]]'' (Operation Independence) in 1975, are also possible events signaling the beginning of the Dirty War.{{efn-ua|Citations discussing this include:<ref name=Reutuers2014/><ref name=Buncombe2022>{{cite web|last=Buncombe|first=Andrew|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/florida-businessman-79-face-trial-210300460.html?guccounter=1|title=Florida businessman, 79, to face trial over notorious 1972 massacre in Argentina|work=[[The Independent]]|via=[[Yahoo!

Onganía shut down Congress, banned all political parties, and dismantled student and worker unions.

On the day Perón returned to Argentina, the clash between Peronist internal factions—[[right-wing]] union leaders and [[left-wing]] youth from the Montoneros—resulted in the [[Ezeiza Massacre]]. Overwhelmed by political violence, Cámpora resigned and Perón won the following [[Argentine general election, September 1973|September 1973 election]] with his third wife [[Isabel Perón|Isabel]] as vice-president. He [[expulsion of Montoneros from Plaza de Mayo|expelled Montoneros from the party]]{{sfn|Robben|2011|pp=76–77}} and they became once again a clandestine organisation.

The ''Proceso'' shut down Congress, removed the judges on the Supreme Court, banned political parties and unions, and resorted to employing the [[forced disappearance]] of suspected guerrilla members including individuals suspected of being associated with the left-wing. By the end of 1976, the Montoneros had lost nearly 2,000 members and by 1977, the ERP was completely subdued. Nevertheless, the severely weakened Montoneros launched a counterattack in 1979, which was quickly put down, effectively ending the guerrilla threat and securing the junta's position in power.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Salas |first=Ernesto |title=Politics and violence in the final years of the Argentine organization Montoneros (1979–1983) |journal=CONICET (National Scientific and Technical Research Council) |url=https://ri.conicet.gov.ar/bitstream/handle/11336/200049/CONICET_Digital_Nro.86a8027f-5edd-4bbe-8e12-a7a20eb7e5ed_A.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y |date=2021 |access-date=6 November 2025}}</ref>
