Notably, [[Crete]] remained under [[Venetian rule in the Ionian Islands|Venetian rule]] until 1669, and the [[Ionian Islands]] were governed by Venice until 1797. These islands were subsequently ceded to [[First French Empire|French]] and later [[British Empire|British]] control.{{sfn|Clogg|1992|p=10}} While some Greeks in the Ionian islands and [[Constantinople]] lived in prosperity, and Greeks of Constantinople ([[Phanariots]]) achieved power within the Ottoman administration,{{sfn|Clogg|1992|p=23}} much of Greece suffered the economic consequences of Ottoman conquest. Heavy taxes were enforced, and in later years the Ottoman Empire enacted a policy of creation of hereditary estates, effectively turning the rural Greek populations into [[serfdom|serfs]],<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Kourvetaris | first1 = George | last2 = Dobratz | first2 = Betty | title = A profile of modern Greece: in search of identity | page = 33 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ePwcAAAAYAAJ&q=Greece+chiflik+serfs | publisher = Clarendon Press | year = 1987 | isbn = 9780198275510 | access-date = 11 October 2015 | archive-date = 10 June 2024 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240610021207/https://books.google.com/books?id=ePwcAAAAYAAJ&q=Greece+chiflik+serfs | url-status = live }}</ref> while the Ottoman conquest had cut Greece off from European historical developments.{{Sfn|Clogg|1992|pages=3}}

The [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] were considered by the Ottoman governments as the ruling authorities of the entire [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] population of the Ottoman Empire, whether ethnically Greek or not. Although the Ottoman state did not force non-Muslims to convert to [[Islam]], Christians faced discrimination. Discrimination, particularly when combined with harsh treatment by local Ottoman authorities, led to conversions to Islam, if only superficially. In the 19th century, many "[[Crypto-Christianity|crypto-Christians]]" returned to their old religious allegiance.{{sfn|Clogg|1992|p=14}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=Venice and the Ottomans |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/learn/educators/curriculum-resources/art-of-the-islamic-world/unit-seven/chapter-two/venice-and-the-ottomans |access-date=2025-04-10 |website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}</ref>

In the 18th century, Greek merchants came to dominate trade within the Ottoman Empire, established communities throughout the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and Europe,{{Sfn|Clogg|1992|pages=21, 23}} and used their wealth to fund educational activities that brought younger generations into contact with Western ideas.{{Sfn|Clogg|1992|page=25, 26, 27}} In the 18th century, an increase in learning during the [[Modern Greek Enlightenment]] led to the emergence among [[Westernization|Westernised]] Greek-speaking [[elite]]s of the [[Greek nationalism|notion of a Greek nation]].

Amidst dissatisfaction with the seeming inertia and unattainability of [[Megali Idea|national aspirations]], military officers organised a [[Goudi coup|coup]] in 1909 and called on [[Cretan State|Cretan]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], who conveyed a vision of national regeneration. After winning [[Greek legislative election, August 1910|two]] [[Greek legislative election, November 1910|elections]] and becoming prime minister in 1910,{{sfn|Mazower|1992|pp=886, 890–893, 895–900, 904}} Venizelos initiated fiscal, social, and [[Greek Constitution of 1911|constitutional reforms]], reorganised the military, made Greece a member of the [[Balkan League]], and led it through the [[Balkan Wars]]. By 1913, Greece's territory and population had doubled, annexing Crete, [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]. The struggle between [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] and charismatic Venizelos over foreign policy on the eve of the First World War dominated politics and divided the country into [[National Schism|two opposing groups]]. During parts of the war, Greece had two governments: A royalist [[Central Powers|pro-German]] one in [[Athens]] and a [[Venizelism|Venizelist]] pro-[[Triple Entente|Entente]] one in [[Thessaloniki]]. They united in 1917, when Greece entered the war on the side of the Entente.

After the war, Greece attempted expansion into [[Asia Minor]], a region with a large native Greek population, but was defeated in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]], contributing to a flight of [[Ottoman Greeks|Asia Minor Greeks]].<ref name=Gibney>{{cite book |author=Matthew J.

[[Constantine II of Greece|King Constantine II]]'s quick acceptance of [[George Papandreou (senior)|George Papandreou]]'s informal resignation as prime minister in 1965 prompted an era of political turbulence that was later called [[Iouliana]], and culminated in a coup in 1967 by the [[Greek junta]], led by [[Georgios Papadopoulos]]. Civil rights were suspended, political repression intensified, and human rights abuses, including torture, were rampant. Economic growth remained rapid before plateauing in 1972. The brutal suppression of the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]] in 1973 set in motion the fall of the regime, resulting in a counter-coup that established brigadier [[Dimitrios Ioannidis]] as the new junta strongman. On 20 July 1974, [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkey invaded the island of Cyprus]] in response to a Greek-backed Cypriot coup, triggering a crisis in Greece that led to the regime's collapse and restoration of democracy through [[Metapolitefsi]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=34.

[[File:Accession of Greece to the European Union.png|thumb|Signing at [[Zappeion]] by [[Constantine Karamanlis]] of the documents for the accession of Greece to the [[European Union|European Communities]] in 1979]]

The former prime minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] was invited back from self-exile and the [[Greek legislative election, 1974|first multiparty elections]] since 1964 were held on the first anniversary of the Polytechnic uprising. A democratic and republican [[Constitution of Greece|constitution]] was promulgated in 1975 following a [[Greek republic referendum, 1974|referendum]] which chose not to restore the monarchy.

Meanwhile, [[Andreas Papandreou]], George Papandreou's son, founded the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) in response to Karamanlis's conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party, with the two political formations dominating government over the next four decades. Greece rejoined NATO in 1980.{{Refn | group = lower-alpha | name="integrated1974" | On 14 August 1974 Greek forces withdrew from the integrated military structure of [[NATO]] in protest at the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus; Greece rejoined NATO in 1980.}}<ref name="AdamHartDavis">History, Editorial Consultant: Adam Hart-Davis.

Investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure, as well as funds from the [[European Union]] and growing revenue from tourism, shipping, and a fast-growing service sector raised the [[standard of living]]. In 1981, [[Andreas Papandreou]] came to power and implemented an [[Social reforms of Andreas Papandreou|ambitious program of social reforms]]. He recognised civil marriage, the dowry was abolished, while expanding access to education and health care. However, he made controversial [[Foreign policy of Andreas Papandreou|foreign policy]] decisions that fueled the rise of [[terrorism in Greece]]. Papandreou's tenure has been associated with corruption (see [[Koskotas scandal|Koskotas]] and [[Yugoslav corn scandal]]s) and the [[1985 Greek constitutional crisis|first constitutional crisis of the new republic]], while [[Economic policies of Andreas Papandreou|his economic policies]] failed to address the persistent [[stagflation]] and chronic budget deficits that exacerbated Greece's economic problems.<ref>{{Cite web |date=5 February 2019 |title=The ideal Greek everyman: Andreas Papandreou at 100 |url=https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2019/02/05/the-ideal-greek-everyman-andreas-papandreou-at-100/ |access-date=9 May 2023 |website=EUROPP |archive-date=9 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230509192132/https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2019/02/05/the-ideal-greek-everyman-andreas-papandreou-at-100/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
