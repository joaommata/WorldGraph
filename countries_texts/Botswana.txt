It is unclear when [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples first moved into the country from the north, although AD 600 seems to be a consensus estimate. In that era, the ancestors of the modern-day [[Kalanga people|Kalanga]] moved into what is now the north-eastern area of the country. These proto-Kalanga were closely connected to states in Zimbabwe as well as to the Mapungubwe state. One notable remnant of this period is [[Domboshaba]] ruins, a cultural and heritage site in Botswana initially occupied towards the end of the Great Zimbabwe period (1250–1450), with stone walls that have an average height of 1.8 metres. The site is a respected place for the people living in the region, and it is believed that the chief lived on the top of the hill with his helpers or assistants. These states, located outside of current Botswana's borders, appear to have kept massive herds of cattle—apparently at numbers approaching modern cattle density—in what is now the Central District.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Denbow |first1=James |year=1986 |title=A New Look at the Later Prehistory of the Kalahari |journal=The Journal of African History |volume=27 |issue=1 |page=15 |doi=10.1017/S0021853700029170 |jstor=181334 |s2cid=163079138}}</ref> This massive cattle-raising complex prospered until around 1300 and seems to have regressed following the collapse of Mapungubwe. During this era, the first Tswana-speaking groups, the [[Bakgalagadi]], moved into the southern areas of the [[Kalahari]]. These various peoples were connected to trade routes that ran via the [[Limpopo River]] to the Indian Ocean. Trade goods from Asia such as beads made their way to Botswana, most likely in exchange for ivory, gold and [[Rhinoceros|rhinoceros horn]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Denbow|first1=James|last2=Klehm|first2=Carla|last3=Dussubieux|first3=Laure|date=April 2015|title=The glass beads of Kaitshàa and early Indian Ocean trade into the far hinterland of southern Africa|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/glass-beads-of-kaitshaa-and-early-indian-ocean-trade-into-the-far-interior-of-southern-africa/9BB659F4DA38A560EF64C4E8E3F49AFA|journal=Antiquity|language=en|volume=89|issue=344|pages=361–377|doi=10.15184/aqy.2014.50|s2cid=161212483|issn=0003-598X|access-date=29 May 2020|archive-date=24 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524064223/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/glass-beads-of-kaitshaa-and-early-indian-ocean-trade-into-the-far-interior-of-southern-africa/9BB659F4DA38A560EF64C4E8E3F49AFA|url-status=live|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

The [[Toutswemogala Hill]] Iron Age settlement's radio-carbon dates range from the 7th to the late 19th century, indicating it was occupied for more than 1,000 years.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web |title=Toutswemogala Hill Iron Age Settlement |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1340/ |access-date=2024-07-13 |website= |publisher=[[UNESCO World Heritage Centre]]}}</ref> The hill was part of the formation of early states in southern Africa, with cattle as a major source of economy.<ref name=":11" /> The Toutswe settlement includes house-floors, large heaps of vitrified cow dung, and burials while the outstanding structure is the stone wall.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dichaba |first=Tsholofelo Sele |year=2009 |title=From Monuments to Cultural Landscapes |url=https://repository.rice.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/9b50f2c1-a371-4c9b-9baa-0f80c353ecbf/content |journal=Rethinking Heritage Management in Botswana |publisher=[[Rice University]] |pages=42}}</ref> Around 1000 AD, the Toutswe people moved into Botswana.<ref>{{Cite report |url=https://www.eskom.co.za/eia/tx/wp-content/uploads/migrated/MahikengIsang/DEIR-Appendicies/Ann-G-Specialist-Reports-2/G_5a.%20AIA%20Botswana%20Component.pdf |title=Archaeological impact assessment for the Bosa transmission line project from Theisang substation to the Tlokweng border post in the South Eastern and Kgatleng districts of Botswana |year=2017 |website=[[Eskom]].com|publisher=Lentswe Archaeological Consultants |page=10 }}</ref>

However, agriculture also played a vital role in the longevity of Toutswemogala Hill's extended occupation, as many grain storage structures have also been found on the site. Many different stratified layers of housing floors further signalled continuous occupation over hundreds of years. The arrival of the Tswana speakers' ancestors who came to control the region has yet to be dated precisely. Members of the [[Bakwena]], a chieftaincy under a leader named Kgabo II, made their way into the southern Kalahari by AD 1500 at the latest, and his people drove the Bakgalagadi inhabitants west into the desert. Over the years, several offshoots of the Bakwena moved into adjoining territories. The [[Bangwaketse]] occupied areas to the west, while the [[Bangwato]] moved northeast into former Kalanga areas.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Magang |first=David |title=The Magic of Perseverance: The Autobiography of David Magang |date=2008 |publisher=Centre for Advanced Studies of African Society |isbn=978-1-920287-70-2 |location=Cape Town |pages=10–14 |authorlink=David Magang}}</ref> Not long afterwards, a Bangwato offshoot known as the Batawana migrated into the [[Okavango Delta]], probably in the 1790s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tlou|first=T.|year=1974|title=The Nature of Batswana States: Towards a Theory of Batswana Traditional Government – The Batawana Case|journal=Botswana Notes and Records|volume=6|pages=57–75|jstor=40959210|issn=0525-5090}}</ref>

The first written records relating to modern-day Botswana appear in 1824. These records show that the Bangwaketse had become the predominant power in the region. Under the rule of Makaba II, the Bangwaketse kept vast herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas, and used their military prowess to raid their neighbours.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Morton|first=Fred|title=The Rise of a Raiding State: Makaba II's Ngwaketse, 1780–1824|url=https://www.academia.edu/11134264|access-date=25 January 2018|archive-date=16 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200816031919/https://www.academia.edu/11134264/The_Rise_of_a_Raiding_State_Makaba_IIs_Ngwaketse_1780_1824|url-status=live|pages=5–9}}</ref> By this time, other chiefdoms in the area had capitals of 10,000 or so and were fairly prosperous.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Morton, B. |title=Pre-1904 Population Estimates of the Tswana|journal=Botswana Notes and Records|volume=25 |year=1993|pages=89–99|jstor=40979984 }}</ref> This equilibrium came to end during the [[Mfecane]] period (1823–1843) when a succession of invading peoples from South Africa entered the country. Although the Bangwaketse were able to defeat the invading [[Kololo people|Bakololo]] in 1826, over time all the major chiefdoms in Botswana were attacked, weakened and impoverished. The Bakololo and [[Northern Ndebele people|AmaNdebele]] raided repeatedly and took large numbers of cattle, women and children from the Batswana – most of whom were driven into the desert or sanctuary areas such as hilltops and caves. Only after 1843, when the Amandebele moved into western Zimbabwe, did this threat subside.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morton |first=Barry|date=14 January 2009|title=The Hunting Trade and the Reconstruction of Northern Tswana Societies after the Difaqane, 1838–1880|journal=South African Historical Journal|volume=36|pages=220–239|language=en|doi=10.1080/02582479708671276}}</ref>

During the 1840s and 1850s, trade with [[Cape Colony]]-based merchants opened up and enabled the [[Tswana people|Batswana]] chiefdoms to rebuild. The [[Bakwena]], Bangwaketse, Bangwato and Batawana cooperated to control the lucrative ivory trade and used the proceeds to import horses and guns, which in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now Botswana. This process was largely complete by 1880, and the Batswana thus subjugated the Bushmen, Kalanga, Bakgalagadi and other current minorities.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/02582479708671276|title=The Hunting Trade and the Reconstruction of Northern Tswana Societies after the Difaqane, 1838–1880|journal=South African Historical Journal|volume=36|pages=220–239|year=1997|last1=Morton|first1=Barry}}</ref>

Following the [[Great Trek]], [[Afrikaners]] from the Cape Colony established themselves on the borders of Botswana in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. In 1852, a coalition of [[Tswana people|Tswana]] chiefdoms led by [[Sechele I]] defeated Afrikaner incursions at the [[Battle of Dimawe]] and, after about eight years of intermittent tensions and hostilities, eventually came to a peace agreement in [[Potchefstroom]] in 1860. From that point on, the modern-day border between South Africa and Botswana was agreed on, and the Afrikaners and Batswana traded and worked together comparatively peacefully.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Magang |first=David |title=The Magic of Perseverance: The Autobiography of David Magang |date=2008 |publisher=Centre for Advanced Studies of African Society |isbn=978-1-920287-70-2 |location=Cape Town |pages=28–38 |authorlink=David Magang}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author= Ramsay, J. |title=The Botswana-Boer War of 1852–53: How the Batswana Achieved Victory|journal=Botswana Notes and Records|volume= 23 |year=1991|pages=193–208|jstor=40980851 }}</ref>

In 1884, Batawana, a northern-based Tswana clan's cavalry under the command of Kgosi Moremi, fought and defeated the Ndebele's invasion of northern Botswana at the [[Tswana people|Battle of Khutiyabasadi]]. This was the start of the collapse of the Ndebele Kingdom in Zimbabwe, and it helped the Tswana speaking authority.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ramsay |first=Jeff |title=The Guns of Khutiyabasadi (II) |url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?aid=72905&dir=2017/november/06 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124091704/https://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?aid=72905&dir=2017/november/06 |archive-date=24 November 2020 |access-date=2018-11-08 |work=[[Mmegi]]}}</ref>

Due to newly peaceful conditions, trade thrived between 1860 and 1880. Christian [[missionaries]] were able to take advantage of this. The [[Lutherans]] and the [[London Missionary Society]] both became established in the country by 1856. By 1880, every major village had a resident missionary, and their influence slowly grew. [[Khama III]], who reigned from 1875 to 1923, was the first of the Tswana chiefs to make Christianity a state religion, and a great deal of Tswana customary law changed as a result. Christianity became the de facto official religion in all the chiefdoms by [[World War I]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Landau |first=Paul Stuart |title=The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender, and Christianity in the Southern African Kingdom |date=1995 |publisher=James Currey |isbn=0-435-08963-3 |publication-place=Portsmouth (N.H.)

{{Main|Bechuanaland Protectorate}}
During the [[Scramble for Africa]], both the [[German Empire]] and Britain coveted the territory of Botswana. During the [[Berlin Conference]], Britain decided to annexe Botswana to safeguard the Road to the North and thus connect the Cape Colony to its territories further north. It unilaterally annexed Tswana territories in January 1885 and then sent the [[Warren Expedition]] north to consolidate control over the area and convince the chiefs to accept British overrule. Despite their misgivings, they eventually acquiesced to this ''fait accompli''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/15645705 |title=The Invention and Perpetuation of Botswana's National Mythology, 1885–1966 |last1=Morton |first1=Barry |last2=Ramsay |first2=Jeff |pages=4–7 |access-date=13 July 2018 |via=academia.edu}}</ref><ref>"Warren informed Chiefs Bathoen of Bangwaketse, Khama of Bangwato and Sebele of Bakwena about the protection in May 1885 (Mogalakwe, 2006)."

In 1890, areas north of 22 degrees were added to the new Bechuanaland Protectorate. During the 1890s, the new territory was divided into eight different reserves, with fairly small amounts of land being left as freehold for white [[settler]]s. During the early 1890s, the British government decided to hand over the Bechuanaland Protectorate to the [[British South Africa Company]]. This plan, which was well on its way to fruition despite the entreaties of Tswana leaders who toured England in protest, was eventually foiled by the failure of the [[Jameson Raid]] in January 1896.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/15645705 |title=The Invention and Perpetuation of Botswana's National Mythology, 1885–1966 |last1=Morton |first1=Barry |last2=Ramsay |first2=Jeff |access-date=13 July 2018 |via=academia.edu |pages=7–11 |archive-date=28 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028165308/https://www.academia.edu/15645705 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Parsons |first=Neil |title=King Khama, Emperor Joe, and the Great White Queen: Victorian Britain Through African Eyes |date=3 February 1998 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-64745-6 |publication-place=Chicago, Ill.}}</ref>

When the [[Union of South Africa]] was formed from the main British colonies in the region in 1910, the High Commission Territories—the Bechuanaland Protectorate, [[Basutoland]] (now [[Lesotho]]) and [[Swaziland]] (now [[Eswatini]])—were not included, but provision was made for their later incorporation. However, the UK began to consult with their inhabitants as to their wishes. Although successive South African governments sought to have the territories transferred to their jurisdiction, the UK kept delaying; consequently, it never occurred. The election of the [[National Party (South Africa)|Nationalist]] government in 1948, which instituted [[apartheid]], and South Africa's withdrawal from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1961, ended any prospect of the UK or these territories agreeing to incorporation into South Africa.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Frank|year=1980|title=South Africa's Departure from the Commonwealth, 1960–1961|journal=The International History Review|volume=2|issue=3|pages=453–484|doi=10.1080/07075332.1980.9640222|jstor=40105085|issn=0707-5332}}</ref>
