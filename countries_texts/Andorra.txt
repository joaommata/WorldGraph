La Balma de la [[La Margineda|Margineda]], found by archaeologists at [[Sant Julià de Lòria]], was settled in 9,500 BCE as a passing place between the two sides of the Pyrenees. The seasonal camp was perfectly located for hunting and fishing by the groups of hunter-gatherers from [[Ariège (river)|Ariege]] and [[Segre (river)|Segre]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elcami.cat/principat-andorra/andorra/andorra-vella/margineda|title=La Margineda – El Camí|date=21 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015125705/http://elcami.cat/principat-andorra/andorra/andorra-vella/margineda|archive-date=15 October 2014}}</ref>

During the [[Neolithic]], a group of people moved to the [[Madriu-Perafita-Claror Valley|Valley of Madriu]] (the present-day Natural Park located in [[Escaldes–Engordany|Escaldes-Engordany]] declared [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]) as a permanent camp in 6640 BCE. The population of the valley grew cereals, raised domestic livestock, and developed commercial trade with people from [[Sègre (department)|Ségre]] and [[Occitania]].{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 32, 33}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 44 a 92}}

Other archaeological deposits include the Tombs of [[Segudet]] ([[Ordino]]) and Feixa del Moro (Sant Julià de Lòria), both dated in 4900–4300 BCE as an example of the [[Urnfield culture|Urn culture]] in Andorra.{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 32, 33}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 44 a 92}} The model of small settlements began to evolve to complex urbanism during the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Metallurgy|Metallurgical]] items of iron, ancient coins, and reliquaries can be found in the [[Sanctuary|ancient sanctuaries]] scattered around the country.

The sanctuary of Roc de les Bruixes (Stone of the Witches) is perhaps the most important archeological complex of this age in Andorra, located in the parish of [[Canillo]], about the rituals of funerals, ancient scripture and engraved stone [[mural]]s.{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 34, 35, 38, 39}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 44 a 92}}

===Iberian and Roman Andorra===
[[File:Ann%C3%ADbal,_andosins.png|left|thumb|[[Hannibal]]'s route (red) during the [[Second Punic War]]. The Iberian tribes (green) fought against the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] army in the Pyrenees.]]

The inhabitants of the valleys were traditionally associated with the [[Iberians]] and historically located in Andorra as the Iberian tribe Andosins or Andosini ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδοσίνους}}) during the 7th and 2nd centuries BC. Influenced by the [[Proto-Celtic language|Celtic]], [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]], [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Iberian languages]], the locals developed some current toponyms. Early writings and documents relating to this group of people goes back to the second century BC by the Greek writer [[Polybius]] in his ''Histories'' during the [[Punic Wars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www15.gencat.net/pres_casa_llengues/mapes/mapes.html?idioma=1&start=cercador|title=Mapes Vius – Linguamon.

Some of the most significant remains of this era are the Castle of the Roc d'Enclar (part of the early [[Marca Hispanica]]),{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 44, 45, 46, 47}} l'Anxiu in [[Les Escaldes]] and Roc de L'Oral in [[Encamp]].{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 44 a 92}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 36, 37}}

The presence of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] influence is recorded from the 2nd century BCE to the 5th century CE. The places with the most Roman presence are in Camp Vermell (Red Field) in [[Sant Julià de Lòria]], and in some places in Encamp and in the Roc d'Enclar. People continued trading, mainly with wine and cereals, with the Roman cities of [[Urgellet]] (the present-day [[La Seu d'Urgell]]) and across Segre through the [[Roman roads|''via romana'']] Strata Ceretana (also known as Strata Confluetana).{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 44 a 92}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 52, 53}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 44, 45, 46, 47}}

===Visigoths and Carolingians: the legend of Charlemagne===
[[File:Charlemagne_et_Louis_le_Pieux.jpg|right|thumb|[[Charlemagne]] instructing his son, [[Louis the Pious]]]]

After the [[fall of the Roman Empire]], Andorra came under the influence of the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigoths]], the [[History of Toledo, Spain#Visigothic Toledo|Kingdom of Toledo]], and the [[Diocese of Urgell]]. The Visigoths remained in the valleys for 200 years, during which time [[Gothic Christianity|Christianity]] spread. When the [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Empire of Al-Andalus]] replaced the ruling Visigoths in most of the Iberian Peninsula, Andorra was under the jurisdiction of the [[Francia|Franks]].{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}}

Tradition holds that Charles the Great (Charlemagne) granted a charter to the Andorran people for a contingent of 5,000 soldiers under the command of Marc Almugaver, in return for fighting against the [[Moors]] near [[Porté-Puymorens]] ([[Cerdanya]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://turisme.andorralavella.ad/llegendes-tradicionals/pas-carlemany|title=El pas de Carlemany – Turisme Andorra la Vella|website=turisme.andorralavella.ad|access-date=3 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803170725/http://turisme.andorralavella.ad/llegendes-tradicionals/pas-carlemany|archive-date=3 August 2017}}</ref>

Andorra remained part of the [[Hispanic Marches|Frankish ''Marca Hispanica'']], the buffer zone between the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] and the Muslim territories, Andorra being part of the territory ruled by the [[Counts of Urgell|Count of Urgell]] and eventually the bishop of the Diocese of Urgell. Tradition also holds that it was guaranteed by the son of Charlemagne, [[Louis the Pious]], writing the ''Carta de Poblament'' or a local [[municipal charter]] {{Circa|805}}.<ref>{{cite web |last=Vidal |first=Jaume |title=Andorra mira els arxius |trans-title=Andorra looks at the archives |url=http://www.elpuntavui.cat/article/19-cultura/933027-andorra-mira-els-arxius.html |access-date=3 August 2017 |website=Elpuntavui.cat |language=ca}}</ref>

The first document that mentions Andorra as a territory is the ''Acta de Consagració i Dotació de la Catedral de la Seu d'Urgell'' (Deed of Consecration and Endowment of the Cathedral of La Seu d'Urgell). The document, dated 839, depicts the six old [[Parishes of Andorra|parishes]] of the Andorran valleys that made up the country's administrative division.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 96 a 146}}

In 988, Count [[Borrell II]] of Urgell gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in [[Cerdanya]].<ref name="histo1">{{Cite GREC|title=La formació d'Andorra|andorra-0#anchor_-la-formaci-d-andorra}}</ref> Since then, the bishop of Urgell, based in Seu d'Urgell, has been [[Co-Princes of Andorra|co-prince]] of Andorra.<ref name="elements">{{cite web |title=Elements de la història del Principat d'Andorra |trans-title=Elements of the history of the Principality of Andorra |url=http://www.coprince-fr.ad/catala/elements.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20100209181327/http://www.coprince-fr.ad/catala/elements.htm |archive-date=9 February 2010 |language=ca}}</ref>

===Middle Ages: The Paréages and the founding of the Co-Principality===
[[File:Esgl%C3%A9sia_de_Sant_Joan_de_Caselles_-_7.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sant Joan de Caselles]] church, dating from the 11th century, part of the Andorran Romanesque heritage]]
Before 1095, Andorra had no military protection, and the bishop of Urgell, who knew that the count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys,<ref name=elements/> asked the [[Lord of Caboet]] for help and protection. In 1095, the lord of Caboet and the bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra. [[Arnalda de Caboet]], daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the viscount of Castellbò. Their daughter, [[Ermessenda de Castellbò]],<ref>{{Cite GREC|title=Ermessenda de Castellbò|ermessenda-de-castellbo}}</ref> married the [[count of Foix]], [[Roger-Bernard II, Count of Foix|Roger-Bernard II]]. Roger-Bernard II and Ermessenda shared rule over Andorra with the bishop of Urgell.

In the 13th century, a military dispute arose between the bishop of Urgell and the count of Foix as aftermath of the [[Cathar Crusade]]. The conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of the [[king of Aragon]], [[Peter III of Aragon|Peter III]], between the bishop and the count, by the signing of the [[Paréage of Andorra 1278|first paréage]], which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix<ref name=elements/> (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the bishop of Urgell, in the [[Principality of Catalonia]]. This gave the principality its territory and political form.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 96 a 146}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009}}

A second paréage was signed in 1288 after a dispute when the count of Foix ordered the construction of a castle in Roc d'Enclar.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 96 a 146}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009}} The document was ratified by the noble notary [[County of Cerdanya|Jaume Orig of Puigcerdà]], and construction of military structures in the country was prohibited.{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 60, 61}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 96 a 146}}

In 1364, the political organisation of the country named the figure of the [[syndic]] (now spokesman and president of the parliament) as representative of the Andorrans to their co-princes, making possible the creation of [[Parishes of Andorra|local departments]] (comuns, quarts and veïnats). After being ratified by Bishop Francesc Tovia and Count [[John I, Count of Foix|John I]], the Consell de la Terra or [[General Council (Andorra)|Consell General de les Valls]] (General Council of the Valleys) was founded in 1419, the second oldest parliament in Europe. The syndic Andreu d'Alàs and the General Council organised the creation of the [[Politics of Andorra#Judicial branch|Justice Courts]] (La Cort de Justicia) in 1433 with the co-princes and the collection of taxes like foc i lloc (literally "fire and site", a national tax active since then).{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 78, 79, 80, 81, 88, 89}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}}

Although there are remains of ecclesiastical works dating before the 9th century (Sant Vicenç d'Enclar or [[Església de Santa Coloma]]), Andorra developed exquisite [[Romanesque Art and Architecture|Romanesque Art]] during the 9th through 14th centuries, particularly in the construction of churches, bridges, religious murals and statues of the [[Virgin and Child]] ([[Our Lady of Meritxell]] being the most important).{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}} Nowadays, the [[List of regional characteristics of Romanesque churches#Romanesque churches in Spain, Portugal and Andorra|Romanesque]] buildings that form part of [[Cultural Heritage of Andorra|Andorra's cultural heritage]] stand out in a remarkable way, with an emphasis on [[Església de Sant Esteve]], [[Sant Joan de Caselles]], [[Església de Sant Miquel d'Engolasters]], [[Sant Martí de la Cortinada]] and the medieval bridges of [[Pont de la Margineda|Margineda]] and [[Pont dels Escalls|Escalls]] among many others.{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 48, 49}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 150 a 194}}

The Catalan Pyrenees were embryonic of the [[Catalan language]] at the end of the 11th century. Andorra was influenced by this language, which was adopted locally decades before it expanded to the rest of the Crown of Aragon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webs.racocatala.cat/cat1714/d/histcat.pdf|title=Història de La Llengua Catalana|website=Racocatala.cat|access-date=3 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035808/http://webs.racocatala.cat/cat1714/d/histcat.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref>

The local economy during the [[Middle Ages]] was based on livestock, agriculture, furs and weavers. Later, at the end of the 11th century, the first [[Bloomery#Early to Medieval Europe|iron foundries]] began to appear in Northern Parishes like [[Ordino]], much appreciated by the master artisans who developed the art of the forges, an important economic activity in the country from the 15th century.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}}

===16th to 18th centuries===
[[File:Tribunal_de_Corts_d%27Andorra.JPG|right|thumb|Main hall of [[#Law and criminal justice|Tribunal de Corts]] (High Court of Justice) inside [[Casa de la Vall]], the central Judiciary Court of Andorra]]
In 1601 the [[#Law and criminal justice|Tribunal de Corts]] (High Court of Justice) was created as a result of [[Huguenot rebellions]] in [[Early modern France|France]], [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] courts coming from [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] and [[Catalan mythology about witches|witchcraft-related beliefs native to the area]], in the context of the [[Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]].{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|pp=44, 45, 47, 48, 50}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 108, 109}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 238, 239}}

With the passage of time, the co-title to Andorra passed to the kings of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. After [[Henry IV of France|Henry III of Navarre]] became [[king of France]], he issued an edict in 1607 that established the head of the French state and the bishop of Urgell as [[Co-Princes of Andorra]], a political arrangement that still holds.

During 1617, communal councils form the sometent (popular militia or army) to deal with the rise of bandolerisme ([[brigandage]]) and the Consell de la Terra was defined and structured in terms of its composition, organisation and competences current today.{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|pp=44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 53, 54, 56}}

Andorra continued with the same economic system that it had during the 12th–14th centuries with a large production of metallurgy (fargues, a system similar to Farga Catalana) and with the introduction of tobacco circa 1692 and import trade. In 1371 and 1448, the co-princes ratified the fair of Andorra la Vella, the most important annual national festival commercially ever since.{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=14}}{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=15}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 134}}

The country had a unique and experienced guild of weavers, Confraria de Paraires i Teixidors, in [[Escaldes-Engordany]]. Founded in 1604, it took advantage of the local thermal waters. By this time, the country was characterised by the social system of prohoms (wealthy society) and casalers (rest of the population with smaller economic acquisition), deriving from the tradition of [[pubilla]] and [[Heir|hereu]].{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|pp=20, 21}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp=106, 107}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 105, 106, 107, 140, 141}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 263 a 270}}

Three centuries after its foundation, the Consell de la Terra located its headquarters and the Tribunal de Corts in [[Casa de la Vall]] in 1702. The [[manor house]] built in 1580 served as a noble fortress of the Busquets family. Inside the parliament was placed the Closet of the Six Keys (Armari de les sis claus), representative of each Andorran parish, where the [[Andorran constitution]] and other documents and laws were later kept.{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=60}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 82}}

In both the [[Reapers' War]] and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the Andorran people (while professing to be a neutral country) supported the [[Catalans]] who saw their [[Catalan constitutions|rights]] reduced in [[Nueva Planta decrees|1716]]. The reaction was the promotion of Catalan writings in Andorra, with cultural works such as the ''Book of Privileges'' (''Llibre de Privilegis de 1674''), ''Manual Digest'' (1748) by Antoni Fiter i Rossell or the ''Polità andorrà'' (1763) by Antoni Puig.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 229}}{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|pp = 49 a 52, i 57, 58}}

[[File:Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit (cropped).png|thumb|upright|left|[[Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit]] led the New Reform of 1866.]]
After the [[French Revolution]], [[Napoleon I]] reestablished the Co-Principate in 1809 and removed the French medieval title. In 1812–1813, the [[First French Empire]] annexed Catalonia during the [[Peninsular War]] ({{lang|ca|Guerra Peninsular}}) and divided the region into four [[département]]s, with Andorra as a part of the district of [[Puigcerdà]]. In 1814, an imperial decree reestablished the independence and economy of Andorra.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p=172}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p=172}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=342–343}}

During this period, Andorra's late medieval institutions and rural culture remained largely unchanged. In 1866, the [[syndic]] [[Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit]] led the reformist group in a Council General of 24 members elected by suffrage limited to heads of families. The Council General replaced the aristocratic oligarchy that previously ruled the state.<ref name="ReferenceA">Page 966, Volume 1, [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Eleventh Edition, 1910–1911</ref>

The authorities of the Co-Princes banned casinos and betting houses throughout the country. The ban resulted in an economic conflict and the Revolution of 1881, which began when revolutionaries assaulted the house of the syndic on 8 December 1880, and established the Provisional Revolutionary Council led by Joan Pla i Calvo and Pere Baró i Mas. The Provisional Revolutionary Council allowed for the construction of casinos and spas by foreign companies.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=198–203}} From 7 to 9 June 1881, the loyalists of [[Canillo]] and [[Encamp]] reconquered the parishes of [[Ordino]] and [[La Massana]] by establishing contact with the revolutionary forces in [[Escaldes-Engordany]].{{sfn|Peruga Guerrero|1998|pp=59–63}} After a day of combat the [[Pont dels Escalls|Treaty of the Bridge of Escalls]] was signed on 10 June.{{sfn|Ministeri d'Educació, Joventut i Esports|1996|pp=58–65}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=194–195}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=348–350}} The council was replaced and new elections were held.

Andorra participated in the cultural movement of the Catalan [[Renaixença]]. Between 1882 and 1887, the first academic schools were formed where trilingualism coexisted with the official language, Catalan. [[Romanticism|Romantic]] authors from [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[Restoration (Spain)|Spain]] reported the awakening of the [[Romantic nationalism|national consciousness]] of the country. [[Jacint Verdaguer]] lived in Ordino during the 1880s where he wrote and shared works related to the Renaixença with writer and photographer [[Casa Rossell|Joaquim de Riba]].

In 1848, [[Fromental Halévy]] had premiered the opera ''[[Le val d'Andorre]]'' to great success in Europe, where the national consciousness of the valleys was exposed in the romantic work during the Peninsular War.{{sfn|Peruga Guerrero|1998|pp=78–81}}{{sfn|Ministeri d'Educació, Joventut i Esports|1996|p=74}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=354–357}}

Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than France, Spain and [[Portugal]]. But in recent times its thriving tourist industry, along with developments in transport and communications, have removed the country from its isolation. Since 1976 the country has seen the need to reform Andorran institutions due to anachronisms in sovereignty, human rights and the balance of powers as well as the need to adapt legislation to modern demands.
