At Aybut Al Auwal, in the [[Dhofar|Dhofar Governorate]] of Oman, a site was discovered in 2011 containing more than 100 surface scatters of stone tools, belonging to a regionally specific African [[lithic industry]]—the late [[Nubia]]n Complex—known previously only from the northeast and [[Horn of Africa]]. Two optically stimulated luminescence age estimates place the Arabian Nubian Complex at 106,000 years old. This supports the proposition that early human populations moved from Africa into Arabia during the [[Late Pleistocene]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0028239| pmid = 22140561| title = The Nubian Complex of Dhofar, Oman: An African Middle Stone Age Industry in Southern Arabia| journal = PLOS ONE| volume = 6| issue = 11| article-number = e28239| year = 2011| last1 = Rose | first1 = J.

==== Iron Age to pre-Islamic period ====
There is considerable agreement in sources that [[frankincense]] was used by traders in 1500 BCE. The [[Land of Frankincense]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], dramatically illustrates that the incense constituted testimony to [[South Arabia]]n civilisations.

During the 8th century BCE, it is believed that the Yaarub, the descendant of [[Qahtanite|Qahtan]], ruled the entire region of Yemen, including Oman. Wathil bin Himyar bin [[Sheba|Abd-Shams (Saba)]] bin Yashjub ([[Yemen|Yaman]]) bin Yarub bin [[Joktan|Qahtan]] later ruled Oman.<ref name=YWTATss/> It is thus believed that the Yaarubah were the first settlers in Oman from Yemen.<ref name=MIIDN/>

In the 1970s and 1980s, scholars like [[John C. Wilkinson]]<ref>{{cite book |title= Water and Tribal Settlement in South East Arabia – A Study of the Aflaj of Oman |author=Wilkinson, John |publisher=Clarendon Press |year= 1977 |pages=76, 85, 122, 126–130, 132 |isbn=0-19-823217-9}}</ref> believed by virtue of oral history that in the 6th century BCE, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] exerted control over the Omani peninsula, most likely ruling from a coastal centre such as [[Suhar]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Cross-roads Early and Late Iron Age South-Eastern Arabia |author=Yule, Paul |publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag |year= 2014 |pages=15–18 |isbn=978-3-447-10127-1}}</ref> Central Oman has its own indigenous Samad Late Iron Age cultural assemblage named eponymously from [[Samad al-Shan]]. In the northern part of the Oman Peninsula the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|Recent Pre-Islamic Period]] begins in the 3rd century BCE and extends into the 3rd century CE. Whether or not Persians brought south-eastern Arabia under their control is a moot point, since the lack of Persian archeological finds speak against this belief. [[Armand-Pierre Caussin de Perceval]] suggests that Shammir bin Wathil bin Himyar recognised the authority of [[Cyrus the Great]] over Oman in 536 BCE.<ref name=YWTATss>[https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023697835.0x000028 British National Archive: Salîl-ibn-Razîk "History of the imâms and seyyids of Omân"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220707182006/http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023697835.0x000028 |date=7 July 2022 }} History of the imâms and seyyids of Omân.

===Azd tribal migration===
Over centuries, tribes from western Arabia settled in Oman; they made a living by fishing, farming, herding or stock breeding. Further, many present-day Omani families trace their ancestral roots to other parts of Arabia. Arab migration to Oman started from northern-western and south-western Arabia and those who chose to settle had to compete with the indigenous population for the best arable land. When Arab tribes started to migrate to Oman, there were two distinct groups. One group, a segment of the [[Azd]] tribe migrated from [[Yemen]] in 120<ref name=YWTAT/>/200 CE following the collapse of [[Marib Dam]], while the other group migrated a few centuries before the birth of Islam from [[Nejd]] (present-day [[Saudi Arabia]]), named [[Nizar ibn Ma'ad|Nizari]]. Other historians believe that the Yaarubah from Qahtan, which belong to an older branch, were the first settlers of Oman from Yemen, and then came the Azd.<ref name=MIIDN/> 
[[File:Ruins6.JPG|thumb|200px|right|upright|Ruins of [[Khor Rori]], built between 100 [[Before Common Era|BCE]] and 100 [[Common Era|CE]]]]
The Azd settlers in Oman are descendants of Nasr bin Azd and were later known as "the Al-Azd of Oman".<ref name=YWTAT/> Seventy years after the first Azd migration, another branch of [[Azd|Alazdi]] under Malik bin Fahm, the founder of Kingdom of [[Tanukhids|Tanukhites]] on the west of [[Euphrates]], is believed to have settled in Oman.<ref name=YWTAT>Salîl-ibn-Razîk.

===Imamate of Oman===
{{Main|Imamate of Oman}}

Omani [[Azd]] used to travel to [[Basra]] for trade, which was a centre of Islam, during the [[Umayyad]] empire. Omani Azd were granted a section of Basra, where they could settle and attend to their needs. Many of the Omani Azd who settled in Basra became wealthy merchants and, under their leader [[al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra]], started to expand their influence of power eastwards towards [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. [[Ibadism]] originated in Basra through its founder, [[Abdallah ibn Ibad|Abd Allah ibn Ibad]],<ref name=":03">{{Cite journal |date=December 1980 |title=10th Congress, Union Européenne des Arabisants et Islamisants |journal=Middle East Studies Association Bulletin |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=101–103 |doi=10.1017/s0026318400009196 |issn=0026-3184}}</ref> around the year 650; the Omani Azd in Iraq would subsequently adopt this as their predominant faith. Later, [[Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf|al-Hajjaj]], the governor of Iraq, came into conflict with the Ibadis, which forced them back to Oman. Among those who returned was the scholar [[Jābir ibn Zayd|Jaber bin Zaid]]. His return (and the return of many other scholars) greatly enhanced the Ibadhi movement in Oman.<ref name=OmanForeignPolicy/> Alhajjaj also made an attempt to subjugate Oman, then ruled by Suleiman and Said (the sons of Abbad bin Julanda). Alhajjaj dispatched Mujjaah bin Shiwah, who was confronted by Said bin Abbad. This confrontation devastated Said's army, after which he and his forces retreated to the [[Jebel Akhdar (Oman)|Jebel Akhdar]] (mountains). Mujjaah and his forces went after Said, successfully flushing them out from hiding in Wadi Mastall. Mujjaah later moved towards the coast, where he confronted Suleiman bin Abbad. The battle was won by Suleiman's forces. Alhajjaj, however, sent another force (under Abdulrahman bin Suleiman); he eventually won the war, taking over the governance of Oman.<ref name=HRIS>Salîl-ibn-Razîk.

Later in the 17th century, using its bases in Oman, Portugal engaged in the [[Battle off Hormuz (1625)|largest naval battle ever fought in the Persian Gulf]]. The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] force fought against a combined armada of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) and [[English East India Company]] supported by the Safavid empire.

To capture Zanzibar [[Saif bin Sultan]], the [[Imam]] of Oman, pressed down the [[Swahili Coast]]. A major obstacle to his progress was [[Fort Jesus]], housing the garrison of a Portuguese settlement at [[Mombasa]]. After a two-year siege, the fort fell to Imam Saif bin Sultan in 1698. Saif bin Sultan occupied Bahrain in 1700.  The rivalry within the house of Yaruba over power after the death of Imam Sultan in 1718 weakened the dynasty. With the power of the Yaruba Dynasty dwindling, Imam Saif bin Sultan II eventually asked for help against his rivals from [[Nader Shah]] of Persia. A Persian force arrived in March 1737 to aid Saif. From their base at Julfar, the Persian forces eventually rebelled against the Yaruba in 1743. The Persian empire then tried to take possession of the coast of Oman until 1747.<ref name=OmanForeignPolicy/><ref name=ASOD>Stefan Siebert.

During the entire 19th century, in addition to Imam Said bin Ahmed who retained the title until he died in 1803, [[Azzan bin Qais]] was the only elected Imam of Oman. His rule started in 1868. However, the British refused to accept Imam Azzan as a ruler, as he was viewed as inimical to their interests.

Upon the outbreak of [[World War II]], the sultan of Oman declared war on Germany on September 10, 1939.<ref name="WWII"/> During the war, Oman had a strategic role in the defence of the United Kingdom's trade routes. Oman was never attacked during the war. In 1943, the [[Royal Air Force]] established stations on [[Masirah Island]] ([[RAF Masirah]]) and at [[Ras al Hadd]]. [[Air-sea rescue]] units were also stationed in Oman. [[No. 244 Squadron RAF]] flew [[Bristol Blenheim V]] [[light bomber]]s and [[Vickers Wellington XIII]]s out of RAF Masirah on anti-submarine duties in the Gulf of Oman and the northern [[Arabian Sea]], while [[No. 209 Squadron RAF]], [[No. 265 Squadron RAF]], and [[No. 321 Squadron RAF]] flew [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]]s out of Umm Ruşayş on Masirah Island.<ref name="RAF"/> On October 16, 1943, the German [[U-Boat]] ''[[German submarine U-533|U-533]]'' was sunk in the Gulf of Oman after being struck by [[depth charge]]s dropped by a Bristol Blenheim from No. 244 Squadron RAF. The wreck settled at a depth of 108 meters (354 feet) approximately 25 nautical miles (46 kilometres) off the [[Fujairah]] coast. 52 crew members died, with the sole survivor, ''[[Matrosengefreiter]]'' Günther Schmidt, taken aboard HMIS ''Hiravati'' near [[Khor Fakkan]] and made a [[prisoner of war]]. The wreck is now a popular recreational diving site.<ref name="UBoat"/><ref name="UBoat2"/>

The December 1951 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation (covering commerce, oil reserves and navigation) between Oman and the United Kingdom recognised the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman as a fully independent state.

In 1955, the [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] coastal [[Makran]] strip acceded to Pakistan and was made a district of its [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan province]], while [[Gwadar]] remained in Oman. On 8 September 1958, Pakistan [[Gwadar Purchase|purchased the Gwadar enclave]] from Oman for [[United States dollar|US$]]3&nbsp;million.<ref group=note>Gwadar remained an Omani possession as part of the Sultanate until September 1958</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oman.org/bonn_007.htm |title=International trade networks: The Omani Enclave of Gwadar – Conference on German and International Research on Oman, Bonn 1998: abstracts |author=Nicolin, Beatrice |date=25 May 1998 |publisher=Conference on German and International Research on Oman |location=Bonn |access-date=27 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200104031644/http://www.oman.org/bonn_007.htm |archive-date=4 January 2020}}</ref> Gwadar then became a [[tehsil]] in the Makran district.

====Dhofar War====
{{further|Dhofar War}}
In the [[Dhofar War]], which began in 1963, pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces were pitted against government troops. As the rebellion threatened the Sultan's control of [[Dhofar]], Sultan Said bin Taimur was deposed in a [[1970 Omani coup d'état|bloodless coup]] in 1970 by his son [[Qaboos bin Said]] with [[United Kingdom|British]] support. Qaboos expanded the [[Sultan of Oman's Armed Forces]], modernised the state's administration and introduced social reforms. The uprising was finally put down in 1976 with the help of forces from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan and Britain.{{Citation needed|date=August 2025}}

In 1971, Oman joined the United Nations, along with Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.{{cn|date=July 2025}}

In 1981, Oman became a founding member of the six-nation [[Gulf Cooperation Council]]. Political reforms were eventually introduced. The country adopted its present [[Flag of Oman|national flag]] in 1995, resembling the previous flag but with a thicker stripe. In 1997, a royal decree was issued granting women the right to vote, and stand for election to the Majlis al-Shura, the [[Consultative Assembly of Oman]]. Two women were duly elected to the body. In 2002, voting rights were extended to all citizens over the age of 21, and the first elections to the Consultative Assembly under the new rules were held in 2003. In 2004, the Sultan appointed Oman's first female minister with portfolio, [[Aisha bint Khalfan bin Jameel|Sheikha Aisha bint Khalfan bin Jameel al-Sayabiyah]], to the post of National Authority for Industrial Craftsmanship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2818553.stm|title=Oman appoints first female minister|website=BBC News|date=4 March 2003|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190917115643/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2818553.stm|archive-date=17 September 2019}}</ref> Despite these changes, there was little change to the actual political makeup of the government. The Sultan continued to rule by decree. Nearly 100 suspected Islamists were arrested in 2005 and 31 people were convicted of trying to overthrow the government. They were ultimately pardoned in June of the same year.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Inspired by the [[Arab Spring]] uprisings that were taking place throughout the region, [[2011 Omani protests|protests occurred in Oman]] during the early months of 2011. While they did not call for the ousting of the regime, demonstrators demanded political reforms, improved living conditions and the creation of more jobs. They were dispersed by riot police in February 2011. Sultan Qaboos reacted by promising jobs and benefits. In October 2011, elections were held to the Consultative Assembly, to which Sultan Qaboos promised greater powers. The following year, the government began a crackdown on internet criticism. In September 2012, trials began of 'activists' accused of posting "abusive and provocative" criticism of the government online. Six were given jail terms.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14654492 |title=Oman profile – Timeline |work=BBC News |date=11 September 2012 |access-date=18 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190510071946/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14654492|archive-date=10 May 2019}}</ref>
