===Prehistory===
{{See also|Megalithic Temples of Malta|Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum|Għar Dalam}}

Malta has been inhabited from at least {{Circa|6500 BC}}, with the arrival of [[Mesolithic]] hunter-gatherers likely originating from Sicily. Discoveries at [[Latnija Cave]] led by the Maltese archaeologist Eleanor Scerri included the remains of hearths, stone tools and an abundant and diverse range of animal bones. These included indigenous red deer that are now extinct, fish and marine mammals, as well as abundant edible marine [[gastropods]]. To arrive on Malta, these hunter-gatherers had to cross around 100&nbsp;km of open water, documenting the longest yet-known sea crossing by hunter-gatherers in the Mediterranean.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last1=Scerri |first1=Eleanor M.

Relatives of the [[kings of Aragon]] ruled the island until 1409 when it formally passed to the Crown of Aragon. Early on in the Aragonese ascendancy, the sons of the monarchs received the title [[Count of Malta]]. During this time much of the local nobility was created. By 1397, however, the bearing of the comital title reverted to a feudal basis, with two families fighting over the distinction. This led King [[Martin I of Sicily]] to abolish the title. The dispute over the title returned when the title was reinstated a few years later and the Maltese, led by the local nobility, rose up against Count [[Gonsalvo Monroy]].<ref name="malticross" /> Although they opposed the Count, the Maltese voiced their loyalty to the [[List of monarchs of Sicily|Sicilian Crown]], which so impressed [[Alfonso V of Aragon|King Alfonso V]] that he did not punish the people for their rebellion. Instead, he promised never to grant the title to a third party and incorporated it back into the crown. The city of [[Mdina]] was given the title of ''Città Notabile''.<ref name="malticross" />

In September&nbsp;1429, [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsid]] Saracens [[Siege of Malta (1429)|attempted to capture Malta]] but were repelled by the Maltese. The invaders pillaged the countryside and took about 3,000&nbsp;inhabitants as [[Slavery in Malta|slaves]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Cauchi |first=Mark |date=12 September 2004 |title=575th&nbsp;anniversary of the 1429 Siege of Malta |newspaper=Times of Malta |url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20040912/letters/575th-anniversary-of-the-1429-siege-of-malta.112708 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722013314/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20040912/letters/575th-anniversary-of-the-1429-siege-of-malta.112708 |archive-date=22 July 2015}}</ref>

However, by the late 1700s the power of the Knights had declined.

The French forces left behind became unpopular with the Maltese, due particularly to the French forces' hostility towards Catholicism and pillaging of local churches to fund war efforts. French financial and religious policies so angered the Maltese that they rebelled, forcing the French to depart.

On 28 October 1798, Captain Sir [[Alexander Ball]] successfully completed negotiations with the French garrison on Gozo for a surrender and transfer of the island to the British.

Malta achieved its independence as the [[State of Malta]] on 21 September 1964 ([[Independence Day (Malta)|Independence Day]]). Under its 1964 constitution, Malta initially retained [[Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of Malta]] and thus head of state, with a [[governor-general]] exercising executive authority on her behalf. In 1971, the [[Malta Labour Party]] led by [[Dom Mintoff]] won the general elections, resulting in Malta declaring itself a republic on 13 December 1974 ([[Republic Day (Malta)|Republic Day]]) within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].
