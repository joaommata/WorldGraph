In 1511, the first [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish settlement]] was founded by [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] at [[Baracoa]]. Other settlements soon followed, including [[Havana|San Cristobal de la Habana]], founded in 1514 (southern coast of the island) and then in 1519 (current place), which later became the capital (1607).

By 1570, most residents of Cuba had a mixture of Spanish, African, and Taíno heritages.<ref name=Britannica/> Cuba developed slowly and, unlike the plantation islands of the Caribbean, had a diversified agriculture. Most importantly, the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported the Spanish colonial empire. By the mid-18th century, there were 50,000 slaves on the island. Estimates suggest that between 1790 and 1820, some 325,000 Africans were imported to Cuba as slaves, which was four times the amount that had arrived between 1760 and 1790.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Freedom's Mirror: Cuba and Haiti in the Age of Revolution |last=Ferrer |first=Ada |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-1107029422 |location=New York |page=36}}</ref>

In 1812, the [[Aponte conspiracy|Aponte slave rebellion]] took place, but it was ultimately suppressed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Matt D.|title=The 1813 Aponte Rebellion in Cuba and the Struggle against Atlantic Slavery|year=2006|publisher=[[The University of North Carolina Press]]|isbn=978-0-8078-5772-4|page=320 pages}}</ref> The population of Cuba in 1817 was 630,980 (of which 291,021 were white, 115,691 were [[free people of color]] (mixed-race), and 224,268 black slaves).{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=352}} The population in 1841 was 1,007,624, of whom 425,521 were black slaves, 418,291 were white.<ref>{{cite book |title=The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge |date=1848 |publisher=Charles Knight |location=London |page=Vol V, p.132 |edition=First}}</ref>

In part due to Cuban slaves working primarily in urbanized settings, by the 19th century, the practice of {{Lang|es|coartacion}} had developed (or "buying oneself out of slavery", a "uniquely Cuban development"), according to historian [[Herbert S. Klein]].<ref>Herbert S. Klein, ''Slavery in the Americas: A Comparative Study of Virginia and Cuba'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967, p. 196</ref> Due to a shortage of white labor, blacks dominated urban industries "to such an extent that when whites in large numbers came to Cuba in the middle of the nineteenth century, they were unable to displace Negro workers."<ref name="drimmer">{{cite journal |jstor=1919107 |author=Melvin Drimmer |title=Reviewed Work: ''Slavery in the Americas: A Comparative Study of Virginia and Cuba'' by [[Herbert S.

In the 1820s, when the rest of Spain's empire in Latin America [[Decolonization of the Americas|rebelled and formed independent states]], Cuba remained loyal to Spain. Its economy was based on serving the empire. By 1860, Cuba had 213,167 free people of color (39% of its non-white population of 550,000).<ref name="drimmer"/>

Full independence from Spain was the goal of a rebellion in 1868 led by planter [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes]]. De Céspedes, a sugar planter, freed his slaves to fight with him for an independent Cuba.<ref name=":14">The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica. "Carlos Manuel de Céspedes".

A number of these individuals had fought for Spain in Santo Domingo following its re-annexation (1861–65). When Spain quit Santo Domingo for the second time, some Dominican colonial officers immigrated to Cuba. Most were unable to find service in the Spanish army in Cuba. Some of these former soldiers joined the new Revolutionary army and provided its initial training and leadership."{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=353}} Mercenaries from Canada, Colombia, France, Mexico, and the United States joined the Cuban Revolutionary Army. Chinese nationals, brought to Cuba as indentured servants, also fought for the cause.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=353}} By 1876, the Cuban Revolutionary movement was facing internal strife, largely driven by racial tensions. General Máximo Gómez surrendered his command after officers refused to follow his orders because he was Dominican. At the same time, the campaign against Antonio Maceo, a [[mulatto]] leader, grew stronger as white factions sought to undermine his leadership because of his race. These racial divisions contributed to a decline in morale within the Revolutionary Army.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=357}}}} but lacked support from wealthy planters and the majority of slaves.<ref name=Britannica/>

Around 200,000 Spanish troops outnumbered the much smaller rebel army, which relied mostly on [[Guerilla warfare|guerrilla]] and [[sabotage]] tactics. The Spaniards began a campaign of suppression.
