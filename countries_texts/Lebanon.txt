In the 9th century BC, [[Phoenician colonies]], including [[Carthage]] in present-day [[Tunisia]] and [[Cádiz]] in present-day [[Spain]], flourished throughout the Mediterranean. Subsequently, foreign powers, starting with the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], imposed tribute and attacked non-compliant cities.

In 64 BC, the Roman general [[Pompey]] had the region of Syria annexed into the [[Roman Republic]]. The area was then split into two [[Imperial province|Imperial Provinces]] under the [[Roman Empire]], [[Coele-Syria]] and [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Phoenice]], the latter which the land of present-day Lebanon was a part of.

The region that is now Lebanon, as with the rest of Syria and much of [[Anatolia]], became a major center of Christianity in the [[Roman Empire]] during the early spread of the faith. During the late 4th and early 5th century, a hermit named [[Maron]] established a monastic tradition focused on the importance of [[monotheism]] and [[asceticism]] near the Mediterranean mountain range known as [[Mount Lebanon]]. The monks who followed Maron spread his teachings among Lebanese in the region. These Christians became known as [[Maronites]] and moved into the mountains to avoid religious persecution by Roman authorities.<ref>{{cite book | title=From the Holy Mountain: A Journey Among the Christians of the Middle East | author=Dalrymple, William | year=1997 | publisher=Vintage Books (Random House) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jHGYvr7rkrsC | page=305 | isbn=9780307948922 | access-date=20 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905212200/https://books.google.com/books?id=jHGYvr7rkrsC | archive-date=5 September 2015 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all}}</ref> During the frequent [[Roman–Persian Wars]] that lasted for many centuries, the [[Sasanian Empire]] occupied what is now Lebanon from 619 till 629.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFTHBoRvQbsC&pg=PA338|title=Colonialism|access-date=25 December 2014|isbn=9781576073353|last1=Page|first1=Melvin Eugene|last2=Sonnenburg|first2=Penny M.|year=2003|publisher=Abc-Clio |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012124706/https://books.google.com/books?id=qFTHBoRvQbsC&pg=PA338|archive-date=12 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Middle Ages ===
During the 7th century, [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Muslims conquered Syria]] from the Byzantines, incorporating the region, including modern-day Lebanon, under the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Islamic Caliphate]].<ref name=":42">{{Cite book |last=Harris |first=William W. |title=Lebanon: A History, 600–2011 |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-518111-1 |edition= |series=Studies in Middle Eastern history |location=New York, N.Y |pages=3–28, 232, 247}}</ref> In the era of [[Uthman]]'s caliphate (644–656), Islam gained significant influence in Damascus, led by [[Mu'awiya I|Mu'awiya]], a relative of Uthman, serving as the governor. Mu'awiya sent forces to the coastal region of Lebanon, prompting conversions to Islam among the coastal population. The mountainous areas retained their Christian or other cultural practices.<ref name=":10" /> Despite Islam and Arabic becoming officially dominant, the population's conversion from Christianity and [[Syriac language]] was gradual. The Maronite community, in particular, managed to maintain a large degree of autonomy despite the succession of rulers over Lebanon and Syria. The relative  isolation of the Lebanese mountains meant the mountains served as a refuge in the times of religious and political crises in the [[Levant]]. As such, the mountains displayed religious diversity and the existence of several well-established sects and religions, notably, [[Maronites]], [[Druze]], [[Shia Islam|Shiite Muslims]], [[Isma'ilism|Ismailis]], [[Alawites]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobites]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hitti|first=Philip|author-link=Philip K. Hitti|date=1957|title=Lebanon in History|url=https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.53848|location=|publisher=Macmillan and Co Ltd|pages=246}}</ref> 

After the Islamic conquest, Mediterranean trade declined for three centuries due to conflicts with the Byzantines. The ports of Tyre, Sidon, Beirut, and Tripoli struggled to recover, sustaining small populations under [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] rule. Christians and Jews were often obligated to pay the ''[[jizya]]'', or poll tax levied on non-Muslims.<ref name=":42" /> During the 980s, the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] took control of the Levant, including Mount Lebanon, resulting in the rejuvenation of Mediterranean trade along the Lebanese coast through renewed connections with Byzantium and Italy. This resurgence saw Tripoli and Tyre flourishing well into the 11th century, focusing on exports such as textiles, sugar, and glassware.<ref name=":42" />

During the 11th century, the [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]] religion emerged from a branch of [[Shia Islam]]. The new religion gained followers in the southern portion of Mount Lebanon. The southern portion of Mount Lebanon was ruled by Druze feudal families till the early 14th century. The Maronite population increased gradually in Northern Mount Lebanon and the Druze have remained in Southern Mount Lebanon until the modern era. [[Keserwan District|Keserwan]], [[Jabal Amel]] and the [[Beqaa Valley]] was ruled by Shia feudal families under the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire. Major cities on the coast, [[Sidon]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], [[Beirut]], and others, were directly administered by the Muslim Caliphs and the people became more fully absorbed by the Arab culture.[[File:Siege of Tripoli Painting (1289).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Fall of Tripoli (1289)|Fall of Tripoli]] to the Egyptian [[Mamluk]]s and destruction of the Crusader state, the County of Tripoli, 1289]]

Following the fall of Roman [[Anatolia]] to the Muslim Turks, the Byzantines put out a call to the Pope in Rome for assistance in the 11th century. The result was a series of wars known as the [[Crusades]] launched by the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]] from Western Europe to reclaim the former Byzantine Christian territories in the Eastern Mediterranean, especially [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (the ''[[Levant]]''). The [[First Crusade]] succeeded in temporarily establishing the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[County of Tripoli]] as Roman Catholic Christian states along the coast.<ref>{{cite book | author=Hillenbrand, Carole | publisher=Psychology Press | year=2000 | title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives | isbn=978-1-57958-354-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UalnoF5MBHMC | pages=20–21 | access-date=20 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905174853/https://books.google.com/books?id=UalnoF5MBHMC | archive-date=5 September 2015 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all}}</ref> These crusader states made a lasting impact on the region, though their control was limited, and the region returned to full Muslim control after two centuries following the conquest by the Mamluks.

Among the most lasting effects of the Crusades in this region was the contact between the Franks (i.e., the French) and the Maronites. Unlike most other Christian communities in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], who swore allegiance to [[Constantinople]] or other local patriarchs, the Maronites proclaimed allegiance to the Pope in Rome. As such the Franks saw them as Roman Catholic brethren. These initial contacts led to centuries of support for the Maronites from France and Italy, even after the fall of the Crusader states in the region.

Eventually, he was appointed [[Sanjak-bey]], overseeing various Ottoman sub-provinces and tax collection.

This expansion raised concerns for Ottoman Sultan Murad IV, leading to a punitive expedition in 1633. Fakhr al-Din II was captured, imprisoned for two years, and subsequently executed in April 1635, along with one of his sons.<ref>{{cite book |author=Gorton, T.J. |title=Renaissance Emir |date=25 April 2013 |publisher=Quartet Books |isbn=9780704372979 |pages=195–210}}</ref> Surviving members of his family continued to govern a reduced area under closer Ottoman supervision until the late 17th century.

=== French Mandate ===
Amidst the height of the [[World War I|First World War]], the [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]] of 1916, a secret pact between Britain and France, delineated Lebanon and its surrounding areas as regions open to potential French influence or control.<ref name=":8" /> After the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] emerged victorious in the war, the [[Ottoman Empire]] ultimately collapsed, losing control over the area.

After the fighting ended in Lebanon, General [[Charles de Gaulle]] visited the area. Under political pressure from both inside and outside Lebanon, de Gaulle recognized the independence of Lebanon. On 26 November 1941, General [[Georges Catroux]] announced that Lebanon would become independent under the authority of the [[Free French]] government. Elections were held in 1943 and on 8 November 1943 the new Lebanese government unilaterally abolished the mandate. The French reacted by imprisoning the new government. Lebanese nationalists declared a provisional government, and the British diplomatically intervened on their behalf. In the face of intense British pressure and protests by Lebanese nationalists, the French reluctantly released the government officials on 22 November 1943, and accepted the independence of Lebanon.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Barr |first=James |date=10 August 2020 |title=Who are Lebanon's real friends? |url=https://unherd.com/2020/08/who-are-lebanons-real-friends/ |access-date=17 August 2024 |website=UnHerd |language=en-GB}}</ref>[[File:Beirut's Martyrs' Square during celebrations marking the release by the French of Lebanon's government from Rashayya prison on November 22, 1943, the day of Lebanon's independence.

=== Independence from Free France ===
Following the end of World War II in Europe the French mandate may be said to have been terminated without any formal action on the part of the [[League of Nations]] or its successor the [[United Nations]]. The mandate was ended by the declaration of the mandatory power, and of the new states themselves, of their independence, followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers, culminating in formal admission to the United Nations. Article 78 of the UN Charter ended the status of tutelage for any member state: "The trusteeship system shall not apply to territories which have become Members of the United Nations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality."<ref>Mandates, Dependencies and Trusteeship, by H. Duncan Hall, Carnegie Endowment, 1948, pages 265–266</ref> So when the UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the [[United Nations Charter]] by the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]], as both Syria and Lebanon were founding member states, the French mandate for both was legally terminated on that date and full independence attained.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/aboutun/unhistory/ |title=History of the United Nations |publisher=United Nations |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127033154/http://www.un.org/aboutun/unhistory/ |archive-date=27 January 2012}}</ref> The last French troops withdrew in December 1946.

In May 1948, Lebanon supported neighboring Arab countries in a [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|war against Israel]]. While some irregular forces crossed the border and carried out minor skirmishes against Israel, it was without the support of the Lebanese government, and Lebanese troops did not officially invade.{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=524}} Lebanon agreed to support the forces with covering artillery fire, armored cars, volunteers and logistical support.{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=259}} On 5–6 June 1948, the Lebanese army – led by the then [[Ministry of National Defense (Lebanon)|Minister of National Defense]], [[Majid Arslan|Emir Majid Arslan]] – captured [[Al-Malkiyya]].

Chamoun requested assistance, and 5,000 [[United States Marines]] were briefly dispatched to Beirut on 15 July. After the crisis, a new government was formed, led by the popular former general [[Fouad Chehab]].

The relocation also led to sectarian tensions between Palestinians versus the Maronites and other Lebanese factions. In 1975, following increasing tensions, largely boosted by [[Fatahland|Palestinian militant presence]] in the south, a full-scale civil war broke out in Lebanon. The war pitted a coalition of Christian groups against the joint forces of the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization|PLO]], left-wing Druze and Muslim militias. In October 1976 the [[Arab League]] agreed to establish a predominantly Syrian [[Arab Deterrent Force]], which was charged with restoring calm.<ref name="fco-cpl">{{cite web |title=Country Profile: Lebanon |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/middle-east-north-africa/lebanon/?profile=all |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117000044/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/middle-east-north-africa/lebanon/?profile=all |archive-date=17 January 2013 |publisher=British Foreign & Commonwealth Office}}</ref>  [[File:Green Line, Beirut 1982.jpg|thumb|The [[Green Line (Lebanon)|Green Line]] that separated west and east Beirut, 1982|left]]PLO attacks from Lebanon into Israel in 1977 and 1978 escalated tensions between two countries.

A [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|multinational force]] of American, French and Italian contingents (joined in 1983 by a British contingent) were deployed in Beirut after [[Siege of Beirut|the Israeli siege of the city]], to supervise the evacuation of the PLO. The civil war re-emerged in September 1982 after the assassination of President [[Bachir Gemayel]], an Israeli ally, and subsequent fighting.

In the late 1980s, as [[Amine Gemayel]]'s second term as president drew to an end, the Lebanese [[Lebanese pound|pound]] collapsed. At the end of 1987 US$1 was worth £L500. This meant the legal minimum wage was worth just $17 a month. Most goods in shops were priced in dollars. A [[Save the Children]] director estimated that 200,000–300,000 children were in need of assistance and were living almost entirely on bread, which was subsidized by the government.
