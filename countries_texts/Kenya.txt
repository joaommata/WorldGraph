===Prehistory===
[[File:Turkana Boy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Turkana boy|Turkana Boy]], a 1.6-million-year-old ''[[Homo erectus]]'' fossil]]

[[Hominid]] species, such as ''[[Homo habilis]]'' (fl. 1.8 to 2.5 million years ago) and ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (fl. 1.9 million to 350,000 years ago), possibly the direct ancestors of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', had lived in Kenya in the [[Pleistocene]] epoch.<ref name="Isaac">{{Cite book |last=Glynn Llywelyn Isaac |first=Barbara Isaac |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qwEoAQAAMAAJ&pg=PAxiii |title=Olorgesailie: archeological studies of a Middle Pleistocene lake basin in Kenya |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1977 |page=xiii |isbn=978-0-226-38483-2 |access-date=26 March 2023 |archive-date=15 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230415094804/https://books.google.com/books?id=qwEoAQAAMAAJ&pg=PAxiii |url-status=live }}</ref> East Africa, including Kenya, is one of the earliest regions where modern humans (''[[Homo sapiens]]'') are believed to have lived.

The coastline of Kenya was home to communities of [[ironwork]]ers and Bantu subsistence farmers, hunters, and fishers who supported the region's economy with agriculture, fishing, metal production, and trade with foreign countries. These communities formed the earliest [[city-states]] in the region, which were collectively known as [[Azania]].<ref name="pbs.org">{{Cite web |title=Wonders of the African World |url=https://www.pbs.org/wonders/fr_e2.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301223400/http://www.pbs.org/wonders/fr_e2.htm |archive-date=1 March 2020 |access-date=16 April 2010 |publisher=[[PBS]]}}</ref> The Swahili people were of mixed African and Asian (particularly Persian) ancestry, as [[DNA]] evidence has revealed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brielle|first1=E.

By the 1st century CE, many of the area's city-states, such as [[Mombasa]], [[Malindi]], and [[Zanzibar]], began to establish trading relations with the [[Arabs]]. This led to increased economic growth of the Swahili states, the introduction of [[Islam]], [[Arabic]] influences on the [[Swahili language]], [[cultural diffusion]], as well as the Swahili city-states becoming members of a larger trade network.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History and Origin of Swahili – Jifunze Kiswahili |url=http://www.swahilihub.com/JifunzeKiswahili/-/1306806/1333292/-/jbyx02z/-/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621021817/http://www.swahilihub.com/JifunzeKiswahili/-/1306806/1333292/-/jbyx02z/-/index.html |archive-date=21 June 2016 |access-date=17 July 2016 |publisher=swahilihub.com}}</ref><ref name="Nanjira">{{Cite book |last=Nanjira |first=Daniel Don |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LZuxGsXVPoMC&pg=PA114 |title=African Foreign Policy and Diplomacy from Antiquity to the 21st Century |date=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9780313379826 |language=en |access-date=26 March 2023 |archive-date=15 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230415153548/https://books.google.com/books?id=LZuxGsXVPoMC&pg=PA114 |url-status=live }}</ref> Many historians had long believed that the city-states were established by Arab or Persian traders, but archaeological evidence has led scholars to recognise the city-states as an indigenous development which, though subjected to foreign influence due to trade, retained a Bantu cultural core.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Spear, Thomas |year=2000 |title=Early Swahili History Reconsidered |journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=257–290 |doi=10.2307/220649 |jstor=220649}}</ref>

The [[Kilwa Sultanate]] was a medieval [[sultanate]] centred at [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], in modern-day Tanzania.

One major city on the Kenyan coast is Malindi. It has been an important Swahili settlement since the 14th century, and the city once rivalled Mombasa for dominance in the [[African Great Lakes]] region. Malindi has traditionally been a friendly port city for foreign powers. In 1414, the Chinese trader and explorer [[Zheng He]], representing the [[Ming Dynasty]], visited the East African coast on one of his last '[[Ming treasure voyages|treasure voyages]]'.<ref>{{Cite web |title=PBS website |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/ancient-chinese-explorers/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008050639/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/ancient-chinese-explorers.html |archive-date=8 October 2015 |access-date=12 October 2015 |website=[[PBS]]|date=16 January 2001 }}</ref> Malindi also welcomed the Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] in 1498.

In the 17th century, the Swahili coast was conquered by the [[Omani Arabs]], who expanded the [[Indian Ocean slave trade|slave trade]] to meet the demands of plantations in [[Oman]] and Zanzibar.<ref>"[https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/548305/slavery/24157/Slave-societies Slavery (sociology)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602182633/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/548305/slavery/24157/Slave-societies |date=2 June 2015 }}".

===18th and 19th centuries===

During the 18th and 19th century, the [[Masai people]] moved into the central and southern [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Rift Valley]] plains of Kenya, from a region north of Lake Rudolf (now [[Lake Turkana]]). Although there weren't many of them, they managed to conquer a great amount of land in the plains, where people did not put up much resistance.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}} The [[Nandi people|Nandi]] peoples managed to oppose the Masai, while the Taveta peoples fled to the forests on the eastern edge of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], although they later were forced to leave the land due to the threat of [[smallpox]]. An outbreak of either [[rinderpest]] or [[pleuropneumonia]] greatly affected the Masai's cattle, while an epidemic of smallpox affected the Masai themselves. After the death of the Masai [[Mbatian]], the chief ''laibon'' (medicine man), the Masai split into warring factions. The Masai caused much strife in the areas they conquered; however, cooperation between such groups as the [[Luo people]], [[Luhya people]], and [[Gusii people]] is evidenced by shared vocabulary for modern implements and similar economic regimes.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ndeda |first=Mildred |year=2019 |title=Population movement, settlement and the construction of society to the east of Lake Victoria in precolonial times: the western Kenyan case |url=https://journals.openedition.org/eastafrica/473 |journal=The East African Review |issue=52 |pages=83–108 |doi=10.4000/eastafrica.473 |s2cid=198396394 |doi-access=free |access-date=13 August 2022 |archive-date=13 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220813063130/https://journals.openedition.org/eastafrica/473 |url-status=live }}</ref> Although Arab traders remained in the area, trade routes were disrupted by the hostile Masai, though there was trade in ivory between these factions.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Beachey |first=R.W. |date=1967 |title=The East African Ivory Trade in the Nineteenth Century |journal=The Journal of African History |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=269–290 |doi=10.1017/S0021853700007052 |s2cid=162882930}}</ref>

The first foreigners to successfully get past the Masai were [[Johann Ludwig Krapf]] and [[Johannes Rebmann]], two German missionaries who established a mission in [[Rabai]], not too far from [[Mombasa]]. The pair were the first Europeans to sight [[Mount Kenya]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Johannes Rebmann |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johannes-Rebmann |access-date=15 August 2022 |edition=Online |archive-date=13 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220813063129/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johannes-Rebmann |url-status=live }}</ref>

===German Protectorate (1885–1890)===
The [[German Empire]] established a protectorate over the [[Sultan of Zanzibar]]'s coastal possessions in 1885, followed by the arrival of the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] in 1888. Imperial rivalry was prevented by the [[Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty]], so Germany handed its East African coastal holdings to Britain in 1890.

The transfer by Germany to Britain was followed by the building of the [[Uganda Railway]] passing through the country.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</ref>

The building of the railway was resisted by some ethnic groups—notably the [[Nandi people|Nandi]], led by ''[[Orkoiyot]]'' [[Koitalel Arap Samoei]] from 1890 to 1900—but the British eventually built it. The ''Nandi'' were the first ethnic group to be put in a native reserve to stop them from disrupting the building of the railway.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" />

During the railway construction era, there was a significant influx of Indian workers, who provided the bulk of the skilled labour required for construction.<ref name="R. Mugo Gatheru 2005">[[R. Mugo Gatheru]] (2005) ''Kenya: From Colonization to Independence, 1888–1970'', McFarland, {{ISBN|0-7864-2199-1}}</ref> They and most of their descendants later remained in Kenya and formed the core of several distinct Indian communities, such as the [[Ismailism|Ismaili Muslim]] and [[Sikh]] communities. While building the railway through [[Tsavo]], a number of the Indian railway workers and local African labourers were attacked by two lions known as the [[Tsavo maneaters]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ismaili muslim |url=http://www.magicalkenya.com/default.nsf/doc21/4YQ4W3FZEI64?opendocument&l=1&e=7&s=1 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103151208/http://www.magicalkenya.com/default.nsf/doc21/4YQ4W3FZEI64?opendocument&l=1&e=7&s=1 |archive-date=3 January 2009 |access-date=16 April 2010 |publisher=Magicalkenya.com}}</ref>

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, the governors of [[British East Africa]] (as the protectorate was generally known) and [[German East Africa]] initially agreed on a truce in an attempt to keep the young colonies out of direct hostilities. But Lieutenant Colonel [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck]], the German military commander, determined to tie down as many British resources as possible. Completely cut off from Germany, Lettow-Vorbeck conducted [[East African campaign (World War I)|an effective guerrilla warfare campaign]], living off the land, capturing British supplies, and remaining undefeated. He eventually surrendered in [[Northern Rhodesia]] (today Zambia) 14 days after the Armistice was signed in 1918.<ref name="R. Mugo Gatheru 2005" />

[[File:Kurve bei Mombasa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|The [[Uganda Railway|Kenya–Uganda Railway]] near [[Mombasa]], about 1899]]
To chase von Lettow, the British deployed the [[British Indian Army]] troops from India but needed large numbers of porters to overcome the formidable logistics of transporting supplies far into the interior on foot. The [[Carrier Corps]] was formed and ultimately mobilised over 400,000 Africans, contributing to their long-term politicisation.<ref name="R. Mugo Gatheru 2005" />

In 1920, the East Africa Protectorate was turned into a colony and renamed Kenya after its highest mountain.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" />

During the early part of the 20th century, the interior central highlands were settled by British and other European farmers, who became wealthy farming coffee and tea.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090211070504/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901759-3,00.html "We Want Our Country"]. ''Time''. 5 November 1965</ref> One depiction of this period of change from a colonist's perspective is found in the memoir ''[[Out of Africa]]'' by Danish author Baroness Karen von Blixen-Finecke, published in 1937. By the 1930s, approximately 30,000 white settlers lived in the area and gained a political voice because of their contribution to the market economy.<ref name="R. Mugo Gatheru 2005" />

The central highlands were already home to over a million members of the Kikuyu people, most of whom had no land claims in European terms and lived as itinerant farmers. To protect their interests, the settlers banned the growing of coffee and introduced a hut tax, and the landless were granted less and less land in exchange for their labour. A massive exodus to the cities ensued as their ability to make a living from the land dwindled.<ref name="R. Mugo Gatheru 2005" /> By the 1950s, there were 80,000 [[Whites in Kenya|white settlers]] living in Kenya.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Firestone |first=Matthew |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-r3g6OdLEUC&pg=PA28 |title=Kenya |date=15 September 2010 |publisher=Lonely Planet Publications |isbn=9781742203553 |page=28 |language=en |access-date=26 March 2023 |archive-date=18 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240518180737/https://books.google.com/books?id=R-r3g6OdLEUC&pg=PA28 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Throughout [[World War II]], [[Kenya in World War II|Kenya was]] an important source of manpower and agriculture for the United Kingdom. Kenya itself was the site of [[East African Campaign (World War II)|fighting]] between Allied forces and Italian troops in 1940–41, when Italian forces invaded. [[Wajir]] and [[Malindi]] were bombed as well.

===Mau Mau Uprising===
{{Further|Mau Mau Uprising}}
[[File:Statue of Dedan Kimathi Nairobi, Kenya.jpg|thumb|A statue of [[Dedan Kimathi]], a Kenyan leader with the [[Kenya Land and Freedom Army|Mau Mau]] who fought against the British colonial system in the 1950s]]

From October 1952 to December 1959, Kenya was in a state of emergency arising from the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Mau rebellion]] against British rule. The Mau Mau, also known as the Kenya Land and Freedom Army, were primarily [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], [[Embu people|Embu]] and [[Meru people|Meru]] people. During the colonial administration's crackdown, over 11,000 freedom fighters had been killed, along with 100 British troops and 2,000 Kenyan loyalist soldiers. War crimes were committed on both sides of the conflict, including the publicised [[Lari massacre]] and the [[Hola massacre]]. The governor requested and obtained British and African troops, including the [[King's African Rifles]]. The British began counter-insurgency operations. In May 1953, General Sir [[George Erskine]] took charge as commander-in-chief of the colony's armed forces, with the personal backing of [[Winston Churchill]].<ref name="Wunyabari O. Maloba 1993">Maloba, Wunyabari O. (1993) ''Mau Mau and Kenya: An Analysis of Peasant Revolt'', Indiana University Press, 0852557450.</ref>

The capture of [[Waruhiu Itote]] (nom de guerre ''"General China"'') on 15 January 1954 and the subsequent interrogation led to a better understanding of the Mau Mau command structure for the British.

===Somalis of Kenya referendum, 1962===
{{Further|Somalis in Kenya}}
Before Kenya got its independence, [[Somalis in Kenya|Somali ethnic people in present-day Kenya]] in the areas of [[Northern Frontier Districts]] petitioned Her Majesty's Government not to be included in Kenya. The colonial government decided to hold Kenya's first referendum in 1962 to check the willingness of [[Somalis in Kenya]] to join [[Somalia]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Castagno |first=A.

===Early independence period===
[[File:Jomo Kenyatta.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The first president and founding father of Kenya, [[Jomo Kenyatta]]]]

The first direct elections for native Kenyans to the Legislative Council took place in 1957.

Despite British hopes of handing power to "moderate" local rivals, it was the [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU) of [[Jomo Kenyatta]] that formed a government. The Colony of Kenya and the Protectorate of Kenya each came to an end on 12 December 1963, with independence conferred on all of Kenya. The U.K. ceded sovereignty over the Colony of Kenya. The Sultan of Zanzibar agreed that simultaneous with independence for the colony, he would cease to have sovereignty over the Protectorate of Kenya so that all of Kenya would become one sovereign state.<ref name="Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966.

Concurrently, the Kenyan army fought the [[Shifta War]] against ethnic Somali rebels inhabiting the [[Northern Frontier District]] who wanted to join their kin in the [[Somali Republic]] to the north.<ref>Bruce Baker, ''Escape from Domination in Africa: Political Disengagement & Its Consequences'', (Africa World Press: 2003), p.83</ref> A ceasefire was eventually reached with the signing of the Arusha Memorandum in October 1967, but relative insecurity prevailed through 1969.<ref name="Hogg1986">{{Cite journal |last=Hogg |first=Richard |year=1986 |title=The New Pastoralism: Poverty and Dependency in Northern Kenya |journal=Africa: Journal of the International African Institute |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=319–333 |doi=10.2307/1160687 |jstor=1160687 |s2cid=146312775}}</ref><ref name="Howell1968">{{Cite journal |last=Howell |first=John |date=May 1968 |title=An Analysis of Kenyan Foreign Policy |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=29–48 |doi=10.1017/S0022278X00016657 |jstor=158675 |s2cid=154605094}}</ref> To discourage further invasions, Kenya signed a defence pact with [[Ethiopia]] in 1969, which is still in effect.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1969–1976, Volume E–6, Documents on Africa, 1973–1976 - Office of the Historian |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve06/d183 |access-date=2023-03-26 |website=history.state.gov |archive-date=26 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326162911/https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve06/d183 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Kabukuru |first=Wanjohi |date=2015-02-26 |title=The Kenya-Ethiopia Defence Pact: Is Somalia a pawn? |url=https://newafricanmagazine.com/10026/ |access-date=2023-03-26 |website=New African Magazine |language=en-GB |archive-date=26 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326162913/https://newafricanmagazine.com/10026/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Kenyatta and his family were tied up with this corruption as they enriched themselves through the mass purchase of property after 1963. Their acquisitions in the Central, Rift Valley, and Coast Provinces aroused great anger among landless Kenyans. His family used his presidential position to circumvent legal or administrative obstacles to acquiring property. The Kenyatta family also heavily invested in the coastal hotel business, with Kenyatta personally owning the Leonard Beach Hotel.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Boone |first=Catherine |date=April 2012 |title=Land Conflict and Distributive Politics in Kenya |url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/2152/19778/2/Boone_AfricanStudiesReview.pdf |journal=African Studies Review |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=75–103 |doi=10.1353/arw.2012.0010 |issn=0002-0206 |s2cid=154334560 |hdl-access=free |hdl=2152/19778}}</ref>

Kenyatta's mixed legacy was highlighted at the 10-year anniversary of Kenya's independence. A December 1973 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Kenyatta's leadership and Kenya for emerging as a model of pragmatism and conservatism. Kenya's GDP had increased at an annual rate of 6.6%, higher than the population growth rate of more than 3%.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Times |first=Charles Mohr Special to The New York |date=16 December 1973 |title=Kenya, 10 Years Independent, Emerges as a Model of Stability (Published 1973) |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/16/archives/kenya-10-years-independent-emerges-as-a-model-of-stability-the.html |url-status=live |access-date=19 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127081501/https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/16/archives/kenya-10-years-independent-emerges-as-a-model-of-stability-the.html |archive-date=27 November 2020}}</ref> But [[Amnesty International]] responded to the article by stating the cost of the stability in terms of human rights abuses.

[[File:Moi and Bush.jpg|thumb|[[Daniel arap Moi]], Kenya's second President, and [[George W. Bush]], 2001]]
After Kenyatta died, [[Daniel arap Moi]] became president. He retained the presidency, running unopposed in elections held in 1979, 1983 ([[snap election]]s), and 1988, all of which were held under the single-party constitution. The 1983 elections were held a year early, and were a direct result of [[1982 Kenyan coup d'état attempt|a failed military coup]] on 2 August 1982.

The 1982 coup was masterminded by a low-ranking Air Force serviceman, Senior Private [[Hezekiah Ochuka]], and was staged mainly by enlisted men of the Air Force. It was quickly suppressed by forces commanded by Chief of General Staff [[Mahamoud Mohamed]], a veteran Somali military official.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3MctAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA12 |title=Society |publisher=Nyamora Communications Limited |year=1992 |page=12 |access-date=26 March 2023 |archive-date=6 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230506160202/https://books.google.com/books?id=3MctAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA12 |url-status=live }}</ref> They included the General Service Unit (GSU)—a paramilitary wing of the police—and later the regular police.

On the heels of the [[Garissa Massacre]] of 1980, Kenyan troops committed the [[Wagalla massacre]] in 1984 against thousands of civilians in [[Wajir County]]. An official probe into the atrocities was later ordered in 2011.<ref>{{Cite news |date=11 February 2011 |title=Wagalla massacre: Raila Odinga orders Kenya probe |publisher=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12463001 |url-status=live |access-date=14 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622041516/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12463001 |archive-date=22 June 2014}}</ref>{{clarify|What were the results of the probe?|date=December 2019}}

=== Transition to multiparty democracy ===
In 1991, Kenya transitioned to a multiparty political system after 26 years of single-party rule. On 28 October 1992, Moi dissolved parliament, five months before the end of his term. As a result, preparations began for all elective seats in parliament as well as the president. The election was scheduled to take place on 7 December 1992, but delays led to its postponement to 29 December. Apart from KANU, the ruling party, other parties represented in the elections included [[Forum for the Restoration of Democracy|FORD]] Kenya and FORD Asili. This election was marked by large-scale intimidation of opponents and harassment of election officials. It resulted in an economic crisis propagated by ethnic violence as the president was accused of rigging electoral results to retain power.<ref name="Keith">{{Cite book |last=Keith. |first=Kyle |title=Politics of the independence of Kenya |date=1999 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0333720080 |oclc=795968156}}</ref><ref name="Goldsworthy">{{Cite journal |last=Goldsworthy |first=David |date=March 1982 |title=Ethnicity and Leadership in Africa: the 'Untypical' Case of Tom Mboya |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=107–126 |doi=10.1017/s0022278x00000082 |issn=0022-278X |s2cid=154841201}}</ref><ref name="ParliamentKe">{{Cite web |title=KENYA: parliamentary elections National Assembly, 1992 |url=http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2167_92.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817091746/http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2167_92.htm |archive-date=17 August 2018 |access-date=29 January 2019 |website=archive.ipu.org}}</ref> This election was a turning point for Kenya as it signified the beginning of the end of Moi's leadership and the rule of KANU.

Moi's plan to be replaced by Uhuru Kenyatta failed, and [[Mwai Kibaki]], running for the opposition coalition "National Rainbow Coalition" ([[National Rainbow Coalition|NARC]]), was elected president. David Anderson (2003) reports the elections were judged free and fair by local and international observers, and seemed to mark a turning point in Kenya's democratic evolution.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

Kibaki was reelected in highly contested elections marred by [[2007–08 Kenyan crisis|political and ethnic violence]]. The main opposition leader, Raila Odinga, claimed the election was rigged and that he was the rightfully elected president. In the ensuing violence, 1,500 people were killed and another 600,000 internally displaced, making it the worst post-election violence in Kenya. To stop the death and displacement of people, Kibaki and Odinga agreed to work together, with the latter taking the position of a prime minister.<ref>{{Cite news |date=12 April 2008 |title=Deal to end Kenyan crisis agreed |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7344816.stm |url-status=live |access-date=29 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415174110/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7344816.stm |archive-date=15 April 2008}}</ref> This made Odinga [[Prime Minister of Kenya|the second prime minister of Kenya]].

In August 2010, Kenyans held a [[2010 Kenyan constitutional referendum|referendum]] and passed [[Constitution of Kenya|a new constitution]], which limited presidential powers and devolved the central government.<ref name="BBCKenyaHist" /> Following the passage of the new constitution, Kenya became a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[President of Kenya]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. The new constitution also states that [[executive power]]s are exercised by the executive branch of government, headed by the president, who chairs a cabinet composed of people chosen from outside parliament. [[Legislative power]] is vested exclusively in [[Parliament of Kenya|Parliament]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.
