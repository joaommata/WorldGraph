:"Han Chinese built four commanderies, or local military units, to rule the peninsula as far south as the Han River, with a core area at Lolang (Nangnang in Korean), near present-day P'yongyang.

According to [[Korean mythology]] in 2333 BC, the [[Old Chosŏn|Gojoseon]] Kingdom was established by the god-king [[Dangun]]. Following the end of the Three Kingdoms of Korea into Silla and Balhae in the late 7th century, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the [[Joseon dynasty]] (1392–1897). In 1897, [[Gojong of Korea|King Gojong]] proclaimed the [[Korean Empire]], which was [[Korea under Japanese rule|annexed]] by the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1910.<ref name="Yi 1984 p.">{{cite book | last=Yi | first=Ki-baek | title=A New History of Korea | publisher=Harvard University Press | publication-place=Cambridge | date=1984 | isbn=978-0-674-61576-2 | pages=12, 56}}</ref>

The Sui emperor, Wen Ti, launched a retaliatory attack on Koguryŏ but met with reverses and turned back in mid-course. Yang Ti, the next Sui emperor, proceeded in 612 to mount an invasion of unprecedented magnitude, marshalling a huge force said to number over a million men. And when his armies failed to take Liao-tung Fortress (modern Liao-yang), the anchor of Koguryŏ's first line of defense, he had a nearly a third of his forces, some 300,000 strong, break off the battle there and strike directly at the Koguryŏ capital of P'yŏngyang. But the Sui army was lured into a trap by the famed Koguryŏ commander Ŭlchi Mundŏk, and suffered a calamitous defeat at the Salsu (Ch'ŏngch'ŏn) River.

In 612, Sui troops invaded Korea again, but Koguryŏ forces fought bravely and destroyed Sui troops everywhere. General Ŭlchi Mundŏk of Koguryŏ completely wiped out some 300,000 Sui troops which came across the Yalu River in the battles near the Salsu River (now Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River) with his ingenious military tactics. Only 2,700 Sui troops were able to flee from Korea.

In 676, the unification of the Three Kingdoms by Silla led to the [[Northern and Southern States period]], in which [[Balhae]] controlled the northern parts of Goguryeo, and much of the Korean Peninsula was controlled by [[Unified Silla|Later Silla]]. Relationships between Korea and China remained relatively peaceful during this time. Balhae was founded by a [[Go of Balhae|Goguryeo general]] and formed as a successor state to Goguryeo. During its height, Balhae controlled most of Manchuria and parts of the Russian Far East and was called the "Prosperous Country in the East".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Injae|last2=Miller|first2=Owen|last3=Park|first3=Jinhoon|last4=Yi|first4=Hyun-Hae|title=Korean History in Maps|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-09846-6|pages=64–65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=46OTBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA64|access-date=February 24, 2017|date=December 15, 2014|archive-date=January 24, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230124005648/https://books.google.com/books?id=46OTBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA64|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 19th century, Joseon began experiencing economic difficulties and widespread uprisings, including the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]]. The royal in-law families had gained control of the government, leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state.{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}} In addition, the strict isolationism of the Joseon government that earned it "the [[hermit kingdom]]" became increasing ineffective due to increasing encroachment from powers such as Japan, Russia, and the United States. This is exemplified by the [[Joseon–United States Treaty of 1882]], in which it was compelled to open its borders.

In 1897, King Gojong, the [[List of monarchs of Korea|last king of Korea]], proclaimed Joseon as the [[Korean Empire]]. However, Japan [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905|compelled Korea to become its protectorate]] in 1905 and [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910|formally annexed it]] in 1910.

===Division of Korea===
{{Main|Division of Korea}}
Towards the end of [[World War II]], the U.S. proposed dividing the Korean peninsula into two occupation zones: a [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|U.S. zone]] and a [[Soviet Civil Administration|Soviet zone]]. [[Dean Rusk]] and [[Charles H. Bonesteel III]] suggested the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] as the dividing line, as it placed Seoul under U.S. control. To the Americans' surprise, the Soviets accepted their proposal and agreed to divide Korea at that line.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fry |first1=Michael |title=National Geographic, Korea, and the 38th Parallel |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/130805-korean-war-dmz-armistice-38-parallel-geography |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225074751/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/130805-korean-war-dmz-armistice-38-parallel-geography |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 25, 2021 |publisher=National Geographic |access-date=May 15, 2021 |language=en |date=August 5, 2013}}</ref>

After the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] at the end of World War II in 1945, [[Division of Korea|the Korean Peninsula was divided]] into two occupation zones along the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]], with the northern half of the peninsula [[Soviet Civil Administration|occupied by the Soviet Union]] and the southern half [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|by the United States]]. Negotiations on reunification failed. Soviet general [[Terentii Shtykov]] recommended the establishment of the [[Soviet Civil Administration]] in October 1945, and supported Kim Il Sung as chairman of the [[Provisional People's Committee of North Korea]], established in February 1946. In September 1946, South Korean citizens [[Autumn Uprising of 1946|rose up against the Allied Military Government]]. In April 1948, an [[Jeju uprising|uprising of the Jeju islanders]] was violently crushed. The South declared its statehood in May 1948 and two months later the ardent anti-communist [[Syngman Rhee]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Administrative Population and Divisions Figures (#26)|work=DPRK: The Land of the Morning Calm|publisher=Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use|date=April 2003|url=http://www.pcgn.org.uk/North%20Korea-%20Land%20of%20the%20Morning%20Calm-%202003.pdf|access-date=10 October 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925042059/http://www.pcgn.org.uk/North%20Korea-%20Land%20of%20the%20Morning%20Calm-%202003.pdf|archive-date=25 September 2006}}</ref> became its ruler.

Soviet forces withdrew from the North in 1948, and most American forces withdrew from the South in 1949.

The [[military of North Korea]] invaded the South on 25 June 1950, and swiftly overran most of the country. The [[United Nations Command]] (UNC) was subsequently established following the [[UN Security Council]]'s recognition of North Korean aggression against South Korea.

=== Leadership of Kim Il Sung ===
[[File:Chollima statue 05.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Chollima Statue|Statue]] of [[Chollima Movement]] in Pyongyang]]
The post-war 1950s and 1960s saw an ideological shift in North Korea, as Kim Il Sung sought to consolidate his power. Kim Il Sung was highly critical of Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and his [[de-Stalinization]] policies and critiqued Khrushchev as revisionist.{{sfn|Armstrong|2010|p=9}} During the 1956 [[August Faction Incident]], Kim Il Sung successfully resisted efforts by the Soviet Union and China to depose him in favor of [[Soviet Koreans faction|Soviet Koreans]] or the pro-Chinese [[Yan'an faction]].<ref name=Sino-SovietSplit>Chung, Chin O.

Industry was the favored sector in North Korea. Industrial production returned to pre-war levels by 1957. In 1959, relations with Japan had improved somewhat, and North Korea began allowing the repatriation of Japanese citizens in the country. The same year, North Korea revalued the [[North Korean won]], which held greater value than its South Korean counterpart. Until the 1960s, economic growth was higher than in South Korea, and North Korean GDP per capita was equal to that of its southern neighbor as late as 1976.{{sfn|Country Study|2009|pp=xxxii, 46}} However, by the 1980s, the economy had begun to stagnate; it started its long decline in 1987 and almost completely collapsed after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, when all Soviet aid was suddenly halted.{{Sfn|French|2007|pp=97–99}}

An internal CIA study acknowledged various achievements of the North Korean government post-war: compassionate care for war orphans and children in general, a radical improvement in the status of women, free housing, free healthcare, and health statistics particularly in life expectancy and infant mortality that were comparable to even the most advanced nations up until the [[North Korean famine]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Cumings|first=Bruce|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pe86S4iCz34C|title=North Korea: Another Country|date=2011|publisher=The New Press|isbn=978-1-59558-739-8|page=9}}</ref> Life expectancy in the North was 72 before the famine which was only marginally lower than in the South.<ref name=":3">{{cite book|last=Lankov|first=Andrei| author-link = Andrei Lankov|title=[[The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia]]|date=2013|publisher=OUP US|isbn=978-0-19-996429-1|page=64}}</ref> The country once boasted a comparatively developed healthcare system; pre-famine North Korea had a network of nearly 45,000 family practitioners with some 800 hospitals and 1,000 clinics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Demick|first=Barbara|date=16 July 2010|title=North Korea's giant leap backwards|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/17/north-korea-famine-fears|access-date=21 January 2021|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

The relative peace between the North and South following the armistice was interrupted by border skirmishes, celebrity abductions, and assassination attempts. The North failed in several assassination attempts on South Korean leaders, such as [[Blue House raid|in 1968]], 1974, and the [[Rangoon bombing]] in 1983; tunnels were found under the DMZ and tensions flared over the [[Korean axe murder incident|axe murder incident]] at [[Panmunjom]] in 1976.<ref>Kirkbride, Wayne (1984).

The talks ultimately failed because in 1973, South Korea declared its preference that the two Koreas should seek separate memberships in international organizations.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Bandow |editor1-first=Doug |editor2-last=Carpenter |editor2-first=Ted Galen|title=The U.S.–South Korean Alliance: Time for a Change |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXdhDRCGD1kC&pg=PA99 |year=1992 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick |isbn=978-1-4128-4086-6 |pages=99–100 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913142656/https://books.google.com/books?id=HXdhDRCGD1kC&&pg=PA99 |archive-date=13 September 2016}}</ref>

=== Leadership of Kim Jong Il ===
The Soviet Union was [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] on 26 December 1991, ending its aid and support to North Korea. In 1992, as Kim Il Sung's health began deteriorating, his son Kim Jong Il slowly began taking over various state tasks. Kim Il Sung [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il Sung|died]] of a [[heart attack]] in 1994; Kim Jong Il declared a three-year period of national mourning, afterward officially announcing his position as the new leader.<ref name="edit_CNN-">{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9707/08/north.korea/|title=North Korea ends mourning for Kim Il Sung|last=Chinoy|first=Mike|date=8 July 1997|publisher=CNN|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519004336/https://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9707/08/north.korea/|archive-date=19 May 2015|access-date=9 May 2015}}</ref>

Flooding in the mid-1990s exacerbated the economic crisis, severely damaging crops and infrastructure and leading to [[North Korean famine|widespread famine]] that the government proved incapable of curtailing, resulting in the deaths of between 240,000 and 420,000 people and leading to the flight of many North Koreans into China, South Korea and neighboring countries. In China, these illegal North Korea child immigrants are called the [[Kotjebi]]. In 1996, the government accepted UN food aid.<ref name="Spoorenberg" />

North Korea promised to halt its development of nuclear weapons under the [[Agreed Framework]], signed in 1994. South Korea began to engage with the North as part of its [[Sunshine Policy]].<ref>Kwak, Tae-Hwan; Joo, Seung-Ho (2003). ''The Korean peace process and the four powers''.
