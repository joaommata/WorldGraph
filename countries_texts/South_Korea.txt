According to Korea's [[Civil religion|founding mythology]], the history of Korea begins with the founding of Joseon (also known as "[[Old Chosŏn|Gojoseon]]", or "Old Joseon", to differentiate it from the 14th century dynasty) in 2333 BC by the legendary [[Dangun]].<ref name="koreashistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm |title=Korea's History |publisher=Asian Shravan |access-date=February 17, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128065300/http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm |archive-date=January 28, 2010}}</ref><ref name="DangunGija">*{{cite book|last=Seth|first=Michael J.|title=A History of Korea: From Antiquity to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJtMGXyGlUEC&pg=PA443|year=2010|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-0-7425-6717-7|page=443|access-date=January 1, 2016|archive-date=January 24, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230124005645/https://books.google.com/books?id=WJtMGXyGlUEC&pg=PA443|url-status=live}}

=== Three Kingdoms of Korea ===
During the [[Proto–Three Kingdoms period]], the states of [[Buyeo]], [[Okjeo]], [[Eastern Ye|Dongye]], and [[Samhan]] occupied the whole Korean peninsula and southern Manchuria. From them, the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] emerged: [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], and [[Silla]].

The Sui emperor, Wen Ti, launched a retaliatory attack on Koguryŏ but met with reverses and turned back in mid-course. Yang Ti, the next Sui emperor, proceeded in 612 to mount an invasion of unprecedented magnitude, marshalling a huge force said to number over a million men. And when his armies failed to take Liao-tung Fortress (modern Liao-yang), the anchor of Koguryŏ's first line of defense, he had a nearly a third of his forces, some 300,000 strong, break off the battle there and strike directly at the Koguryŏ capital of P'yŏngyang. But the Sui army was lured into a trap by the famed Koguryŏ commander Ŭlchi Mundŏk, and suffered a calamitous defeat at the Salsu (Ch'ŏngch'ŏn) River. It is said that only 2,700 of the 300,000 Sui soldiers who had crossed the Yalu survived to find their way back, and the Sui emperor now lifted the siege of Liao-tung Fortress and withdrew his forces to China proper.

In 612, Sui troops invaded Korea again, but Koguryŏ forces fought bravely and destroyed Sui troops everywhere. General Ŭlchi Mundŏk of Koguryŏ completely wiped out some 300,000 Sui troops which came across the Yalu River in the battles near the Salsu River (now Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River) with his ingenious military tactics.

In the 19th century, Joseon began experiencing economic difficulties and widespread uprisings, including the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]]. The royal in-law families had gained control of the government, leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state.<ref>{{cite book |last=오 |first=영교 |date=2007 |script-title=ko:세도정권기 조선사회와 대전회통 |publisher=혜안 |isbn=978-8984943131}}</ref> Additionally, the strict isolationism of the Joseon government that earned it the nickname "the [[hermit kingdom]]" became increasingly ineffective due to increasing encroachment from powers such as Japan, Russia, and the United States. This was exemplified by the [[Joseon–United States Treaty of 1882]], which forced Joseon to open its borders.

=== Japanese occupation and World War II ===
{{Main|Korea under Japanese rule}}
In the late 19th century, Japan became a significant regional power after winning the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] against Qing China and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] against the [[Russian Empire]]. In 1897, King Gojong, the [[List of monarchs of Korea|last king of Korea]], proclaimed Joseon as the [[Korean Empire]]. However, Japan [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905|compelled Korea to become its protectorate]] in 1905 and [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910|formally annexed it]] in 1910.

Towards the end of [[World War II]], the U.S. proposed dividing the Korean peninsula into two occupation zones: a [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|U.S. zone]] and a [[Soviet Civil Administration|Soviet zone]]. [[Dean Rusk]] and [[Charles H. Bonesteel III]] suggested the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] as the dividing line, as it placed Seoul under U.S. control.

=== Division of Korea ===
[[File:Ceremony inaugurating the government of the Republic of Korea (colored).jpg|thumb|Ceremony for the inauguration of the South Korean government (August 15, 1948)]]
Despite intentions to liberate a unified peninsula in the [[1943 Cairo Declaration]], escalating tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States led to the [[division of Korea]] into two political entities in 1948: North Korea and South Korea.

In the South, the United States appointed and supported the former head of the Korean Provisional Government [[Syngman Rhee]] as leader. Rhee won the first presidential elections of the newly declared Republic of Korea in May 1948. In the North, the Soviets backed a former anti-Japanese guerrilla and communist activist, [[Kim Il Sung]], who was appointed premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in September.<ref>Malkasian, Carter (2001). ''The Korean War 1950–1953''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn. p. 13. {{ISBN|978-1-57958-364-4}}.</ref>

In October, the Soviet Union declared Kim Il Sung's government as sovereign over both the north and south. The UN declared Rhee's government as "a lawful government having effective control and jurisdiction over that part of Korea where the UN Temporary Commission on Korea was able to observe and consult" and the government "based on elections which was observed by the Temporary Commission" in addition to a statement that "this is the only such government in Korea."<ref name="UN195">[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/043/66/IMG/NR004366.pdf?OpenElement "195 (III) The problem of the independence of Korea"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061108/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/043/66/IMG/NR004366.pdf?OpenElement |date=October 23, 2013 }}, December 12, 1948, ''Resolutions Adopted by the General Assembly During its Third Session'', p. 25.</ref> Both leaders engaged in authoritarian repression of political opponents.<ref>Regarding Syngman Rhee (South Korea):{{bulleted list|{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Gil-sang |title=Korea through the Ages |date=2005 |publisher=Center for Information on Korean Culture, the Academy of Korean Studies |location=Seongnam |pages=166–181}}|{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Hyun-hee |last2=Park |first2=Sung-soo |last3=Yoon |first3=Nae-hyun |title=New History of Korea |date=2005 |publisher=Jimoondang |location=Paju |pages=584–590}}}}Regarding Kim Il-sung (North Korea):{{bulleted list|{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-23749-9 |pages=71–91}}}}</ref> South Korea requested military support from the United States but was denied,<ref>{{cite book |last=Appleman |first=Roy E. |title=South to the Naktong, North to the Yalu |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]] |year=1998 |orig-year=1961 |page=17 |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/korea/20-2-1/toc.htm |isbn=978-0160019180 |archive-date=February 7, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207235336/http://www.history.army.mil/books/korea/20-2-1/toc.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> while North Korea's military was heavily reinforced by the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite book |last=Millett |first=Allan R. |series=The Essential Bibliography Series |title=The Korean War: The Essential Bibliography |year=2007 |publisher=Potomac Books Inc. |location=Dulles, VA |isbn=978-1574889765 |page=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Stuecker|first=William|date=2004|title=Korean War: World History|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|pages=102–103}}</ref>

=== Korean War ===
On June 25, 1950, [[Operation Pokpung|North Korea invaded]] South Korea, sparking the [[Korean War]], the [[Cold War]]'s first major conflict, which continued until 1953. At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the UN, thus forfeiting [[United Nations Security Council veto power|their veto rights]]. This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country. The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of [[People's Volunteer Army|Chinese troops]]. After an ebb and flow that saw both sides facing defeat with massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate. During the war, Rhee's party promoted the [[Ilminism|One-People Principle]], an effort to build an obedient citizenry through ethnic homogeneity and authoritarian appeals to [[nationalism]].<ref name="Hwang93">Su-kyoung Hwang, ''[[Korea's Grievous War]].'' Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2016; pg. 90–95.</ref>

The [[Korean Armistice Agreement|1953 armistice]], never signed by South Korea, split the peninsula along the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|demilitarized zone]] near the original demarcation line. No peace treaty was ever signed, resulting in the two countries remaining technically at war. Approximately 3 million people died in the Korean War, with a higher proportional civilian death toll than [[World War II]] or the [[Vietnam War]], making it one of the deadliest conflicts of the Cold War era.<ref name="Kim p.45">{{cite book|last=Kim|first=Samuel S.|chapter=The Evolving Asian System|title=International Relations of Asia|publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]]|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4422-2641-8|page=45|quote=With three of the four major Cold War fault lines—divided Germany, divided Korea, divided China, and divided Vietnam—East Asia acquired the dubious distinction of having engendered the largest number of armed conflicts resulting in higher fatalities between 1945 and 1994 than any other region or sub-region. Even in Asia, while Central and South Asia produced a regional total of 2.8 million in human fatalities, East Asia's regional total is 10.4 million including the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1 million), the Korean War (3 million), the [[Vietnam War]] (2 million), and the [[Pol Pot]] [[Cambodian genocide|genocide]] in Cambodia (1 to 2 million).}}</ref><ref name="Cumings p. 35">{{cite book|last=Cumings|first=Bruce|author-link=Bruce Cumings|title=The Korean War: A History|publisher=[[Modern Library]]|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8129-7896-4|page=35|quote=Various encyclopedias state that the countries involved in the three-year conflict suffered a total of more than 4 million casualties, of which at least 2 million were civilians—a higher percentage than in World War II or Vietnam.

This was followed by 13 months of political instability as South Korea was led by the weak and ineffectual [[Second Republic of Korea|Second Republic]]. This instability was broken by the [[May 16 coup|May 16, 1961 coup]] led by General [[Park Chung Hee]]. As president, Park oversaw a period of rapid [[Export-oriented industrialization|export-led economic growth]] enforced by [[Political repression in South Korea|political repression]]. Under Park, South Korea [[South Korea in the Vietnam War|took an active role]] in the Vietnam War.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Griffiths |first=James |title=The 'forgotten' My Lai: South Korea's Vietnam War massacres|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/23/asia/south-korea-vietnam-massacre-intl/index.html |date=February 23, 2018 |access-date=March 28, 2024 |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612151022/https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/23/asia/south-korea-vietnam-massacre-intl/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Park was heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a [[Yusin Constitution|new constitution]], which gave the president dictatorial powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms. The [[Economy of South Korea|Korean economy]] developed significantly during Park's tenure, largely due to investment in [[Chaebol|family-run conglomerates]]. The government developed the [[Expressways in South Korea|nationwide expressway system]], the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|Seoul subway system]], and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year tenure, which ended with [[Assassination of Park Chung Hee|his assassination]] in 1979.

The years after Park's assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979, General [[Chun Doo-hwan]] led the [[coup d'état of December Twelfth]]. On May 17, Chun forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to [[Jeju Island]]. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities, and further curtailed the press. Chun's assumption of the presidency through the events of May 17 triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy; these protests were particularly widespread in [[Gwangju]], to which Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the [[Gwangju Uprising|Gwangju Democratization Movement]].<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/752055.stm Flashback: The Kwangju massacre] , May 17, 2000.</ref>

Chun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan. Chun and his government held South Korea under a despotic rule until 1987, when a [[Seoul National University]] student, [[Park Jong-chul]], was tortured to death.<ref>[http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/184219.html "20 years later, father still seeks truth in son's death"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173203/http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/184219.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}, ''The Hankyoreh'', January 15, 2007.

Eventually, Chun's party, the [[Democratic Justice Party]], and its leader, [[Roh Tae-woo]], announced the [[June 29 Declaration]], which promised a democratic election of the president.

=== Democracy ===
Roh Tae-woo went on to win the [[1987 South Korean presidential election|1987 election]] by a narrow margin against the two main opposition leaders, [[Kim Dae-jung]] and [[Kim Young-sam]]. Seoul hosted the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games in 1988]], which was widely regarded as successful and a significant boost for South Korea's global image and economy.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/10/229_12790.html |title=Two Decedes [sic] After Seoul Olympics |date=October 30, 2007 |newspaper=[[The Korea Times]] |access-date=March 12, 2018 |archive-date=October 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025132245/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/10/229_12790.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 702|South Korea was formally invited]] to become a member of the United Nations in 1991. The transition of Korea from autocracy to modern democracy was marked in 1997 by the election of Kim Dae-jung, who was sworn in as the eighth president of South Korea on February 25, 1998. His election was significant given that he had in earlier years been a political prisoner sentenced to death (later commuted to exile).
