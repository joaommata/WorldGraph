There are six periods of human settlement with distinctive behaviours in the region before Islam, which include the [[Hafit period]] from 3,200 to 2,600 BCE, the [[Umm Al Nar culture]] from 2,600 to 2,000 BCE, and the [[Wadi Suq culture]] from 2,000 to 1,300 BCE. From 1,200 BCE to the advent of Islam in Eastern Arabia, through three distinctive [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron Ages]] and the [[Mleiha]] period, the area was variously occupied by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] and other forces, and saw the construction of fortified settlements and extensive husbandry thanks to the development of the [[Qanat|''falaj'']] irrigation system.

===Islam===
The spread of [[Islam]] to the northeastern tip of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] is thought to have followed directly from a letter sent by the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] to the rulers of [[Oman]] in 630 CE. This led to a group of rulers travelling to [[Medina]], converting to Islam, and subsequently driving a successful uprising against the unpopular [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanids]], who dominated the coast at the time.{{sfnp|Heard-Bey|1996|p=127}} Following the death of Muhammad, the new Islamic communities south of the [[Persian Gulf]] threatened to disintegrate, with insurrections against the [[Muslim leaders]]. Caliph [[Abu Bakr]] sent an army from the capital [[Medina]] which completed its reconquest of the territory ([[Ridda wars|the Ridda Wars]]) with the [[Battle of Dibba]] in which 10,000 lives are thought to have been lost.{{sfnp|Heard-Bey|1996|pp=127–128}} This assured the integrity of the [[Caliphate]] and the unification of the Arabian Peninsula under the newly emerging [[Rashidun Caliphate]].

In 637, Julfar (in the area of today's [[Ras Al Khaimah]]) was an important port that was used as a staging post for the Islamic invasion of the [[Sasanian Empire]].<ref name="AbedHellyer2001">{{cite book|author1=Ibrahim Abed|author2=Peter Hellyer|title=United Arab Emirates, a New Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QcMz3zV0qAMC&pg=PA83|year= 2001|isbn=978-1-900724-47-0|pages=83–84|publisher=Trident Press }}</ref> The area of the [[Al Ain]]/[[Buraimi Oasis]] was known as Tu'am and was an important trading post for camel routes between the coast and the Arabian interior.{{sfnp|Heard-Bey|1996|pp=22–23}}

The earliest [[Christianity|Christian]] site in the UAE was first discovered in the 1990s, an extensive monastic complex on what is now known as [[Sir Bani Yas]] Island and which dates back to the seventh century. Thought to be [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] and built in 600 CE, the church appears to have been abandoned peacefully in 750 CE.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/ancient-secrets-of-sir-bani-yas-island-unveiled|title = Ancient secrets of Sir Bani Yas unveiled|last = Thomas|first = Jen|date = 12 December 2012|work = The National|url-status=dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222103357/http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/ancient-secrets-of-sir-bani-yas-island-unveiled|archive-date = 22 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref> It forms a rare physical link to a legacy of Christianity, which is thought to have spread across the peninsula from 50 to 350 CE following trade routes.

The harsh desert environment led to the emergence of the "versatile tribesman", nomadic groups who subsisted due to a variety of economic activities, including animal husbandry, agriculture, and hunting. The seasonal movements of these groups led not only to frequent clashes between groups but also to the establishment of seasonal and semi-seasonal settlements and centres. These formed tribal groupings whose names are still carried by modern Emiratis, including the [[Bani Yas]] and [[Al Nahyan family|Al Bu Falah]] of [[Abu Dhabi]], Al Ain, [[Liwa Oasis|Liwa]], and the west coast; the [[Dhawahir]], Awamir, [[Al Ali (tribe)|Al Ali]], and [[Manasir (tribe)|Manasir]] of the interior; the [[Sharqiyin]] of the east coast; and the [[Al-Qasimi|Qawasim]] to the north.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia|last = Lorimer|first = John|publisher= Government of India|year = 1908|location = Bombay|pages = 1432–1436}}</ref>

With the expansion of European [[colonial empire]]s, [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[British Empire|English]], and [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] forces appeared in the Persian Gulf region. By the 18th century, the Bani Yas confederation was the dominant force in most of the area now known as Abu Dhabi,{{sfnp|Heard-Bey|1996|p=43}}<ref>{{ cite journal | first=Kashf | last=Al Gumma | title=Annals of Oman from Early times to the year 1728 AD | journal= Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal | date= 1874}}</ref><ref>{{ cite book | last=Ibn Ruzaiq | translator= GP Badger | title= History of the Imams and Sayids of Oman | place= London | date= 1871}}</ref> while the Northern [[Al-Qasimi|Al Qawasim]] (Al Qasimi) dominated maritime commerce. The Portuguese maintained an influence over the coastal settlements, building [[Fortification|forts]] in the wake of the bloody 16th-century conquests of coastal communities by [[Afonso de Albuquerque|Albuquerque]] and the Portuguese commanders who followed him – particularly on the east coast at [[Muscat]], [[Sohar]], and [[Khor Fakkan]].{{sfnp|Heard-Bey|1996|p=282}}

British expeditions to protect their Indian trade routes led to campaigns against Ras Al Khaimah and other harbours along the coast, including the [[Persian Gulf campaign of 1809]] and the more successful [[Persian Gulf campaign of 1819|campaign of 1819]]. The following year, Britain and a number of local rulers signed a [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820|maritime truce]], giving rise to the term [[Trucial States]], which came to define the status of the coastal emirates. A further treaty was signed in 1843 and in 1853, the [[Perpetual Maritime Truce]] was agreed. To this was added the 'Exclusive Agreements', signed in 1892, which made the [[Trucial States]] a British protectorate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.na.ae/en/education/historicalperiods/britishprince.aspx|title=British Era|website=National Archives of the United Arab Emirates|archive-date=18 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718144851/http://www.na.ae/en/education/historicalperiods/britishprince.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Under the 1892 treaty, the trucial sheikhs agreed not to dispose of any territory except to the British and not to enter into relationships with any foreign government other than the British without their consent. In return, the British promised to protect the Trucial Coast from all aggression by sea and to help in case of land attack. British maritime policing meant that pearling fleets could operate in relative security. However, the British prohibition of the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] meant an important source of income was lost to some sheikhs and merchants.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/persian-gulf-states/84.htm United Arab Emirates – The Economy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214091633/http://countrystudies.us/persian-gulf-states/84.htm |date=14 December 2010 }}.

In 1869, the Qubaisat tribe settled at [[Khor Al Adaid]] and tried to enlist the support of the Ottomans. Khor Al Adaid was claimed by Abu Dhabi at that time, a claim supported by the British. In 1906, the British Political Resident, [[Percy Cox]], confirmed in writing to the ruler of Abu Dhabi, [[Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan]] ('Zayed the Great'), that Khor Al Adaid belonged to his sheikhdom.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|title=Keepers of the Golden Shore: A History of the United Arab Emirates|year=2016|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-78023-580-6|pages=49–50|url=http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/display.asp?ISB=9781780235806|access-date=19 February 2017|archive-date=20 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220094206/http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/display.asp?ISB=9781780235806|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[Pearl hunting|pearling industry]] thrived, providing both income and employment to the people of the Persian Gulf.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Carter |first=Robert |date=2005 |title=The History and Prehistory of Pearling in the Persian Gulf |journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=139–209 |doi=10.1163/1568520054127149 |jstor=25165089 |issn=0022-4995}}</ref> The [[World War I|First World War]] had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the [[economic depression]] of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the [[cultured pearl]], that wiped out the trade. The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the [[World War II|Second World War]], when the newly independent [[Government of India]] imposed heavy taxation on imported pearls. The decline of pearling resulted in extreme economic hardship in the Trucial States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp |title=UAE History & Traditions: Pearls & pearling |work=UAEinteract |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206103534/http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp |archive-date=6 February 2016 }}</ref>

In 1922, the British government secured undertakings from the rulers of the Trucial States not to sign concessions with foreign companies without their consent. Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC, later to become [[BP|British Petroleum]], or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC.<ref>{{Cite book|title = From Pearls to Oil|last = Heard|first = David|publisher= Motivate|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-86063-311-9|location = UAE|pages = 41–42}}</ref> APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the [[Red Line Agreement]], which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=mid|-deep}} bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of £1 million.

The British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates. The seven [[sheikh]]s of the [[Emirates of the United Arab Emirates|emirates]] then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office. In 1952, they formed the Trucial States Council,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nasibbitar.net/adi_sr/DocumentsArticle4.jpg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803020019/http://nasibbitar.net/adi_sr/DocumentsArticle4.jpg|archive-date=3 August 2008|url-status=usurped|title=Al Khaleej News Paper}}</ref> and appointed [[Adi Bitar|Adi Al Bitar]], Dubai's [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]]'s legal advisor, as secretary general and legal advisor to the council. The council was terminated once the United Arab Emirates was formed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fotw.info/flags/ae_tsc.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011257/https://www.fotw.info/flags/ae_tsc.html |archive-date=29 April 2011 |title=Trucial States Council until 1971 (United Arab Emirates) |publisher=Flags of the World |url-status=live }}{{user-generated inline |date=November 2023}}</ref> The tribal nature of society and the lack of definition of borders between emirates frequently led to disputes, settled either through mediation or, more rarely, force. The [[Trucial Oman Scouts]] was a small military force used by the British to keep the peace.

In 1953, a subsidiary of [[BP]], D'Arcy Exploration Ltd, obtained an offshore concession from the ruler of Abu Dhabi. BP joined with [[Total SE|Compagnie Française des Pétroles]] (later [[Total SE|Total]]) to form operating companies, Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Ltd (ADMA) and Dubai Marine Areas Ltd (DUMA). A number of undersea oil surveys were carried out, including one led by the famous marine explorer [[Jacques Cousteau]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cousteau|first1=Jacques|title=Calypso explores for underwater oil|url=https://www.librarything.com/work/18080895|journal=National Geographic Magazine|date=August 1955|volume=CVIII|issue=2|access-date=19 February 2017|author-link=Jacques Cousteau|archive-date=20 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220093825/https://www.librarything.com/work/18080895|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|title=Calypso in the Arabian Gulf: Jacques Cousteau's Undersea Survey of 1954|journal=Liwa|date=June 2015|volume=7|issue=13|pages=3–28|url=https://www.academia.edu/13056568|access-date=27 November 2016|archive-date=26 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220426051607/https://www.academia.edu/13056568|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1958, a floating platform rig was towed from [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], and positioned over the [[Umm Shaif oil field|Umm Shaif]] pearl bed, in Abu Dhabi waters, where drilling began. In March, it struck oil in the Upper Thamama rock formation. This was the first commercial discovery of the Trucial Coast, leading to the first exports of oil in 1962. ADMA made further offshore discoveries at Zakum and elsewhere, and other companies made commercial finds such as the [[Fateh Oil Field|Fateh oilfield]] off Dubai and the Mubarak field off Sharjah (shared with Iran).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Butt|first1=Gerald|title=Oil and Gas in the UAE|url=https://www.uaeinteract.com/uaeint_misc/pdf/perspectives/11.pdf|website=UAE Interact|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123003948/http://www.uaeinteract.com/uaeint_misc/pdf/perspectives/11.pdf|archive-date=23 November 2015}}</ref>

Meanwhile, onshore exploration was hindered by territorial disputes. In 1955, the [[United Kingdom]] represented Abu Dhabi and Oman in their dispute with Saudi Arabia over the [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Buraimi Oasis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5444.htm|title=United Arab Emirates (06/07)|publisher=US Department of State|access-date=12 February 2016|archive-date=6 June 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606162024/https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5444.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> A 1974 agreement between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia seemed to have settled the Abu Dhabi-Saudi [[Territorial dispute|border dispute]], but this has not been ratified.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Matthew|title=Global Security Watch – Saudi Arabia|year= 2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=978-0-313-38699-2|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dxvFBAAAQBAJ}}</ref> The UAE's border with Oman was ratified in 2008.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/government/historic-uae-oman-accord-involves-272km-of-border-1.119592|title = Historic UAE-Oman accord involves 272&nbsp;km of border|date = 22 July 2008|work = Gulf News|access-date = 19 February 2017|archive-date = 29 November 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141129030925/http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/government/historic-uae-oman-accord-involves-272km-of-border-1.119592|url-status = live}}</ref>

PDTC continued its onshore exploration away from the disputed area, drilling five more bore holes that were also dry. However, on 27 October 1960, the company discovered oil in commercial quantities at the Murban No. 3 well on the coast near Tarif.<ref>{{Cite book|title = From Pearls to Oil|last = Heard|first = David|publisher= Motivate|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-86063-311-9|location = UAE|pages = 413–416}}</ref> In 1962, PDTC became the [[Abu Dhabi Petroleum Company]]. As oil revenues increased, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], undertook a massive construction program, building schools, housing, hospitals, and roads. When Dubai's oil exports commenced in 1969, Sheikh [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], the ruler of Dubai, was able to invest the revenues from the limited reserves found to spark the diversification drive that would create the modern [[global city]] of Dubai.<ref name="bbc.co.uk" />

By 1966, it had become clear that the British government could no longer afford to administer and protect the [[Trucial States]], what is now the United Arab Emirates. British [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) debated the preparedness of the [[Royal Navy]] to defend the [[sheikhdom]]s. On 24 January 1968, British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] announced the government's decision, reaffirmed in March 1971 by Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]], to end the treaty relationships with the seven trucial sheikhdoms. Days after the announcement, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], fearing vulnerability, tried to persuade the British to honour the protection treaties by offering to pay the full costs of keeping the [[British Armed Forces]] in the Emirates. The British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government rejected the offer.<ref>{{cite web |author=Gornall, Jonathan |date=2 December 2011 |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/sun-sets-on-british-empire-as-uae-raises-its-flag#page5 |title=Sun sets on British Empire as UAE raises its flag |work=The National |location=Abu Dhabi |access-date=28 March 2024 |archive-date=29 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629152914/http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/sun-sets-on-british-empire-as-uae-raises-its-flag#page5 |url-status=live }}</ref> After [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Goronwy Roberts, Baron Goronwy-Roberts|Goronwy Roberts]] informed Sheikh Zayed of the news of British withdrawal, the nine Persian Gulf sheikhdoms attempted to form a union of Arab emirates, but by mid-1971 they were still unable to agree on terms of union even though the British treaty relationship was to expire in December of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://guide.theemiratesnetwork.com/basics/history_of_the_emirates.php |title=History the United Arab Emirates (UAE)&nbsp;– TEN Guide |work=Guide.theemiratesnetwork.com |date=11 February 1972 |access-date=23 June 2009 |archive-date=8 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608021436/http://guide.theemiratesnetwork.com/basics/history_of_the_emirates.php |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Fears of vulnerability were realised the day before independence. An Iranian destroyer group broke formation from an exercise in the lower Gulf, sailing to the [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs|Tunb islands]]. The islands were [[Seizure of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs|taken by force]], civilians and Arab defenders alike allowed to flee. A British warship stood idle during the course of the invasion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tonb |title=Tonb Islands (Greater and Lesser), two tiny islands of arguable strategic importance in the eastern Persian Gulf, south of the western tip of Qešm island |last1=Mirfendereski |first1=Guive |date=25 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704222708/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tonb |archive-date=4 July 2015 }}</ref> A destroyer group approached the island of [[Abu Musa]] as well.
