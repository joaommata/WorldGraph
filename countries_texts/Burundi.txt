{{Main|History of Burundi|Ruanda-Urundi}}
Burundi is one of the few countries in Africa, along with its neighbour Rwanda among others (such as [[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], and [[Eswatini]]), to be a direct territorial continuation of a pre-colonial era African state. The early history of Burundi, and especially the role and nature of the country's three dominant ethnic groups, the Twa, Hutu and Tutsi, is highly debated amongst academics.<ref>Uvin, Peter. 1999. "Ethnicity and Power in Burundi and Rwanda: Different Paths to Mass Violence" in Comparative Politics, Vol. 31, No. 3 (Apr. 1999), pp. 253–272 Published by: Comparative Politics, Ph.D. Programs in Political Science, City University of New York.

===Kingdom of Burundi===
{{Main|Kingdom of Burundi}}
The first evidence of the Burundian state dates back to the late 16th century where it emerged on the eastern foothills. Over the following centuries it expanded, annexing smaller neighbours. The Kingdom of Burundi or Urundi, in the Great Lakes region was a polity ruled by a traditional monarch with several princes beneath him; succession struggles were common.<ref name="KB">"Kingdom of Burundi". Encyclopædia Britannica (Online ed.). Retrieved 15 October 2016.</ref> The king, known as the ''mwami'' (translated as ruler) headed a princely aristocracy (''ganwa'') which owned most of the land and required a tribute, or tax, from local farmers (mainly Hutu) and herders (mainly Tutsi). The Kingdom of Burundi was characterised by a hierarchical political authority and tributary economic exchange.<ref>VANDEGINSTE, S., Stones left unturned: law and transitional justice in Burundi, Antwerp-Oxford-Portland, Intersentia, 2010, p 17.</ref>

In the mid-18th century, the Tutsi royalty consolidated authority over land, production, and distribution with the development of the ubugabire—a patron-client relationship in which the populace received royal protection in exchange for tribute and land tenure. By this time, the royal court was made up of the Tutsi-Banyaruguru. They had higher social status than other pastoralists such as the Tutsi-Hima. In the lower levels of this society were generally Hutu people, and at the very bottom of the pyramid were the Twa. The system had some fluidity, however. Some Hutu people belonged to the nobility and in this way also had a say in the functioning of the state.<ref>R. O. Collins & J. M. Burns. 2007. A History of Sub-Saharan Africa, Cambridge University Press. Page 125.</ref>

The classification of Hutu or Tutsi was not merely based on ethnic criteria alone. Hutu farmers that managed to acquire wealth and livestock were regularly granted the higher social status of Tutsi, some even made it to become close advisors of the ''Ganwa''. On the other hand, there are also reports of Tutsi that lost all their cattle and subsequently lost their higher status and were called Hutu. Thus, the distinction between Hutu and Tutsi was also a socio-cultural concept, instead of a purely ethnic one.<ref>Chrétien, Jean-Pierre (2003).

===Rule by Germany and Belgium===
{{Main|German East Africa|Ruanda-Urundi}}
From 1884, the [[German East Africa Company]] was active in the African Great Lakes region. As a result of heightened tensions and border disputes between the German East Africa Company, the [[British Empire]] and the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]], the [[German Empire]] was called upon to put down the [[Abushiri revolt]]s and protect the empire's interests in the region. The German East Africa Company transferred its rights to the German Empire in 1891, in this way establishing the German colony of [[German East Africa]], which included Burundi (Urundi), Rwanda (Ruanda), and the mainland part of [[Tanzania]] (formerly known as [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]]).<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/German-East-Africa|title=German East Africa {{!}} former German dependency, Africa |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=16 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902012730/https://www.britannica.com/place/German-East-Africa|archive-date=2 September 2017|url-status=live |quote=In archived text: German East Africa, German Deutsch-Ostafrika, former dependency of imperial Germany, corresponding to present-day Rwanda and Burundi, the continental portion of Tanzania, and a small section of Mozambique. Penetration of the area was begun in 1884 by German commercial agents, and German claims were recognized by the other European powers in the period 1885–94. In 1891 the German imperial government took over administration of the area from the German East Africa Company. Although its subjugation was not completed until 1907, the colony experienced considerable economic development before World War I. During the war it was occupied by the British, who received a mandate to administer the greater part of it (Tanganyika Territory) by the Treaty of Versailles (signed June 1919; enacted January 1920). A smaller portion (Ruanda-Urundi) was entrusted to Belgium.}}</ref> The German Empire stationed armed forces in Rwanda and Burundi during the late 1880s.

During the [[World War I|First World War]], the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]] greatly affected the African Great Lakes region. The [[Belgian Congo|Belgian]] and [[British Empire|British]] colonial forces of the [[Allies of World War I|allied powers]] launched a [[Tabora offensive|coordinated attack]] on the German colony. The German army stationed in Burundi was forced to retreat by the numerical superiority of the Belgian army and by 17 June 1916, Burundi and Rwanda were occupied. The [[Force Publique]] and the British [[Lake Force]] then started a thrust to capture [[Tabora]], an administrative centre of central German East Africa. After the war, as outlined in the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Germany was forced to cede "control" of the Western section of the former German East Africa to Belgium.<ref name="state"/><ref>Strachan, H.

On 20 October 1924, [[Ruanda-Urundi]], which consisted of modern-day Rwanda and Burundi, became a Belgian [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandate territory]], with [[Bujumbura|Usumbura]] as its capital. In practical terms it was considered part of the [[Belgian colonial empire]].

The Belgians, however, preserved many of the kingdom's institutions; the Burundian monarchy succeeded in surviving into the post-colonial period.<ref name="KB" /> Following the [[Second World War]], Ruanda-Urundi was classified as a [[United Nations Trust Territory]] under Belgian administrative authority.<ref name="cia"/> During the 1940s, a series of policies caused divisions throughout the country. On 4 October 1943, powers were split in the legislative division of Burundi's government between chiefdoms and lower chiefdoms. Chiefdoms were in charge of land, and lower sub-chiefdoms were established. Native authorities also had powers.<ref name="wein5"/> In 1948, Belgium allowed the region to form [[political parties]].<ref name="state"/> These factions contributed to Burundi gaining its independence from Belgium, on 1 July 1962.

In 1963, King Mwambutsa appointed a Hutu prime minister, [[Pierre Ngendandumwe]], but he was assassinated on 15 January 1965 by a Rwandan Tutsi employed by the US Embassy.

King Mwambutsa, who had fled the country during the October coup of 1965, was deposed by a [[July 1966 Burundian coup d'état|coup in July 1966]] and his teenage son, [[Ntare V of Burundi|Prince Ntare V]], claimed the throne. In November that same year, the Tutsi Prime Minister, then-Captain Michel Micombero, carried out another [[November 1966 Burundian coup d'état|coup]], this time deposing Ntare, abolishing the monarchy and declaring the nation a [[republic]], though his one-party government was effectively a [[military dictatorship]].<ref name="state"/> As president, Micombero became an advocate of [[African socialism]] and received support from the People's Republic of China.

===Civil war and genocides===
{{Further|Burundian genocide (1972)|Burundian genocide (1993)}}

In late April 1972, two events led to the outbreak of the [[Burundian genocide (1972)|First Burundian Genocide]]. On 27 April 1972, a rebellion led by [[Hutu]] members of the [[gendarmerie]] broke out in the lakeside towns of [[Rumonge]] and [[Nyanza-Lac]] and the rebels declared the short-lived [[Martyazo Republic]].<ref>[[#Lemarchand1996|Lemarchand (1996)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=T8W6RfqiYf0C&pg=PA89 p. 89] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240518174520/https://books.google.com/books?id=T8W6RfqiYf0C&pg=PA89#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=18 May 2024 }}</ref><ref>Lemarchand, (2008).

Following the civil war and genocide, Micombero became mentally distraught and withdrawn. In 1976, Colonel [[Jean-Baptiste Bagaza]], a Tutsi, led a [[1976 Burundian coup d'état|bloodless coup]] to topple Micombero and set about promoting reform. His administration drafted a new constitution in 1981, which maintained Burundi's status as a [[one-party state]].<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/> In August 1984, Bagaza was elected head of state. During his tenure, Bagaza suppressed political opponents and religious freedoms.

Major [[Pierre Buyoya]], a Tutsi, [[1987 Burundian coup d'état|overthrew Bagaza in 1987]], suspended the constitution and dissolved political parties. He reinstated military rule by a Military Committee for National Salvation (CSMN).<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/> Anti-Tutsi ethnic propaganda disseminated by the remnants of the 1972 UBU, which had re-organized as PALIPEHUTU in 1981, led to [[1988 ethnic violence in Burundi|killings of Tutsi peasants]] in the northern communes of [[Ntega]] and [[Marangara]] in August 1988. The government put the death toll at 5,000,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} some international NGOs{{who|date=January 2024}} believed this understated the deaths.

The new regime did not unleash the harsh reprisals of 1972. Its effort to gain public trust was eroded when it decreed an [[amnesty]] for those who had called for, carried out, and taken credit for the killings. Analysts have called this period the beginning of the "culture of impunity." Other analysts put the origins of the "culture of impunity" earlier, in 1965 and 1972, when a small number of identifiable Hutus unleashed massive killings of Tutsis.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In the aftermath of the killings, a group of Hutu intellectuals wrote an open letter to [[Pierre Buyoya]], asking for more representation of the Hutu in the administration. They were arrested and jailed. A few weeks later, Buyoya appointed a new government, with an equal number of Hutu and Tutsi ministers. He appointed [[Adrien Sibomana]] (Hutu) as Prime Minister. Buyoya also created a commission to address issues of national unity.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/> In 1992, the government created a new constitution that provided for a multi-party system,<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/> but a [[civil war]] broke out.

An estimated total of 250,000 people died in Burundi from the various conflicts between 1962 and 1993.<ref>

===First attempt at democracy and war between Tutsi National Army and Hutu population===
In June 1993, [[Melchior Ndadaye]], leader of the Hutu-dominated [[Front for Democracy in Burundi]] (FRODEBU), won the first democratic election. He became the first Hutu head of state, leading a pro-Hutu government. Though he attempted to smooth the country's bitter ethnic divide, his reforms antagonised soldiers in the Tutsi-dominated army, and he was assassinated amidst a failed military coup in October 1993, after only three months in office. The ensuing [[Burundian Civil War]] (1993–2005) saw persistent violence between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi majority army. It is estimated that some 300,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the years following the assassination.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1068873.stm Country profile Burundi] BBC. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007175839/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1068873.stm |date=7 October 2011 }}.

In early 1994, the parliament elected [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]] (Hutu) to the office of president. He and [[Juvénal Habyarimana]], the president of Rwanda, both Hutus, died together [[Assassination of Habyarimana and Ntaryamira|when their airplane was shot down]] in April 1994. More refugees started fleeing to Rwanda. Speaker of Parliament, [[Sylvestre Ntibantunganya]] (Hutu), was appointed as president in October 1994. A coalition government involving 12 of the 13 parties was formed. A feared general massacre was averted, but violence broke out. A number of Hutu refugees in Bujumbura,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} the then-capital, were killed. The mainly Tutsi Union for National Progress withdrew from the government and parliament.

In 1996, [[Pierre Buyoya]] (Tutsi) again took power through a [[1996 Burundian coup d'état|coup d'état]]. He suspended the constitution and was sworn in as president in 1998. This was the start of his second term as president, after his first term from 1987 to 1993. In response to rebel attacks, the government forced much of the population to move to [[refugee camp]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}} Under Buyoya's rule, long peace talks started, mediated by [[South Africa]]. Both parties signed agreements in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Pretoria]], South Africa, to share power in Burundi. The agreements took four years to plan.

On 28 August 2000, a transitional government for Burundi was planned as a part of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement. The transitional government was placed on a trial basis for five years. After several aborted cease-fires, a 2001 peace plan and power-sharing agreement has been relatively successful.

===Peace agreements===
African leaders began a series of peace talks between the warring factions following a request by the United Nations Secretary General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] for them to intervene in the humanitarian crisis. Talks were initiated under the aegis of former Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] in 1995; following his death, South African President [[Nelson Mandela]] took the helm. As the talks progressed, South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]] and United States President [[Bill Clinton]] also lent their respective weight.

The main objective was to transform the Burundian government and military structurally in order to bridge the ethnic gap between the Tutsi and Hutu. It was to take place in two major steps. First, a transitional power-sharing government would be established, with the presidents holding office for three-year terms. The second objective involved a restructuring of the armed forces, where the two groups would be represented equally.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Raffoul |first=Alexandre |date=2019 |title=Tackling the power-sharing dilemma? The role of mediation |url=https://www.swisspeace.ch/assets/publications/downloads/Reports/7df2350452/Power-sharing-and-mediation.pdf |journal=Swisspeace |pages=1–59 |access-date=3 January 2024 |archive-date=3 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240103114137/https://www.swisspeace.ch/assets/publications/downloads/Reports/7df2350452/Power-sharing-and-mediation.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

As the protracted nature of the peace talks demonstrated, the mediators and negotiating parties confronted several obstacles. First, the Burundian officials perceived the goals as "unrealistic" and viewed the treaty as ambiguous, contradictory and confusing. Second, and perhaps most importantly, the Burundians believed the treaty would be irrelevant without an accompanying cease fire. This would require separate and direct talks with the rebel groups. The main Hutu party was skeptical of the offer of a power-sharing government; they alleged that they had been deceived by the Tutsi in past agreements.

In 2000,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/jan-van-eck-peace-mediator-in-burundi/|title=Jan van Eck – peace mediator in Burundi|date=7 August 2000|website=Radio Netherlands Archives|language=en-GB|access-date=4 July 2019|archive-date=19 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201019153223/https://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/jan-van-eck-peace-mediator-in-burundi/|url-status=live}}</ref> the Burundian President signed the treaty, as well as 13 of the 19 warring Hutu and Tutsi factions. Disagreements persisted over which group would preside over the nascent government, and when the ceasefire would begin. The spoilers of the peace talks were the hardliner Tutsi and Hutu groups who refused to sign the accord; as a result, violence intensified. Three years later at a summit of African leaders in Tanzania, the Burundian president and the main opposition Hutu group signed an accord to end the conflict; the signatory members were granted ministerial posts within the government. However, smaller militant Hutu groups – such as the Forces for National Liberation – remained active.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ndayiragije |first=Alexandre W.

Between 1993 and 2003, many rounds of peace talks, overseen by regional leaders in Tanzania, South Africa and [[Uganda]], gradually established power-sharing agreements to satisfy the majority of the contending groups. Initially the South African Protection Support Detachment was deployed to protect Burundian leaders returning from exile. These forces became part of the [[African Union Mission in Burundi|African Union Mission to Burundi]], deployed to help oversee the installation of a transitional government. In June 2004, the UN stepped in and took over peacekeeping responsibilities as a signal of growing international support for the already markedly advanced peace process in Burundi.<ref name="Howard, Lise Morje 2008">Howard, Lise Morje (2008). UN Peacekeeping in Civil Wars. New York: Cambridge University Press.</ref>

The mission's mandate, under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]], has been to monitor cease-fire, carry out disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former military personnel, support humanitarian assistance and refugee and IDP return, assist with elections, protect international staff and Burundian civilians, monitor Burundi's troublesome borders, including halting illicit arms flows, and assist in carrying out institutional reforms including those of the Constitution, judiciary, armed forces and police. The mission has been allotted 5,650 military personnel, 120 civilian police and about 1,000 international and local civilian personnel. The mission has been functioning well. It has greatly benefited from the transitional government, which has functioned and is in the process of transitioning to one that will be popularly elected.<ref name="Howard, Lise Morje 2008"/>

The main difficulty in the early stages was continued resistance to the peace process by the last Hutu nationalist rebel group. This organisation continued its violent conflict on the outskirts of the capital despite the UN's presence. By June 2005, the group had stopped fighting and its representatives were brought back into the political process. All political parties have accepted a formula for inter-ethnic power-sharing: no political party can gain access to government offices unless it is ethnically integrated.<ref name="Howard, Lise Morje 2008"/>

The focus of the UN's mission had been to enshrine the power-sharing arrangements in a popularly voted constitution, so that elections may be held and a new government installed. Disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration were done in tandem with elections preparations. In February 2005, the [[Constitution of Burundi|constitution]] was approved with over 90% of the popular vote. In May, June and August 2005, three separate elections were also held at the local level for the Parliament and the presidency.

While there are still some difficulties with refugee returns and securing adequate food supplies for the war-weary population, the mission managed to win the trust and confidence of a majority of the formerly warring leaders, as well as the population at large.<ref name="Howard, Lise Morje 2008" /> It was involved with several "quick effect" projects, including rehabilitating and building schools, orphanages, health clinics and rebuilding infrastructure such as water lines.

The  2005 Constitution formalised a complex power-sharing architecture that has been described as "associational" in its logic, as it aims to provide guarantees of representation for the Tutsi minority without entrenching the ethnic cleavage at the centre of Burundian politics.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Raffoul |first=Alexandre W. |date=2020-01-01 |title=The Politics of Association: Power-Sharing and the Depoliticization of Ethnicity in Post-War Burundi |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17449057.2018.1519933 |journal=Ethnopolitics |language=en |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1080/17449057.2018.1519933 |s2cid=149937031 |issn=1744-9057 |url-access=subscription |access-date=3 January 2024 |archive-date=3 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240103114135/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17449057.2018.1519933 |url-status=live}}</ref> This institutional design provides an original contribution from Burundian negotiators and constitution makers to institutional options to manage ethnic conflict.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}

However, the terms of the September 2006 Ceasefire between the government and the last remaining armed opposition group, the [[National Liberation Front (Burundi)|FLN]] (Forces for National Liberation, also called NLF or FROLINA), were not totally implemented, and senior FLN members subsequently left the truce monitoring team, claiming that their security was threatened.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://report2008.amnesty.org/eng/regions/africa/burundi |title=Burundi |access-date=4 March 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513054914/http://report2008.amnesty.org/eng/regions/africa/burundi |archive-date=13 May 2009}}.

The 2007 report<ref name="hrw.org"/> of [[Amnesty International]] mentions many areas where improvement is required. Civilians are victims of repeated acts of violence done by the FLN. The latter also recruits child soldiers. The rate of violence against women is high. Perpetrators regularly escape prosecution and punishment by the state. There is an urgent need for reform of the judicial system. [[Genocide]], [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] continued to go unpunished.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

In late March 2008, the FLN sought for the parliament to adopt a law guaranteeing them 'provisional immunity' from arrest. This would cover ordinary crimes, but not grave violations of international humanitarian law like war crimes or crimes against humanity .<ref name="hrw.org"/> Even though the government has granted this in the past to people, the FLN has been unable to obtain the provisional immunity.

On 17 April 2008, the FLN bombarded Bujumbura. The Burundian army fought back and the FLN suffered heavy losses. A new ceasefire was signed on 26 May 2008. In August 2008, President Nkurunziza met with the FLN leader [[Agathon Rwasa]], with the mediation of [[Charles Nqakula]], South Africa's Minister for Safety and Security. This was the first direct meeting since June 2007. Both agreed to meet twice a week to establish a commission to resolve any disputes that might arise during the peace negotiations.<ref>[http://www.pbcupdate.org/?p=114#more-114 Peace Building Commission Update, A project of the Institute for Global Policy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819200320/http://www.pbcupdate.org/?p=114#more-114 |date=19 August 2017 }}, 2008</ref>

The UN has attempted to evaluate the impact of its peace-building initiatives. In the early 2010s, the UN peacekeeping mission in Burundi sought to assess the success of its Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration program by counting the number of arms that had been collected, given the prevalence of arms in the country. However, these evaluations failed to include data from local populations, which are significant in impact evaluations of peacebuilding initiatives.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Autesserre|first1=Séverine|url=https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780197530351.001.0001/oso-9780197530351|title=The Frontlines of Peace: An Insider's Guide to Changing the World|last2=Gbowee|first2=Leymah|date=2021-05-03|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-753035-1|edition=1|language=en|doi=10.1093/oso/9780197530351.001.0001|access-date=4 November 2021|archive-date=4 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211104172256/https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780197530351.001.0001/oso-9780197530351|url-status=live}}</ref>
