The rock art in the [[Sahara]] suggests that northern Mali has been inhabited since 10,000 BC, when the Sahara was fertile and rich in wildlife. Early ceramics have been discovered at the central Malian site of Ounjougou dating to about 9,400 BC, and are believed to represent an instance of the independent invention of pottery in the region.<ref>Eric Huysecom, M. Rasse, L. Lespez, K. Neumann, A. Fahmy, A. Ballouche, S. Ozainne, M. Maggetti, Ch. Tribolo, S.

In the first millennium BC, early cities and towns were created by Mande peoples related to the [[Soninke people]], along the middle Niger River in central Mali, including [[Dia, Mali|Dia]] which began from around 900 BC, and reached its peak around 600 BC,<ref name="Arazi">{{cite web |last1=Arazi |first1=Noemie |title=Tracing History in Dia, in the Inland Niger Delta of Mali -Archaeology, Oral Traditions and Written Sources |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1444342/1/U591645.pdf |website=University College London |publisher=Institute of Archaeology |access-date=4 November 2021 |archive-date=13 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220213144217/http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1444342/1/U591645.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[Djenne-Djenno]], which lasted from around 300 BC to 900 AD. Through approximately 6th century BC and 4th century BC, the lucrative trans-Saharan trade in pack-animals, gold, salt and slaves had begun, facilitating the rise of West Africa's great empires.

There are a few references to Mali in early Islamic literature. Among these are references to "Pene" and "Malal" in the work of [[al-Bakri]] in 1068,<ref>al-Bakri in Nehemiah Levtzion and J. F. Pl Hopkins, eds and trans., ''Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History'' (New York and London: Cambridge University Press, 1981, reprint edn Princeton, New Jersey,: Marcus Wiener, 2000), pp. 82–83.</ref> the story of the conversion of an early ruler, known to [[Ibn Khaldun]] (by 1397) as Barmandana,<ref>ibn Khaldun in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds, and transl. ''Corpus'', p. 333.</ref> and a few geographical details in the work of [[al-Idrisi]].<ref>al-Idrisi in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and transl, ''Corpus'', p. 108.</ref>

Mali was once part of three famed West African empires which controlled [[trans-Saharan trade]] in gold, salt, other precious commodities, and [[slaves]] majorly during the reign of [[Mansa Musa]] from c. 1312 – c. 1337.<ref name=p1>[[#Prof|Mali country profile]], p. 1.</ref> These [[Sahelian kingdom]]s had neither rigid geopolitical boundaries nor rigid ethnic identities.<ref name=p1/> The earliest of these empires was the [[Ghana Empire]], which was dominated by the [[Soninke people|Soninke]], a [[Mande languages|Mande]]-speaking people.<ref name=p1/> The empire expanded throughout West Africa from the eighth century until 1078, when it was conquered by the [[Almoravids]].<ref name=p2>[[#Prof|Mali country profile]]. Mali was later responsible for the collapse of Islamic Slave Army from the North. The defeat of Tukuror Slave Army, was repeated by Mali against the France and Spanish Expeditionary Army in the 1800s ("Blanc et memoires"). p. 2.</ref>

The [[Battle of Kirina]] in 1235, culminated in a victory for the [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] under the command of the exiled prince [[Sundiata Keita]], which led to the downfall of the [[Sosso Empire]].

The [[Mali Empire]] later formed on the upper [[Niger River]], and reached the height of power in the 14th century.<ref name=p2/> Under the Mali Empire, the ancient cities of [[Djenné]] and [[Timbuktu]] were centers of both trade and Islamic learning.<ref name=p2/> The empire later declined as a result of internal intrigue, ultimately being supplanted by the [[Songhai Empire]].<ref name=p2/> The Songhai had long been a major power in West Africa subject to the Mali Empire's rule.<ref name=p2/>

In the late 14th century, the Songhai gradually gained independence from the Mali Empire and expanded, ultimately subsuming the entire eastern portion of the Mali Empire.<ref name=p2/> The Songhai Empire's eventual collapse was largely the result of the [[Saadian invasion of the Songhai Empire|Moroccan invasion]] of 1591 under the command of [[Judar Pasha]].<ref name=p2/> The fall of the Songhai Empire marked the end of the region's role as a trading crossroads.<ref name=p2/> Following the [[European exploration of Africa|establishment of sea routes by the European powers]], the trans-Saharan trade routes lost significance.<ref name="p2" /> At that time, the Mali Empire's abundance in wealth expanded its commercial assets of [[salt]] and [[gold]].

One of the worst [[famine]]s in the region's recorded history occurred in the 18th century. According to [[John Iliffe (historian)|John Iliffe]], "The worst crises were in the 1680s, when famine extended from the Senegambian coast to the Upper Nile and 'many sold themselves for slaves, only to get a sustenance', and especially in 1738–1756, when West Africa's greatest recorded subsistence crisis, due to drought and locusts, reportedly killed half the population of [[Timbuktu]]."<ref>[[John Iliffe (historian)|John Iliffe]] (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bNGN2URP_rUC ''Africans: the history of a continent''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906225011/https://books.google.com/books?id=bNGN2URP_rUC&pg=&dq&hl=en |date=6 September 2015 }}.

Mali fell under the control of France during the [[Scramble for Africa]] in the late 19th century.<ref name=p2/> By 1905, most of the area was under firm French control as a part of [[French Sudan]].<ref name=p2/> 

In November 1915, a large [[Volta-Bani War|anti-French uprising]] broke out among the tribes in the regions of present-day Mali and Burkina Faso.<ref>[http://www.cairn.info/revue-autrepart-2003-2-page-35.htm#no3 La guerre coloniale du Bani-Volta, 1915-1916 (Burkina Faso, Mali)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029121219/http://www.cairn.info/revue-autrepart-2003-2-page-35.htm#no3 |date=29 October 2017 }}, Autrepart, 2003.</ref> The last resistance was suppressed only in September 1916.

On 24 November 1958, French Sudan (which changed its name to the Sudanese Republic) became an autonomous republic within the [[French Community]].<ref name="Independent Mali">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Mali/Independent-Mali|title=Independent Mali|publisher=Britannica |date=1946|access-date=21 January 2021|archive-date=19 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201119042637/https://www.britannica.com/place/Mali/Independent-Mali|url-status=live}}</ref> In January 1959, Mali and [[Senegal]] united to become the [[Mali Federation]].<ref name="Independent Mali"/>

=== Independence ===
The Mali Federation gained independence from France on 20 June 1960.<ref name=p2/> Senegal withdrew from the federation in August 1960, which allowed the Sudanese Republic to become the independent Republic of Mali on 22 September 1960, and that date is now the country's [[List of national independence days|Independence Day]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://maliembassy.us/index.php/2012-02-27-16-59-35/public-holidays |title=Public Holidays |website=Embassy of the Republic of Mali to the United States |access-date=20 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920234345/http://maliembassy.us/index.php/2012-02-27-16-59-35/public-holidays |archive-date=20 September 2018 }}</ref>

[[Modibo Keïta]] was elected the first president.<ref name=p2/> He quickly established a one-party state, adopted an independent African and socialist orientation with close ties to the East, and implemented extensive nationalization of economic resources.<ref name=p2/> In 1960, the population of Mali was reported to be about 4.1&nbsp;million.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130530011412/http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/897ce24a48d43c82802565f700407640 Core document forming part of the reports of states parties: Mali].

=== Moussa Traoré regime ===
The subsequent military-led regime, with Traoré as president, attempted to reform the economy. His efforts were frustrated by political turmoil and a devastating [[Sahel drought|drought]] from 1968 to 1974,<ref name=p3/> in which famine killed thousands of people.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4132326.stm Mali's nomads face famine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224054313/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4132326.stm |date=24 February 2021 }}".

The Traoré regime repressed all dissenters until the late 1980s.<ref name=p3/>

[[File:Place de la liberté - Bamako.jpg|thumb|WWI Commemorative Monument to the "Armée Noire"]]

Opposition to the corrupt and dictatorial regime of General Moussa Traoré grew during the 1980s. During this time strict programs, imposed to satisfy demands of the International Monetary Fund, brought increased hardship upon the country's population, while elites close to the government supposedly lived in growing wealth. The government continued to attempt economic reforms, and the populace became increasingly dissatisfied.<ref name=p3/> In response to growing demands for multi-party democracy, the Traoré regime allowed some limited political liberalization in the late 1980s, but refused to usher in a full-fledged democratic system.<ref name=p3/> 

In 1990, cohesive opposition movements began to emerge, and was complicated by the turbulent rise of ethnic violence in the north following the return of many [[Tuareg people|Tuaregs]] who had migrated to [[Algeria]] and [[Libya]] during the drought.<ref name=p3/> Peaceful student protests in January 1991 were brutally suppressed, with mass arrests and torture of leaders and participants.<ref name="nonviolent">{{cite web|url=http://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/index.php/movements-and-campaigns/movements-and-campaigns-summaries?sobi2Task%3Dsobi2Details%26catid%3D34%26sobi2Id%3D10 |title=Nonviolent Conflict Summaries |access-date=1 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616222251/http://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/index.php/movements-and-campaigns/movements-and-campaigns-summaries?sobi2Task=sobi2Details&catid=34&sobi2Id=10 |archive-date=16 June 2011}} Mali March 1991 Revolution</ref> Scattered acts of rioting and vandalism of public buildings followed, but most actions by the dissidents remained nonviolent.<ref name="nonviolent" />

From 22 March through 26 March 1991, mass pro-democracy rallies and a nationwide strike was held in both urban and rural communities, which became known as ''les évenements'' ("the events") or the March Revolution. In Bamako, in response to mass demonstrations organized by university students and later joined by trade unionists and others, soldiers opened fire indiscriminately on the nonviolent demonstrators. Riots broke out briefly following the shootings. Barricades as well as roadblocks were erected and Traoré declared a state of emergency and imposed a nightly curfew. Despite an estimated loss of 300 lives over the course of four days, nonviolent protesters continued to return to Bamako each day demanding the resignation of the dictatorial president and the implementation of democratic policies.<ref name="nesbitt">{{cite web|last=Nesbitt |first=Katherine |title=Mali's March Revolution (1991) |url=http://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/index.php/movements-and-campaigns/movements-and-campaigns-summaries?sobi2Task=sobi2Details&catid=34&sobi2Id=10 |publisher=International Center on Nonviolent Conflict |access-date=1 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616222251/http://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/index.php/movements-and-campaigns/movements-and-campaigns-summaries?sobi2Task=sobi2Details&catid=34&sobi2Id=10 |archive-date=16 June 2011}}</ref>

26 March 1991 is the day that marks the clash between military soldiers and peaceful demonstrating students which climaxed in the massacre of dozens under the orders of Traoré. He and three associates were later tried and convicted and received the death sentence for their part in the decision-making of that day. Nowadays, the day is a national holiday in order to remember the tragic events and the people who were killed.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bussa |first=Edward |title=Mali's March to Democracy |url=http://www.threadster.com/2009/03/mali-march-to-democracy/ |website=Threadster.com |access-date=1 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235624/http://www.threadster.com/2009/03/mali-march-to-democracy/ |archive-date=24 March 2012 |date=26 March 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Mohsin |first=Haroon |date=18 August 2022 |title=Martyr's Day in Mali |url=https://nationaltoday.com/martyrs-day-in-mali/ |access-date=16 September 2023 |website=National Today |language=en-US |archive-date=17 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231017204906/https://nationaltoday.com/martyrs-day-in-mali/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The coup is remembered as Mali's [[1991 Malian coup d'état|March Revolution of 1991]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Turrittin |first=Jane |date=1991 |title=Mali: People Topple Traoré |journal=Review of African Political Economy |volume=18 |issue=52 |pages=97–103 |doi=10.1080/03056249108703927 |jstor=4005962 |issn=0305-6244 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

By 26 March, the growing refusal of soldiers to fire into the largely nonviolent protesting crowds turned into a full-scale tumult, and resulted in thousands of soldiers putting down their arms and joining the pro-democracy movement.{{cn|date=June 2025}} That afternoon, Lieutenant Colonel [[Amadou Toumani Touré]] announced on the radio that he had arrested the dictatorial president, Moussa Traoré. 

=== Multi-party democracy ===
Opposition parties were legalized, a transitional government was formed and a national congress of civil and political groups met to draft a [[Constitution of Mali|new democratic constitution]] to be approved by a national referendum.<ref name="nesbitt"/><ref name=p3/> In 1992, [[Alpha Oumar Konaré]] won Mali's first democratic, multi-party presidential election, before being re-elected for a second term in 1997, which was the last allowed under the constitution. [[Amadou Toumani Touré]], a retired general who had been the leader of the military aspect of the 1991 democratic uprising, was elected in 2002.<ref name=p4>[[#Prof|Mali country profile]], p. 4.</ref> During this democratic period Mali was regarded as one of the most politically and socially stable countries in Africa.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101111133055/http://www.usaid.gov/locations/sub-saharan_africa/countries/mali/ USAID Africa: Mali].

The conflict has seen the creation and growth of Dogon and Bambara militias.
