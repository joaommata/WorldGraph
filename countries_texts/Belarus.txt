===Early history===
{{further|Early Slavs}}
From 5000 to 2000 BC, the [[Bandkeramik]] predominated in what now constitutes Belarus, and the [[Cimmerians]] as well as other pastoralists roamed through the area by 1,000 BC. The [[Zarubintsy culture]] later became widespread at the beginning of the [[1st millennium]]. In addition, remains from the [[Dnieper–Donets culture]] were found in Belarus and parts of Ukraine.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Ian|last2=Jameson|first2=Robert|title=A Dictionary of Archaeology|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|pages=203–204|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8HKDtlPuM2oC&pg=PA203|isbn=978-0-470-75196-1}}</ref> The region was first permanently settled by [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] tribes in the 3rd century. Around the 5th century, the area was taken over by the Slavs. The takeover was partially due to the lack of military coordination of the Balts, but their gradual assimilation into Slavic culture was peaceful.<ref>{{harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|p=7}}</ref> Invaders from [[Asia]], among whom were the [[Huns]] and [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], swept through c. 400–600 AD, but were unable to dislodge the Slavic presence.<ref>John Haywood, ''Historical Atlas, Ancient and Classical World'' (1998).<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>

In the 9th century, the territory of modern Belarus became part of [[Kievan Rus']], a vast East Slavic state ruled by the [[Rurikids]].

In the years following the union, the process of gradual [[Polonization]] of both Lithuanians and Ruthenians gained steady momentum. In culture and social life, both the [[Polish language]] and [[Catholicism]] became dominant, and in 1696, Polish replaced Ruthenian as the official language, with Ruthenian being banned from administrative use.<ref>[http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=103&menu=00 "Belarusian": UCLA Language Materials Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222171418/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=103&menu=00 |date=22 December 2015 }}, ucla.edu; accessed 4 March 2016.</ref> However, the Ruthenian peasants continued to speak their native language. Also, the [[Belarusian Byzantine Catholic Church]] was formed by the Poles to bring Orthodox Christians into the [[Holy See|See of Rome]]. The Belarusian church entered into a full [[Koinonia|communion]] with the [[Latin Church]] through the [[Union of Brest]] in 1595, while keeping its Byzantine [[liturgy]] in the [[Church Slavonic]] language.

In a [[Russification]] drive in the 1840s, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] prohibited the use of the Belarusian language in public schools, campaigned against Belarusian publications, and tried to pressure those who had converted to Catholicism under the Poles to reconvert to the Orthodox faith. In 1863, economic and cultural pressure exploded in a [[January Uprising|revolt]], led by [[Konstanty Kalinowski]] (also known as Kastus). After the failed revolt, the Russian government reintroduced the use of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] to Belarusian in 1864 and no documents in Belarusian were permitted by the Russian government until 1905.<ref>{{cite book|author=D.

The [[Belarusian People's Republic]] was the first attempt to create an independent Belarusian state under the name "Belarus". Despite significant efforts, the state ceased to exist, primarily because the territory was continually dominated by the [[Imperial German Army]] and the [[Imperial Russian Army]] in [[World War I]], and then the [[Bolshevik]] [[Red Army]]. It existed from only 1918 to 1919 but created prerequisites for the formation of a Belarusian state. The choice of name was probably based on the fact that core members of the newly formed government were educated in tsarist universities, with corresponding emphasis on the ideology of West-Russianism.<ref name="Jr.Zaprudnik2010">{{cite book|author1=Vitali Silitski, Jr.|author2=Jan Zaprudnik|title=The A to Z of Belarus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQXyAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA308|date=7 April 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1-4617-3174-0|pages=308–}}</ref>

The [[Republic of Central Lithuania]] was a short-lived political entity, which was the last attempt to restore Lithuania to the historical confederacy state (it was also supposed to create Lithuania Upper and Lithuania Lower).

During that time, 209 out of 290 towns and cities were destroyed, 85% of the republic's industry, and more than one million buildings. After the war, it was estimated that 2.2 million local inhabitants had died, and of those some 810,000 were combatants—some foreign.

[[1991 Belarusian strikes|Wide-scale strikes]] erupted in April 1991. With the support of the [[Communist Party of Byelorussia]], the country's name was changed to the Republic of Belarus on 25 August 1991.<ref>{{Cite CIA World Factbook|country=Belarus|access-date=4 March 2016|year=2016|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/belarus/}}</ref><ref name="byind"/> [[Stanislav Shushkevich]], the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus, met with [[Boris Yeltsin]] of Russia and [[Leonid Kravchuk]] of Ukraine on 8 December 1991 in [[Białowieża Forest]] to formally declare the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].<ref name="byind"/>

In January 1992, the [[Belarusian Popular Front]] campaigned for early elections later in the year, two years before they were scheduled. By May of that year, about 383,000 signatures had been collected for a petition to hold the referendum, which was 23,000 more than legally required to be put to a referendum at the time. Despite this, the meeting of the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus]] to ultimately decide the date for the referendum was delayed by six months. However, with no evidence to suggest such, the Supreme Council rejected the petition on the grounds of massive irregularities. Elections for the Supreme Council were set for March 1994. A new law on parliamentary elections failed to pass by 1993. Disputes over the referendum were accredited to the largely conservative [[Party of Belarusian Communists]], which controlled the Supreme Council at the time and was largely opposed to political and economic reform, with allegations that some of the deputies opposed Belarusian independence.<ref>{{cite book |title=Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States 1997 |date=November 1996 |publisher=Europa Publications Limited |isbn=1-85743-025-5 |page=181 |edition=3 }}</ref>

===Lukashenko era===
[[File:Belarus 1997 CIA map.jpg|thumb|1997 map of Belarus]]
A national constitution was adopted in March 1994 in which the functions of prime minister were given to the [[President of Belarus]]. A two-round [[1994 Belarusian presidential election|election for the presidency on 24 June 1994 and 10 July 1994]]<ref name=Factbook/> catapulted the formerly unknown Alexander Lukashenko into national prominence. He garnered 45% of the vote in the first round and 80%<ref name="byind"/> in the second, defeating [[Vyacheslav Kebich]] who received 14% of the vote. The elections were the first and only free elections in Belarus after independence.<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/116265.stm Profile: Europe's last dictator?] BBC News, 10 September 2001</ref>

The 2000s saw some economic disputes between Belarus and its primary economic partner, Russia. The first one was the [[2004 Russia–Belarus energy dispute]] when Russian energy giant [[Gazprom]] ceased the import of gas into Belarus because of price disagreements. The [[2007 Russia–Belarus energy dispute]] centered on accusations by Gazprom that Belarus was siphoning oil from the [[Druzhba pipeline]] that runs through Belarus. Two years later the so-called [[Milk War]], a trade dispute, started when Russia wanted Belarus to recognize the independence of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]] and through a series of events ended up banning the import of dairy products from Belarus.

In 2011, Belarus suffered [[Economy of Belarus#Crisis of 2011|a severe economic crisis]] attributed to Lukashenko's government's centralized control of the economy, with inflation reaching 108.7%.<ref name="2011-crisis">{{cite web |author=Andrew E.

Two suspects, who were arrested within two days, confessed to being the perpetrators and were executed by shooting in 2012. The official version of events as publicised by the Belarusian government was questioned in the unprecedented wording of the [[UN Security Council]] statement condemning "the apparent terrorist attack" intimating the possibility that the Belarusian government itself was behind the bombing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2011/sc10225.doc.htm|title=Security Council Press Statement on Minsk Bombing &#124; Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org}}</ref>
