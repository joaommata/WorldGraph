After [[Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria]], the Byzantines took control of East Bulgaria. [[Samuel of Bulgaria|Samuil]] was proclaimed [[First Bulgarian Empire|Tsar of Bulgaria]]. He moved the capital to Skopje and then to Ohrid, which had been the cultural and military centre of southwestern Bulgaria since Boris I's rule. Samuil re-established Bulgarian power, but after several decades of conflicts, in 1014, the Byzantine Emperor [[Basil II]] defeated his armies, and within four years the Byzantines restored control over the Balkans (modern-day North Macedonia was included into a new province, called [[Bulgaria (theme)|Bulgaria]]). The rank of the autocephalous [[Bulgarian Patriarchate]] was lowered due to its subjugation to [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]] and it was transformed into the [[Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. By the late 12th century, Byzantine decline saw the region contested by various political entities, including a brief [[Normans|Norman]] occupation in the 1080s.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}

In the early 13th century, a revived [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] gained control of the region. Plagued by political difficulties, the empire did not last, and the region came once again under Byzantine control in the early 14th century. In the 14th century, it became part of the [[Serbian Empire]]. Skopje became the capital of Tsar [[Stefan Dušan]]'s empire. Following Dušan's death, a weak successor appeared, and power struggles between nobles divided the Balkans once again. These events coincided with the entry of the [[Ottoman Turks]] into Europe.

Several movements whose goals were the establishment of an autonomous Macedonia, which would encompass the entire region of Macedonia, began to arise in the late 19th century; the earliest of these was the [[Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees]], later becoming Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (SMARO). In 1905 it was renamed the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO), and after [[World War I]] the organisation separated into the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) and the [[Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation]] (ITRO).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jSg3lxgSy8C&q=thracian+revolutionary+organization&pg=PA100|isbn=978-0-8108-5565-6|page=100|access-date=14 November 2011|title=Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia|last=Bechev|first=Dimitar|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press }}</ref>

The Krushevo manifesto was declared, assuring the population that the uprising was against the Sultan and not against Muslims in general, and that all peoples would be included. As the population of Krushevo was two-thirds hellenised Vlachs and Patriarchist Slavs, this was a wise move. Despite these promises, the insurgent flew Bulgarian flags everywhere and in many places the uprising did entail attacks on Muslim Turks and Albanians who themselves organised for self-defence."

The names of IMRO revolutionaries like [[Gotse Delchev]], [[Pitu Guli]], [[Dame Gruev]] and [[Yane Sandanski]] were included into the lyrics of the national anthem of the state of North Macedonia "[[Denes nad Makedonija]]" ("Today over Macedonia"). The major national holiday of North Macedonia, the [[Republic Day (North Macedonia)|Republic Day]], is celebrated on 2 August, Ilinden (St. Elijah day), the day of the Ilinden uprising.

IMRO followed by starting an insurgent war in Vardar Macedonia, together with [[Macedonian Youth Secret Revolutionary Organization]], which also conducted guerrilla attacks against the Serbian administrative and army officials there.

[[File:Lazar Kolishevski left.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Lazar Koliševski]] was the political leader of SR Macedonia and briefly of SFR Yugoslavia.]]

In December 1944, the [[Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia]] (ASNOM) proclaimed the People's Republic of Macedonia as part of the People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.<ref>Мичев, Добрин. Партизанското движение във Вардарска Македония, 1941–1944 г. сп. Македонски преглед, кн. 2, стр. 5–40.</ref> ASNOM remained an acting government until the end of the war. The Macedonian alphabet was codified by linguists of ASNOM, who based their alphabet on the phonetic alphabet of [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] and the principles of [[Krste Misirkov|Krste Petkov Misirkov]]. During the [[Greek Civil War|civil war in Greece]] (1946–1949), Macedonian communist insurgents supported the Greek communists. Many refugees fled to the Socialist Republic of Macedonia from there. The state removed "Socialist" from its name in 1991 when it peacefully seceded from Yugoslavia.

The new republic became one of the six republics of the Yugoslav federation. Following the federation's renaming as the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1963, the People's Republic of Macedonia was likewise renamed the Socialist Republic of Macedonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.slvesnik.com.mk/Issues/0AF2E0456C964935B7705FB5BF6F31F9.pdf|title=Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, 1974 – Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia}}</ref><ref>Устав Федеративне Народне Републике Југославије (1946), [http://sr.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%A3%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2_%D0%A4%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B5_%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B5_%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B5_%D0%88%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B5_%281946%29 sr.wikisource.org], retrieved on 19 October 2007. {{in lang|sh}}</ref><ref>Устав Социјалистичке Федеративне Републике Југославије (1963), [http://sr.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%A3%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2_%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B5_%D0%A4%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B5_%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B5_%D0%88%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B5_%281963%29 sr.wikisource.org], retrieved on 19 October 2007. {{in lang|sh}}</ref>

These actions were seen as deliberate provocations in neighbouring Greece, exacerbating the dispute and further stalling the country's EU and NATO applications.<ref>''Greece slates Skopje's provocative Alexander statue'' Sinisa Jakov Marusic, Balkan Insight, 15 June 2011 [http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/greece-slates-skopje-s-provocative-alexander-statue]</ref> The policy has also attracted criticism domestically, as well as from EU diplomats,<ref name="Georgievski"/> and, following the Prespa agreement, it has been partly reversed after 2016 by the new [[SDSM]] government of North Macedonia.<ref>{{cite news |last=Marusic|first=Sinisa Jakov |date=15 June 2018 |title=Macedonia to Rename Divisive Statues That Irked Greece |url= https://balkaninsight.com/2018/06/15/divisive-skopje-2014-landmarks-find-new-purpose-06-14-2018/|work=BalkanInsight |location=Skopje|access-date=2 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Tagaris |first=Karolina |date=24 January 2018 |title=Macedonia to rename airport to help resolve name row with Greece, PM says |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-macedonia-name-airport/macedonia-to-rename-airport-to-help-resolve-name-row-with-greece-pm-says-idUSKBN1FD2TS |work=[[Reuters]] |location= Davos|access-date=2 April 2019}}</ref> Moreover, per Prespa agreement both countries have acknowledged that their respective understanding of the terms "Macedonia" and "Macedonian" refers to a different historical context and cultural heritage.

In August 2017, what was then the Republic of Macedonia signed a [[Bulgaria–North Macedonia relations#Friendship treaty and beyond|friendship agreement]] with Bulgaria, aiming to end the "anti-Bulgarian ideology" in the country and to solve the historical issues between the two.

Under the [[Prespa agreement]], signed with Greece on 17 June 2018, the country agreed to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia and stop public use of the [[Vergina Sun]]. It retained the demonym "Macedonian", but clarified this as distinct from the Hellenistic Macedonian identity in northern Greece. The agreement included removal of irredentist material from textbooks and maps in both countries, and official UN recognition of the Slavic [[Macedonian language]]. It replaced the bilateral Interim Accord of 1995.<ref name="2018FinalAgreement">{{cite web|url=http://s.kathimerini.gr/resources/article-files/symfwnia-aggliko-keimeno.pdf|title=Final Agreement for the Settlement of Differences as Described in the United Nations Security Council Resolutions 817 (1993) and 845 (1993), the Termination of the Interim Accord of 1995, and the Establishment of a Strategic Partnership Between the Parties|website=Kathimerini.gr|access-date=13 June 2018}}</ref>

The withdrawal of the Greek veto, along with the signing the friendship agreement with Bulgaria, resulted in the European Union on 27 June approving the start of [[Accession of North Macedonia to the European Union|accession talks]], which were expected to take place in 2019, under the condition that the Prespa deal was implemented.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://balkaninsight.com/2018/06/27/eu-paves-the-road-for-macedonia-albania-accession-talks-06-27-2018/ |title=Macedonia, Albania Hail EU Approval for Accession Talks |first=Sinisa Jakov |last=Marusic |website=Balkan Insight |date=27 June 2018 |access-date=27 June 2018}}</ref> On 5 July, the Prespa agreement was ratified by the Macedonian parliament with 69 MPs voting in favour of it.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-macedonia/macedonias-parliament-endorses-name-deal-with-greece-for-second-time-idUSKBN1JV1MP |title=Macedonia's parliament endorses name deal with Greece for second time |website=Reuters |date=5 July 2018 |access-date=6 July 2018}}</ref> On 12 July, [[NATO]] invited Macedonia to start accession talks in a bid to become the alliance's 30th member.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://balkaninsight.com/2018/07/11/nato-invites-macedonia-to-join-the-western-alliance-07-11-2018/ |title=NATO Invites Macedonia to Join the Western Alliance |first=Sinisa Jakov |last=Marusic |website=Balkan Insight |date=11 July 2018 |access-date=13 July 2018}}</ref> On 30 July, the parliament of Macedonia approved plans to hold a non-binding [[2018 Macedonian referendum|referendum on changing the country's name]], which took place on 30 September.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/macedonia-to-hold-name-change-referendum-on-september-30 |title=Macedonia to hold name-change referendum on September 30 |website=SBS News |date=30 July 2018 |access-date=31 July 2018}}</ref> Ninety-one percent of voters voted in favour with a 37% turnout,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://referendum.sec.mk/Referendum/Results?cs=en-US&r=r&rd=r1&eu=All&m=All |title=iVote Demokra – Integrated Election Information System of the State Election Commission of the Republic of Macedonia |website=referendum.sec.mk |access-date=14 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930231415/https://referendum.sec.mk/Referendum/Results?cs=en-US&r=r&rd=r1&eu=All&m=All |archive-date=30 September 2018 }}</ref> but the referendum was not carried because of a constitutional requirement for a 50% turnout.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-macedonia-referendum-turnout/macedonia-name-referendum-fails-to-reach-turnout-threshold-election-commission-idUSKCN1MA0X2 |title=Macedonia name referendum fails to reach turnout threshold: election commission |website=Reuters |date=30 September 2018 |language=en |access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref>

The 2023 European Commission Progress Report has cited the unfulfilled constitutional changes, as the primary reasons for the blocking of the further country's accession path.
