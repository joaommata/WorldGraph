Rodríguez de Francia established new laws that greatly reduced the powers of the Catholic church (Catholicism was then an established state religion) and the cabinet, forbade colonial citizens from marrying one another and allowed them to marry only blacks, [[mulattoes]] or natives, in order to break the power of colonial-era elites and to create a [[mixed-race]] or mestizo society.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Romero |first1=Simon |date=12 March 2012 |title=In Paraguay, indigenous language with unique staying power |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/world/americas/in-paraguay-indigenous-language-with-unique-staying-power.html |access-date=5 October 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930235457/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/world/americas/in-paraguay-indigenous-language-with-unique-staying-power.html |archive-date=30 September 2015}}</ref> He cut off relations between Paraguay and the rest of South America.

===Rule of the López family===

After Francia's death in 1840, Paraguay was ruled by various military officers under a new ''[[military junta|junta militar]]'', until [[Carlos Antonio López]] (allegedly Rodríguez de Francia's nephew) came to power in 1841. López modernized Paraguay and opened it to foreign commerce. He signed a [[nonaggression pact]] with Argentina and officially declared independence of Paraguay in 1842. After López's death in 1862, power was transferred to his eldest son, [[Francisco Solano López]].

The regime of the López family was characterized by pervasive and rigid centralism in production and distribution. There was no distinction between the public and the private spheres, and the López family ruled the country as it would a large estate.<ref>{{cite report |title=Carlos Antonio López |date=December 1988 |series=Library of Congress Country Studies |publisher=U.S. [[Library of Congress]] |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+py0019) |access-date=30 December 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816005342/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+py0019%29 |archive-date=16 August 2017}}</ref>

The government exerted control on all exports. The export of [[yerba mate]] and valuable wood products maintained the balance of trade between Paraguay and the outside world.<ref>{{worldhistory |section=1665 |quote=Page 630}}</ref> The Paraguayan government was extremely protectionist, never accepted loans from abroad and levied high [[tariff]]s against imported foreign products. This [[protectionism]] made the society self-sufficient, and it also avoided the debt suffered by Argentina and Brazil. Slavery existed in Paraguay, although not in great numbers, until 1844, when it was legally abolished in the new constitution.<ref name=rbcg1933>{{cite book |last1=Cunninghame Graham |first1=Robert Bontine |year = 1933 |title=Portrait of a Dictator: Francisco Solano López |publisher=William Heinemann Ltd.  |location=London |author1-link=Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham}}</ref>{{rp|39–40}}

[[Francisco Solano López]], the son of Carlos Antonio López, replaced his father as the President-Dictator in 1862, and generally continued the political policies of his father. Both wanted to give an international image of Paraguay as "democratic and republican", but in fact, the ruling family had almost total control of all public life in the country, including church and colleges.<ref name=rbcg1933 />{{rp|41–42}}

Militarily, Carlos Antonio López modernized and expanded industry and the [[Paraguayan Army]] and greatly strengthened the strategic defenses of Paraguay by developing the [[Fortress of Humaitá]].<ref>Robert Cowley, ''The Reader's Encyclopedia to Military History''. New York, New York: Houston Mifflin, 1996. Page 479.</ref> The government hired more than 200 foreign technicians, who installed [[telegraph line]]s and railroads to aid the expanding steel, textile, paper and ink, naval construction, weapons and gunpowder industries. The [[Ybycuí]] foundry, completed in 1850, manufactured cannons, mortars and bullets of all calibers. River warships were built in the shipyards of Asunción. Fortifications were built, especially along the [[Apa River]] and in [[Gran Chaco]].<ref name="Hooker">Hooker, T.D., 2008, The Paraguayan War, Nottingham: Foundry Books, {{ISBN|1901543153}}</ref>{{rp|22}} Following the death of Carlos Antonio López, these projects continued under his son Francisco Solano.

In terms of socio-economic development, the country was dubbed "the most advanced Republic in South America", notably by the British judge and politician [[Robert Phillimore|Sir Robert Phillimore]].<ref>Robert Phillimore (1860), ''A Statement of the Facts of the Controversy Between the Governments of Great Britain and Paraguay'', page 2. William Moore Printing, Washington D.C., USA.</ref>

According to George Thompson, Lieutenant Colonel of Engineers in the Paraguayan Army prior to and during the war, López's government was comparatively a good one for Paraguay:
{{blockquote|Probably in no other country in the world has life and property been so secure as all over Paraguay during his (Antonio Lopez's) reign. Crime was almost unknown, and when committed, immediately detected and punished. The mass of the people was, perhaps, the happiest in existence. They had hardly to do any work to gain a livelihood. Each family had its house or hut in its own ground. They planted, in a few days, enough tobacco, maize and mandioca for their own consumption [...]. Having at every hut a grove of oranges [...] and also a few cows, they were almost throughout the year under little necessity [...]. The higher classes, of course, lived more in the European way...|George Thompson, C.E.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Thompson | first1=George |year=1869 |title = The War in Paraguay: With a historical sketch of the country and its people and notes upon the military engineering of the war. |publisher = Longmans and Green Co. |location = London |page=10}}</ref>}}

The Paraguayans, led by the [[Grand marshal|Marshal of the Republic]] [[Francisco Solano López]], retaliated by [[Mato Grosso Campaign|attacking Mato Grosso]] on 15 December 1864 and later declared war against Argentina on 23 March 1865. The Blanco Government was toppled and replaced by a Colorado government under General Venancio Flores on 22 February 1865. Afterward, the [[Argentine Republic]], the [[Empire of Brazil]] and the Republic of Uruguay signed the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Secret Treaty of the Triple Alliance]] against the Paraguayan Government on 1 May 1865.<ref>{{cite book |author=Pomer, León |year=2008 |title=La Guerra del Paraguay: Estado, política y negocios |language=es |pages=240–241 |location=Buenos Aires, Argentina |publisher=Editorial Colihue}}</ref>

On 24 May 1866, the [[Battle of Tuyutí]] led to the loss of 6,000 men when a Paraguayan attack was repelled by the Allies. It was marked as the bloodiest battle in South America during the war.

The Paraguayans put up a ferocious resistance but ultimately lost in 1870 in the [[Battle of Cerro Corá]], where Marshal Solano López refused to surrender and died in action.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hooker, T.D. |year=2008 |title=The Paraguayan War |location=Nottingham, UK |publisher=Foundry Books |pages=105–108 |isbn=978-1901543155}}</ref> The real causes of this war, which remains the bloodiest international conflict in the history of [[The Americas]], are still highly debatable.{{efn|The classical view asserts that Francisco Solano López's expansionist and hegemonic views are the main reason for the outbreak of the conflict.

This view is usually contested by the "''anti-lopistas''" (known in Paraguay as "''legionarios''"), who favored the "Triple Alliance".

Paraguay lost 25–33% of its territory to Argentina and Brazil, paid an enormous war debt, and sold large amounts of national properties to stabilize its internal budget. The worst consequence of the war was the catastrophic loss of population. At least 50% of Paraguayans died during the conflict, numbers to which it took many decades for the country to return. Of the disaster suffered by the Paraguayans at the outcome of the war, [[William D. Rubinstein]] wrote:

"The normal estimate is that of a Paraguayan population of somewhere between 450,000 and 900,000, only 220,000 survived the war, of whom only 28,000 were adult males."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rubinsein |first=W.D. |year=2004 |title=Genocide: a history |publisher=Pearson Education |page=94 |isbn=0-582-50601-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMMAk4VwLLwC |url-status=live |access-date=18 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910110549/https://books.google.com/books?id=nMMAk4VwLLwC |archive-date=10 September 2015}}</ref>

In 1904, the Liberal revolution against the rule of Colorados broke out. The Liberal rule started a period of great political instability. Between 1904 and 1954, Paraguay had thirty-one [[President of Paraguay|presidents]], most of whom were removed from office by force.<ref>{{cite report |last1=Hanratty |first1=Dannin M. |last2=Meditz |first2=Sandra W. |year=1988 |title=Paraguay: A country study |location=Washington, DC |publisher=U.S. [[Library of Congress]] / [[Government Printing Office|GPO]] |url=http://countrystudies.us/paraguay/2.htm |url-status=live |access-date=19 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919163833/http://countrystudies.us/paraguay/2.htm |archive-date=19 September 2011}}</ref> Conflicts between the factions of the ruling Liberal party led to the [[Paraguayan Civil War (1922)|Paraguayan Civil War of 1922]].

The unresolved border conflict with Bolivia over the Chaco region finally erupted in the early 1930s in the [[Chaco War]]. After both sides suffered great losses, Paraguay defeated Bolivia and established its sovereignty over most of the disputed Chaco region. After the war, military officers used popular dissatisfaction with the Liberal politicians to seize the power for themselves. On 17 February 1936, the [[February Revolution (Paraguay)|February Revolution]] brought colonel [[Rafael Franco]] to power. Between 1940 and 1948, the country was ruled by general [[Higinio Morínigo]].

===Stroessner era, 1954–1989===
{{see also|El Stronato|Operation Condor}}
A series of unstable governments ensued until the establishment in 1954 of the regime of dictator [[Alfredo Stroessner]], who remained in office for more than three decades until 1989. Paraguay was modernized to some extent under Stroessner's regime, although his rule was marked by extensive human rights abuses.<ref>{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Bernstein |date=17 August 2006 |title=Alfredo Stroessner; Paraguayan dictator |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |location=Washington, DC |access-date=2 May 2010 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/16/AR2006081601729.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516121443/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/16/AR2006081601729.html |archive-date=16 May 2011}}</ref>

Stroessner and the ''Colorado'' party ruled the country from 1954 to 1989. The dictator oversaw an era of economic expansion, but also had a poor human rights and environmental record (see "Political History"). Paraguay actively participated in [[Operation Condor]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Dinges |first=John |title=Operation Condor |website=latinamericanstudies.org |publisher=[[Columbia University]] |url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/chile/operation-condor.htm |url-status=live |access-date=6 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722031734/http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/chile/operation-condor.htm |archive-date=22 July 2018}}</ref> Torture and death for political opponents was routine. After his overthrow, the ''Colorado'' continued to dominate national politics until 2008.

The splits in the ''Colorado'' Party in the 1980s, and the prevailing conditions – Stroessner's advanced age, the character of the regime, the economic downturn, and [[international isolation]] – were catalysts for anti-regime demonstrations and statements by the opposition prior to the 1988 general elections.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

''[[Authentic Radical Liberal Party|PLRA]]'' leader [[Domingo Laíno]] served as the focal point of the opposition in the second half of the 1980s. The government's effort to isolate Laíno by exiling him in 1982 had backfired. On his sixth attempt to reenter the country in 1986, Laíno returned with three television crews from the U.S., a former United States ambassador to Paraguay, and a group of Uruguayan and Argentine congressmen. Despite the international contingent, the police violently barred Laíno's return.<ref>{{cite web |title=Paraguay 1987, Chapter 4 |url=http://www.cidh.org/countryrep/Paraguay87eng/chap.4.htm |website=[[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (cidh.org) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210507100105/http://www.cidh.org/countryrep/Paraguay87eng/chap.4.htm |archive-date=7 May 2021}}</ref>

The Stroessner regime relented in April 1987, and permitted Laíno to return to Asunción. Laíno took the lead in organizing demonstrations and reducing infighting among the opposition party. The opposition was unable to reach agreement on a common strategy regarding the elections, with some parties advocating abstention, and others calling for blank voting. The parties held numerous 'lightning demonstrations' (''mítines relámpagos''), especially in rural areas. Such demonstrations were gathered and quickly disbanded before the arrival of the [[police]].

In response to the upsurge in opposition activities, Stroessner condemned the Accord for advocating "sabotage of the general elections and disrespect of the law". He used national police and civilian [[vigilantes]] of the ''Colorado'' Party to break up demonstrations. A number of opposition leaders were imprisoned or otherwise harassed. {{ill|Hermes Rafael Saguier|es}}, another key leader of the ''PLRA'', was imprisoned for four months in 1987 on charges of sedition. In early February 1988, police arrested 200 people attending a National Coordinating Committee meeting in [[Coronel Oviedo]]. Laíno and several other opposition figures were arrested before dawn on the day of the election, 14 February, and held for twelve hours. The government declared Stroessner's reelection with 89% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news |title=Paraguayan wins his eighth term |date=15 February 1988 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/15/world/paraguayan-wins-his-eighth-term.html?scp=3&sq=Paraguay%20february%201988&st=cse |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816064442/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/15/world/paraguayan-wins-his-eighth-term.html?scp=3&sq=Paraguay%20february%201988&st=cse |archive-date=16 August 2017}}</ref>

The opposition attributed the results in part to the virtual Colorado monopoly on the mass media. They noted that 53% of those polled indicated that there was an "uneasiness" in Paraguayan society. 74% believed that the political situation needed changes, including 45% who wanted a substantial or total change. Finally, 31% stated that they planned to abstain from voting in the February elections.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

===Stroessner's overthrow, post-1989===
On 3 February 1989, Stroessner was overthrown in a military coup headed by General [[Andrés Rodríguez (President)|Andrés Rodríguez]]. As president, Rodríguez instituted political, legal, and economic reforms and initiated a ''rapprochement'' with the international community. Reflecting the deep hunger of the rural poor for land, hundreds immediately occupied thousands of acres of unused territories belonging to Stroessner and his associates; by mid-1990, 19,000 families occupied {{convert|340000|acres|-3|abbr=on}}. At the time, 2.06 million people lived in rural areas, more than half of the 4.1 million total population, and most were landless.<ref name="nagel">{{cite journal |author=Nagel, Beverly Y. |year=1999 |title='Unleashing the fury': The cultural discourse of rural violence and land rights in Paraguay |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=148–181 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/S0010417599001905 |s2cid=146491025 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=1921 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016023308/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=1921 |archive-date=16 October 2015|issn=0010-4175 |url-access=subscription }}</ref>

The June 1992 constitution established a democratic system of government and dramatically improved protection of fundamental human rights. In May 1993, Colorado Party candidate [[Juan Carlos Wasmosy]] was elected as Paraguay's first civilian president in almost forty years, in what international observers deemed free and fair elections.

With support from the United States, the Organization of American States, and other countries in the region, the Paraguayan people rejected an April 1996 attempt by then Army Chief General [[Lino Oviedo]] to oust President Wasmosy.

Oviedo was nominated as the Colorado candidate for president in the 1998 election. However, when the Supreme Court upheld in April his conviction on charges related to the 1996 coup attempt, he was not allowed to run and was detained in jail. His former running mate, [[Raúl Cubas]], became the Colorado Party's candidate, and was elected in May in elections deemed by international observers to be free and fair. One of Cubas' first acts after taking office in August was to commute Oviedo's sentence and release him. In December 1998, Paraguay's Supreme Court declared these actions unconstitutional. In this tense atmosphere, the murder of Vice President and long-time Oviedo rival [[Luis María Argaña]] on 23 March 1999, led the Chamber of Deputies to impeach Cubas the next day.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} On 26 March, eight student anti-government demonstrators were murdered, widely believed to have been carried out by Oviedo supporters. This increased opposition to Cubas, who resigned on 28 March. Senate President [[Luis González Macchi]], a Cubas opponent, was peacefully sworn in as president the same day.

In 2003, [[Nicanor Duarte]] was elected as president.

===Election of Fernando Lugo===
For the 2008 general elections, the Colorado Party was favored in polls. Their candidate was Minister of Education [[Blanca Ovelar]], the first woman to be nominated as a candidate for a major party in Paraguayan history. After sixty years of Colorado rule, voters chose [[Fernando Lugo]], a former Roman Catholic Bishop and not a professional politician in civil government, and a member of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, Paraguay's largest opposition party. Lugo was an adherent of [[liberation theology]]. Lugo achieved a historic victory in Paraguay's presidential election, defeating the ruling party candidate, and ending 61 years of conservative rule. Lugo won with nearly 41% of the vote, compared to almost 31% for Blanca Ovelar of the Colorado party.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2008.10.001|author=Nickson, Andrew|year=2009|title=The general election in Paraguay, April 2008|journal=Journal of Electoral Studies|volume=28|issue=1|pages=145–9}}</ref> Outgoing President [[Nicanor Duarte|Nicanor Duarte Frutos]] hailed the moment as the first time in the history of the nation that a government had transferred power to opposition forces in a constitutional and peaceful fashion.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

Political instability following Lugo's election and disputes within his cabinet encouraged some renewal of popular support for the Colorado Party. Reports suggested that the businessman [[Horacio Cartes]] became the new political figure amid disputes. Despite the US [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]'s strong accusations against Cartes related to [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]], he continued to amass followers in the political arena.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

On 14 January 2011, the Colorado Party convention nominated Horacio Cartes as the presidential candidate for the party. However, the party's constitution did not allow it.{{clarify|date=April 2012}}

On 14 May 2011, Paraguay celebrated its [[Paraguay Bicentennial|bicentenary]] on the 200th anniversary of independence from the Spanish Empire as a sovereign state.

Lugo's supporters gathered outside Congress to protest the decision as a "politically motivated coup d'état".<ref name=CNN22/> Lugo's removal from office on 22 June 2012 is considered by [[UNASUR]] and other neighboring countries, especially those currently governed by leftist leaders, as a coup d'état.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unasursg.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=698%3Acomunicado-asuncion-22-de-junio-de-2012&catid=68%3Acomunicados&Itemid=346 |title=COMUNICADO UNASUR Asunción, 22 de Junio de 2012 |language=es |date=22 June 2012 |publisher=UNASUR |access-date=23 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627050748/http://www.unasursg.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=698:comunicado-asuncion-22-de-junio-de-2012&catid=68:comunicados&Itemid=346 |archive-date=27 June 2012}}</ref> However, the Organization of American States, which sent a mission to Paraguay to gather information, concluded that the impeachment process was not a coup d'état, as it had been carried out in accordance with the [[Constitution of Paraguay]].<ref>Halvorssen, Thor, ''[https://www.forbes.com/sites/thorhalvorssen/2012/07/03/paraguay-is-not-honduras/#57bce3c72308 Paraguay is not Honduras: President Lugo's Impeachment was not a Coup] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730203938/https://www.forbes.com/sites/thorhalvorssen/2012/07/03/paraguay-is-not-honduras/#57bce3c72308|date=30 July 2018}}'', Forbes.com, 3 July 2012, retrieved 30 July 2018</ref>
