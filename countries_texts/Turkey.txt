The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the [[Roman Empire]] centered in [[Constantinople]] during [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]]. The eastern half of the Empire survived the conditions that caused the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of the West]] in the 5th century AD, and continued to exist until the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire remained the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in the [[Mediterranean world]]. The term ''Byzantine Empire'' was only coined following the empire's demise; its citizens referred to the polity as the "Roman Empire" and to themselves as ''Romans''. Due to the imperial seat's move from Rome to [[Byzantium]], the [[Christianity as the Roman state religion|adoption of Christianity as the state religion]], and the predominance of [[Medieval Greek|Greek]] instead of [[Latin]], modern historians continue to make a distinction between the earlier ''Roman Empire'' and the later ''Byzantine Empire''.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

In the early Byzantine Empire period, the Anatolian coastal areas were Greek speaking. In addition to natives, interior Anatolia had diverse groups such as [[Goths]], [[Celts]], [[Persians]] and [[History of the Jews in the Byzantine Empire|Jews]]. Interior Anatolia had been "heavily Hellenized".<ref name=Horrocks_pp_778-779>{{harvnb|Horrocks|2008|pp=778–779}}: "Thus the majority of traditional 'Greek' lands, including the coastal areas of Asia Minor, remained essentially Greek-speaking, despite the superimposition of Latin and the later Slavic incursions into the Balkans during the sixth and seventh centuries. Even on the Anatolian plateau, where Hellenic culture had come only with Alexander's conquests, both the extremely heterogeneous indigenous populations and immigrant groups (including Celts, Goths, Jews, and Persians) had become heavily Hellenized, as the steady decline in epigraphic evidence for the native languages and the great mass of public and private inscriptions in Greek demonstrate. Though the disappearance of these languages from the written record did not entail their immediate abandonment as spoken languages,..."</ref> [[Anatolian languages]] eventually became extinct after [[Hellenization]] of Anatolia.<ref>{{harvnb|van den Hout|2011|p=1}}</ref>

* {{harvnb|Lee|2023|p=4}}: "It should also be noted that even the early Turkic peoples, including the Tiele and the Türks, were made up of heterogeneous elements. Importantly, DNA studies demonstrate that the expansion process of the Turkic peoples involved the Turkicization of various non-Turkic-speaking groups. The "Turks" intermixed with and Turkicized various indigenous groups across Eurasia: Uralic hunter-gatherers in northern Eurasia; Mongolic nomads in Mongolia; Indo-European-speaking nomads and sedentary populations in Xinjiang, Transoxiana, Iran, Kazakhstan, and South Siberia; and Indo-European elements (the Byzantine subjects, among others) in Anatolia and the Balkans.11"
* {{harvnb|Findley|2005|p=18}}: "Moreover, Turks do not all physically look alike. They never did. The Turks of Turkey are famous for their range of physical types. Given the Turks' ancient Inner Asian origins, it is easy to imagine that they once presented a uniform Mongoloid appearance. Such traits seem to be more characteristic in the eastern Turkic world; however, uniformity of type can never have prevailed there either. Archeological evidence indicates that Indo-Europeans, or certainly Europoid physical types, inhabited the oases of the Tarim basin and even parts of Mongolia in ancient times. In the Tarim basin, persistence of these former inhabitants' genes among the modern Uyghurs is both observable and scientifically demonstrable.32 Early Chinese sources describe the Kirghiz as blue-eyed and blond or red-haired. The genesis of Turkic ethnic groups from earliest times occurred in confederations of diverse peoples. As if to prove the point, the earliest surviving texts in Turkic languages are studded with terms from other languages."
