[[File:Cairo Castle GardenTaiz,Yemen.jpg|thumb|[[Al-Qahira Castle]]'s Garden in Taiz, the capital of Yemen during the [[Rasulid dynasty|Rasulid's era]]]]

The [[Rasulid dynasty]] was established in 1229 by [[Al-Mansur Umar|Umar ibn Ali]], who was appointed deputy governor by the Ayyubids in 1223. When the last Ayyubid ruler left Yemen in 1229, Umar stayed in the country as caretaker. He subsequently declared himself an independent king by assuming the title "al-Malik Al-Mansur" (the king assisted by [[Allah]]).<ref name="Abdul Ali 1996 84" />

Umar first established himself at Zabid, then moved into the mountainous interior, taking the important highland centre Sana'a. However, the Rasulid capitals were Zabid and Taiz. He was assassinated by his nephew in 1249.<ref name="Alexander D. Knysh 1999 230" /> Omar's son [[Al-Muzaffar Yusuf I|Yusuf]] defeated the faction led by his father's assassins and crushed several counterattacks by the Zaydi imams who still held on in the northern highland.

The Ottomans had two fundamental interests to safeguard in Yemen—the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and the trade route with India for spices and textiles, both threatened, and the latter virtually eclipsed, by the arrival of the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea in the early 16th century.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IiRwGU9pvw4C|last=Nahrawālī|first=Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad|date=6 September 2002|publisher=I.

[[File:Dar al hajar.jpg|thumb|upright|Imam [[Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din|Yahya Hamid Ed-Din]]'s house near Sana'a]]

Imam Yahya hamid ed-Din al-Mutawakkil was ruling the northern highlands independently from 1911, from which he began a conquest of the Yemen lands. In 1925 Yahya captured al-Hudaydah from the [[Idrisid dynasty|Idrisids]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Bernard Reich|title=Political Leaders of the Contemporary Middle East and North Africa: A Biographical Dictionary |year=1990|page=509|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-26213-6}}</ref> In 1927, Yahya's forces were about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} away from Aden, Taiz, and Ibb, and were bombed by the British for five days; the imam had to pull back.<ref>{{cite book |author=Paul Dresch |title=A History of Modern Yemen |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-79482-X |page=34}}</ref> Small [[Bedouin]] forces, mainly from the [[Madh'hij]] confederation of [[Marib]], attacked [[Shabwah Governorate|Shabwah]] but were bombed by the British and had to retreat.

The [[Italian Empire]] was the first to recognize Yahya as the king of Yemen in 1926. This created a great deal of anxiety for the British, who interpreted it as recognition of Imam Yahya's claim to sovereignty over Greater Yemen, which included the Aden protectorate and Asir.<ref>{{cite book|author=Massimiliano Fiore|year=2010|title=Anglo-Italian Relations in the Middle East, 1922–1940|url=https://archive.org/details/angloitalianrela00fior|url-access=limited|page=[https://archive.org/details/angloitalianrela00fior/page/n37 21]|publisher=Ashgate Publishing |isbn=978-0-7546-9747-3}}</ref> The Idrisis turned to [[Ibn Saud]] seeking his protection from Yahya.

==== Colonial Aden ====

Starting in 1890, hundreds of Yemeni people from Hajz, Al-Baetha, and Taiz migrated to Aden to work at ports, and as labourers. This helped the population of Aden once again become predominantly Arab after, having been declared a free zone, it had become mostly foreigners. During World War II, Aden had increasing economic growth and became the second-busiest port in the world after [[New York City]].<ref name="Wealth p.117">Kiren Aziz Chaudhry The Price of Wealth: Economies and Institutions in the Middle East p. 117</ref> After the rise of labour unions, a rift was apparent between the sectors of workers and the first signs of resistance to the occupation started in 1943.<ref name="Wealth p.117" /> [[Muhammad Ali Luqman]] founded the first Arabic club and school in Aden, and was the first to start working towards a union.<ref>Ulrike Freitag Indian Ocean Migrants and State Formation in Hadhramaut: Reform</ref>

The [[Colony of Aden]] was divided into an eastern colony and a western colony. Those were further divided into 23 sultanates and emirates, and several independent tribes that had no relationships with the sultanates. The deal between the sultanates and Britain detailed protection and complete control of foreign relations by the British. The Sultanate of Lahej was the only one in which the sultan was referred to as ''His Highness''.<ref>Don Peretz The Middle East Today p. 490</ref> The [[Federation of South Arabia]] was created by the British to counter [[Arab nationalism]] by giving more freedom to the rulers of the nations.<ref>The Middle East Today By Don Peretz p. 491</ref>

The [[North Yemen Civil War]] inspired many in the south to rise against the British rule. The [[National Liberation Front (Yemen)|National Liberation Front]] (NLF) of Yemen was formed with the leadership of [[Qahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi|Qahtan Muhammad Al-Shaabi]]. The NLF hoped to destroy all the sultanates and eventually unite with the [[Yemen Arab Republic]]. Most of the support for the NLF came from [[Radfan]] and Yafa, so the British launched Operation Nutcracker, which completely burned Radfan in January 1964.<ref>Human Rights Human Wrongs By M. S. Gill p. 48</ref>

==== Two states ====
{{Main|Yemen Arab Republic|South Yemen}}

Arab nationalism had an influence in some circles who opposed the lack of modernization efforts in the Mutawakkilite monarchy. This became apparent when Imam [[Ahmad bin Yahya]] died in 1962. He was succeeded by his son, but army officers attempted to seize power, sparking the [[North Yemen Civil War]].<ref>{{cite book |author=F.

Relations between the two Yemeni states fluctuated between peaceful and hostile. The South was supported by the Eastern bloc. The North, however, was not able to get the same connections. In 1972, the two states fought a war. The war was resolved with a ceasefire and negotiations brokered by the [[Arab League]], where it was declared that unification would eventually occur.

In October 2000, 17 U.S. personnel died after an al-Qaeda [[USS Cole bombing|suicide attack on the U.S. naval vessel USS ''Cole'']] in [[Aden]]. After the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States, President Saleh assured U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] that Yemen was a partner in his [[War on Terror]]. In 2001, violence surrounded [[Yemeni constitutional referendum, 2001|a referendum]], which apparently supported extending Saleh's rule and powers.

The [[Houthi insurgency in Yemen]] began in June 2004 when dissident cleric [[Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi]], head of the Zaidi Shia sect, launched an uprising against the Yemeni government. The Yemeni government alleged that the [[Houthis]] were seeking to overthrow it and to implement ''Shī'ite'' [[religious law]].

The 2011 [[Yemeni Revolution|Yemeni revolution]] followed other [[Arab Spring]] mass protests in early 2011. The uprising was initially against unemployment, economic conditions, and corruption, as well as against the government's proposals to modify the [[constitution of Yemen]] so that Saleh's son could inherit the presidency.

In March 2011, police snipers opened fire on a pro-democracy camp in Sana'a, killing more than 50 people. In May, dozens were killed in clashes between troops and tribal fighters in Sana'a. By this point, Saleh began to lose international support. In October 2011, Yemeni human rights activist [[Tawakul Karman]] won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], and the [[UN Security Council]] condemned the violence and called for a transfer of power. On 23 November 2011, Saleh flew to [[Riyadh]], in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, to sign the [[Gulf Co-operation Council]] plan for political transition, which he had previously spurned. Upon signing the document, he agreed to legally transfer the office and powers of the presidency to his deputy, Vice President [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Yemen's Ali Abdullah Saleh resigns – but it changes little {{!}} Brian Whitaker |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/24/yemen-ali-abdullah-saleh-resigns |work=the Guardian |date=24 November 2011 |language=en}}</ref>

Al-Hadi would oversee the drafting of a new constitution, followed by parliamentary and presidential elections in 2014. Saleh returned in February 2012. In the face of objections from thousands of street protesters, parliament granted him full immunity from prosecution. Saleh's son, General [[Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh]], continues to exercise a strong hold on sections of the military and security forces.

[[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula|AQAP]] claimed responsibility for a February 2012 suicide attack on the presidential palace that killed 26 Republican Guards on the day that President Hadi was sworn in. AQAP was also behind a suicide bombing that killed 96 soldiers in Sana'a three months later. In September 2012, a car bomb attack in Sana'a killed 11 people, a day after a local al-Qaeda leader [[Said al-Shihri]] was reported killed in the south.

By 2012, there was a "small contingent of U.S. special-operations troops"—in addition to CIA and "unofficially acknowledged" U.S. military presence—in response to increasing terror attacks by AQAP on Yemeni citizens.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2123810,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906231921/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2123810,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 September 2012 |title=The End of Al-Qaeda? |first=Bobby |last=Ghosh |magazine=Time |location=New York |date=17 September 2012 |access-date=24 September 2012}}</ref> Many analysts have pointed out the former Yemeni government role in cultivating terrorist activity in the country.<ref>{{cite news |title=Whose Side Is Yemen On? |date=29 August 2012 |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/08/29/whose_side_is_yemen_on?page=0,1 |work=Foreign Policy |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=22 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530044140/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/08/29/whose_side_is_yemen_on?page=0,1 |archive-date=30 May 2013}}</ref> Following the election of President [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi]], the Yemeni military was able to push [[Ansar al-Sharia (Yemen)|Ansar al-Sharia]] back and recapture the [[Shabwah Governorate]].
