France seized and colonized [[Ubangi-Shari]] territory in 1894. In 1911 at the [[Treaty of Fez]], France ceded a nearly 300,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> portion of the Sangha and Lobaye basins to the [[German Empire]] which ceded a smaller area (in present-day [[Chad]]) to France. After [[World War I]] France again annexed the territory. Modeled on [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold]]'s [[Congo Free State]], concessions were doled out to private companies that endeavored to strip the region's assets as quickly and cheaply as possible before depositing a percentage of their profits into the French treasury. The concessionary companies [[corvée|forced local people]] to harvest rubber, coffee, and other commodities without pay and held their families hostage until they met their quotas.<ref name=fp1015>{{Cite magazine|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/28/one-day-we-will-start-a-big-war-central-african-republic-un-violence/|title=One day we will start a big war|magazine=Foreign Policy|access-date=13 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205203123/http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/28/one-day-we-will-start-a-big-war-central-african-republic-un-violence/|archive-date=5 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 31 December 1965, Dacko was overthrown in the [[Saint-Sylvestre coup d'état]] by Colonel [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], who suspended the constitution and dissolved the National Assembly. President Bokassa declared himself President for Life in 1972 and named himself Emperor Bokassa I of the [[Central African Empire]] (as the country was renamed) on 4 December 1976. A year later, Emperor Bokassa [[Coronation of Bokassa I and Catherine|crowned himself in an expensive ceremony]].<ref name=Bokassa/>

In April 1979, young students protested against Bokassa's decree that all school pupils were required to buy uniforms from a company owned by one of his wives. The government violently suppressed the protests, killing 100 children and teenagers. Bokassa might have been personally involved in some of the killings.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7803421.stm 'Good old days' under Bokassa?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203043924/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7803421.stm |date=3 December 2013 }}".

Dacko, in turn, was again overthrown in a [[1981 Central African Republic coup d'état|coup]] by General [[André Kolingba]] on 1 September 1981.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/02/world/army-tropples-leader-of-central-african-republic.html|title=Army Tropples Leader of Central African Republic|last1=Prial|first1=Frank J.|date=2 September 1981|work=The New York Times|access-date=19 September 2019|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=21 May 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230521051018/https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/02/world/army-tropples-leader-of-central-african-republic.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Central African Republic under Kolingba ====
Kolingba suspended the constitution and ruled with a [[military junta]] until 1985. He introduced a new constitution in 1986 which was adopted by a nationwide referendum. Membership in his new party, the [[Rassemblement Démocratique Centrafricain]] (RDC), was voluntary. In 1987 and 1988, semi-free elections to parliament were held, but Kolingba's two major political opponents, [[Abel Goumba]] and [[Ange-Félix Patassé]], were not allowed to participate.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#Why-Visit|title=Central African Republic – Discover World|website=www.discoverworld.com|access-date=10 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210180433/https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#Why-Visit|archive-date=10 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

By 1990, inspired by the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], a pro-democracy movement arose. Pressure from the United States, France, and from a group of locally represented countries and agencies called GIBAFOR (France, the US, Germany, Japan, the EU, the [[World Bank]], and the [[United Nations]]) finally led Kolingba to agree, in principle, to hold free elections in October 1992 with help from the UN Office of Electoral Affairs. After using the excuse of alleged irregularities to suspend the results of the elections as a pretext for holding on to power, President Kolingba came under intense pressure from GIBAFOR to establish a "Conseil National Politique Provisoire de la République" (Provisional National Political Council, CNPPR) and to set up a "Mixed Electoral Commission", which included representatives from all political parties.<ref name=":0" />

When a second round of elections were finally held in 1993, again with the help of the international community coordinated by GIBAFOR, Ange-Félix Patassé won in the second round of voting with 53% of the vote while Goumba won 45.6%. Patassé's party, the ''Mouvement pour la Libération du Peuple Centrafricain'' (MLPC) or Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People, gained a [[Plurality voting|plurality]] (relative majority) but not an [[Majority|absolute majority]] of seats in parliament, which meant Patassé's party required coalition partners.<ref name=":0" />

==== Patassé government (1993–2003) ====
Patassé purged many of the Kolingba elements from the government and Kolingba supporters accused Patassé's government of conducting a "[[Witch-hunt#Figurative use of the term|witch hunt]]" against the Yakoma. A new constitution was approved on 28 December 1994 but had little impact on the country's politics. In 1996–1997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in the government's erratic behavior, three [[Mutiny|mutinies]] against Patassé's administration were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension. During this time (1996), the [[Peace Corps]] evacuated all its volunteers to neighboring Cameroon. To date, the Peace Corps has not returned to the Central African Republic. The [[Bangui Agreements]], signed in January 1997, provided for the deployment of an inter-African military mission, to the Central African Republic and re-entry of ex-mutineers into the government on 7 April 1997. The inter-African military mission was later replaced by a U.N. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1159|peacekeeping force (MINURCA)]]. Since 1997, the country has hosted almost a dozen peacekeeping interventions, earning it the title of "world champion of peacekeeping".<ref name=fp1015/>

In 1998, parliamentary elections resulted in Kolingba's RDC winning 20 out of 109 seats. The next year, however, in spite of widespread public anger in urban centers over his corrupt rule, Patassé won a second term in the presidential election.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eisa.org.za/wep/car1999results.htm|title=EISA Central African Republic: 1999 Presidential election results|date=October 2010|website=www.eisa.org.za|publisher=African Democracy Encyclopaedia Project|access-date=27 February 2020|archive-date=29 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190729062022/https://eisa.org.za/wep/car1999results.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 28 May 2001, rebels stormed strategic buildings in Bangui in an [[2001 Central African Republic coup d'état attempt|unsuccessful coup attempt]]. The army chief of staff, Abel Abrou, and General François N'Djadder Bedaya were killed, but Patassé regained the upper hand by bringing in at least 300 troops of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] rebel leader [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] and Libyan soldiers.<ref>{{Cite web|author=International Crisis Group|title=Central African Republic: Anatomy of a Phantom State|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/central-africa/central-african-republic/Central%20African%20Republic%20Anatomy%20of%20a%20Phantom%20State.pdf|website=CrisisGroup.org|publisher=International Crisis Group|access-date=24 July 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626162538/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/central-africa/central-african-republic/Central%20African%20Republic%20Anatomy%20of%20a%20Phantom%20State.pdf|archive-date=26 June 2014}}</ref>

In the aftermath of the [[2001 Central African Republic coup d'état attempt|failed coup]], militias loyal to Patassé sought revenge against rebels in many neighborhoods of [[Bangui]] and incited unrest including the murder of many political opponents. Eventually, Patassé came to suspect that General [[François Bozizé]] was involved in another coup attempt against him, which led Bozizé to flee with loyal troops to Chad. In March 2003, Bozizé launched a surprise attack against Patassé, who was out of the country. Libyan troops and some 1,000 soldiers of Bemba's Congolese rebel organization failed to stop the rebels and Bozizé's forces succeeded in overthrowing Patassé.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#History|title=Central African Republic History|date=2018|website=DiscoverWorld.com|access-date=15 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210180433/https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#History|archive-date=10 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[François Bozizé]] suspended the constitution and named a new cabinet, which included most opposition parties. [[Abel Goumba]] was named vice-president.

The Syrte Agreement in February and the Birao Peace Agreement in April 2007 called for a cessation of hostilities, the billeting of [[Democratic Front of the Central African People|FDPC]] fighters and their integration with FACA, the liberation of political prisoners, the integration of FDPC into government, an amnesty for the [[Union of Democratic Forces for Unity|UFDR]], its recognition as a political party, and the integration of its fighters into the national army.
