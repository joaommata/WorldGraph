On 22 September 1992, [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 47/1|United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/47/1]] was adopted, by which it considered that \"the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations,\" and therefore decided that \"the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should apply for membership in the United Nations and that it shall not participate in the work of the General Assembly\".

During the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]], and in response to the election of [[Malaysia]] as a [[List of members of the United Nations Security Council|non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council]], in a letter dated 20 January 1965, [[Indonesia]] informed the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] that it had decided \"at this stage and under the present circumstances\" to withdraw from the UN. However, following the overthrow of [[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Sukarno]], in a telegram dated 19 September 1966, Indonesia notified the Secretary-General of its decision \"to resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities starting with the twenty-first session of the General Assembly\".

       "\"Isabella of Castile(later Isabella of Spain) is probably one of the most consequential leaders in globally history because of the actions that her and her husband Ferdinand made. In terms of her positives and negatives, this is the list I have\\n\\nNegatives: Starting the Spanish Inquisition(which persecuted conversos and heretics). Issuing the Alhambra Decree(decree of expulsion for Jews in Spain). Later sanctioning the expulsion of the Islamic population(1501). Negotiating the Treaty of Tordesillas with the Pope and Portugal(essentially dividing the New World and initiating the colonial discovery doctrine)\\n\\nPositives: Successfully resolving the War of Castillian Succession. Bringing about the unification of Spain. Playing a pivotal role in the age of exploration which would increase globalization between peoples. Successfully curbing organized crime in Spanish society. Successfully dealing with Castile and Spain's finances. Surprisingly defending the rights of indigenous people(she told Columbus to release natives who were enslaved, and even had him arrest for oppressing them). Setting the stage for the Golden Age of Spanish culture. \\n\\nIn addition, Isabella's history with Jews in Spain are somewhat complicated. Before her Alhambra Decree apparently she was known for protecting the civil rights of Jews. She had Jewish subjects serving in her government, and whenever local governing councils passed laws against the Jews, she would repeatedly intervene and have them annulled.\""
