===Geological history===
The islands of  were formed from the [[Miocene]] period. For the past 2 million years, the  archipelago has experienced activity related to [[ hotspot|volcanic hotspots]].

===Early history===
 was discovered and settled by the [[Lapita people]] (Austronesian people who spoke [[Oceanic languages]]), who travelled from [[Island Melanesia]]. The earliest human remains found in  are dated to between roughly 2,900 and 3,500 years ago. The remains were discovered at a Lapita site at [[Mulifanua]], and the scientists' findings were published in 1974. The Samoans' origins have been studied in modern times through scientific research on Polynesian [[genetics]], [[linguistics]], and [[anthropology]]. Although this research is ongoing, a number of theories have been proposed. One theory is that the original Samoans were [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesians]] who arrived during a final period of eastward expansion of the Lapita peoples out of Southeast Asia and [[Melanesia]] between 2,500 and 1,500 BCE.

Intimate sociocultural and genetic ties were maintained between , , and , and the archaeological record supports oral tradition and native genealogies that indicate interisland voyaging and intermarriage among precolonial Samoans, [[Fijians]], and [[Tongans]]. Notable figures in  history included the [[Tui Manu'a]] line, Queen [[Salamasina]], [[Falefa|King Fonoti]] and the four ''tama a ʻāiga'': [[Malietoa]], [[Tupua Tamasese]], [[Mataʻafa]], and [[Tuimalealiʻifano]]. [[Nafanua]] was a famous woman warrior who was deified in ancient  religion and whose patronage was highly sought after by successive  rulers.

Today, all of  is united under its two principal royal families: the Sā Malietoa of the ancient Malietoa lineage that defeated the Tongans in the 13th century; and the Sā Tupua, Queen Salamasina's descendants and heirs who ruled  in the centuries that followed her reign. Within these two principal lineages are the four highest titles of  – the elder titles of Malietoa and Tupua Tamasese of antiquity and the newer Mataʻafa and Tuimalealiʻifano titles, which rose to prominence in 19th-century wars that preceded the colonial period. These four titles form the apex of the  matai system as it stands today.

Contact with Europeans began in the early 18th century. [[Jacob Roggeveen]], a Dutchman, was the first known non-Polynesian to sight the  islands in 1722. This visit was followed by  explorer [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who named them the Navigator Islands in 1768. Contact was limited before the 1830s, which is when British [[missionaries]] of the London Missionary Society, whalers, and traders began arriving.

===19th century===
Visits by  trading and [[whaling]] vessels were important in the early economic development of . The [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] brig ''Roscoe'' (Captain Benjamin Vanderford), in October 1821, was the first  trading vessel known to have called, and the ''Maro'' (Captain Richard Macy) of [[Nantucket]], in 1824, was the first recorded  whaler at . The whalers came for fresh drinking water, firewood, provisions and, later, for recruiting local men to serve as crewmen on their ships. The last recorded whaler visitor was the ''Governor Morton'' in 1870.

Christian missionary work in  began in 1830 when [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]] of the [[London Missionary Society]] arrived in [[Sapapali'i]] from the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Tahiti]]. According to Barbara A. West, "The Samoans were also known to engage in 'headhunting', a ritual of war in which a warrior took the head of his slain opponent to give to his leader, thus proving his bravery."

In ''[[A Footnote to History: Eight Years of Trouble in ]]'' (1892), [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] details the activities of the [[great power]]s battling for influence in &nbsp;– the ,  and Britain&nbsp;– and the political machinations of the various  factions within their indigenous political system. Even as they descended into ever greater interclan warfare, what most alarmed Stevenson was the Samoans' economic innocence. In 1894, just months before his death, he addressed the island chiefs:

{{Blockquote|text=There is but one way to defend . Hear it before it is too late. It is to make roads, and gardens, and care for your trees, and sell their produce wisely, and, in one word, to occupy and use your country&nbsp;... if you do not occupy and use your country, others will. It will not continue to be yours or your children's, if you occupy it for nothing. You and your children will in that case be cast out into outer darkness.}}

He had "seen these judgments of God" in [[Hawaiian Kingdom|Hawaii]], where abandoned native churches stood like tombstones "over a grave, in the midst of the white men's sugar fields".

The Germans, in particular, began to show great commercial interest in the [[ Islands]], especially on the island of Upolu, where  firms monopolised [[copra]] and [[cocoa bean]] processing. The  laid its own claim, based on commercial shipping interests in Pearl Harbor in [[Hawaii]] and Pago Pago Bay in eastern , and forced alliances, most conspicuously on the islands of [[Tutuila]] and [[Manu'a]], which became [[ ]].

Britain also sent troops to protect British business enterprise, harbour rights, and consulate office. This was followed by an [[ Civil War|eight-year civil war]], during which each of the three powers supplied arms, training and in some cases combat troops to the warring  parties. The [[ crisis]] came to a critical juncture in March 1889 when all three colonial contenders sent warships into Apia harbour, and a larger-scale war seemed imminent. A massive storm on 15 March 1889 damaged or destroyed the warships, ending the military conflict.

The [[Second  Civil War]] reached a head in 1898 when [[ Empire|]], the [[ of Great Britain and |]], and the  were locked in dispute over who should control the  Islands. The [[Siege of Apia]] occurred in March 1899.  forces loyal to Prince [[Malietoa Tanumafili I|Tanu]] were besieged by a larger force of  rebels loyal to [[Mata'afa Iosefo|Mataʻafa Iosefo]]. Supporting Prince Tanu were landing parties from four British and  warships. After several days of fighting, the  rebels were finally defeated.

The eastern island-group became a territory of the  (the Tutuila Islands in 1900 and officially Manu'a in 1904) and was known as  . The western islands, by far the greater landmass, became [[ ]]. The  had vacated all claims in  and in return received (1) termination of  rights in [[]], (2) all of the  south of Bougainville, and (3) territorial alignments in West Africa.

===  (1900–1914)===

{{Main| }}
The [[ Empire]] governed the western part of the  archipelago from 1900 to 1914. [[Wilhelm Solf]] was appointed the colony's first governor. In 1908, when the non-violent [[Mau movement|Mau a Pule]] resistance movement arose, Solf did not hesitate to banish the Mau leader [[Lauaki Namulauulu Mamoe|Lauaki Namulau'ulu Mamoe]] to Saipan in the  [[Northern Mariana Islands]].

The  colonial administration governed on the principle that "there was only one government in the islands." Thus, there was no  ''Tupu'' (king), nor an ''alii sili'' (similar to a governor), but two ''Fautua'' (advisors) were appointed by the colonial government. ''Tumua'' and ''Pule'' (traditional governments of Upolu and Savai'i) were for a time silent; all decisions on matters affecting lands and titles were under the control of the colonial Governor.

In the first month of [[World War I]], on 29 August 1914, troops of the  Expeditionary Force landed unopposed on Upolu and [[Occupation of  |seized control]] from the  authorities, following a request by Great Britain for  to perform this "great and urgent imperial service."

=== rule (1914–1961)===
{{Main|Western  Trust Territory}}
From the end of [[World War I]] until 1962,  controlled Western  as a [[Western  Trust Territory|Class C Mandate]] under [[trusteeship]] through the [[League of Nations]], then through the United Nations. Between 1919 and 1962,  was administered by the [[Department of Island Territories ()|Department of External Affairs]], a government department which had been specially created to oversee 's Island Territories and . In 1943, this department was renamed the [[Department of Island Territories ()|Department of Island Territories]] after a separate [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs ()|Department of External Affairs]] was created to conduct 's foreign affairs. During the period of  control, their administrators were responsible for two major incidents.

====Flu pandemic====
In the first incident, approximately one fifth of the  population died in the [[Influenza epidemic of 1918|influenza epidemic of 1918–1919]].

In 1918, during the final stages of [[World War I]], the [[ flu]] had taken its toll, spreading rapidly from country to country. On , there had been no epidemic of pneumonic influenza in Western  before the arrival of the [[SS Talune|SS ''Talune'']] from [[Auckland]] on 7 November 1918. The NZ administration allowed the ship to berth in breach of quarantine; within seven days of this ship's arrival, influenza became epidemic in Upolu and then spread rapidly throughout the rest of the territory.  suffered the most of all Pacific islands, with 90% of the population infected; 30% of adult men, 22% of adult women and 10% of children died. The cause of the epidemic was confirmed in 1919 by a [[Royal Commission]] of Inquiry into the Epidemic concluded that there had been no epidemic of pneumonic influenza in Western  before the arrival of the ''Talune'' from Auckland on 7 November 1918.

The pandemic undermined  confidence in 's administrative capacity and competence. Some Samoans asked that the rule of the islands be transferred to the Americans or the British.

====Mau movement====
The second major incident arose out of an initially peaceful protest by the [[Mau movement|Mau]] (which translates as "strongly held opinion"), a non-violent popular pro-independence movement which had its beginnings in the early 1900s on Savai'i, led by [[Lauaki Namulauulu Mamoe]], an orator chief deposed by Solf. In 1909, Lauaki was exiled to [[Saipan]] and died en route back to  in 1915.

By 1918, Western  had a population of some 38,000 Samoans and 1,500 Europeans.

However, native Samoans greatly resented 's colonial rule, and blamed inflation and the catastrophic 1918 flu epidemic on its misrule. By the late 1920s the resistance movement against colonial rule had gathered widespread support. One of the Mau leaders was [[Olaf Frederick Nelson]], a half  and half  merchant. Nelson was eventually [[exile]]d during the late 1920s and early 1930s, but he continued to assist the organisation financially and politically. In accordance with the Mau's non-violent philosophy, the newly elected leader, High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi, led his fellow uniformed Mau in a peaceful demonstration in downtown Apia on 28 December 1929.

The  police attempted to arrest one of the leaders in the demonstration. When he resisted, a struggle developed between the police and the Mau. The officers began to fire randomly into the crowd and used a [[Lewis machine gun]], mounted in preparation for the demonstration, to disperse the demonstrators. Mau leader and paramount chief [[Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III]] was shot from behind and killed while trying to bring calm and order to the Mau demonstrators. Ten others died that day and approximately 50 were injured by gunshot wounds and police batons. That day would come to be known in  as Black Saturday.

On 13 January 1930, the  authorities banned the organisation. As many as 1500 Mau men took to the bush, pursued by an armed force of 150 marines and seamen from the [[light cruiser]] [[HMS Dunedin|HMS ''Dunedin'']], and 50 military police. They were supported by a seaplane flown by Flight Lieutenant [[Sidney Wallingford]] of the [[ Permanent Air Force]]. Villages were raided, often at night and with fixed bayonets. In March, through the mediation of local Europeans and missionaries, Mau leaders met 's Minister of Defence and agreed to disperse.

Supporters of the Mau continued to be arrested, so women came to the fore rallying supporters and staging demonstrations. The political stalemate was broken following the victory of the Labour Party in 's 1935 general election. A 'goodwill mission' to Apia in June 1936 recognised the Mau as a legitimate political organisation, and Olaf Nelson was allowed to return from exile. In September 1936, Samoans exercised for the first time the right to elect the members of the advisory ''[[Fono of Faipule]]'', with representatives of the [[Mau movement]] winning 31 of the 39 seats.

===Independence===
After repeated efforts by the  independence movement, the  Western  Act of 24 November 1961 terminated the Trusteeship Agreement and granted the country independence as the ''Independent State of Western '', effective 1 January 1962. Western , the first small-island country in the Pacific to become independent, signed a [[– relations#Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Friendship]] with  later in 1962. Western  joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on 28 August 1970. While independence was achieved at the beginning of January,  annually celebrates 1 June as its independence day.

At the time of independence, [[Fiamē Mataʻafa Faumuina Mulinuʻu II]], one of the four highest-ranking [[paramount chief]]s in the country, became 's first [[Prime Minister of |prime minister]]. Another paramount chief, [[Tuiaana Tuimalealiʻifano Suatipatipa II]], was admitted to the [[Council of Deputies]]; the remaining two – [[Tupua Tamasese Meaʻole]] and [[Malietoa Tanumafili II]] – became joint heads of state for life.

On 15 December 1976, Western  was admitted to the [[United Nations]] as the 147th [[Member states of the United Nations|member state]]. It asked to be referred to in the United Nations as the ''Independent State of ''.

Travel writer [[Paul Theroux]] noted marked differences between the societies in Western  and [[ ]] in 1992.

On 4 July 1997 the government amended the constitution to change the name of the country from ''Western '' to '''', the name it had been called by in the United Nations since it joined. [[ ]] protested against the name change, asserting that it diminished its own identity.

In 2002,  prime minister [[Helen Clark]] formally apologised for 's role in the  influenza outbreak in 1918 that killed over a quarter of 's population and for the Black Saturday killings in 1929.

On 7 September 2009, the government changed the rule of the road from [[Left- and right-hand traffic|right to left]], in common with most other Commonwealth countries – most notably countries in the region such as  and , home to large numbers of Samoans. This made  the first country in the 21st century to switch to driving on the left.

At the end of December 2011,  changed its time zone offset from UTC−11 to UTC+13, effectively jumping forward by one day, omitting Friday, 30 December from the local calendar. This also changed the shape of the [[International Date Line]], moving it to the east of the territory. This change aimed to help the nation boost its economy in doing business with  and . Before this change,  was 21 hours behind [[Sydney]], but the change means it is now three hours ahead. The previous time zone, implemented on 4 July 1892, operated in line with  traders based in [[California]]. In October 2021,  ceased [[daylight saving time]].

In 2017,  signed the UN [[treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].

In June 2017, Parliament amended Article 1 of the  Constitution to make [[Christianity]] the state religion.

In September 2019, a [[2019  measles outbreak|measles outbreak]] resulted in the deaths of 83 people. Following the outbreak, the government imposed a curfew in December later during the same year.

In May 2021, [[Fiamē Naomi Mataʻafa]] became 's first female prime minister. Mataʻafa's [[Faʻatuatua i le Atua  ua Tasi|FAST]] party narrowly won the [[2021  general election|election]], ending the rule of long-term Prime Minister [[Tuilaʻepa Saʻilele Malielegaoi]] of the [[Human Rights Protection Party]] (HRPP), although the [[2021  constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] complicated and delayed this. On 24 May 2021, she was sworn in as the new prime minister, though it was not until July that the Supreme Court ruled that her swearing-in was legal, thus ending the constitutional crisis and bringing an end to Tuilaʻepa's 22-year premiership. The FAST party's success in the 2021 election and subsequent court rulings also ended nearly four decades of HRPP rule.
