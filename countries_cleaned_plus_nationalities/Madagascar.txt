Traditionally, archaeologists have estimated that the earliest settlers arrived in successive waves in [[Outrigger canoe|outrigger canoes]] from [[South Kalimantan|South Borneo]], possibly throughout the period between 350&nbsp;BCE and 550&nbsp;CE, while others are cautious about dates earlier than 250 CE. In either case, these dates make  one of the most recent major landmasses on Earth to be settled by humans, predating the settlement of [[]] and [[]]. It has been proposed that [[Ma'anyan people]] were brought as laborers and slaves by [[Java|Javan]] and [[Sumatra|Sumatran]]-[[Malay (ethnic group)|Malays]] in their trading fleets to . Dates of settlement of the island earlier than the mid-first millennium CE are not strongly supported. However, there is scattered evidence for much earlier human visits and presence.{{efn|Archaeological finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and stone tools in the northeast indicate that  was visited by foragers around 2000 BCE. See [[History of #First inhabitants and settlements (500 BCE–700 CE)|History of ]].}}

Upon arrival, early settlers practiced [[slash-and-burn agriculture]] to clear the coastal rainforests for cultivation. The first settlers encountered 's abundance of [[Pleistocene megafauna|megafauna]], including 17 species of [[Subfossil lemur|giant lemurs]], the large flightless [[Elephant bird|elephant birds]] (including possibly the largest bird to ever exist, ''[[Aepyornis maximus]]''), the [[Cryptoprocta spelea|giant fossa]], and several species of [[ hippopotamus]], which have since become extinct because of hunting and habitat destruction. According to the ''[[General History of Africa]]'', these first settlers, the ''[[tompontany]]'' (masters of the soil/land), are thought to have been the [[Kimosy]] in south-central , the [[Antevinany]] in the southeast, the [[Antankoala]] and [[Kajemby]] in the northwest, and the [[Rasikajy]] in the northeast. Newer arrivals formed marriage alliances with the ''tompontany'', facilitating their gradual assimilation.{{Reference page|page=900}} By 600&nbsp;CE, groups of these early settlers had begun clearing the forests of the [[Central Highlands ()|Central Highlands]]. According to the ''General History of Africa'', by the 8th century the [[Vazimba]] (a 'way of life' rather than ethnic group){{Reference page|page=71}} had absorbed or violently displaced the first settlers, and had come to refer to themselves as ''tompontany''.{{Reference page|page=900}} Though  popular belief regards the Vazimba as the island's first inhabitants.

Arab traders first reached the island between the 7th and 9th centuries, and introduced [[Islam]] and the [[Arabic script]] (adapted as ''[[sorabe]]'' for the [[ language]]). [[ Ocean trade]] along the northwestern coast of  came to be controlled by the [[Antalaotra]], Muslim [[Swahili language|Swahili]]-speakers who had migrated to the region around the 10th century and intermarried with the locals,{{Reference page|pages=36-7}} forming [[city-states]] such as {{Interlanguage link|Mahilaka|de}} and {{Interlanguage link|Irodo (village)|lt=Irodo|fr}}.{{Reference page|page=900}} A wave of [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking migrants from southeastern Africa arrived around the year 1000. Around this time, [[zebu]] from [[South ]] were first brought, intermingling with [[Sanga cattle|sanga]] found in East Africa. By 1100, all regions of  were inhabited, although the total population remained small.{{Rp|page=48}} Societies organized at the behest of ''[[Hasina ()|hasina]]'' (which later evolved to embody kingship) and competed with one another over the [[List of rivers of |island's estuaries]] and [[Bridgehead|bridgeheads]], with oral histories describing bloody clashes and earlier settlers often pushed along the coast or inland.{{rp|pages=43, 52–3}} An Arab geographer wrote in 1224 that the island consisted of a great many towns and kingdoms, with kings making war on each other.{{rp|pages=51–2}} Assisted by climate change, the peoples gradually transformed the island from [[ lowland forests|dense forest]] to grassland for cultivation and zebu [[pastoralism]].{{rp|pages=71}}

=== Rise of early kingdoms and contact with Europeans ===
The period from 1500 to 1800 saw 's populations go from being mobile and unsettled to having organized largely into states.{{Reference page|page=70}} On the northern coast, Mahilaka was abandoned and replaced by [[Vohemar]] in the 15th century as one of the island's main trading ports, accompanied by [[Mazalagem Nova]] in the late-16th century.

The [[British Empire|British]] attempted to found a colony at the Bay in 1645 but were expelled by the .{{Reference page|pages=38-9, 54, 61-2}}

Kent considered the Maroserana to have migrated and met the proto-Sakalava near the [[Mangoky River]], who all traditions agree were skilled warriors.{{Reference page|page=869}} Sakalava traditions detail how a kingdom was founded along the [[Morondava River]] before 1600, called ''[[Menabe]]'' ("very red") after the red soil.

In the southwest and south, conflict between the [[Mahafaly kingdom|Mahafaly]] and [[Antandroy kingdom|Antandroy]] kingdoms in the mid-17th century caused the death of two Antandroy kings and saw Mahafaly split in two: [[Kingdom of Menarandra|Menarandra]] and [[Kingdom of Sakatovo|Sakatovo]], with Menarandra soon splitting further to produce [[Kingdom of Linta|Linta]]. In the early-18th century, a Menarandra king expanded east to conquer the western Antandroy, though yet another split produced [[Kingdom of Onilahy|Onilahy]].{{Reference page|pages=867-8}} On the east coast, when the [[Antemoro people|Antemoro]] settled their lands they found Muslim settlers, the [[Zafiraminia]], already there since around 1500. A conflict between the two broke out,{{Efn|Represented in traditions as a battle between two giants, [[Darafify]] and Fatrapaitatana{{rp|page=853}}}} and the Zafiraminia had come to rule the [[Antemoro kingdom]] by the mid-16th century.{{Reference page|pages=851-3}} In the southeast the  founded [[Fort-Dauphin ()|Fort Dauphin]] in 1642.

In the Central Highlands, [[Merina people|Merina]] traditions hold that they encountered the Vazimba{{Efn|Represented as "primitive dwarfs"{{Reference page|page=70}}}} when gradually settling the highlands from the southeast, thought to have been completed by the 15th century.{{Reference page|page=70}} After peacefully coexisting for several generations, [[Hill of Alasora|Alasora]] king [[Andriamanelo]], son of a Vazimba queen{{Efn|Traditions differ on whether it was [[Rafohy]] or [[Rangita]].{{Reference page|page=142}}}} and Merina man, launched a campaign to conquer the Vazimba.{{Reference page|page=142}} Of his successors, [[Ralambo]] founded the [[Merina Kingdom]],{{Efn|In Merina tradition, Ralambo is credited with founding various institutions, such as a [[head tax]] and [[standing army]], and with domesticating zebu.{{rp|page=876}}}} and [[Andrianjaka]] completed the expulsion and assimilation of the Vazimba by the early-17th century.{{Reference page|page=876}} Traditions attribute the conquest of the Vazimba to the need to acquire more land for rice cultivation, with archaeological research putting the beginning of this expansion in the 14th century.{{Reference page|pages=49-50}} In the mid-17th century a Mahafaly king invaded [[Bara people|Bara]] territory and appointed his relatives, the [[Zafimanely]], as rulers, who gained independence of [[Bara kingdoms|various kinglets]] after his death.{{Reference page|page=880}} [[Betsileo kingdoms]] such as [[Arindrano]] and [[Kingdom of Isandra|Isandra]] were likely founded in the mid-17th century, and the [[Betsileo people|Betsileo]] derive their name from King Besilau who repelled a Sakalava-Menabe invasion in the 1670s.{{Efn|''-silau''/''-tsileo'' means "the invincible".{{rp|page=874}}}} By the 18th century the Betsileo were the island's most proficient cultivators of rice.{{Reference page|pages=874-5}}

=== 19th century and the Kingdom of  ===
[[File:Andrianampoinimerina_HQ.jpg|thumb|King [[Andrianampoinimerina]] (1787–1810)]]
After reuniting Imerina, and now seated at the [[Rova of Antananarivo]], Andrianampoinimerina rapidly expanded his rule over neighbouring principalities. He used ports' reliance on the supply of slaves from the highlands to gain control over trade on the eastern coast.{{Reference page|page=165}} Andrianampoinimerina's ambition to bring the entire island under his control was largely achieved by his son and successor, King [[Radama I]] (r.{{Spaces}}1810–28). The 18th century had seen rivalry between the  and the British over the wider  Ocean trade, of which  trade had proved decisive during the [[Carnatic Wars]].{{Reference page|pages=195}} Radama expanded east to control [[Toamasina]] on the coast,{{Reference page|page=416}} and concluded a treaty in 1817 with the British governor of [[]] to abolish the lucrative slave trade in return for British military and financial assistance, and recognition as the "King of ". Artisan missionary envoys from the [[London Missionary Society]] began arriving in 1818 who established schools, transcribed the [[ language]] using the [[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]], and translated the Bible. In response, the Sakalava and  found themselves as natural allies.{{Reference page|pages=198}} Radama embarked on successive campaigns to conquer the island, subduing the east coast, dismantling Iboina and expelling its ruler, and achieving Menabe's nominal submission. By 1828 he controlled two-thirds of the island (excepting the Bara, Mahafaly, and [[Antandroy]]), though Merina rule was far from secure and widespread resistance continued.{{Reference page|pages=420-2}}

Radama's successor, Queen [[Ranavalona I]] (1828–61), responded to increasing political and cultural encroachment on the part of Britain and  by issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of [[Christianity in ]] and pressuring most foreigners to leave the territory. The Queen made heavy use of the traditional practice of ''[[Corvée|fanompoana]]'' (forced labor as tax payment) to complete public works projects and develop a standing army of between 20,000 and 30,000 Merina soldiers, whom she deployed to pacify outlying regions of the island and further expand the Kingdom of Merina to encompass most of . Residents of  could accuse one another of various crimes, including theft, Christianity and especially witchcraft, for which the ordeal of ''[[tangena]]'' was routinely obligatory. Between 1828 and 1861, the ''tangena'' ordeal caused about 3,000 deaths annually. The combination of regular warfare, disease, difficult forced labor, and harsh measures of justice resulted in a high mortality rate among soldiers and civilians alike during her 33-year reign; the population of  is estimated to have declined from around 5&nbsp;million to 2.5&nbsp;million between 1833 and 1839. In 1839, Boina queen [[Tsiomeko of Boina|Tsiomeko]], having fled to the island of [[Nosy Be]], requested  assistance against Merina attacks. In accordance with 's conditions, she signed Nosy Be and part of the mainland to them, which the  then declared as its [[protectorate]].{{Reference page|pages=241-5}}

Among those who continued to reside in Imerina were [[Jean Laborde]], an entrepreneur who developed munitions and other industries on behalf of the monarchy, and [[Joseph-François Lambert]], a  adventurer and slave trader, with whom then-Prince [[Radama II]] signed a controversial trade agreement termed the [[Lambert Charter]]. Succeeding his mother, Radama II attempted to relax the queen's stringent policies but was [[Radama II#Assassination plot|overthrown]] two years later by Prime Minister [[Rainivoninahitriniony]] and an alliance of ''[[Andriana]]'' (noble) and ''[[Hova ()|Hova]]'' (commoner) courtiers, who sought to end the absolute power of the monarch.

Following the coup, the courtiers offered Radama's queen, [[Rasoherina]], the opportunity to rule, if she would accept a power-sharing arrangement with the Prime Minister: a new social contract that would be sealed by a political marriage between them. Queen Rasoherina accepted, first marrying Rainivoninahitriniony, then later deposing him and marrying his brother, Prime Minister [[Rainilaiarivony]], who would go on to marry Queen [[Ranavalona II]] and Queen [[Ranavalona III]] in succession.

Over the course of Rainilaiarivony's 31-year tenure as prime minister, numerous policies were adopted to modernize and consolidate the power of the central government. Schools were constructed throughout the island and attendance was made mandatory. Army organization was improved and British consultants were employed to train and professionalize soldiers. [[Polygamy]] was outlawed and Christianity declared the official religion of the court in 1869, was adopted alongside traditional beliefs among a growing portion of the populace. Legal codes were reformed on the basis of British [[common law]] and three European-style courts were established in the capital city. In his joint role as Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony also successfully ensured the defense of  against several  colonial incursions. The  devised plans in 1842 and the 1860s to land troops in  and assist the Sakalava, who continued to resist, in a war against Imerina, however they didn't come to fruition.{{Reference page|page=252}}

At the end of the war,  ceded the northern port town of [[Antsiranana]] (Diego Suarez) to  and paid 560,000 francs to Lambert's heirs. In 1890, the British accepted the full formal imposition of a  [[protectorate]] on the island, but  authority was not acknowledged by the government of . To force capitulation, the  bombarded and occupied the harbor of [[Toamasina]] on the east coast, and [[Mahajanga]] on the west coast, in December 1894 and January 1895 respectively.

A  military [[flying column]] then marched toward Antananarivo, losing many men to malaria and other diseases. Reinforcements came from [[]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Upon reaching the city in September 1895, the column bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, causing heavy casualties and leading Queen Ranavalona III to surrender. Popular resistance to the  capture of [[Antananarivo]]—known as the [[Menalamba rebellion]]—broke out in December 1895, and was not suppressed until the end of 1897.  annexed  in 1896 and declared the island a colony the following year, dissolving the Merina monarchy and sending the royal family into exile on [[Réunion|Réunion Island]] and to .{{Citation needed|date=November 2025}}

The conquest was followed by ten years of civil war, due to the Menalamba insurrection. The "pacification" carried out by the  administration lasted more than fifteen years, in response to the rural guerrillas scattered throughout the country. The  [[Franco-Menabe war|campaign against Menabe]] began with the {{Interlanguage link|Ambiky massacre|fr|Massacre d'Ambiky}} in 1897 and ended in 1902. The Antandroy and Mahafaly continued to oppose colonial rule, though yielded in 1904.{{Reference page|pages=238-9}} In total, the repression of this resistance to colonial conquest caused several tens of thousands of  victims.

Under colonial rule, plantations were established for the production of a variety of export crops. [[Slavery]] was abolished in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed; many remained in their former masters' homes as servants or as sharecroppers; in many parts of the island strong discriminatory views against slave descendants are still held today. Wide paved boulevards and gathering places were constructed in the capital city of Antananarivo and the Rova palace compound was turned into a museum. Additional schools were built, particularly in rural and coastal areas where the schools of the Merina had not reached. Education became mandatory between the ages of 6 and 13 and focused primarily on the  language and practical skills.

Huge mining and forestry concessions were granted to large companies. Native chiefs loyal to the  administration were also granted part of the land. Forced labor was introduced in favor of the  companies and peasants were encouraged, through taxation, to work for wages (especially in the colonial concessions) to the detriment of small individual farms. However, the colonial period was accompanied by movements fighting for independence: the Menalamba, the [[Vy Vato Sakelika]], the [[Democratic Movement for  Renovation]] (MDRM). In 1927, major demonstrations were organized in Antananarivo, notably on the initiative of the communist activist {{Interlanguage link|François Vittori|fr}}, who was imprisoned as a result. The 1930s saw the  anti-colonial movement gain further momentum.  trade unionism began to appear underground and the [[Communist Party of the  region]] was formed. But in 1939, all the organizations were dissolved by the administration of the colony, which opted for the [[Vichy regime]]. The MDRM was accused by the colonial regime of being at the origin of the 1947 insurrection and was pursued by violent repression.

The Merina royal tradition of [[Corvée|taxes paid in the form of labor]] was continued under the  and used to construct a railway and roads linking key coastal cities to Antananarivo.  troops fought for  in [[World War I]]. In the 1930s, [[Nazi |Nazi]] political thinkers developed the [[ Plan]] that had identified the island as a potential site for the deportation of Europe's Jews. During the [[Second World War]], the island was the site of the [[Battle of ]] between the [[Vichy |Vichy ]] and an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] expeditionary force.

The occupation of  during the Second World War tarnished the prestige of the colonial administration in  and galvanized the growing independence movement, leading to the [[ Uprising]] of 1947. This movement led the  to establish reformed institutions in 1956 under the ''[[Loi Cadre]]'' (Overseas Reform Act), and  moved peacefully towards independence. The [[ Republic]] was proclaimed on 14 October 1958, as an [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] state within the [[ Community]]. A period of provisional government ended with the adoption of a constitution in 1959 and full independence on 26 June 1960.

[[File:Philibert_Tsiranana_1962.jpg|thumb|[[Philibert Tsiranana]], the first [[List of Presidents of |president of ]] (1960–1972)]]
Since regaining independence,  has transitioned through four republics with corresponding revisions to its constitution. The [[ Republic|First Republic]] (1960–72), under the leadership of -appointed President [[Philibert Tsiranana]], was characterized by a continuation of strong economic and political ties to . Many high-level technical positions were filled by  expatriates, and  teachers, textbooks and curricula continued to be used in schools around the country. Popular resentment over Tsiranana's tolerance for this "neo-colonial" arrangement inspired a [[Rotaka|series of farmer and student protests]] that overturned his administration in 1972.

[[Gabriel Ramanantsoa]], a major general in the army, was appointed interim president and prime minister that same year, but low public approval forced him to step down in 1975. Colonel [[Richard Ratsimandrava]], appointed to succeed him, was assassinated six days into his tenure. General [[Gilles Andriamahazo]] ruled after Ratsimandrava for four months before being replaced by another military appointee: Vice Admiral [[Didier Ratsiraka]], who ushered in the Marxist–Leninist [[Democratic Republic of |Second Republic]] that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993.

This period saw a political alignment with the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures stemming from the [[1973 oil crisis]], resulted in the rapid collapse of 's economy and a sharp decline in living standards, and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, [[World Bank]] and various bilateral donors in exchange for their bailout of the nation's broken economy.

Ratsiraka's dwindling popularity in the late 1980s reached a critical point in 1991 when presidential guards opened fire on unarmed protesters during a rally. Within two months, a transitional government had been established under the leadership of [[Albert Zafy]] (1993–96), who went on to win the 1992 presidential elections and inaugurate the [[Third Republic of |Third Republic]] (1992–2010). The new [[Constitution of | constitution]] established a multi-party democracy and a separation of powers that placed significant control in the hands of the National Assembly. The new constitution also emphasized human rights, social and political freedoms, and free trade. Zafy's term, however, was marred by economic decline, allegations of corruption, and his introduction of legislation to give himself greater powers. He was consequently impeached in 1996, and an interim president, [[Norbert Ratsirahonana]], was appointed for the three months prior to the next presidential election. Ratsiraka was then voted back into power on a platform of decentralization and economic reforms for a second term which lasted from 1996 to 2001.

The contested [[ presidential election, 2001|2001 presidential elections]] in which then-mayor of Antananarivo, [[Marc Ravalomanana]], eventually emerged victorious, caused a seven-month standoff in 2002 between supporters of Ravalomanana and Ratsiraka. The negative economic impact of the political crisis was gradually overcome by Ravalomanana's progressive economic and political policies, which encouraged investments in education and ecotourism, facilitated foreign direct investment, and cultivated trading partnerships both regionally and internationally. National GDP grew at an average rate of 7&nbsp;percent per year under his administration. In the latter half of his second term, Ravalomanana was criticised by domestic and international observers who accused him of increasing authoritarianism and corruption.

Opposition leader and then-mayor of Antananarivo, [[Andry Rajoelina]], led a [[2009  political crisis|movement in early 2009]] in which Ravalomanana was pushed from power in an unconstitutional process widely condemned as a ''coup d'état''. In March 2009, Rajoelina was declared by the Supreme Court as the President of the [[High Transitional Authority]], an interim governing body responsible for moving the country toward presidential elections. In 2010, a new constitution was [[ constitutional referendum, 2010|adopted by referendum]], establishing a Fourth Republic, which sustained the democratic, multi-party structure established in the previous constitution. [[Hery Rajaonarimampianina]] was declared the winner of the [[ general election, 2013|2013 presidential election]], which the international community deemed fair and transparent.

In 2018 the first round of the [[2018  presidential election|presidential election]] was held on 7 November and the second round was held on 10 December. Three former presidents and the most recent president were the main candidates of the elections. Rajoelina won the second round of the elections. Ravalomana lost the second round and he did not accept the results because of allegations of fraud. Rajaonarimampianina received very modest support in the first round. In January 2019 the High Constitutional Court declared Rajoelina as the winner of the elections and the new president.
