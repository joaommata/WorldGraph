The first human traces are supported by the presence of [[Acheulean]] tools, generally close to the [[obsidian]] outcrops more than 1 million years ago. The most recent and important excavation is at the [[Nor Geghi|Nor Geghi 1]] [[Stone Age]] site in the [[Hrazdan (river)|Hrazdan river]] valley. Thousands of 325,000 year-old artifacts may indicate that this stage of human technological innovation occurred intermittently throughout the Old World, rather than spreading from a single point of origin (usually hypothesized to be Africa), as was previously thought.

Many early [[Bronze Age]] settlements were built in  (Valley of Ararat, Shengavit, Harich, Karaz, Amiranisgora, Margahovit, Garni, etc.). One of the important sites of the Early Bronze Age is [[Shengavit (site)|Shengavit settlement]]. It was located on the site of today's capital of , [[Yerevan]].

Archaeological surveys in 2010 and 2011 at the [[Areni-1 cave]] complex have resulted in the discovery of [[Areni-1 shoe|the world's earliest known leather shoe]], skirt, and [[Areni-1 winery|wine-producing facility]].

Several Bronze Age cultures and states flourished in the area of Greater , including the [[Trialeti culture|Trialeti-Vanadzor culture]], [[Hayasa-Azzi]], and [[Mitanni]] (located in southwestern historical ), all of which are believed to have had Indo-European populations. The [[Nairi]] confederation and its successor, [[Urartu]], successively established their sovereignty over the [[ Highlands]]. Each of the aforementioned nations and confederacies participated in the ethnogenesis of the [[Armenians]]. A large cuneiform lapidary inscription found in [[Yerevan]] established that the modern capital of  was founded in the summer of 782&nbsp;BC by King [[Argishti I of Urartu|Argishti I]]. Yerevan is one of the world's [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously inhabited cities]].{{sfn|Bournoutian|2006|p=12}}

After the fall of the state of [[Urartu]] at the beginning of the 6th century BC, the [[ highlands]] were for some time under the hegemony of the [[Medes]], and after that they were part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].  was part of the Achaemenid state from the second half of the 6th century BC until the second half of the 4th century BC divided into two satrapies: XIII (western part, with the capital in [[Melitene]]) and XVIII (northeastern part). During the late 6th century BC, the [[Satrapy of |first geographical entity that was called ]] by neighbouring populations was established under the [[Orontid dynasty]].

In the next centuries,  was in the [[Persian Empire]]'s sphere of influence during the reign of [[Tiridates I of |Tiridates I]], the founder of the [[Arsacid dynasty of ]], which was a branch of the [[Parthian Empire]]. Throughout its history, the kingdom of  enjoyed both periods of independence and periods of autonomy subject to contemporary empires. Its strategic location between two continents has subjected it to invasions by many peoples, including [[Assyria]] (under [[Ashurbanipal]], at around 669–627 BC, the boundaries of Assyria reached as far as  and the [[Caucasus Mountains]]), Medes, Achaemenid Empire, [[Greeks]], Parthians, [[ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Sasanian Empire]], [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Arabs]], [[Seljuk Empire]], [[Mongols]], [[Ottoman Empire]], the successive [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]], [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]], and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties of , and the Russians.

Religion in ancient  was historically related to a set of beliefs that, in Persia, led to the emergence of [[Zoroastrianism]]. It particularly focused on the worship of [[Mithra]] and also included a pantheon of gods such as [[Aramazd]], [[Vahagn]], [[Anahit]], and [[Astghik]]. The country used the solar [[ calendar]], which consisted of 12 months.

Christianity first appeared in  in the 1st century AD, with the arrival of two of [[Jesus]]'s twelve [[Apostles in the New Testament|apostles]] – [[Jude the Apostle|Thaddaeus]] and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]].{{sfn|Hacikyan|Basmajian|Franchuk|Ouzounian|2000|pp=75-76}}{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=24}} Under the influence of [[Gregory the Illuminator]], King [[Tiridates III of |Tiridates III]] proclaimed Christianity as the [[state religion]] in 301,{{sfn|Hacikyan|Basmajian|Franchuk|Ouzounian|2000|pp=77-79}} partly in defiance of the [[Sasanian Empire]].  thus became the first officially Christian state. Prior to this, during the latter part of the Parthian era,  was a predominantly Zoroastrian country.

Another major cornerstone of  identity – the [[ alphabet]] – was invented a century later by [[Mesrop Mashtots]] {{circa|405}}.{{sfn|Hacikyan|Basmajian|Franchuk|Ouzounian|2000|p=87}} After the fall of the  Arsacids in 428, most of  was incorporated as a [[Sasanian |''marzpanate'' within Sasanian Persia]]. Following the [[Battle of Avarayr]] in 451, Christian Armenians maintained their religion, and  gained autonomy in the [[Treaty of Nvarsak]] in 484.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|pp=47-48}}

The Sassanid Empire was conquered by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in the mid 7th century, reuniting  lands previously taken by the Byzantine Empire, and  subsequently emerged as [[Arminiya]], an autonomous principality under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. The principality was ruled by the Prince of , and recognised by the [[Caliphate|Caliph]] and the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]]. It was part of the administrative division/emirate ''Arminiya'' created by the Arabs, which also included parts of  and [[Caucasian ]], and had its centre in the  city [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]]. Arminiya lasted until 884, when it regained its independence from the weakened [[Abbasid Caliphate]] under [[Ashot I of ]].{{Sfn|Canard|Cahen|1960}}

The reemergent  kingdom was ruled by the [[Bagratuni dynasty]] and lasted until 1045. In time, several areas of the [[Bagratid ]] separated as independent kingdoms and principalities such as the Kingdom of [[Vaspurakan]] ruled by the House of [[Artsruni]] in the south, Kingdom of [[Syunik Province|Syunik]] in the east, or [[Kingdom of Artsakh]] on the territory of modern [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], while still recognising the supremacy of the Bagratid kings.{{sfn|Payaslian|2007|p=52}}

In 1045, the Byzantine Empire conquered Bagratid . Soon, the other  states fell under Byzantine control as well. The Byzantine rule was short-lived, as in 1071 the [[Seljuk Empire]] defeated the Byzantines and conquered  at the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. To escape death or servitude at the hands of those who had assassinated his relative, [[Gagik II of |Gagik II]], King of [[Ani]], an  named [[Ruben I, Prince of ]], went with some of his countrymen into the gorges of the [[Taurus Mountains]] and then into [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] of [[Cilicia]]. The Byzantine governor of the palace gave them shelter where the [[ Kingdom of Cilicia]] was eventually established on 6 January 1198 under [[Leo I, King of ]], a descendant of Prince Ruben.

Cilicia was a strong ally of the [[Crusades|European Crusaders]] and saw itself as a bastion of [[Christendom]] in the East. Cilicia's significance in  history and statehood is also attested by the transfer of the seat of the [[Catholicos]] of the [[ Apostolic Church]], the spiritual leader of the  people, to the region.

In the early 12th century,  princes of the [[Zakarid dynasty|Zakarid family]] drove out the Seljuk Turks and established a semi-independent principality in northern and eastern  known as [[Zakarid ]], which lasted under the patronage of the [[History of  (country)| Kingdom]]. The [[Orbelian dynasty]] shared control with the Zakarids in various parts of the country, especially in [[Syunik Province|Syunik]] and [[Vayots Dzor Province|Vayots Dzor]], while the [[House of Hasan-Jalalyan]] controlled provinces of [[Artsakh (historical province)|Artsakh]] and [[Utik]] as the [[Kingdom of Artsakh]].

===Early modern era===

[[File:Map Safavid persia.png|thumb|In 1501–02, most of the [[Eastern ]]n territories, including Yerevan, were conquered by the emerging [[Safavid dynasty]] of  led by Shah [[Ismail I]].]]
During the 1230s, the [[Mongol Empire]] conquered Zakarid  and then the remainder of . The  invasions were soon followed by those of other Central Asian tribes, such as the [[Kara Koyunlu]], [[Timurid dynasty]] and [[Ağ Qoyunlu]], which continued from the 13th century until the 15th century. After incessant invasions, each bringing destruction to the country, with time  became weakened.

In the 16th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Safavid dynasty]] of  divided . From the early 16th century, both [[Western ]] and [[Eastern ]] fell to the Safavids. Owing to the century long [[Ottoman–Safavid relations|Turco- geopolitical rivalry]] that would last in West Asia, significant parts of the region were frequently fought over between the two rivalling empires during the [[Ottoman–Persian Wars]]. From the mid 16th century with the [[Peace of Amasya]], and decisively from the first half of the 17th century with the [[Treaty of Zuhab]] until the first half of the 19th century, Eastern  was ruled by the successive Safavid, [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties, while Western  remained under Ottoman rule. From 1604, [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I of ]] implemented a "[[scorched earth]]" policy in the region to protect his north-western frontier against any [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1603–1618)|invading Ottoman forces]], a policy that involved a [[History of #Persian |forced resettlement]] of masses of Armenians outside of their homelands.

The 18th century saw the first foray of the [[ Empire]] into the region, with [[Peter the Great]] and his alliance with the  [[melik]]s of [[Syunik (historical province)|Syunik]] and [[Melikdoms of Karabakh|Artsakh]] during the [[Russo-Persian War (1722–1723)]].{{sfn|Hewsen|2001|pp=163-165}} Despite the setbacks of Peter's campaign, this initial move encouraged the meliks in their [[Artsakh liberation struggle (1724–1731)|resistance struggle]] against the Safavids and the Ottomans.{{sfn|Hewsen|2001|pp=163-165}} However, it was not until the early 19th century that Eastern  formally passed to  control, following the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–1813)]] and the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)]].{{sfn|Badalyan Riegg|2020|pp=55, 91}} In the 1813 [[Treaty of Gulistan]] and the 1828 [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]], Qajar  ceded to  the [[Karabakh Khanate|Karabakh]], [[Erivan Khanate|Erivan]], and [[Nakhichevan Khanate]]s.{{sfn|Bournoutian|2018|pp=6-7}}{{sfn|Tsutsiev|2014|pp=15-17}} The [[Russo- War (1877–1878)]] resulted in further gains for [[ ]], notably the regions of [[Kars]] and [[Ardahan]].{{sfn|Panossian|2006|p=120}}{{sfn|Badalyan Riegg|2020|p=164}}

Most of Western , however, remained under Ottoman rule. Within the Ottoman ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]'' system, Armenians lived in relative harmony with other groups, including the ruling Turks. However, as Christians under a strict Muslim [[social structure]], Armenians faced pervasive discrimination. In response to the [[1894 Sasun rebellion]], Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] organised state-sponsored massacres against the Armenians between 1894 and 1896, resulting in close to 200,000 deaths.{{sfn|Kévorkian|2011|p=11}} The [[Hamidian massacres]], as they came to be known, gave Abdul Hamid international infamy as the "Bloody Sultan"{{sfn|Suny|1993|p=99}} or the "Red Sultan".{{sfn|Kévorkian|2011|p=67}}

[[File:ErevanKhanate.gif|thumb|The [[ Oblast]] (1828–1840) included the territory of the former Erivan (marked in yellow) and Nakhichevan (marked in light green) khanates.]]

During the 1890s, the [[ Revolutionary Federation]], commonly known as the ''Dashnaktsutyun'', became active within the Ottoman Empire with the aim of unifying the various small groups in the empire that were advocating for reform and defending  villages from massacres that were widespread in some of the -populated areas of the empire. Dashnaktsutyun members also formed [[ fedayi]] groups that defended  civilians through armed resistance.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=177}} The Dashnaks also worked for the wider goal of creating a "free, independent and unified" , although they sometimes set aside this goal in favour of a more realistic approach, such as advocating autonomy.{{sfn|Suny|1993|p=100}}

The Ottoman Empire began to collapse, and in 1908, the [[Young Turk Revolution]] overthrew the government of Sultan Hamid. In April 1909, the [[Adana massacre]] occurred in the [[Adana Vilayet]] resulting in the deaths of as many as 20,000–30,000 Armenians. The Armenians living in the empire hoped that the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] would change their second-class status. The [[ reform package]] (1914) was presented as a solution by appointing an [[inspector general]] over  issues.

===World War I and the  genocide===
[[File:Morgenthau336.jpg|thumb|[[ genocide]] victims in 1915]]
The outbreak of World War I led to confrontation between the Ottoman Empire and the  Empire in the [[Caucasus campaign|Caucasus]] and [[Persian campaign (World War I)|Persian campaign]]s. The new government in [[Istanbul]] began to look on the Armenians with distrust and suspicion because the [[Imperial  Army]] contained a contingent of [[ volunteer units| volunteers]]. On 24 April 1915, [[Deportation of  intellectuals on 24 April 1915| intellectuals were arrested by Ottoman authorities]] and, with the [[Temporary Law of Deportation|Tehcir Law]] (29 May 1915), eventually a large proportion of Armenians living in [[Anatolia]] perished in what has become known as the [[ genocide]].

The genocide was implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly and infirmed on [[death march]]es leading to the [[ desert]]. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre.{{sfn|Walker|1990|pp=200-203}} There was local [[ resistance during the  genocide| resistance]] in the region, developed against the activities of the Ottoman Empire. The events of 1915 to 1917 are regarded by Armenians and the vast majority of Western historians to have been state-sponsored mass killings, or genocide.

 authorities deny the genocide took place to this day. The  genocide is acknowledged to have been one of the first modern genocides.{{sfn|Suny|1993|p=106}} According to the research conducted by [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], an estimated 600,000 Armenians died during deportation from 1915 to 1916. This figure, however, accounts for solely the first year of the genocide and does not take into account those who died or were killed after the report was compiled on 24 May 1916. The [[International Association of Genocide Scholars]] places the death toll at "more than a million". The total number of people killed has been most widely estimated at between 1 and 1.5 million.  and the  diaspora have been campaigning for [[ genocide recognition|official recognition]] of the events as genocide for over 30&nbsp;years. These events are traditionally commemorated yearly on 24 April, the  Martyr Day, or the Day of the  genocide.

===First Republic of ===
[[File:First Republic of .png|thumb|{{legend|#FF7F00|Territory held by [[First Republic of |]] and the [[Karabakh Council]] at some point}} {{legend|beige|Area given to  by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], which was never enforced}}]]
The [[Caucasus Army ( Empire, 1914–1917)|Imperial  Caucasus Army]], commanded by [[Nikolai Yudenich]], and the  volunteer units, led by [[Andranik Ozanian]] and [[Tovmas Nazarbekian]], succeeded in gaining much of Western  during World War I. However, their gains were lost with the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. At the time, -controlled Eastern , , and  attempted to bond together in the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]]. This federation, however, lasted from only February to May 1918, when all three parties decided to dissolve it. As a result, the Dashnak-dominated government of Eastern  declared its independence on 28 May as the [[First Republic of ]] under the leadership of [[Aram Manukian]].
[[File:Government-House-of-Republic-of--1918-1920.jpg|thumb|upright|The Government house of the [[First Republic of ]] (1918–1920)]]
The First Republic's short-lived independence was fraught with war, territorial disputes, [[Muslim uprisings in Kars and Sharur–Nakhichevan|ethnic unrest]], [[May Uprising|Bolshevik rebellions]], and a mass influx of refugees from Western , bringing with them disease and starvation. The [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] sought to help the newly founded  state through relief funds and other forms of support.

At the end of the war, the victorious powers sought to divide up the Ottoman Empire. Signed between the Allied Powers and the Ottoman Empire at [[Sèvres]] on 10 August 1920, the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] promised to maintain the existence of the  republic and to attach the former territories of Western  to it.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|pp=247-248}} Because the new borders of  were to be drawn by  President [[Woodrow Wilson]], Western  was also referred to as "[[Wilsonian ]]". In addition, just days prior on 5 August, [[Mihran Damadian]] of the  National Union, the de facto  administration in Cilicia, declared the independence of Cilicia as an  autonomous republic under  protectorate. There was even consideration of making  a [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] under the protection of the . The treaty, however, was rejected by the [[ National Movement]] and never came into effect.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|pp=247-248}}

In 1920,  nationalist forces [[ invasion of |invaded]] the fledgling  republic from the east. Under the command of [[Kâzım Karabekir]], they captured the  territories that Imperial  had annexed in 1878 and occupied Alexandropol (today [[Gyumri]]). Hostilities finally concluded with the [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] on 2 December 1920. The treaty forced  to disarm most of its military forces and to cede all former Ottoman territory granted to it by the Treaty of Sèvres. Simultaneously, the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|11th Red Army]], led by [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]], invaded  at Karavansarai (today [[Ijevan]]) on 29 November. By early December, Ordzhonikidze's forces entered Yerevan and the short-lived  republic collapsed.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1996b|pp=389–390}}

After the fall of the First Republic, the [[war communism]] policies of the new [[ Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet  government]] led to the [[February Uprising]] of 1921.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1996b|pp=405–406}} Following the defeat of that revolt,  forces under the command of [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] established the [[Republic of Mountainous ]] and continued to fight Soviet forces in the southern region of [[Zangezur]].{{sfn|Saparov|2015|pp=104-106}} To end the rebellion, Soviet authorities pledged to include the [[Syunik Province]] within 's borders.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|p=259}} The Red Army soon took control of the region, driving the leaders of the revolt out of , across the [[Aras (river)|Araks River]] into  on 15 July 1921.{{sfn|Saparov|2015|pp=104-106}}

====Sovietization to Stalinism====
Following 's [[Soviet invasion of |Sovietization]], the Treaty of Alexandropol was superseded by the [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Treaty of Moscow]] and the [[Treaty of Kars]]. In these agreements,  renounced its claims on [[Batumi]] to [[ Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet ]] in exchange for the provinces of [[Kars oblast|Kars]], [[Ardahan okrug|Ardahan]], and [[Surmalu uezd|Surmalu]], all of which had been under  military control since the  invasion of  in 1920. The territory ceded to  included the medieval  capital [[Ani]] and [[Mount Ararat]], the national symbol of the  people.{{sfn|Tsutsiev|2014|pp=74–76, 79}} Together with Soviet  and [[ Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet ]], Soviet  officially entered the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] as part of the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] (TSFSR) in March 1922.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|p=246}} The TSFSR later split into three separate republics in December 1936 – the  SSR, the  SSR, and the  SSR.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|p=266}}

[[Vladimir Lenin]], who "favored a moderate policy in ,"{{sfn|Shakarian|2025|p=49}} appointed [[Alexander Miasnikian]], an experienced administrator, to oversee affairs in the republic.{{sfn|Saparov|2015|p=103}} During the era of the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP),  enjoyed a period of stability and cultural revival within the USSR, in contrast to the turbulent years of the First Republic.{{sfn|Suny|1993|p=140}} However, after the [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|death of Lenin]] and the [[Joseph Stalin's rise to power|rise]] of [[Joseph Stalin]] to the Soviet leadership, the situation changed significantly. Armenians suffered greatly during [[ victims of the Great Purge|Stalin's Great Purge]], with [[Lavrentiy Beria]] playing an especially conspicuous role, beginning with the death of the popular Soviet  leader [[Aghasi Khanjian]] in 1936.{{sfn|Shakarian|2025|pp=14-15}}{{sfn|Suny|1993|pp=156-157}} The repressions claimed the lives of major  intellectual figures like [[Yeghishe Charents]], [[Axel Bakunts]], and [[Vahan Totovents]].{{sfn|Suny|1993|p=155}} The  Church also suffered in this period, culminating in the murder of the  Catholicos [[Khoren I of |Khoren I]], an act for which Beria is usually held responsible.

Nevertheless, an estimated 500,000 Armenians (nearly a third of the population) served in the [[Red Army]] during the war, and 175,000 died. A total of 117 citizens of Soviet , including 10 non-Armenians, were awarded [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. Six special military divisions were formed in  in 1941–42. Five of them, the [[89th Rifle Division|89th]], [[409th Rifle Division|409th]], [[408th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|408th]], [[390th Rifle Division|390th]], and [[76th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|76th]] Divisions, would have a distinguished war record, while the sixth was ordered to stay in  to guard the republic's western borders against a possible incursion by neighboring . The 89th Tamanyan Division, composed of ethnic Armenians, fought in the [[Battle of Berlin]]. Over 60 Armenians were promoted to the rank of general, while one attained the rank of [[Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union|Admiral]] ([[Ivan Isakov]]) and three achieved the rank of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] ([[Ivan Bagramyan]], [[Hamazasp Babadzhanian]], and [[Sergei Khudyakov]]).

After the [[State funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Stalin]] in 1953,  experienced a new period of liberalization under [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[Khrushchev Thaw|Thaw]]. In March 1954, two years before Khrushchev [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|denounced Stalin]], his close ally, the  statesman [[Anastas Mikoyan]], flew to Yerevan and called for the [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]] of Charents and the republication of the writers [[Raphael Patkanian]] and [[Raffi (novelist)|Raffi]].{{sfn|Shakarian|2025|pp=34-35}} During the Thaw, life in Soviet  soon began to see rapid improvement with greater investment in housing and the consumer economy. The  Church, which was limited under Stalin, was revived when [[Catholicos of All Armenians|Catholicos]] [[Vazgen I]] assumed the duties of his office in 1955.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|p=352}} In 1962, the massive statue of Stalin that towered over Yerevan was pulled down from its pedestal by troops and replaced with that of [[Mother ]] in 1967.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|p=349}} That same year, a memorial to the victims of the  genocide was built at the [[Tsitsernakaberd]] hill above the Hrazdan gorge in [[Yerevan]].{{sfn|Panossian|2006|p=349}} This occurred after [[1965 Yerevan demonstrations|mass demonstrations]] took place on the tragic event's fiftieth anniversary in 1965.

Following the [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] era, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms of ''[[glasnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]'' witnessed a major national revival in  with the rise of the [[Karabakh movement]]. Taking advantage of the new political climate, the Armenians of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO) of Soviet  began to demand unification with Soviet , citing [[Forced assimilation in |discrimination by Baku]].{{sfn|Suny|1993|pp=192-194}} Peaceful protests in  supporting the Karabakh Armenians became common. By the beginning of 1988, nearly one million Armenians from several regions of the republic engaged in these demonstrations, centered on Yerevan's Theater Square (today [[Freedom Square, Yerevan|Freedom Square]]). However, in neighboring , [[Sumgait pogrom|violence against Armenians]] erupted in the city of [[Sumgait]].{{sfn|Saparov|2015|p=166}} Ethnic rioting soon broke out between Armenians and Azeris, preventing any peaceful resolution from taking place.{{sfn|Tsutsiev|2014|p=113}} Compounding 's problems was a [[1988  earthquake|devastating earthquake]] in 1988 with a [[surface-wave magnitude]] of 6.8. Another major [[Baku pogrom|pogrom against Armenians]] in [[Baku]] in January 1990 forced almost all of the 200,000 Armenians in the  capital to flee to .

Gorbachev's inability to alleviate any of 's problems created disillusionment among the Armenians and fed a growing hunger for independence. On 23 August 1990,  declared its sovereignty on its territory. On 17 March 1991, , along with the [[Baltic states]],  and [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldova]], boycotted a nationwide [[1991 Soviet Union referendum|referendum]] in which 78% of all voters voted for the retention of the Soviet Union in a reformed form.
