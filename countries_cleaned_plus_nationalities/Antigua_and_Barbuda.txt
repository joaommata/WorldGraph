===Pre-colonial period===
{{Main|Pre-Columbian }}
[[Archaic period (North America)|Archaic-period]] hunter-gatherers called the [[Ciboney]] were the first culture present in . [[Radiocarbon dating|Carbon dating]] has established the earliest settlements started around 3100 BC. They were succeeded by the ceramic age pre-Columbian [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]]-speaking [[Saladoid]] people who migrated from the lower [[Orinoco River]]. They introduced agriculture, raising, among other crops, the famous [[Antigua Black Pineapple]] (''[[Ananas comosus]]''), [[maize|corn]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[chili pepper|chillies]], [[guava]], tobacco, and cotton. Later on the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] settled the island.

===European arrival and slavery===
[[Christopher Columbus]] was the first European to sight the islands in 1493. The  did not colonise Antigua until after a combination of European and African diseases, malnutrition, and slavery eventually extirpated most of the native population; [[smallpox]] was probably the greatest killer.

The  settled on Antigua in 1632; Christopher Codrington settled on Barbuda in 1685. Tobacco and then sugar was grown, worked by a large population of slaves transported from West Africa, who soon came to vastly outnumber the European settlers.

===Colonial era===
The  maintained control of the islands, repulsing an attempted  attack in 1666. The brutal conditions endured by the slaves led to revolts in 1701 and 1729 and a planned revolt in 1736, the last led by [[Prince Klaas]], though it was discovered before it began and the ringleaders were executed. [[Slavery]] was abolished in the  Empire in 1833, affecting the economy. This was exacerbated by natural disasters such as the 1843 earthquake and the 1847 hurricane. Mining occurred on the isle of [[Redonda]], however, this ceased in 1929 and the island has since remained uninhabited.

Part of the Leeward Islands colony,  became part of the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]] from 1958 to 1962.  subsequently became an associated state of the  with full internal autonomy on 27 February 1967. The 1970s were dominated by discussions as to the islands' future and the rivalry between [[Vere Bird]] of the [[ Labour Party]] (ABLP) (Premier from 1967 to 1971 and 1976 to 1981) and the [[Progressive Labour Movement]] (PLM) of [[George Walter]] (Premier 1971–1976). Eventually,  gained full independence on 1 November 1981; Vere Bird became prime minister of the new country. The country opted to remain within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], retaining [[Elizabeth II]] ({{reign|1952|2022}}) as [[Monarchy of |head of state]], with the first [[List of colonial governors and administrators of Antigua#Governors of  (1967–1981)|governor]], [[Wilfred Jacobs|Sir Wilfred Jacobs]], as [[Governor-general of |governor-general]]. Succeeding [[Wilfred Jacobs]] were [[James Carlisle]] (1993–2007), [[Louise Lake-Tack]] (2007–2014), and the present since 2014 being [[Rodney Williams (governor-general)|Rodney Williams]].

===Independence era===
The first two decades of Antigua's independence were dominated politically by the Bird family and the ABLP, with [[Vere Bird]] ruling from 1981 to 1994, followed by his son [[Lester Bird]] from 1994 to 2004. Though providing a degree of political stability, and boosting tourism to the country, the Bird governments were frequently accused of corruption, cronyism and financial malfeasance. [[Vere Bird Jr.]], the elder son, was forced to leave the cabinet in 1990 following a [[Guns for Antigua|scandal]] in which he was accused of smuggling  weapons to  drug-traffickers. Another son, [[Ivor Bird]], was convicted of possessing [[cocaine]] in 1995.

In 1995, [[Hurricane Luis]] caused severe damage on Barbuda.

The ABLP's dominance of  politics ended with the [[2004  general election]], which was won by [[Winston Baldwin Spencer]]'s [[United Progressive Party ()|United Progressive Party]] (UPP). Winston Baldwin Spencer was [[Prime Minister of ]] from 2004 to 2014. However the UPP lost the [[2014  general election]], with the ABLP returning to power under [[Gaston Browne]]. ABLP won 15 of the 17 seats in the [[2018  general election|2018 snap election]] under the leadership of incumbent Prime Minister Gaston Browne.

In 2016, [[Nelson's Dockyard]] was designated as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

Most of Barbuda was devastated in early September 2017 by [[Hurricane Irma]], which brought winds with speeds reaching 295&nbsp;km/h (185&nbsp;mph). The storm damaged or destroyed 95% of the island's buildings and infrastructure, leaving Barbuda "barely habitable" according to Prime Minister Gaston Browne. Nearly everyone on the island was evacuated to Antigua.
Amidst the following rebuilding efforts on Barbuda that were estimated to cost at least $100&nbsp;million, the government announced plans to revoke a century-old law of [[communal land|communal land ownership]] by allowing residents to buy land; a move that has been criticised as promoting "[[disaster capitalism]]".
