The area that is now  was settled in pre-Roman times by various [[Celt]]ic tribes, having been the core of the [[Hallstatt culture]] by the [[6th century BC]]. The city of [[Hallstatt]], in fact, has the oldest archaeological evidence of the Celts in Europe.

The Celtic [[Kingdom of Noricum]] that included most of modern  and parts of modern  was conquered by the [[Roman Empire]] in 16 BC and made a [[Roman province|province]] called [[Noricum]] which lasted until 476. The regions of today's  which were not located within the province of Noricum were divided between the Roman provinces of [[Pannonia]], which encompassed parts of eastern , and [[Raetia]], which encompassed the areas of present-day [[Vorarlberg]] and [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]].

Present-day Petronell-[[Carnuntum]] in eastern  was an important army camp turned capital city in what became known as the [[Pannonia Superior]]. Carnuntum was home to 50,000 people for nearly 400 years.

===Middle Ages===
After the [[fall of the Roman Empire]], the area was first invaded by the Germanic [[Rugii]] which made this region part of their "[[Rugiland]]". In 487, most of modern  was conquered by [[Odoacer]], a [[Barbarian kingdoms|barbarian]] soldier and statesman from the [[Middle Danube]], which incorporated most of today's  in his [[Kingdom of  (476-493)|Kingdom of ]]. By 493, it was conquered by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Ostrogoths]] which created their own kingdom, the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]]. Following the Kingdom's fall the area was invaded by the [[Alemanni]], [[Baiuvarii]], [[Slavs]], and [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]].

[[Charlemagne]], King of the [[Franks]], conquered the area in 788, encouraged colonisation, and introduced Christianity. As part of [[Eastern Francia]], the core areas that now encompass  were bequeathed to the house of [[Babenberg]]. The area was known as the ''[[March of |marchia Orientalis]]'' and was given to [[Leopold I of  (Babenberg)|Leopold of Babenberg]] in 976.

The first record showing the name  is from 996, where it is written as ''[[Ostarrîchi]]'', referring to the territory of the Babenberg March. In 1156, the [[Privilegium Minus]] elevated  to the status of a duchy. In 1192, the Babenbergs also acquired the Duchy of [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]]. With the death of [[Frederick II of |Frederick II]] in 1246, the line of the Babenbergs was extinguished.

As a result, [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] effectively assumed control of the duchies of , Styria, and [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]]. His reign came to an end with his defeat at [[Dürnkrut]] at the hands of [[Rudolph I of ]] in 1278. Thereafter, until World War I, 's history was largely that of its ruling dynasty, the [[Habsburgs]].

[[File:HRR 14Jh.jpg|thumb|Habsburg (orange),  (violet) and Wittelsbach (green) dominions within the Holy Roman Empire, 14th century]]

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburgs]] began to accumulate other provinces in the vicinity of the Duchy of . In 1438, Duke [[Albert V of ]] was chosen as the successor to his father-in-law, Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]]. Although Albert himself only reigned for a year, henceforth every emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was a Habsburg, with only one exception.

The Habsburgs began also to accumulate territory far from the hereditary lands. In 1477, Archduke [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]], only son of Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]], married the heiress Maria of [[County of Burgundy|Burgundy]], thus acquiring most of the [[]] for the family. In 1496, his son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Fair]] married [[Joanna the Mad]], the heiress of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], thus acquiring  and its , African, [[|Asian]], and [[New World]] appendages for the Habsburgs.

In 1526, following the [[Battle of Mohács]], [[Bohemia]] and the part of [[]] not occupied by the Ottomans came under  rule. [[Ottoman– Wars|Ottoman expansion]] into  led to [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|frequent conflicts]] between the two empires, particularly evident in the [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] of 1593 to 1606. The Turks made incursions into [[Styria]] nearly 20 times, of which some are cited as "burning, pillaging, and taking thousands of slaves". In late September 1529, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] launched the first [[Siege of Vienna (1529)|siege of Vienna]], which unsuccessfully ended, according to Ottoman historians, with the snowfalls of an early beginning winter.

===17th and 18th centuries===
[[File:Anonym Entsatz Wien 1683.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Vienna]] in 1683 broke the advance of the [[Ottoman Empire]] into Europe.]]

During the long reign of [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]] following the successful [[Battle of Vienna|defence of Vienna]] against the Turks in 1683, under the command of the King of  [[John III Sobieski]], the [[Great  War]] resulted in most of  being controlled by . This arrangement was formalized in the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699.

[[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]] relinquished many of the gains the empire made in the previous years. He enjoyed the imminent extinction of the [[House of Habsburg]]. Charles VI was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for recognition of the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]]. Therefore, his daughter [[Maria Theresa]] was recognized as his heir. With the rise of [[Prussia]], the [[–Prussia rivalry]] began in .  participated, together with Prussia and , in the first and the third of the three [[Partitions of ]] in 1772 and 1795 respectively.

From that time,  became the birthplace of [[classical music]] and played host to different composers including [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], and [[Franz Schubert]].

[[File:Congress of Vienna.PNG|thumb|left|The [[Congress of Vienna]] met in 1814–15. The objective of the Congress was to settle the many issues arising from the [[ Revolutionary Wars]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].]]

 engaged in war with [[Revolutionary ]], as part of the First and Second Coalitions, and subsequently in the Napoleonic Wars. From 1792 to 1801, the  had suffered 754,700 casualties. The Hapsburg rulers of  and the Holy Roman Empire suffered successive defeats at the hands of [[Napoleon]] Bonaparte. To protect their status as an imperial dynasty after Napoleon proclaimed the  Empire, the [[ Empire|Empire of ]] was founded in 1804, and to prevent Napoleon from claiming their previous Imperial throne, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was abolished 1806. In 1814,  was part of the coalition of Allied forces that invaded  and brought to an end the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

The  Empire emerged from the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 as one of the continent's four dominant powers and a recognized [[great power]]. The same year, the [[ Confederation]] ({{Lang|de|Deutscher Bund}}) was founded under the presidency of . Because of unsolved social, political, and national conflicts, the  lands were shaken by the [[1848 revolutions]] aiming to create a unified .

[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|Map of the [[ Confederation]] with its 39-member sovereign states]]

The possibilities for a unified  were: a [[Kleindeutschland and Großdeutschland|Greater ]] or a [[ of Greater |Greater ]] or a  Confederation without  at all. In 1864,  and Prussia fought together against [[]] and secured the independence from  of the duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. As they could not agree on how the two duchies should be administered, though they fought the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866. Defeated by Prussia in the [[Battle of Königgrätz]],  had to leave the  Confederation and no longer took part in  politics.As 's Habsburg monarchy was not willing to join its -speaking territory to the [[Unification of | Empire of 1871]], and relinquish its non--speaking territories, the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the Prussian King [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]].

To settle issues lingering from the suppressed [[ Revolution of 1848]], the [[Austro- Compromise of 1867]], the ''Ausgleich'', provided for a dual sovereignty, the [[ Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of ]], under [[Franz Joseph I of |Franz Joseph I]]. The - rule of this diverse empire included various groups, including [[]], [[]], Croats, , [[ people|Poles]], [[Rusyns]], Serbs, , , and , as well as large  and  communities.

As a result, ruling - became increasingly difficult in an age of emerging nationalist movements, requiring considerable reliance on an expanded secret police. Yet, the government of  tried its best to be accommodating in some respects: for example, the ''Reichsgesetzblatt'', publishing the laws and ordinances of [[Cisleithania]], was issued in eight languages; and all national groups were entitled to schools in their own language and to the use of their mother tongue at state offices.

[[File:  ethnic.svg|thumb|An ethnic map of [[-]], 1910]]

Many   of all different social circles such as [[Georg Ritter von Schönerer]] promoted strong [[ nationalism in |pan-Germanism]] in the hope of reinforcing an ethnic  identity amongst   and the annexation of  to  (''[[Anschluss]]''). Some  such as [[Karl Lueger]] also used pan-Germanism as a form of populism to further their own political goals. Although Bismarck's policies excluded  and the   from , many  pan- idolised him and wore blue cornflowers, known to be the favourite flower of  Emperor [[William I,  Emperor|William I]], in their buttonholes, along with cockades in the  national colours (black, red, and yellow), although they were both temporarily banned in  schools, as a way to show discontent towards the multi-ethnic empire.

's exclusion from  caused many  a problem with their national identity and prompted the Social Democratic Leader [[Otto Bauer]] to state that it was "the conflict between our  and  character". The Austro- Empire caused ethnic tension between the   and the other ethnic groups. Many , especially those involved with the pan- movements, desired a reinforcement of an ethnic  identity and hoped that the empire would collapse, which would allow an [[Anschluss|annexation of  by ]].

Many  pan- nationalists protested passionately against minister-president [[Count Kasimir Felix Badeni|Kasimir Count Badeni]]'s language decree of 1897, which made  and  co-official languages in Bohemia and required new government officials to be fluent in both languages. This meant in practice that the civil service would almost exclusively hire  because most middle-class  spoke  but not the other way around. The support of [[ultramontanism|ultramontane]] Catholic politicians and clergy for this reform triggered the launch of the ''[[Away from Rome]]'' movement, which was initiated by supporters of Schönerer and called on "" Christians to leave the Roman Catholic Church.

===Early 20th century ===

As the [[Second Constitutional Era]] began in the [[Ottoman Empire]], - took the opportunity to annex [[ in -|]] in 1908. The [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of |assassination]] of Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of |Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]] in 1914 by  Serb [[Gavrilo Princip]] was used by leading  politicians and generals to persuade the emperor to declare war on , thereby risking and prompting the outbreak of World War I, which eventually led to the dissolution of the Austro- Empire. Over one million Austro- soldiers died in World War I.

On 21 October 1918, the elected  members of the ''Reichsrat'' (parliament of Imperial ) met in Vienna as the Provisional National Assembly for   (''Provisorische Nationalversammlung für Deutschösterreich''). On 30 October the assembly founded the [[Republic of -]] by appointing a government, called ''Staatsrat''. This new government was invited by the Emperor to take part in the decision on the planned armistice with  but refrained from this business.

This left the responsibility for the end of the war, on 3 November 1918, solely to the emperor and his government. On 11 November, the emperor, advised by ministers of the old and the new governments, declared he would not take part in state business any more; on 12 November, -, by law, declared itself to be a democratic republic and part of the new  republic. The constitution, renaming the ''Staatsrat'' as ''Bundesregierung'' (federal government) and ''Nationalversammlung'' as ''Nationalrat'' (national council) was passed on 10 November 1920.

The [[Treaty of -Germain]] of 1919 (for  the [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920) confirmed and consolidated the new order of Central Europe which to a great extent had been established in November 1918, creating new states and altering others. The -speaking parts of  which had been part of - were reduced to a rump state named the Republic of - (: ''Republik Deutschösterreich''), though excluding the predominantly -speaking [[South Tyrol]]. The desire for the annexation of  to  was a popular opinion shared by all social circles in both  and . On 12 November, - was declared a republic, and named Social Democrat [[Karl Renner]] as provisional chancellor. On the same day it drafted a provisional constitution that stated that "- is a democratic republic" (Article 1) and "- is an integral part of the  Reich" (Article 2). The Treaty of  Germain and the [[Treaty of Versailles]] explicitly forbade union between  and . The treaties also forced - to rename itself as "Republic of " which consequently led to the first [[First  Republic| Republic]].

Over three million -speaking  found themselves living outside the new  Republic as minorities in the newly formed or enlarged states of [[]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[]], and . These included the provinces of [[South Tyrol]], and [[ Bohemia]]. The status of  Bohemia and [[Sudetenland]] later played a role in World War II.

The border between  and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was settled with the [[Carinthian Plebiscite]] in October 1920 and allocated the major part of the territory of the former Austro- Crownland of [[Carinthia]] to . This set the border on the [[Karawanks]] mountain range, with many  remaining in .

After the war, inflation began to devalue the Krone, which was still 's currency. In the autumn of 1922,  was granted an international loan supervised by the [[League of Nations]]. The purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy, stabilise the currency, and improve 's general economic condition. The loan meant that  passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the League of Nations. In 1925, the ''[[ schilling]]'' was introduced, replacing the Krone at a rate of 10,000:1. Later, it was nicknamed the "Alpine dollar" due to its stability. From 1925 to 1929 the economy enjoyed a short high before nearly crashing after [[Wall Street crash of 1929|Black Tuesday]].

The [[First  Republic]] lasted until 1933, when Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], using what he called [[Selbstausschaltung des Parlaments|"self-switch-off of Parliament"]], established an autocratic regime tending towards [[ fascism]]. The two big parties at this time, the Social Democrats and the Conservatives, had paramilitary armies; the Social Democrats' ''[[Republikanischer Schutzbund]]'' was now declared illegal, but was still operative as the 12–15 February 1934 [[ Civil War]] broke out.

In February 1934, several members of the ''Schutzbund'' were executed, the Social Democratic party was outlawed, and many of its members were imprisoned or emigrated. On 1 May 1934, the [[Austrofascism|Austrofascists]] imposed a new constitution ("Maiverfassung") which cemented Dollfuss's power, but on 25 July he was assassinated in an [[ Nazi]] [[July Putsch|coup attempt]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0922-500, Wien, Heldenplatz, Rede Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]] speaking at [[Heldenplatz]], Vienna, 1938]]
His successor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] acknowledged the fact that  was a " state" and he also believed that  were "better " but he wished that  would remain independent. He announced a [[referendum]] on 9 March 1938, to be held on 13 March, concerning 's independence from .

==== Nazi rule ====
On 12 March 1938,  Nazis took over the government, while  troops occupied the country, which prevented Schuschnigg's referendum from taking place. On 13 March 1938, the ''[[Anschluss]]'' ({{literal translation|joining|connection}}) of  was officially declared. Two days later, -born [[Adolf Hitler]] announced what he called the "reunification" of his home country with the "rest of the [[Nazi | Reich]]" on Vienna's [[Heldenplatz]]. He established a referendum which confirmed the union with  in April 1938.

Parliamentary elections were held in  (including recently annexed ) on 10 April 1938. They were the final elections to the Reichstag during Nazi rule, and they took the form of a single-question referendum asking whether voters approved of a single Nazi-party list for the 813-member Reichstag, as well as the recent annexation of  (the ''[[Anschluss]]''). Jews, Roma and Sinti were not allowed to vote. Turnout in the election was officially 99.5%, with 98.9% voting "yes". In the case of , Adolf Hitler's native soil, 99.71% of an electorate of 4,484,475 officially went to the ballots, with a positive tally of 99.73 percent. Although most  favoured the ''Anschluss'', in certain parts of , the  soldiers were not always welcomed with flowers and joy, especially in Vienna, which had 's largest Jewish population. Nevertheless, despite the propaganda and the manipulation and rigging which surrounded the ballot box result, there was massive genuine support for Hitler for fulfilling the ''Anschluss'', since many  from both  and  saw it as completing the long overdue unification of all  into one state.

[[File:OstmarkMap.png|thumb|upright=1.25| in 1941 when it was known as the "Ostmark"]]
On 13 March 1938,  was annexed by the [[Third Reich]] and ceased to exist as an independent country (the ''Anschluss''). The [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanisation]] of the wealth of Jewish  started immediately in mid-March, with a so-called "wild" (i.e. extra-legal) phase, but it was soon structured legally and bureaucratically so the assets which Jewish citizens possessed could be stripped from them. At that time, [[Adolf Eichmann]], who grew up in , was transferred to Vienna and ordered to persecute the Jews. During the November pogrom in 1938 ("Reichskristallnacht"), Jews and Jewish institutions such as synagogues were subjected to violent attacks in Vienna, Klagenfurt, Linz, Graz, Salzburg, Innsbruck and several cities in Lower . [[Otto von Habsburg]], a vehement opponent of the Nazis, the last Crown Prince of -, an honorary citizen of hundreds of places in  and partly envisaged by Schuschnigg as a monarchical option, was in  at the time. He spoke out against the Anschluss and was then wanted by the Nazi regime and his property would have been expropriated and he would have been shot immediately if he were caught. In 1938, the Nazis renamed  the "[[Ostmark ()|Ostmark]]", a name which it had until 1942, when it was renamed the "Alpine and Danubian Gaue" (Alpen-und Donau-Reichsgaue).

Though  made up only 8% of the population of the Third Reich, some of the most prominent Nazis were native , including [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]], [[Franz Stangl]], [[Alois Brunner]], [[Friedrich Rainer]], and [[Odilo Globocnik]], as were over 13% of the members of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and 40% of the staff at the Nazi [[extermination camp]]s. In the [[ under National Socialism|Reichsgau]], besides the main camp [[Mauthausen concentration camp|KZ-Mauthausen]], there were numerous sub-camps in all provinces where Jews and other prisoners were killed, tortured and exploited. At this time, because the territory was outside the operational radius of Allied aircraft, the armaments industry was greatly expanded through the forced labour of concentration camp prisoners, this was especially the case with regard to the manufacture of fighter planes, tanks and missiles.

Most of the [[ resistance|resistance groups]] were soon crushed by the [[Gestapo]]. While the plans of the group around [[Karl Burian]] to blow up the Gestapo's headquarters in Vienna were uncovered, the important group around the later executed priest [[Heinrich Maier]] managed to contact the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. This so-called Maier-Messner group was able to send the Allies information about armaments factories where [[V-1 flying bomb]]s, [[V-2 rocket]]s, [[Tiger I|Tiger tanks]], and aircraft ([[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], [[Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet]], etc.) were manufactured, information which was important to the success of [[Operation Crossbow]] and [[Operation Hydra (1943)|Operation Hydra]], both of which were preliminary missions before the launch of [[Operation Overlord]]. This resistance group, which was in contact with the  secret service ([[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]]), soon provided information about mass executions and [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] such as [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. The group's aim was to cause Nazi  to lose the war as quickly as possible and re-establish an independent .

=== Allied occupation ===
Vienna fell on 13 April 1945, during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Vienna offensive]], just before the total collapse of the Third Reich. The invading Allied powers, in particular the , planned for the supposed "Alpine Fortress Operation" of a national redoubt, that was largely to have taken place on  soil in the mountains of the [[Eastern Alps]]. However, it never materialised because of the rapid collapse of the Reich.

[[Karl Renner]] and [[Adolf Schärf]] ([[Social Democratic Party of |Socialist Party of ]]), Leopold Kunschak ([[Christian Social Party ()|Christian Social Party]]), and [[Johann Koplenig]] ([[Communist Party of ]]) declared 's secession from the Third Reich by the Declaration of Independence on 27 April 1945 and set up a [[provisional government]] in Vienna under state Chancellor Renner the same day, with the approval of the victorious [[Red Army]] and backed by [[Joseph Stalin]]. (The date is officially named the birthday of the second republic.) At the end of April, most of western and southern  were still under Nazi rule. On 1 May 1945, the [[Federal Constitutional Law]] of 1920, which had been terminated by dictator Dollfuss on 1 May 1934, was declared valid again. The total number of [[World War II casualties#endnote | military deaths]] from 1939 to 1945 was 260,000. The total number of Jewish [[The Holocaust in | Holocaust]] victims was 65,000. About 140,000 Jewish  had fled from the country in 1938–39. Thousands of  had taken part in serious Nazi crimes (hundreds of thousands of people died in the [[Mauthausen concentration camp|Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] alone), a fact which was officially acknowledged by Chancellor [[Franz Vranitzky]] in 1992.[[File:Uno City Kaiserwasser.jpg|thumb|right|The [[United Nations Office in Vienna]]]]
[[Allied-occupied ]] was after [[World War II]] divided into [[military occupation]] zones.  was governed by the [[Allied Commission for ]]. As stipulated in the [[Moscow Declaration]] of 1943 a subtle difference was seen in the treatment of  by the Allies.

The  government, consisting of Social Democrats, Conservatives, and Communists resided in [[Vienna]], which was surrounded by the Soviet zone. This  government was recognised by the [[allies of World War II]] in October 1945 despite concerns that [[Karl Renner]] could be Stalin's puppet. On 26 July 1946 the  Parliament passed its first [[nationalization]] law and approximately 70 mining and manufacturing companies were seized by the  state. The Ministry of Property Protection and Economic Planning (''Ministerium für Vermögenssicherung und Wirtschaftsplanung'') was responsible for directing the nationalized industries under the directorship of Minister [[Peter Krauland]] (party ÖVP).

=== Independence ===
On 15 May 1955, after talks which lasted for years and were influenced by the [[Cold War]]  regained full independence by concluding the [[ State Treaty]] with the allies of World War II. On 26 October 1955, all occupation troops had left and  declared its ''permanent neutrality'' by an act of parliament. This day is now 's [[National Day]], a public holiday.

The status of [[Tyrol]] was a lingering problem between  and [[]]. To this day, there are 20 different squares in  cities called "Südtiroler Platz" (South Tyrolean Square) in memory of the supposed loss of the  territories. Terrorist acts by the [[South Tyrolean independence movement]] have been documented in the 1950s and 1960s. A great degree of autonomy was granted to Tyrol by the  national government.

The political system of the [[Second  Republic|Second Republic]] is based on the constitution of 1920 and 1929, which was reintroduced in 1945. The system came to be characterised by ''[[Proporz]]'', whereby most posts of political importance were split proportionately between members of the [[Social Democratic Party of ]] (SPÖ) and the [[ People's Party]] (ÖVP). Interest group "chambers" with mandatory membership (e.g. for workers, business people, farmers) grew to considerable importance and were usually consulted in the legislative process, so hardly any legislation was passed that did not reflect widespread consensus.

Since 1945, governing via a single-party government has occurred twice: 1966–1970 (ÖVP) and 1970–1983 (SPÖ). During all other legislative periods, either a [[grand coalition]] of SPÖ and ÖVP or a "small coalition" (one of these two and a smaller party) ruled the country.

[[Kurt Waldheim]], the former secretary-general of the [[United Nations]], was elected President of  from 1986 to 1992. He had been a Wehrmacht officer in the Second World War and was [[ – the Nazis' first victim#Waldheim Affair|accused of war crimes]].

Following a [[1994  European Union membership referendum|referendum in 1994]], at which consent reached a majority of two-thirds, the country became a member of the [[European Union]] on 1 January 1995.

The major parties SPÖ and ÖVP have contrary opinions about the future status of 's military nonalignment: While the SPÖ in public supports a neutral role, the ÖVP argues for stronger integration into the EU's security policy; even a future NATO membership is not ruled out by some ÖVP politicians (ex. Werner Fasslabend (ÖVP) in 1997). In reality,  is taking part in the EU's [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]], participates in [[peacekeeping]] and peace creating tasks, and has become a member of [[NATO]]'s "[[Partnership for Peace]]"; the constitution has been amended accordingly. Since [[]] joined the [[Schengen Area]] in 2011, none of 's neighbouring countries performs border controls towards it anymore.
