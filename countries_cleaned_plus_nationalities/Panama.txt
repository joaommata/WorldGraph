The [[Isthmus of ]] was formed about three&nbsp;million years ago when the land bridge between North and South America finally became complete, and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions. The existence of the [[isthmus]] affected the dispersal of people, agriculture and technology throughout the Americas from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities.

The earliest discovered artifacts of [[Indigenous peoples of |indigenous peoples]] in  include [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-]] [[projectile point]]s. Later central  was home to some of the first [[pottery]]-making in the Americas, for example the cultures at [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]], which date back to 2500–1700 BC. These evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials (dating to c. 500–900 AD) at the [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]] [[archaeological site]], and their [[Gran Coclé]] style [[polychrome pottery]]. The monumental [[monolith]]ic sculptures at the [[Barriles]] (Chiriqui) site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures.

Before Europeans arrived  was widely settled by [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan]], [[Chocoan]], and [[Cueva people|Cueva]] peoples. The largest group were the Cueva (whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented). The size of the [[Indigenous peoples of |indigenous]] population of the isthmus at the time of European colonization is uncertain. Estimates range as high as two million people, but more recent studies place that number closer to 200,000. Archaeological finds and testimonials by early European explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developed{{clarify|date=August 2016|reason=Is this an anthropological term?}} by regular regional routes of commerce. [[Austronesians]] had a trade network to  as there is evidence of [[coconuts]] reaching the Pacific coast of  from the [[]] in [[Columbian Exchange|Precolumbian]] times.

When  was colonized, the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands. Scholars believe that [[Infection|infectious disease]] was the primary cause of the population decline of the natives. The indigenous peoples had no [[Adaptive immune system|acquired immunity]] to diseases such as [[smallpox]] which had been chronic in [[Eurasia]]n populations for centuries.

[[Rodrigo de Bastidas]] sailed westward from [[]] in 1501 in search of gold, and became the first European to explore the isthmus of . A year later, [[Christopher Columbus]] visited the isthmus, and established a short-lived settlement in the province of [[Darién Province|Darien]]. [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]'s tortuous trek from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1513 demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas, and  quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of 's empire in the [[New World]]. King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] assigned [[Pedro Arias Dávila]] as Royal Governor. He arrived in June 1514 with 19 vessels and 1,500 men. In 1519, Dávila founded [[ City]]. Gold and silver were brought by ship from South America, hauled across the isthmus, and loaded aboard ships for . The route became known as the Camino Real, or Royal Road, although it was more commonly known as Camino de Cruces (Road of Crosses) because of the number of gravesites along the way. At 1520 the Genoese controlled the port of . The Genoese obtained a concession from the  to exploit the port of  mainly for the slave trade, until the destruction of the primeval city in 1671. In the meantime in 1635 Don [[Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera]], the then governor of , had recruited [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]], Peruvians, and Panamanians, as soldiers to wage war against Muslims in the  and to found the city [[Zamboanga City|of Zamboanga]].

 was under [[ Empire| rule]] for almost 300 years (1538–1821), and became part of the [[Viceroyalty of ]], along with all other  possessions in South America. From the outset,  identity was based on a sense of "geographic destiny", and  fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus. The colonial experience spawned  nationalism and a racially complex and highly stratified society, the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalism.

 authorities had little control over much of the territory of . Large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until late in the colonial era. Because of this, indigenous people of the area were often referred to as "indios de guerra" (war Indians). However,  was important to  strategically because it was the easiest way to ship silver mined in  to Europe. Silver cargoes were landed on the west coast of  and then taken overland to [[Portobelo, Colón|Portobello]] or [[Nombre de Dios, Colón|Nombre de Dios]] on the Caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment. Aside from the European route, there was also an Asian- route, which led to traders and adventurers carrying silver from [[]] going over land through  to reach Acapulco,  before sailing to Manila,  using the famed [[Manila galleon]]s. In 1579, the royal monopoly that Acapulco,  had on trading with Manila,  was relaxed and  was assigned as another port that was able to trade directly with Asia.

Because of incomplete  control, the  route was vulnerable to attack from pirates (mostly  and ), and from "new world" Africans called [[cimarron people ()|cimarrons]] who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or ''palenques'' around the Camino Real in 's Interior, and on some of the islands off 's Pacific coast. One such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under [[Bayano]], which emerged in the 1552 to 1558 period. Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s famous raids on  in 1572–73 and [[John Oxenham]]'s crossing to the Pacific Ocean were aided by  cimarrons, and  authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in 1582.

The following elements helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within  well before the rest of the colonies: the prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries (1540–1740) while contributing to colonial growth; the placing of extensive regional judicial authority (Real Audiencia) as part of its jurisdiction; and the pivotal role it played at the height of the  Empire – the first modern global empire.

 was the site of the ill-fated [[Darien scheme]], which set up a [[Kingdom of Scotland|]] colony in the region in 1698. This failed for a number of reasons, and the ensuing debt contributed to the [[Acts of Union 1707|union of England and Scotland in 1707]].

In 1671, the [[privateer]] [[Henry Morgan]], licensed by the  government, [[Henry Morgan's  expedition|sacked and burned]] the city of [[Panamá Viejo|]] – the second most important city in the  New World at the time. In 1717 the [[viceroyalty of New Granada]] (northern South America) was created in response to other Europeans trying to take  territory in the Caribbean region. The Isthmus of  was placed under its jurisdiction. However, the remoteness of New Granada's capital, [[Santa Fe de Bogotá]] (the modern capital of [[]]) proved a greater obstacle than the  crown anticipated as the authority of New Granada was contested by the seniority, closer proximity, and previous ties to the [[viceroyalty of ]] and even by 's own initiative. This uneasy relationship between  and Bogotá would persist for centuries.

In 1744, Bishop Francisco Javier de Luna Victoria DeCastro established the [[College of San Ignacio de Loyola]] and on June 3, 1749, founded La Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Javier. By this time, however, 's importance and influence had become insignificant as 's power dwindled in Europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted ships to round [[Cape Horn]] in order to reach the Pacific. While the  route was short it was also labor-intensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and laden-down trek required to get from the one coast to the other.

As the [[  wars of independence]] were heating up all across Latin America,  City was preparing for independence; however, their plans were accelerated by the unilateral Grito de La Villa de Los Santos (Cry From the Town of Saints), issued on November 10, 1821, by the residents of [[Azuero Peninsula|Azuero]] without backing from  City to declare their separation from the  Empire. In both [[Veraguas]] and the capital this act was met with disdain, although on differing levels. To Veraguas, it was the ultimate act of treason, while to the capital, it was seen as inefficient and irregular, and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans.

Nevertheless, the Grito was a sign, on the part of the residents of Azuero, of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital. Those in the capital region in turn regarded the Azueran movement with contempt, since the separatists in  City believed that their counterparts in Azuero were fighting not only for independence from , but also for their right to self-rule apart from  City once the Spaniards were gone.

It was seen as a risky move on the part of Azuero, which lived in fear of Colonel [[History of #José de Fábrega|José Pedro Antonio de Fábrega y de las Cuevas]] (1774–1841). The colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus' military supplies in his hands. They feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists.

What they had counted on, however, was the influence of the separatists in the capital. Ever since October 1821, when the former Governor General, [[Juan de la Cruz Mourgeón|Juan de la Cruz Murgeón]], left the isthmus on a campaign in [[Quito]] and left a colonel in charge, the separatists had been slowly converting Fábrega to the separatist side. So, by November 10, Fábrega was now a supporter of the independence movement. Soon after the separatist declaration of Los Santos, Fábrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the city's support for independence. No military repercussions occurred because of skillful bribing of royalist troops.

In the 80 years following independence from ,  was a [[Subdivisions of Gran |subdivision of Gran ]], after voluntarily joining the country at the end of 1821. It then became part of the [[Republic of New Granada]] in 1831 and was divided into several [[Provinces of the Republic of New Granada|provinces]]. In 1855, the autonomous [[ State|State of ]] was created within the Republic out of the New Granada provinces of , Azuero, Chiriquí, and Veraguas. It continued as a state in the [[Granadine Confederation]] (1858–1863) and [[ of ]] (1863–1886). The [[ Constitution of 1886|1886 constitution]] of the modern Republic of [[]] created a [[ Department (1886)|new  Department]].

The people of the isthmus made over 80 attempts to secede from . They came close to success in 1831, then again during the [[Thousand Days' War]] of 1899–1902, understood among Indigenous Panamanians as a struggle for land rights under the leadership of Victoriano Lorenzo.

The US intent to influence the area, especially the  Canal's construction and control, led to the [[secession of  from ]] in 1903 and its political independence. When the [[Senate of ]] rejected the [[Hay–Herrán Treaty]] on January 22, 1903, the  decided to support and encourage the  secessionist movement.

In November 1903, , tacitly supported by the , proclaimed its independence and concluded the [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]] with the  without the presence of a single . [[Philippe Bunau-Varilla]], a  engineer and lobbyist represented  even though 's president and a delegation had arrived in New York to negotiate the treaty. Bunau-Varilla was a shareholder in a  company (the ''Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de ''), which had acquired the rights of the original  company which had gone bankrupt in 1889.{{sfn|McCullough|1977|pp=276-282}} The treaty was quickly drafted and signed the night before the  delegation arrived in Washington. The treaty granted rights to the  "as if it were sovereign" in a [[ Canal Zone|zone]] roughly {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long. In that zone, the US would build a canal, then administer, fortify, and defend it "in perpetuity".

[[File: Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|thumb|Construction work on the [[Gaillard Cut]] of the  Canal, 1907]]

In 1914, the  completed the existing {{convert|83|km||adj=mid|abbr=off|-long|sp=us}} canal.

Because of the strategic importance of the canal during [[World War II]], the US extensively fortified access to it.

From 1903 to 1968,  was a [[constitutional democracy]] dominated by a commercially oriented [[oligarchy]]. During the 1950s, the  military began to challenge the oligarchy's political hegemony. The early 1960s saw also the beginning of sustained pressure in  for the renegotiation of the [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]], including riots that broke out in early 1964, resulting in widespread looting and dozens of deaths, and the evacuation of the  embassy.

Amid negotiations for the Robles–Johnson treaty,  held [[1968  general election|elections in 1968]]. The candidates were:
* Dr. [[Arnulfo Arias]] Madrid, Unión Nacional (National Union)
* Antonio González Revilla, [[People's Party ()|Democracia Cristiana]] (Christian Democrats)
* Engr. David Samudio, Alianza del Pueblo (People's Alliance), who had the government's support.

Arias Madrid was declared the winner of elections that were marked by violence and accusations of fraud against Alianza del Pueblo. On October 1, 1968, Arias Madrid took office as president of , promising to lead a government of "national union" that would end the reigning corruption and pave the way for a new . A week and a half later, on October 11, 1968, the National Guard (Guardia Nacional) [[1968  coup d'état|ousted]] Arias and initiated the downward spiral that would culminate with the ' invasion in 1989. Arias, who had promised to respect the hierarchy of the National Guard, broke the pact and started a large restructuring of the Guard. To preserve the Guard's and his vested interests, Lieutenant Colonel [[Omar Torrijos]] Herrera and Major Boris Martínez commanded another military coup against the government.

The military justified itself by declaring that Arias Madrid was trying to install a dictatorship, and promised a return to constitutional rule. In the meantime, the Guard began a series of populist measures that would gain support for the coup. Among them were:
* Price freezing on food, medicine and other goods until January 31, 1969
* rent level freeze
* legalization of the permanence of squatting families in boroughs surrounding the historic site of  Viejo
Parallel to this, the military began a policy of repression against the opposition, who were labeled communists. The military appointed a Provisional Government Junta that was to arrange new elections. However, the National Guard would prove to be very reluctant to abandon power and soon began calling itself ''El Gobierno Revolucionario'' (The Revolutionary Government).

====Post-1970====
[[File:Omar Torrijos with  farmers.jpg|thumb|[[Omar Torrijos]] (right) with farmers in the  countryside. The Torrijos government was well known for its policies of [[land redistribution]].]]

Under [[Omar Torrijos]]'s control, the military transformed the political and economic structure of the country, initiating massive coverage of social security services and expanding public education.

The constitution was changed in 1972. To reform the constitution, the military created a new organization, the Assembly of Corregimiento Representatives, which replaced the National Assembly. The new assembly, also known as the Poder Popular (Power of the People), was composed of 505 members selected by the military with no participation from political parties, which the military had eliminated. The new constitution proclaimed [[Omar Torrijos]] as the Maximum Leader of the  Revolution, and conceded him unlimited power for six years, although, to keep a façade of constitutionality, [[Demetrio B. Lakas]] was appointed president for the same period.

In 1981, Torrijos died in a plane crash. Torrijos' death altered the tone of 's political evolution. Despite the [[1983  constitutional referendum|1983 constitutional amendments]] which proscribed a political role for the military, the [[ Defense Forces| Defense Force]] (PDF), as they were then known, continued to dominate  political life. By this time, General [[Manuel Noriega|Manuel Antonio Noriega]] was firmly in control of both the PDF and the civilian government.{{when|date=May 2016}}

In the [[1984  general election|1984 elections]], the candidates were:
* [[Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino]], supported by the military in a union called UNADE
* Arnulfo Arias Madrid, for the opposition union ADO
* ex-General [[Rubén Darío Paredes]], who had been forced to an early retirement by Manuel Noriega, running for the Partido Nacionalista Popular (PAP; "Popular Nationalist Party")
* Carlos Iván Zúñiga, running for the Partido Acción Popular (PAPO; Popular Action Party)
Barletta was declared the winner of elections that had been considered to be fraudulent. Barletta inherited a country in economic ruin and hugely indebted to the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]]. Amid the economic crisis and Barletta's efforts to calm the country's creditors, street protests arose, and so did military repression.

Meanwhile, Noriega's regime had fostered a well-hidden criminal economy that operated as a parallel source of income for the military and their allies, providing revenues from drugs and [[money laundering]]. Toward the end of the military dictatorship, a new wave of  migrants arrived on the isthmus in the hope of migrating to the . The smuggling of  became an enormous business, with revenues of up to 200 million dollars for Noriega's regime (see Mon 167).

The military dictatorship assassinated or tortured more than one hundred Panamanians and forced at least a hundred more dissidents into exile. (see Zárate 15). Noriega's regime was supported by the  and it began playing a double role in Central America. While the [[Contadora group]], an initiative launched by the foreign ministers of various Latin  nations including 's, conducted diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region, Noriega supplied  [[Contras]] and other guerrillas in the region with weapons and ammunition on behalf of the CIA.

On June 6, 1987, the recently retired Colonel Roberto Díaz Herrera, resentful that Noriega had broken the agreed-upon "Torrijos Plan" of succession that would have made him the chief of the military after Noriega, decided to denounce the regime. He revealed details of electoral fraud, accused Noriega of planning Torrijos's death and declared that Torrijos had received 12 million dollars from the Shah of  for giving the exiled  leader asylum. He also accused Noriega of the assassination by decapitation of then-opposition leader, Dr. [[Hugo Spadafora]].

On the night of June 9, 1987, the Cruzada Civilista ("Civic Crusade") was created{{where|date=May 2016}} and began organizing actions of civil disobedience. The Crusade called for a general strike. In response, the military suspended constitutional rights and declared a state of emergency in the country. On July 10, the [[Civic Crusade]] called for a massive demonstration that was violently repressed by the "Dobermans", the military's special riot control unit. That day, later known as El Viernes Negro ("Black Friday"), left many people injured and killed.

 President [[Ronald Reagan]] began a series of sanctions against the military regime. The  froze economic and military assistance to  in the middle of 1987 in response to the domestic political crisis in  and an attack on the US embassy. The sanctions failed to oust Noriega, but severely hurt 's economy. 's gross domestic product (GDP) declined almost 25 percent between 1987 and 1989.

On February 5, 1988, General Manuel Antonio Noriega was accused of drug trafficking by federal juries in Tampa and Miami. [[Human Rights Watch]] wrote in its 1989 report: "Washington turned a blind eye to abuses in  for many years until concern over drug trafficking prompted indictments of the general [Noriega] by two grand juries in Florida in February 1988".

In April 1988, US President Ronald Reagan invoked the [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]], freezing  government assets in all US organizations. In May 1989 Panamanians voted overwhelmingly for the anti-Noriega candidates. The Noriega regime promptly annulled the election and embarked on a new round of repression.

====US invasion (1989)====
{{Further| invasion of }}

The  invaded  on December 20, 1989, codenamed [[Operation Just Cause]]. The U.S. stated the operation was "necessary to safeguard the lives of U.S. citizens in , defend democracy and human rights, combat drug trafficking, and secure the neutrality of the  Canal as required by the [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties]]". The US reported 23 servicemen killed and 324 wounded, with the number of  soldiers killed estimated at 450. The estimates for civilians killed in the conflict ranges from 200 to 4,000. The United Nations put the  civilian death toll at 500, [[Americas Watch]] estimated 300, the  gave a figure of 202 civilians killed and former US attorney general [[Ramsey Clark]] estimated 4,000 deaths. It represented the largest  military operation since the  War. The number of US civilians (and their dependents), who had worked for the [[ Canal Authority| Canal Commission]] and the US military, and were killed by the  Defense Forces, has never been fully disclosed.

On December 29, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] approved a resolution calling the intervention in  a "flagrant violation of international law and of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the States". A similar resolution was vetoed in the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] by the , the , and . Noriega was captured and flown to Miami to be tried. The conflict ended on January 31, 1990.

The urban population, many living below the poverty level, was greatly affected by the 1989 intervention. As pointed out in 1995 by a UN Technical Assistance Mission to , the fighting displaced 20,000 people. The most heavily affected district was the [[El Chorrillo]] area of  City, where several blocks of apartments were completely destroyed. The economic damage caused by the fighting has been estimated at between 1.5 and 2 billion dollars. Most [[Panamanians]] supported the intervention.

===Post-intervention era===
's Electoral Tribunal moved quickly to restore civilian constitutional government, reinstated the results of the May 1989 election on December 27, 1989, and confirmed the victory of President [[Guillermo Endara]] and Vice Presidents [[Guillermo Ford]] and [[Ricardo Arias Calderón]].

During its five-year term, the often-fractious government struggled to meet the public's high expectations. Its new police force was a major improvement over its predecessor but was not fully able to deter crime. [[Ernesto Pérez Balladares]] was sworn in as president on September 1, 1994, after an internationally monitored election campaign.

On September 1, 1999, [[Mireya Moscoso]], the widow of former president [[Arnulfo Arias Madrid]], took office after defeating PRD candidate [[Martín Torrijos]], son of [[Omar Torrijos]], in a free and fair election. During her administration, Moscoso attempted to strengthen social programs, especially for child and youth development, protection, and general welfare. Moscoso's administration successfully handled the  Canal transfer and was effective in the administration of the Canal.

The PRD's Martin Torrijos won the presidency and a legislative majority in the National Assembly in 2004. Torrijos ran his campaign on a platform of, among other pledges, a "zero tolerance" for corruption, a problem endemic to the Moscoso and Perez Balladares administrations. After taking office, Torrijos passed a number of laws which made the government more transparent. He formed a National Anti-Corruption Council whose members represented the highest levels of government and civil society, labor organizations, and religious leadership. In addition, many of his closest Cabinet ministers were non-political [[Technocracy|technocrats]] known for their support for the Torrijos government's anti-corruption aims. Despite the Torrijos administration's public stance on corruption, many high-profile cases, particularly involving political or business elites, were never acted upon.

Conservative supermarket magnate [[Ricardo Martinelli]] was elected to succeed Martin Torrijos with a landslide victory in the May [[2009  general election]]. Martinelli's business credentials drew voters worried by slowing growth during the [[Great Recession]]. Standing for the four-party opposition Alliance for Change, Martinelli gained 60 percent of the vote, against 37 percent for the candidate of the governing left-wing [[Democratic Revolutionary Party]] (PRD).

On May 4, 2014, Vice President [[Juan Carlos Varela]], candidate of the [[Panameñista Party|Partido Panamenista]] ( Party) won the 2014 [[2014  general election|presidential election]] with over 39 percent of the votes, against the party of his former political partner Ricardo Martinelli, Cambio Democrático, and their candidate [[José Domingo Arias]]. He was sworn in on July 1, 2014. On July 1, 2019 [[Laurentino Cortizo]] took possession of the presidency. Cortizo was the candidate of [[Democratic Revolutionary Party|Democratic Revolution Party]] (PRD) in the May 2019 [[2019  general election|presidential election]].

During the presidency of Cortizo, numerous events happened in the country, including the [[COVID-19 pandemic in |COVID-19 pandemic]] and its [[Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic|economic impact]], and the [[2022  protests|2022]] and [[2023  protests|2023 protests]].

On July 1, 2024, [[José Raúl Mulino]] was sworn in as 's new president. Mulino, a close ally of former president Ricardo Martinelli, won the presidential [[2024  general election|election]] in May 2024.
