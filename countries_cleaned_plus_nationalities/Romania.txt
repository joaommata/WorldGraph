===Dacia and the Roman Empire===
{{Main|Dacians|Roman Dacia}}

[[File:Dacia 82 BC.png|left|thumb|Dacia under [[Burebista]], {{circa|82}} BC]]

It is believed that the [[tribes]] responsible for creating the [[Bronze Age]] culture on the territory of modern  belonged to the [[Indo-European]] group of [[Thracians]]. [[Strabo]], in ''[[Geographica]]'', notes that the [[Getae]] spoke the same language as the Thracians, and the Dacians the same language as the Getae. However, the earliest account of the Getae is attributed to [[Herodotus]]. The Roman Empire's [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|conquest of Dacia]] led to the fusion of two cultures—the Daco-Romans became the ancestors of the [[Romanians| people]].{{sfn|Vékony|2000|p=4}}{{Sfn|Illyés|1992|p=33}} After [[Dacia]] became a province of the [[Roman Empire]], elements of Roman culture and civilisation—most notably [[Vulgar Latin]], which laid the foundation for the development of the [[ language]]—were introduced.

Based on information from the inscription at [[Dionysupolis]] and the account of [[Jordanes]], it is known that under the rule of [[Burebista]], assisted by the great priest [[Deceneus]], the first Geto-Dacian state was formed. In 44 BC, Burebista was assassinated by one of his servants. After his death, the Geto-Dacian state fragmented into four, and later five, kingdoms. The core of the state remained in the area of the [[Șureanu Mountains]], where successive rulers such as [[Deceneu]], [[Comosicus]], and [[Coryllus]] held power. The centralised Dacian state reached the peak of its development under [[Decebalus]]. During this period, a series of conflicts with the [[Roman Empire]] continued, with part of the Dacian state being conquered in 106 AD by the Roman emperor [[Trajan]]. Dacia was evacuated by the Romans between 271 and 275 AD, under Emperor [[Aurelian]].

===Period of the Principalities and the Phanariot Era===
{{Main| in the Middle Ages|Phanariots}}

In the [[first millennium]], waves of [[nomads]] swept across the territory of : the [[Goths]] during the 3rd–4th centuries, the [[Huns]] in the 4th century, the [[Gepids]] in the 5th century, the [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]] in the 6th century, the [[Slavs]] in the 7th century, the [[Magyars]] in the 9th century, the [[Pechenegs]], the [[Cumans]], the [[Uzes (people)|Uzes]] and the [[Alans]] during the 10th–12th centuries, and the [[Tatars]] in the 13th century. In 1054, a series of [[Eastern Orthodox – Roman Catholic ecclesiastical differences|ecclesiastical differences]] and [[Theological differences between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church|theological disputes]] between the [[ East and Latin West]] caused the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]], eventually resulting in  adopting Orthodoxy.

In the [[13th century]], the first bearers of the [[Medieval  noble titles|Slavic noble title]] [[Knyaz]] south of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] are attested. Later, in the context of the crystallisation of feudal relations, as a result of the creation of favourable internal and external conditions (the weakening of [[Kingdom of |]] pressure and the diminishing of [[Tatars]] domination), autonomous feudal states emerged south and east of the Carpathians – [[Wallachia]] in 1310, under [[Basarab I of Wallachia]], and [[Moldova]] in 1359, under [[Bogdan the Founder]]. Among the  rulers who played a more important role can be mentioned: [[Alexander the Good]], [[Stephen the Great]], [[Petru Rareș]], and [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] in Moldova; [[Mircea the Elder]], [[Vlad the Impaler]], [[Michael the Brave]], and [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]] in Wallachia; and [[John Hunyadi]] in Transylvania.

Beginning in the late [[15th century]], the two principalities gradually came under the influence of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Transylvania]], which throughout the [[Middle Ages]] was part of the [[Kingdom of ]], governed by voivodes, became part of the [[Eastern  Kingdom]] from 1526 and later a self-governing [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]] and a vassal of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1570. For a very brief period at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries, [[Michael the Brave]] ruled over a large part of present-day 's territory.

=== Unification and the Kingdom of  ===

[[File:Al I Cuza.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], ''[[Domnitor]]'' of  from 1862 to 1866]]

====From the Little Union to the Great War====
The modern  state was created through the [[Unification of the  Principalities|unification of the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia]], accepted as a federative structure by the Great Powers following the [[Paris Convention]] of 1858, and later cemented by the simultaneous election as ruler of both states of the unionist [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]]. After carrying out numerous reforms that laid the foundations for the modernisation of the state, he was forced in 1866 by a broad coalition of the political parties of the time, also known as the "[[Monstrous coalition]]", to abdicate and leave the country.

The union was at one time in peril, but the political leaders of the era succeeded in placing on the princely throne [[Carol I of ]], who accepted the Constitution and took the oath on 10 May 1866. Eleven years later, on 10 May 1877,  proclaimed its independence—achieved on the battlefield—and in 1881, on the same day of the year, Carol was crowned as [[King of ]]. In 1913,  entered the [[Second Balkan War]] against [[]], at the end of which it obtained [[Southern Dobruja]]. In 1914, [[King Carol I of |King Carol I]] died, and his nephew, [[Ferdinand I of |Ferdinand I]], succeeded him on the throne.

====World War I and the Great Union====
{{Main| in World War I}}

In 1916,  entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Entente Powers]]. Although the  forces did not perform well militarily, by the end of the war the  and  Empires had disintegrated; the National Assembly in [[Transylvania]], and the [[Sfatul Țării]] in [[Bessarabia]] and [[Bukovina]] proclaimed their union with , and [[Ferdinand I of |King Ferdinand I]] and [[Queen Maria of |Queen Maria]] were crowned sovereign of all Romanians in [[Alba Iulia]] on 15 October 1922. 

After [[World War I]], the union of [[Bukovina]] with  was ratified in 1919 by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint Germain]]. Most of the territories claimed by  from the [[Kingdom of ]]—[[Crișana]], [[Transylvania]] and parts of [[Banat]] and [[Maramureș]]—were annexed to the [[Kingdom of ]]. This act was ratified in 1920 by the [[Treaty of Trianon]], which defined the new border between  and .

====Interwar period====
After having left the country and renounced his claim to the throne in 1925, [[Carol II of |Carol II]] returned in 1930 and usurped his son’s throne; influenced by his inner circle—referred to by historians as the "Royal Camarilla"—he gradually undermined the democratic system, and in 1938 he assumed dictatorial powers. Although he was pro-Western (especially Anglophile), Carol attempted to appease extreme centrifugal forces by appointing nationalist governments that adopted anti-Semitic measures, such as the [[Goga cabinet]] and the one led by the Orthodox Patriarch [[Miron Cristea]].

====World War II: Positions and territorial losses====
[[File:PérdidasTerritorialesRumanas1940-ro.svg|thumb|right|'s territorial losses in the summer of 1940. Of these territories, only [[Northern Transylvania]] was [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|regained]] after the end of World War II]]
Following the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939, in June 1940  accepted the loss of [[Bessarabia]], [[Northern Bukovina]] and the [[Hertsa]] region in favour of the [[USSR]] (as stipulated in the Soviet ultimatum of 28 June 1940). Unaware of the details of the Soviet– pact, Carol attempted to secure an alliance with [[Nazi ]], and appointed Ion Gigurtu as President of the Council of Ministers, who declared that he would pursue a Nazi pro-Axis (Berlin–Rome) policy that was anti-Semitic and fascist-totalitarian in nature. Between 4 July and 4 September 1940, by accepting [[Second Vienna Award|Hitler's arbitration]] over Transylvania (after Gigurtu declared on radio that  must make territorial sacrifices to justify its Nazi orientation and full adherence to the Berlin–Rome Axis),  ceded [[Northern Transylvania]]—including the city of [[Cluj]]—to . The vast territories in Transylvania ceded by Ion Gigurtu to  contained important natural resources, including gold mines. Ion Gigurtu also initiated negotiations to cede 8,000 km<sup>2</sup> of Southern Dobruja to , these negotiations were interrupted by Antonescu's unconditional acceptance of the territorial cession.

In response to the chaotic withdrawal from Bessarabia, the territorial cessions, public discontent, and protests from political leaders, King Carol II suspended the [[1938 Constitution of ]] and appointed General [[Ion Antonescu]] as Prime Minister. This measure, supported by the [[Iron Guard]], demanded that the king abdicate in favour of his son, [[Mihai I of |Mihai]]. Subsequently, Antonescu assumed dictatorial powers and became President of the Council of Ministers, as the self-titled "Leader" of the state.

====World War II====
{{Main| in World War II}}

In 1941, as an ally of [[Nazi ]],  entered [[World War II]] by declaring war on the [[Soviet Union]]. A shift in fortunes only became discernible after the defeat at Stalingrad and the subsequent change of the USSR from a defensive to an offensive posture. On 23 August 1944, with the Soviet army having been present in northern Moldova since March, [[Mihai I of |King Mihai I]] forcibly removed Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]] from power, as he refused to sign an armistice with the [[Allies of World War II]]. Following Antonescu's outright refusal, King Mihai I ordered the dismissal and arrest of the marshal, and  switched sides to join the Allies.

=== Socialist  (1947–1989) ===

Less than three years after the [[Soviet occupation of ]], in 1947, [[Mihai I of |King Michael I]] was forced to abdicate and the [[People's Republic of ]]—a state of "popular democracy"—was proclaimed. The newly established communist regime, led by the [[ Workers' Party]], consolidated its power through a Stalinist-type policy aimed at suppressing any political opposition and transforming the economic and social structures of the old bourgeois regime.

In the early 1960s, the  government began asserting a certain degree of independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in its foreign policy, although it did not abandon its repressive policies (which it labeled "revolutionary conquests") in domestic affairs. In 1965, communist leader [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] died, ushering in a period of change in . After a brief power struggle, [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] emerged as the head of the communist party, becoming General Secretary of the [[ Communist Party]] in 1965, President of the [[State Council of |State Council]] in 1967, and President of the [[Socialist Republic of ]] in 1974. Ceaușescu's rule from 1965 to 1989 grew increasingly authoritarian during the 1980s.

===  since 1989 ===
{{Main| Revolution of 1989|}}

[[File:Revolutia_Bucuresti_1989_000.JPG|thumb|Tanks and [[Miliția ()|Miliția]] on the [[Bulevardul Magheru|Magheru Boulevard]] in [[Bucharest]] during the revolution]]
In the context of the fall of communism throughout Eastern Europe during the [[revolutions of 1989]], a protest in support of [[Reformed Church in |Reformed pastor]] [[László Tőkés]] that began in December 1989 in [[Timișoara]] quickly escalated into a national uprising against the communist regime, ultimately resulting in the [[Trial and execution of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu|execution of Ceaușescu]] and his wife [[Elena Ceaușescu|Elena]] on 25 December 1989.

An interim council composed of figures from civil society and former communist officials assumed control of the government, and [[Ion Iliescu]] became the provisional president of the country. The new government reversed many of the authoritarian communist policies and dismissed several leaders of the former regime, although still influenced by members of the former regime (the basis for the [[Golaniad]]'','' and [[Mineriads]]).

==== Return to democracy ====
In [[1990  general election|May 1990]], the first free elections in  since the [[1937  general election|1937]] elections were held, with Iliescu of the [[National Salvation Front ()|National Salvation Front]] winning the presidency with 85% of the vote. In [[1992  general election|1992]], he was reelected in the first election after the adoption of [[Constitution of |a permanent constitution]] via [[1991  constitutional referendum|a referendum]] held [[1991  constitutional referendum|the previous year]]. Illiescu lost the [[1996  general election|1996 election]] to [[Emil Constantinescu]], but returned to power in [[2000  general election|2000]]. [[Traian Băsescu]] was elected president in [[2004  general election|2004]] and [[2009  presidential election|2009]], serving until [[2014  presidential election|2014]] at which point [[Klaus Iohannis]] succeeded him, being re-elected in [[2019  presidential election|2019]] and serving until [[2025  presidential election|2025]]. During these years several events occurred. In 2009, the country was bailed out by the [[International Monetary Fund]] as result of the [[Great Recession in Europe]] following the [[2008 financial crisis]].

The post-1989 period has been characterised by the privatisation and closure of several former industrial and economic enterprises from the communist period, while [[Corruption in |corruption]] has been a [[Corruption in |major issue]] in contemporary politics.

A [[National Anticorruption Directorate]] was formed in the country in 2002. During the 2000s,  had one of the highest economic growth rates in Europe and has been referred at times as "the Tiger of Eastern Europe". This has been accompanied by a significant improvement in living standards as the country successfully reduced domestic poverty and established a functional democratic state. However, 's development suffered a major setback during the [[Great Recession|late 2000s' recession]] leading to a large gross domestic product contraction and a budget deficit in 2009. This led to  borrowing from the International Monetary Fund. Worsening economic conditions led to [[2012  constitutional crisis|unrest]] and triggered a political crisis in 2012.

Since 2014,  launched an anti-corruption effort that led to the prosecution of medium- and high-level political, judicial and administrative offenses by the [[National Anticorruption Directorate]]. In 2015, massive [[2015  protests|anti-corruption protests]] which developed in the wake of the [[Colectiv nightclub fire]] led to the resignation of prime minister [[Victor Ponta]]. During 2017–2019, in response to measures which were perceived to weaken the fight against corruption, some of the [[2017–2019  protests|biggest post-1989 protests]] took place in , with over 500,000 people protesting nationwide.

The [[2021  political crisis]] led to the outsting of [[Florin Cîțu]]'s [[Cîțu Cabinet|incumbent government]]. The [[Ciucă Cabinet]] then took power, with  since having experienced a shift towards [[authoritarianism]] and [[illiberalism]], as well as an increased [[Corruption in |corruption]]. Around this time,  was also hit by the [[COVID-19 pandemic in |COVID-19 pandemic]]. In the [[2024  presidential election|2024 presidential election]], Independent candidate [[Călin Georgescu]] achieved a surprise win in the first round. However, the [[Constitutional Court of |Constitutional Court]] annulled the election results, citing [[Accusations of  interference in the 2024  presidential election| meddling]]. The cancellation led to [[2024–2025  election annulment protests|far-right protests]], [[2025 JD Vance speech at the Munich Security Conference|criticism]] by the [[Second presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]], and [[Ilie Bolojan]] becoming acting president in February 2025 as Iohannis resigned to political pressure. In the subsequent [[2025  presidential election]], [[Mayor of Bucharest|Bucharest Mayor]] [[Nicușor Dan]] was elected president.
