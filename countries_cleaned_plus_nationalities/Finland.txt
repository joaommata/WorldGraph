The area that is now  was settled in, at the latest, around 8,500 BC during the [[Stone Age]] towards the end of the [[last glacial period]]. The [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] the first settlers left behind present characteristics that are shared with those found in [[]], , and . The earliest people were [[hunter-gatherer]]s, using stone tools.

The first pottery appeared in 5200&nbsp;BC, when the [[Comb Ceramic culture]] was introduced. The area of present-day  was in the western limits of the culture, which produced pottery with a distinct [[Comb Ceramic|comb pattern]].{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=2}} The arrival of the [[Corded Ware culture]] in the south of coastal  between 3000 and 2500 BC may have coincided with the start of agriculture. Even with the introduction of agriculture, hunting and fishing continued to be important parts of the subsistence economy.

Based upon linguistic evidence,  seems to have been primarily inhabited by speakers of [[Paleo-European languages|Paleo-European]] languages prior to the migration of the Finno-Ugric peoples, which influenced the [[Sámi languages]] who were the first Finno-Ugric peoples to move towards . These languages have been divided into [[Paleo-Laplandic languages]] which was spoken around Lappland, and the Lakelandic languages spoken in most of modern-day . Many toponyms in  such as Inari, Saimaa, Päijänne and Imatra seem to derive from these Paleo-European languages, as their etymologies are not explainable by either Indo-European or Finno-Ugric roots.

In the [[Bronze Age]], permanent all-year-round cultivation and [[animal husbandry]] spread, but the cold climate slowed the change. The [[Seima-Turbino phenomenon]] brought the first bronze artefacts to the region and possibly also the [[Finno-Ugric languages]]. Commercial contacts that had so far mostly been to  started to extend to Scandinavia. Domestic manufacture of bronze artefacts started 1300 BC.

In the [[Iron Age]], population grew. [[ Proper]] was the most densely populated area. Commercial contacts in the [[Baltic Sea]] region grew and extended during the eighth and ninth centuries. Main exports from  were furs, slaves, [[castoreum]], and falcons to European courts. Imports included silk and other fabrics, jewelry, [[Ulfberht swords]], and, in lesser extent, glass. Production of iron started approximately in 500 BC. At the end of the ninth century, indigenous artefact culture, especially weapons and women's jewelry, had more common local features than ever before. This has been interpreted to be expressing common  identity.

An early form of [[Finnic languages]] spread to the Baltic Sea region approximately 1900 BC. Common Finnic language was spoken around [[Gulf of ]] 2000 years ago. The dialects from which the modern-day  language was developed came into existence during the Iron Age. Contacts with the ancient [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] and eastern [[Germanic peoples]] greatly influenced the [[Proto-Finnic language]].{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=2}} Although distantly related, the [[Sámi people]] retained the hunter-gatherer lifestyle longer than the Finns. The Sámi cultural identity and the [[Sámi languages]] have survived in [[Lapland ()|Lapland]], the northernmost province.

The 12th and 13th centuries were a violent time in the northern Baltic Sea. The [[Livonian Crusade]] was ongoing and the [[ tribes]] such as the [[Tavastians]] and [[Karelia (historical province of )|Karelians]] were in [[Early  wars|frequent conflicts]] with [[Republic of Novgorod|Novgorod]] and with each other. Also, during the 12th and 13th centuries several crusades from the Catholic realms of the Baltic Sea area were made against the  tribes. [[Danes]] waged at least three crusades to , in 1187 or slightly earlier, in 1191 and in 1202, and [[Swedes]], possibly the so-called [[Second  Crusade|second Crusade to ]], in 1249 against Tavastians and the [[Third  Crusade|third Crusade to ]] in 1293 against the Karelians. The so-called [[First  Crusade|first Crusade to ]], possibly in 1155, most likely never occurred.

As a result of the Crusades, mostly with the Second  Crusade led by [[Birger Jarl]], and the [[ colonisation of |colonization of some  coastal areas]] with Christian [[-speaking population of |Swedes]] during the Middle Ages,  gradually became part of the kingdom of  and the sphere of influence of the [[Catholic Church]]. Under ,  was annexed as part of the cultural order of [[Western Europe]]. The Swedes built fortresses in [[Häme]] and [[Turku]], while a  royal council was instituted, an administrative structure and fiscal apparatus was created, and law codes were codified during the reigns of [[Magnus Ladulås]] (1275–1290) and [[Magnus Eriksson]] (1319–1364).{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=9}} As a result, the  lands were firmly integrated into the  realm.{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=9}}

During the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[Finns]] gradually converted to [[Lutheranism]]. The end of the [[Kalmar Union]] ushered in an era of religious, social, and economic changes.{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=28}} [[Gustav Vasa]] ({{reign|1523|1560}}) made his second son [[John III of |Johan]] the [[duke of ]], while [[Gustavus Adolphus|Gustav Adolf]] ({{reign|1611|1632}}) created the office of [[Governor-General of |governor-general]] for  as part of his restructuring of the administration of the  realm.{{sfn|Kirby|2006|pp=37–38}}

In the 16th century, a bishop and Lutheran Reformer [[Mikael Agricola]] published the first written works in ; and 's current capital city, [[Helsinki]], was founded by King [[Gustav I of |Gustav Vasa]] in 1555. The first university in , the [[Royal Academy of Turku]], was established by Queen [[Christina of ]] at the proposal of Count [[Per Brahe the Younger|Per Brahe]] in 1640.

The Finns reaped a reputation in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) as a well-trained [[cavalrymen]] called "[[Hakkapeliitta]]".  suffered a severe [[Great Famine of  (1695–1697)|famine in 1695–1697]], during which about one third of the  population died, and a [[The plague during the Great Northern War|devastating plague occurred a few years later]].

In the 18th century, wars between  and  twice led to the occupation of  by  forces, times known to the Finns as the [[Greater Wrath]] (1714–1721) and the [[Russo- War (1741–1743)|Lesser Wrath]] (1742–1743). It is estimated that almost an entire generation of young men was lost during the Great Wrath, due mainly to the destruction of homes and farms, and the burning of Helsinki.

===Grand Duchy of ===
{{Main|Grand Duchy of }}
The  era ended with the [[ War]] of 1809. On 29 March 1809, after being conquered by the armies of [[Alexander I of ]],  became [[Grand Duchy of |an autonomous grand duchy]] within the [[ Empire]], as recognised by the [[Diet of Porvoo]]. This situation continued until the end of 1917. In 1812, Alexander I incorporated the  [[Vyborg Governorate|province of Vyborg]] into the Grand Duchy of . In 1854,  became involved in 's involvement in the [[Crimean War]] when the  and  navies bombed the  coast and [[Åland]] during the so-called [[Åland War]].

Although  was still widely spoken, the  language began to gain recognition during this period. From the 1860s, a strong  [[Ethnic nationalism|nationalist movement]], known as the [[Fennoman movement]], grew. One of the movement's most prominent leaders was the philosopher and politician [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman|J.V. Snellman]], who worked to stabilise the status of the  language and its own currency, the [[ markka]], in the Grand Duchy of . Milestones included the publication of what would become 's [[national epic]], the ''[[Kalevala]]'', in 1835 and the legal equality of the  language with  in 1892. In the spirit of [[Adolf Ivar Arwidsson]] – "we are not Swedes, we do not want to become , so let us be Finns" – a  national identity was established. Nevertheless, there was no real independence movement in  until the early 20th century.

The [[ famine of 1866–1868]] occurred after freezing temperatures in early September devastated crops and killed around 15% of the population, making it one of the worst [[famine]]s in European history. The famine led the  Empire to relax financial regulations, and investment increased in the following decades. Economic development was rapid. The [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) per capita was still half of that of the  and a third of that of Britain.

From 1869 to 1917, the  Empire pursued [[Russification of |a policy of Russification]], which was suspended between 1905 and 1908. In 1906, [[universal suffrage]] was introduced in the Grand Duchy of . However, relations between the Grand Duchy of  and the  Empire soured when the  government began to take steps to restrict 's special status and autonomy. For example, universal suffrage was virtually meaningless in practice, as the [[tsar]] did not have to approve any of the laws passed by the  parliament. The desire for independence gained ground, first among radical [[Liberalism|liberals]] and [[Socialism|socialists]], partly driven by a declaration called the'' [[February Manifesto]]'' by the last tsar of the  Empire, [[Nicholas II of |Nicholas II]], on 15 February 1899.

===Civil war and early independence===
{{Main|Independence of | Civil War}}
After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, 's position as a Grand Duchy under the rule of the  Empire was questioned. The [[Parliament of | parliament]], controlled by the [[Social Democratic Party of |Social Democrats]], passed the so-called [[Independence of #Power act|Power Act]] to give the parliament supreme authority. This was rejected by the [[ Provisional Government]], which decided to dissolve the parliament. New elections were held in which the right-wing parties won by a small majority. Some social democrats refused to accept the result, claiming that the dissolution of parliament and the subsequent elections were extra-legal. The two almost equally powerful political blocs, the right-wing parties and the Social Democratic Party, were deeply divided.

The [[October Revolution]] in  changed the geopolitical situation once again. Suddenly the right-wing parties in  began to reconsider their decision to block the transfer of supreme executive power from the  government to  when the [[Bolsheviks]] came to power in . The right-wing government, led by Prime Minister [[P. E. Svinhufvud]], presented the [[ Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on 4 December 1917, which was officially approved by the  Parliament on 6 December. The [[ Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR), led by [[Vladimir Lenin]] was the first country to recognise 's independence on 4 January 1918.

On 27 January 1918, the government began to disarm the  forces in [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia]]. The socialists took control of southern  and Helsinki, but the white government continued in exile in [[Vaasa]]. This led to a short but bitter [[ Civil War|civil war]]. The [[White Guard ()|Whites]], backed by [[ Empire|Imperial ]], prevailed over the [[Red Guards ()|Reds]] and their self-proclaimed [[ Socialist Workers' Republic]]. After the war, tens of thousands of Reds were interned in camps where thousands were executed or died of malnutrition and disease. A deep social and political enmity was sown between the Reds and the Whites that would last until the [[Winter War]] and beyond. The civil war and the activist expeditions to Soviet  in 1918–1920, known as the "[[Heimosodat|Kinship Wars]]", strained relations with the East.

After a [[Kingdom of  (1918)|brief experiment with monarchy]], when an attempt to make [[Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse]] the king of  failed, a [[Constitution of |republican constitution]] was adopted and  became a [[presidential republic]], with [[K. J. Ståhlberg]] elected as its first president on 25 July 1919. A [[Civic nationalism|liberal nationalist]] with a legal background, Ståhlberg anchored the state in [[liberal democracy]], promoted the [[rule of law]] and initiated internal reforms.  was also one of the first European countries to strongly promote [[Women's rights|women's equality]], with [[Miina Sillanpää]] becoming the first female minister in  history in [[Tanner Cabinet|Väinö Tanner's cabinet]] in 1926–1927. The - border was established in 1920 by the [[Treaty of Tartu (–)|Treaty of Tartu]], which largely followed the historical border but gave  [[Pechengsky District|Pechenga]] ({{langx|fi|Petsamo}}) and its [[Barents Sea]] port.  democracy survived Soviet coup attempts and the anti-communist [[Lapua movement]].

In 1917 there were three million people in the country. After the civil war, a credit-based [[land reform]] was introduced, increasing the proportion of the population with access to capital. About 70% of the workforce was employed in agriculture and 10% in industry.

===World War II===

The [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi ]] signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] on 23 August 1939, which divided Europe into spheres of influence between the two dictatorships. In accordance with the pact, the Soviet Union launched the [[Winter War]] on 30 November 1939 in order to annex . The [[ Democratic Republic]] was set up by [[Joseph Stalin]] at the beginning of the war to govern  after Soviet conquest. There was widespread international condemnation of the unprovoked attack and it led to the Soviet Union being expelled from the [[League of Nations]]. The [[Red Army]] was defeated in numerous battles, most notably the [[Battle of Suomussalmi]]. After two months of negligible progress on the battlefield, as well as heavy losses in men and material, Soviet forces began to advance in February and [[Battle of Vyborg Bay (1940)|reached Vyborg]] ({{langx|fi|Viipuri}}) in March. The [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] was signed on 12 March 1940, and the war ended the following day.  had defended its independence, but ceded 9% of its territory to the Soviet Union. Between 1939 and 1944, some 400,000 people were [[Evacuation of  Karelia|evacuated from Karelia]]. 

[[File: areas ceded in 1944.png|thumb|upright|Areas ceded by  to the [[Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]]. The [[Porkkala]] land lease was returned to  in 1956.]]
Hostilities resumed in June 1941 with the [[Continuation War]], when  allied itself with  following the [[Operation Barbarossa|latter's invasion of the Soviet Union]]; the main aim was to regain the territory lost to the Soviets barely a year earlier.  troops [[ military administration in Eastern Karelia|occupied Eastern Karelia]] from 1941 to 1944 and assisted the  army in the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. The massive Soviet [[Vyborg–Petrozavodsk offensive]] in the summer of 1944 led to a breakthrough until the Finns finally repulsed it at [[Battle of Tali–Ihantala|Tali–Ihantala]]. This partial Soviet success led to a stalemate and later an [[Moscow Armistice|armistice]]. This was followed by the [[Lapland War]] of 1944–1945, when  fought retreating  forces in northern . 

The [[Moscow Armistice|Armistice]] and [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|treaty]] signed with the Soviet Union in 1944 and 1948 included  obligations, restraints, and reparations, as well as further territorial concessions. As a result of the two wars,  lost 12% of its land area, 20% of its industrial capacity, its second largest city, [[Vyborg]] ({{langx|fi|Viipuri}}), and the ice-free port of [[Liinakhamari]] ({{langx|fi|Liinahamari}}). The Finns lost around 97,000 soldiers and were forced to pay war reparations initially set at $300 million in 1938 prices, later adjusted to $226.5 million. However, the country avoided occupation by Soviet forces and managed to retain its independence. Along with [[Great Britain]],  emerged from the war as one of the only European countries to have taken part in hostilities that was never occupied and managed to preserve its democracy throughout.

In the decades following World War II, the [[Communist Party of |Communists]] were a strong political party. Furthermore, the Soviet Union persuaded  to refuse [[Marshall Plan]] aid. However, in the hope of preserving 's independence, the  provided secret development aid and supported the [[Social Democratic Party of |Social Democratic Party]].

===After the war===
[[File:Urho-Kekkonen-1975b (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Urho Kekkonen]] was 's longest-serving president in 1956–1982.]]
The development of trade with the Western powers, such as the , and the payment of reparations to the Soviet Union led to 's transformation from a primarily [[agrarian society]] to an industrialised one. [[Valmet]], originally a shipyard and then several metal workshops, was established to produce materials for war reparations. After the reparations were paid,  continued to trade with the Soviet Union as part of [[bilateral trade]].

In 1950, 46% of  workers were employed in agriculture and a third lived in urban areas, but new jobs in manufacturing, services and trade quickly attracted people to the cities. The average number of births per woman fell from a [[baby boom]] peak of 3.5 in 1947 to 1.5 in 1973. As the baby boomers entered the workforce, the economy failed to create jobs fast enough and hundreds of thousands emigrated to more industrialised , with emigration peaking in 1969 and 1970.  participated in trade liberalisation in the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]].

During the [[Cold War]],  officially embraced a policy of [[Neutral country|neutrality]]. The [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|YYA Treaty]] (Finno-Soviet Pact of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance) recognized 's desire to remain outside great-power conflicts. From 1956 president [[Urho Kekkonen]] had a virtual monopoly on relations with the Soviet Union, which was crucial to his continued popularity. In politics, there was a tendency to avoid any policy or statement that could be interpreted as anti-Soviet. This phenomenon was dubbed "[[Finlandisation]]" by the West  press.

[[File:2018_Helsinki,_Finland_(41401402010).jpg|thumb|left|[[Alvar Aalto]]'s [[Finlandia Hall]] hosted the [[Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in 1975.]]
A [[market economy]] was maintained in . Various industries benefited from trade privileges with the Soviets. Economic growth was rapid in the post-war period, and by 1975 's GDP per capita was the 15th highest in the world. During the 1970s and 1980s,  built one of the most extensive [[welfare state]]s in the world. In 1973,  negotiated a treaty with the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) that reduced tariffs, enhancing trade relations.

Miscalculated macroeconomic decisions, a [[ banking crisis of 1990s|banking crisis]], the collapse of its largest trading partner, the Soviet Union, and a global economic downturn caused a deep recession in  in the [[Early 1990s depression in |early 1990s]]. The recession bottomed out in 1993 and  enjoyed more than a decade of steady economic growth. After the collapse of the Soviet Union,  began to integrate more closely with the West.  [[1995 enlargement of the European Union|joined]] the [[European Union]] in 1995 and the [[euro zone]] in 1999. Much of the economic growth of the late 1990s was fuelled by the success of mobile phone manufacturer [[Nokia]].
