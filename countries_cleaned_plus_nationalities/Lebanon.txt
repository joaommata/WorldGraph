It is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].|left]]

The [[Natufian culture]] was the first to become sedentary at around 12000 BC.

Evidence of early settlement in  was found in [[Byblos]], considered among the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously inhabited cities]] in the world. The evidence dates back to earlier than 5000 BC. Archaeologists discovered remnants of prehistoric huts with crushed limestone floors, primitive weapons, and [[Jar burial|burial jars]] left by the [[Neolithic]] and [[Chalcolithic]] fishing communities who lived on the shore of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] over 7,000 years ago.

 was part of northern [[Canaan]], and consequently became the homeland of Canaanite descendants, the [[Phoenicia]]ns, a seafaring people based in the coastal strip of the northern [[Levant]] who spread across the Mediterranean in the first millennium BC. The most prominent Phoenician cities were [[Byblos]], [[Sidon]] and [[Tyre, |Tyre]]. According to the [[Bible]], King [[Hiram I|Hiram of Tyre]] collaborated closely with [[Solomon]], supplying cedar logs for [[Solomon's Temple]] and sending skilled workers. The [[Canaanite languages|Phoenicians]] are credited with the invention of the [[Phoenician alphabet|oldest verified alphabet]], which subsequently inspired the [[ alphabet]] and the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] one thereafter.

In the 9th century BC, [[Phoenician colonies]], including [[Carthage]] in present-day [[]] and [[Cádiz]] in present-day [[]], flourished throughout the Mediterranean. Subsequently, foreign powers, starting with the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], imposed tribute and attacked non-compliant cities. The [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] took control in the 6th century BC. In 539 BC, The cities of Phoenicia were then incorporated into the [[Achaemenid Empire]] by [[Cyrus the Great]]. The Phoenician city-states were later incorporated into the empire of [[Alexander the Great]] following the [[Siege of Tyre (332 BC)|siege of Tyre in 332 BCE]].

In 64 BC, the Roman general [[Pompey]] had the region of  annexed into the [[Roman Republic]]. The area was then split into two [[Imperial province|Imperial Provinces]] under the [[Roman Empire]], [[Coele-]] and [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Phoenice]], the latter which the land of present-day  was a part of.

The region that is now , as with the rest of  and much of [[Anatolia]], became a major center of Christianity in the [[Roman Empire]] during the early spread of the faith. During the late 4th and early 5th century, a hermit named [[Maron]] established a monastic tradition focused on the importance of [[monotheism]] and [[asceticism]] near the Mediterranean mountain range known as [[Mount ]]. The monks who followed Maron spread his teachings among  in the region. These Christians became known as [[Maronites]] and moved into the mountains to avoid religious persecution by Roman authorities. During the frequent [[Roman–Persian Wars]] that lasted for many centuries, the [[Sasanian Empire]] occupied what is now  from 619 till 629.

=== Middle Ages ===
During the 7th century, [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Muslims conquered ]] from the Byzantines, incorporating the region, including modern-day , under the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Islamic Caliphate]]. In the era of [[Uthman]]'s caliphate (644–656), Islam gained significant influence in Damascus, led by [[Mu'awiya I|Mu'awiya]], a relative of Uthman, serving as the governor. Mu'awiya sent forces to the coastal region of , prompting conversions to Islam among the coastal population. The mountainous areas retained their Christian or other cultural practices. Despite Islam and Arabic becoming officially dominant, the population's conversion from Christianity and [[Syriac language]] was gradual. The Maronite community, in particular, managed to maintain a large degree of autonomy despite the succession of rulers over  and . The relative  isolation of the  mountains meant the mountains served as a refuge in the times of religious and political crises in the [[Levant]]. As such, the mountains displayed religious diversity and the existence of several well-established sects and religions, notably, [[Maronites]], [[Druze]], [[Shia Islam|Shiite Muslims]], [[Isma'ilism|Ismailis]], [[Alawites]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobites]].

After the Islamic conquest, Mediterranean trade declined for three centuries due to conflicts with the Byzantines. The ports of Tyre, Sidon, Beirut, and Tripoli struggled to recover, sustaining small populations under [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] rule. Christians and Jews were often obligated to pay the ''[[jizya]]'', or poll tax levied on non-Muslims. During the 980s, the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] took control of the Levant, including Mount , resulting in the rejuvenation of Mediterranean trade along the  coast through renewed connections with Byzantium and . This resurgence saw Tripoli and Tyre flourishing well into the 11th century, focusing on exports such as textiles, sugar, and glassware.

During the 11th century, the [[Druze in |Druze]] religion emerged from a branch of [[Shia Islam]]. The new religion gained followers in the southern portion of Mount . The southern portion of Mount  was ruled by Druze feudal families till the early 14th century. The Maronite population increased gradually in Northern Mount  and the Druze have remained in Southern Mount  until the modern era. [[Keserwan District|Keserwan]], [[Jabal Amel]] and the [[Beqaa Valley]] was ruled by Shia feudal families under the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire. Major cities on the coast, [[Sidon]], [[Tyre, |Tyre]], [[Acre, |Acre]], [[Tripoli, |Tripoli]], [[Beirut]], and others, were directly administered by the Muslim Caliphs and the people became more fully absorbed by the Arab culture.[[File:Siege of Tripoli Painting (1289).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Fall of Tripoli (1289)|Fall of Tripoli]] to the  [[Mamluk]]s and destruction of the Crusader state, the County of Tripoli, 1289]]

Following the fall of Roman [[Anatolia]] to the Muslim Turks, the Byzantines put out a call to the Pope in Rome for assistance in the 11th century. The result was a series of wars known as the [[Crusades]] launched by the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]] from Western Europe to reclaim the former Byzantine Christian territories in the Eastern Mediterranean, especially [[]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (the ''[[Levant]]''). The [[First Crusade]] succeeded in temporarily establishing the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[County of Tripoli]] as Roman Catholic Christian states along the coast. These crusader states made a lasting impact on the region, though their control was limited, and the region returned to full Muslim control after two centuries following the conquest by the Mamluks.

Among the most lasting effects of the Crusades in this region was the contact between the Franks (i.e., the ) and the Maronites. Unlike most other Christian communities in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], who swore allegiance to [[Constantinople]] or other local patriarchs, the Maronites proclaimed allegiance to the Pope in Rome. As such the Franks saw them as Roman Catholic brethren. These initial contacts led to centuries of support for the Maronites from  and , even after the fall of the Crusader states in the region.

[[File:DeirAlQamar-FakhredinePalace.jpg|thumb|[[Fakhreddine II Palace]], 17th century]]
In 1516,  became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], with governance administered indirectly through local [[emir]]s. 's area was organized into provinces: Northern and Southern Mount , Tripoli, Baalbek and Beqaa Valley, and [[Jabal Amil]].

In 1590, Druze tribal leader [[Fakhr al-Din II]] succeeded [[Mount  Emirate#Qurqumaz (1544–1585)|Korkmaz]] in southern Mount  and quickly asserted his authority as the paramount emir of the Druze in the Shouf region. Eventually, he was appointed [[Sanjak-bey]], overseeing various Ottoman sub-provinces and tax collection. Expanding his influence extensively, he even constructed a fort in [[Palmyra Castle|Palmyra]].

This expansion raised concerns for Ottoman Sultan Murad IV, leading to a punitive expedition in 1633. Fakhr al-Din II was captured, imprisoned for two years, and subsequently executed in April 1635, along with one of his sons. Surviving members of his family continued to govern a reduced area under closer Ottoman supervision until the late 17th century. On the death of the [[Ahmad Ma'n|last Maan emir]], various members of the Shihab clan ruled Mount  until 1830.

While the history of Druze-Christian relations in  has generally been marked by harmony and peaceful coexistence, there were occasional periods of tension, notably during the [[1860 civil conflict in Mount  and Damascus|1860 Mount  civil war]], during which around 10,000 Christians were killed by the Druze. Shortly afterwards, the [[Emirate of Mount ]], which lasted about 400 years, was replaced by the [[Mount  Mutasarrifate]], as a result of a European-Ottoman treaty called the [[Règlement Organique (Mount )|Règlement Organique]]. The ''Mount  Mutasarrifate'' (1861–1918, {{langx|ar|متصرفية جبل لبنان }}; {{langx|tr|Cebel-i Lübnan Mutasarrıflığı}}) was one of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s subdivisions following the [[Tanzimat]] reform. After 1861 there existed an autonomous Mount  with a Christian [[mutasarrıf]], which had been created as a homeland for the [[ Maronite Christians|Maronites]] under European diplomatic pressure following the 1860 massacres. The [[Maronite]] [[Catholic]]s and the [[Druze]] founded modern  in the early eighteenth century, through the ruling and social system known as the "[[Christianity and Druze|Maronite-Druze dualism]]" in Mount  Mutasarrifate.

The Baalbek and Beqaa Valley and Jabal Amel was ruled intermittently by various Shia feudal families, especially the [[El Assaad Family|Al Ali Alsagheer]] in Jabal Amel that remained in power until 1865 when Ottomans took direct ruling of the region. [[Youssef Bey Karam]], a  nationalist played an influential role in 's independence during this era.

 experienced profound devastation in the [[World War I|First World War]] when the [[Ottoman Army (1861–1922)|Ottoman army]] assumed direct control, disrupting supplies and confiscating animals, ultimately leading to a severe famine. During the war, approximately 100,000 people in Beirut and Mount  died due to starvation.

===  Mandate ===
Amidst the height of the [[World War I|First World War]], the [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]] of 1916, a secret pact between Britain and , delineated  and its surrounding areas as regions open to potential  influence or control. After the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] emerged victorious in the war, the [[Ottoman Empire]] ultimately collapsed, losing control over the area. Soon after the war, Patriarch [[Elias Peter Hoayek]], representing the Maronite Christians,  successfully campaigned for an expanded territory at the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)|Paris Peace Conference]], also including areas with significant Muslim and Druze populations in addition to the Christian-dominated Mount .

In 1920, King [[Faisal I of |Faisal I]] proclaimed the [[Arab Kingdom of ]]'s independence and asserted control over . However, following a defeat to the  at the [[Battle of Maysalun]], the kingdom was dissolved. Around the same time, at the [[San Remo conference|San Remo Conference]], tasked with deciding the fate of former Ottoman territories, it was determined that  and  would fall under  rule. Shortly afterward, the formal division of territories took place in the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], signed a few months later.

On 1 September 1920, [[Greater ]], or ''Grand Liban'', was established under  control as a [[League of Nations mandate|League of Nations Mandate]], following the terms outlined in the proposed [[Mandate for  and the ]]. Greater  united the regions of Mount , North , South , and the Bekaa, with Beirut as its designated capital. These specified boundaries later evolved into the present-day configuration of . This arrangement was ratified in July 1922. The  Republic was officially proclaimed on 1 September 1926, with the [[Constitution of |adoption of a constitution]] inspired by the  constitution on 23 May 1926. While a  government was established, the country continued to be under  control.

The Vichy authorities in 1941 allowed  to move aircraft and supplies through [[]] to [[]] where they were used against British forces. The , fearing that [[Nazi ]] would gain full control of  and [[]] by pressure on the weak Vichy government, [[– campaign|sent its army into  and ]].

After the fighting ended in , General [[Charles de Gaulle]] visited the area. Under political pressure from both inside and outside , de Gaulle recognized the independence of . On 26 November 1941, General [[Georges Catroux]] announced that  would become independent under the authority of the [[Free ]] government. Elections were held in 1943 and on 8 November 1943 the new  government unilaterally abolished the mandate. The  reacted by imprisoning the new government.  nationalists declared a provisional government, and the British diplomatically intervened on their behalf. In the face of intense British pressure and protests by  nationalists, the  reluctantly released the government officials on 22 November 1943, and accepted the independence of .[[File:Beirut's Martyrs' Square during celebrations marking the release by the  of 's government from Rashayya prison on November 22, 1943, the day of 's independence.

=== Independence from Free  ===
Following the end of World War II in Europe the  mandate may be said to have been terminated without any formal action on the part of the [[League of Nations]] or its successor the [[United Nations]]. The mandate was ended by the declaration of the mandatory power, and of the new states themselves, of their independence, followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers, culminating in formal admission to the United Nations. Article 78 of the UN Charter ended the status of tutelage for any member state: "The trusteeship system shall not apply to territories which have become Members of the United Nations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality." So when the UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the [[United Nations Charter]] by the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]], as both  and  were founding member states, the  mandate for both was legally terminated on that date and full independence attained. The last  troops withdrew in December 1946.

's unwritten [[National Pact]] of 1943 required that its president be Maronite Christian, its [[Speaker (politics)|speaker of the parliament]] to be a [[ Shia Muslims|Shia Muslim]], its prime minister be [[ Sunni Muslims|Sunni Muslim]], and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament and the Deputy Prime Minister be [[  Orthodox Christians| Orthodox]].

's history since independence has been marked by alternating periods of political stability and turmoil interspersed with prosperity built on [[Beirut]]'s position as a regional center for finance and trade.

In May 1948,  supported neighboring Arab countries in a [[1948 Arab– War|war against ]]. While some irregular forces crossed the border and carried out minor skirmishes against , it was without the support of the  government, and  troops did not officially invade.{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=524}}  agreed to support the forces with covering artillery fire, armored cars, volunteers and logistical support.{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=259}} On 5–6 June 1948, the  army – led by the then [[Ministry of National Defense ()|Minister of National Defense]], [[Majid Arslan|Emir Majid Arslan]] – captured [[Al-Malkiyya]].

100,000 [[Palestinians in |Palestinians]] fled to  because of the war.  [[Palestinian right of return|did not permit their return]] after the cease-fire. As of 2017, between 174,000 and 450,000 Palestinian refugees live in  with about half in refugee camps (although these are often decades old and resemble neighborhoods). Often Palestinians are legally barred from owning property or performing certain occupations. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], Palestinian refugees in  live in "appalling social and economic conditions."

In 1958, during the last months of President [[Camille Chamoun]]'s term, [[1958  crisis|an insurrection]] broke out, instigated by  Muslims who wanted to make  a member of the [[United Arab Republic]]. Chamoun requested assistance, and 5,000 [[ Marines]] were briefly dispatched to Beirut on 15 July. After the crisis, a new government was formed, led by the popular former general [[Fouad Chehab]].

Until the early 1970s,  was dubbed "the  of the Middle East" for its unique status as both a snow-capped holiday destination and secure banking hub for [[Gulf Arab]]s. Beirut was also nicknamed "the Paris of the Middle East."

=== Civil War and occupation ===

The relocation also led to sectarian tensions between Palestinians versus the Maronites and other  factions. In 1975, following increasing tensions, largely boosted by [[Fatahland|Palestinian militant presence]] in the south, a full-scale civil war broke out in . The war pitted a coalition of Christian groups against the joint forces of the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization|PLO]], left-wing Druze and Muslim militias. In October 1976 the [[Arab League]] agreed to establish a predominantly  [[Arab Deterrent Force]], which was charged with restoring calm.  [[File:Green Line, Beirut 1982.jpg|thumb|The [[Green Line ()|Green Line]] that separated west and east Beirut, 1982|left]]PLO attacks from  into  in 1977 and 1978 escalated tensions between two countries. On 11 March 1978, Fatah militants in northern , hijacked two passenger buses, that killed 37 Israelis before being killed in a firefight with  forces.  [[Operation Litani|invaded]]  four days later and occupied most of the area south of the [[Litani River]]. The [[UN Security Council|UNSC]] passed the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 425|Resolution 425]] calling for immediate  withdrawal and creating the [[United Nations Interim Force in |U.N Interim Force in ]] (UNIFIL), charged with attempting to establish peace.  forces withdrew later in 1978, but retained control of the southern region by managing a {{convert|12|mi|km|0|adj=mid|-wide|order=flip}} security zone along the border. These positions were held by the [[South  Army]] (SLA), a Christian militia under the leadership of Major [[Saad Haddad]] backed by . The  Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]], compared the plight of the Christian minority in southern  (then about 5% of the population in SLA territory) to that of European Jews during World War II.

The PLO routinely [[Palestinian insurgency in South |attacked]]  during the period of the cease-fire, with over 270 documented attacks. People in Galilee regularly had to leave their homes during these shellings. Documents captured in PLO headquarters after the invasion showed they had come from . PLO leader [[Yasser Arafat]] refused to condemn these attacks on the grounds that the cease-fire was only relevant to . In April 1980 the killing of two UNIFIL soldiers and the injuring of a third by the South  Army, near [[At Tiri]], in the buffer zone led to a [[At Tiri incident|military conflict]]. On 17 July 1981,  aircraft bombed multi-story apartment buildings in Beirut that contained offices of PLO associated groups. The  delegate to the United Nations Security Council claimed that 300 civilians had been killed and 800 wounded. The bombing led to worldwide condemnation, and a temporary embargo on the export of U.S. aircraft to .

In August 1981, defense minister [[Ariel Sharon]] began to draw up plans to attack PLO military infrastructure in West Beirut, where PLO headquarters and command bunkers were located. In 1982, [[PLO in |PLO]] attacks from  on  led to [[1982  War|an  invasion]], aiming to support  forces in driving out the PLO. A [[Multinational Force in |multinational force]] of ,  and  contingents (joined in 1983 by a British contingent) were deployed in Beirut after [[Siege of Beirut|the  siege of the city]], to supervise the evacuation of the PLO. The civil war re-emerged in September 1982 after the assassination of President [[Bachir Gemayel]], an  ally, and subsequent fighting. During this time a number of sectarian massacres occurred, such as in [[Sabra and Shatila massacre|Sabra and Shatila]], and in [[War of the Camps|several refugee camps]]. The multinational force was withdrawn in the spring of 1984, following [[1983 Beirut barracks bombings|a devastating bombing attack]] during the previous year.

During the early 1980s, [[Hezbollah]], a Shiite Islamist militant group and political party, came into existence through the efforts of Shiite clerics who were [[Hezbollah– relations|financially supported and trained by ]]. Arising in the aftermath of the 1982 war and drawing inspiration from the [[ Revolution|Islamic Revolution in ]], Hezbollah actively engaged in combat against  as well as [[suicide attack]]s, [[car bomb]]ings and assassinations. Their objectives encompassed eliminating , fighting for the Shia cause in the civil war, ending Western presence in , and establishing a Shiite [[Khomeinism|Khomeinist]] [[Islamic state]].

In the late 1980s, as [[Amine Gemayel]]'s second term as president drew to an end, the  [[ pound|pound]] collapsed. At the end of 1987 US$1 was worth £L500. This meant the legal minimum wage was worth just $17 a month. Most goods in shops were priced in dollars. A [[Save the Children]] director estimated that 200,000–300,000 children were in need of assistance and were living almost entirely on bread, which was subsidized by the government. Those who could relied on foreign assistance. Hezbollah was receiving about $3–5 million a month from [[]]. In September 1988, the Parliament failed to elect a successor to President Gemayel as a result of differences between the Christians, Muslims, and Syrians. The Arab League Summit of May 1989 led to the formation of a –– committee to solve the crisis.

On 16 September 1989 the committee issued a peace plan which was accepted by all. A ceasefire was established, the ports and airports were re-opened and refugees began to return. In the same month, the parliament agreed to the [[Taif Agreement]], which included an outline timetable for  withdrawal from  and a formula for the de-confessionalization of the  political system. The civil war ended at the end of 1990 after 16 years; it had caused massive loss of human life and property and devastated the country's economy. It is estimated that 150,000 people were killed and another 200,000 wounded. Nearly a million civilians were displaced by the war, and some never returned. Parts of  were left in ruins. The agreement has still not been implemented in full and 's political system continues to be divided along sectarian lines.

Conflict between  and  militants continued, leading to a series of violent events and clashes including the [[Qana massacre]]. In May 2000,  forces fully withdrew from . Since then, 25 May is regarded by the  as the [[Resistance and Liberation Day ()|Liberation Day]]. The internal political situation in  significantly changed in the early 2000s. After the  withdrawal from southern  and the death of former  president [[Hafez al-Assad]] in 2000, the  military presence faced criticism and resistance from the  population.[[File:Cedar_Revolution_Demonstrators.jpg|thumb|Demonstrations in  triggered by the assassination of Rafik Hariri on 14 February 2005]]On 14 February 2005, former Prime Minister [[Rafic Hariri]] was assassinated in a [[car bomb]] explosion. Leaders of the [[March 14 Alliance]] accused [[]] of the attack, while  and the [[March 8 Alliance]] claimed that  was behind the assassination. It marked the beginning of a series of assassinations that resulted in the death of many prominent  figures and triggered the [[Cedar Revolution|demonstrations]] which demanded the withdrawal of the  troops from  and the establishment of an international commission to investigate the assassination. Under the pressure from the West,  began withdrew from  by 26 April. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1595|UNSC Resolution 1595]] called for an investigation into the assassination. The [[United Nations International Independent Investigation Commission|UN International Independent Investigation Commission]] published preliminary findings on 20 October 2005 in the [[Mehlis report]], which cited indications that the assassination was organized by  and  intelligence services.

=== Post-war revolution and spillover of the  conflict ===
{{main| civil war spillover in |2011  protests|17 October Revolution}}
On 12 July 2006, [[Hezbollah]] launched a series of rocket attacks and [[2006 Hezbollah cross-border raid|raids]] into  territory, where they killed three  soldiers and captured two others.  responded with [[airstrike]]s and [[artillery]] fire on targets in , and a ground invasion of [[southern ]], resulting in the [[2006  War]]. The conflict was officially ended by the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|UNSC Resolution 1701]] on 14 August 2006, which ordered a ceasefire, the withdrawal of  forces from , and the disarmament of Hezbollah. Some 1,191  and 160 Israelis were [[Casualties of the 2006  War|killed]] in the conflict. Beirut's southern suburb was heavily damaged by  airstrikes.

In 2007, the [[Nahr al-Bared]] refugee camp became the center of the [[2007  conflict]] between the  Army and [[Fatah al-Islam]]. At least 169 soldiers, 287 insurgents and 47 civilians were killed in the battle. Funds for the reconstruction of the area have been slow to materialize. Between 2006 and 2008, [[2006–2008  political protests|a series of protests]] led by groups opposed to the pro-Western Prime Minister [[Fouad Siniora]] demanded the creation of a national unity government, over which the mostly Shia opposition groups would have veto power. When [[Émile Lahoud]]'s presidential term ended in October 2007, the opposition refused to vote for a successor unless a power-sharing deal was reached, leaving  without a president.

On 7 May 2008, [[Hezbollah]] and [[Amal Movement|Amal]] forces, sparked by a government declaration that Hezbollah's communications network was illegal, seized western [[Beirut]], the most important Sunni center in , leading to an [[2008  conflict|intrastate military conflict]]. The  government denounced the violence as a coup attempt. At least 62 people died in the resulting clashes between pro-government and opposition militias. On 21 May 2008, the signing of the [[Doha Agreement (2008)|Doha Agreement]] ended the fighting. As part of the accord, which ended 18 months of political paralysis, [[Michel Suleiman]] became president and a national unity government was established, granting a veto to the opposition. The agreement was a victory for opposition forces, as the government caved in to all their main demands.

In early January 2011, the [[ government of November 2009|national unity government]] collapsed due to growing tensions stemming from the [[Special Tribunal for ]], which was expected to indict Hezbollah members for the Hariri assassination. The parliament elected [[Najib Mikati]], the candidate for the Hezbollah-led [[March 8 Alliance]], Prime Minister of , making him responsible for forming a new government. Hezbollah leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]] later accused  of assassinating Hariri. A report leaked by the [[Al Akhbar ()|Al-Akhbar]] newspaper in November 2010 stated that Hezbollah had drafted plans for a violent takeover of the country in case the Special Tribunal for  issued an indictment against its members.

In 2012, the [[ civil war]] threatened to spill over in , causing [[ civil war spillover in |incidents of sectarian violence]] and armed clashes between [[ Sunni Muslims|Sunnis]] and [[Alawites in |Alawites]] in Tripoli. According to [[UNHCR]], the number of [[Refugees of the  civil war| refugees]] in  increased from around 250,000 in early 2013 to 1,000,000 in late 2014. In 2013, The [[ Forces Party]], the [[Kataeb Party]] and the [[Free Patriotic Movement]] voiced concerns that the country's sectarian based political system is being undermined by the influx of  refugees. On 6 May 2015, [[UNHCR]] suspended registration of  refugees at the request of the  government. In February 2016, the  government signed the  Compact, granting a minimum of €400 million of support for refugees and vulnerable  citizens. As of October 2016, the government estimated that the country hosts 1.5 million Syrians.

As a result of the protests,  entered a political crisis, with Prime Minister [[Saad Hariri]] tendering his resignation and echoing protestors' demands for a government of independent specialists.
