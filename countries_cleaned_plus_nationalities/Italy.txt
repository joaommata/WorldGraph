[[Lower Paleolithic]] artefacts, dating back 850,000 years, have been recovered from [[Monte Poggiolo]]. Excavations throughout  revealed a [[Neanderthal]] presence in the Middle Palaeolithic period 200,000 years ago, while [[Early modern human|modern humans]] appeared about 40,000 years ago at [[Riparo Mochi]].

The [[Ancient peoples of |ancient peoples]] of pre-Roman  were [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]], specifically the [[Italic peoples]]. The main historic peoples of possible non-Indo-European or [[pre-Indo-European languages|pre-Indo-European]] heritage include the [[Etruscans]], the [[Elymians]] and [[Sicani]] of Sicily, and the prehistoric [[Sardinians]], who gave birth to the [[Nuragic civilisation]]. Other ancient populations include the [[Rhaetian people]] and [[Camunni]], known for their [[rock drawings in Valcamonica]]. A natural mummy, [[Ötzi]], dated 3400–3100 BC, was discovered in the [[Similaun]] glacier in 1991.

The first colonisers were the [[Phoenicia]]ns, who established [[Emporium (antiquity)|emporium]]s on the coasts of Sicily and Sardinia. Some became small urban centres and developed parallel to [[ colonies]]. During the 8th and 7th centuries,  colonies were established at [[Pithecusae]], eventually extending along the south of the  Peninsula and the coast of Sicily, an area later known as [[Magna Graecia]]. [[Ionians]], [[Doric |Doric]] colonists, [[Syracusan]]s, and the [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaeans]] founded various cities. [[ colonization of | colonisation]] placed the [[Italic peoples]] in contact with democratic forms of government and high artistic and cultural expressions.

's history goes back to numerous [[List of ancient peoples of |Italic peoples]] – notably including the [[ancient Romans]], who conquered the Mediterranean world during the [[Roman Republic]] and ruled it for centuries during the [[Roman Empire]].

Ancient Rome, a settlement on the [[River Tiber]] in central , [[Founding of Rome|founded]] in 753 BC, was ruled for 244 years by a monarchical system. In 509 BC, the Romans, favouring a government of the Senate and the People ([[SPQR]]), [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|expelled the monarchy]] and established an oligarchic republic.

The  Peninsula, named ''Italia'', was consolidated into a unified entity during Roman expansion, the conquest of new territories often at the expense of the [[Samnite Wars|other Italic tribes]], [[Roman–Etruscan Wars|Etruscans]], [[Roman–Gallic wars|Celts]], and [[Pyrrhic War|]]. A permanent association, with most of the local tribes and cities, was formed, and Rome began the conquest of Western Europe, North Africa, and the [[History of the Middle East# and Roman Empire|Middle East]]. In the wake of [[Julius Caesar]]'s assassination in 44 BC, Rome grew into a massive empire stretching from [[Roman Britain|Britain]] to the borders of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Persia]], engulfing the whole Mediterranean basin, in which , Roman, and other cultures merged into a powerful civilisation. The long reign of the first emperor, [[Augustus]], began an age of peace and prosperity. Roman  remained the [[metropole]] of the empire, homeland of the Romans and territory of the capital. 

The [[History of the Roman Empire|first two centuries of the empire]] saw a period of unprecedented stability known as the [[Pax Romana]] ({{Literal translation|Roman Peace}}). Rome reached its [[Borders of the Roman Empire|greatest territorial extent]] under [[Trajan]] ({{Reign|98|117|era=AD}}), but a period of increasing trouble and decline began under [[Commodus]] ({{Reign|180|192}}). The [[Migration Period]], involving [[Germanic–Roman contacts|large invasions by Germanic peoples]], led to the decline of the Roman Empire.

The Roman Empire was among the largest in history, wielding great economical, cultural, political, and military power. At its greatest extent, it had an area of {{Convert|5|e6km2|abbr=off}}. The [[Legacy of the Roman Empire|Roman legacy]] has deeply influenced Western civilisation shaping the modern world. The widespread use of [[Romance languages]] derived from Latin, [[Roman numerals|numerical system]], modern Western alphabet and calendar, and the emergence of Christianity as a world religion, are among the many legacies of Roman dominance.

=== Middle Ages ===
{{Main| in the Middle Ages}}
After the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]],  fell under the [[Kingdom of  (476–493)|Odoacer's kingdom]], and was seized by the [[Ostrogoths]]. Invasions resulted in a chaotic succession of kingdoms and the supposed "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]". The invasion of another [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] in the 6th century, the [[Lombards]], reduced Byzantine presence and ended political unity of the peninsula. The north formed the [[Lombard kingdom]], central-south was also controlled by the Lombards, and other parts remained Byzantine.
[[File:Marco Polo Mosaic from Palazzo Tursi.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.7|[[Marco Polo]], 13th-century explorer]]

The Lombard kingdom was absorbed into [[Francia]] by [[Charlemagne]] in the late 8th century and became the Kingdom of . The Franks helped form the [[Papal States]]. Until the 13th century, politics was dominated by relations between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s and the Papacy, with city-states siding with the former ([[Ghibellines]]) or with the latter ([[Guelphs]]) for momentary advantage. The Germanic emperor and Roman pontiff became the [[universal power]]s of medieval Europe. However, conflict over the [[Investiture Controversy]] and between Guelphs and Ghibellines ended the imperial-feudal system in the north, where cities gained independence. In 1176, the [[Lombard League]] of city-states defeated Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]], ensuring their independence.

City-states – e.g. [[Milan]], [[Florence]], [[Venice]] – played a crucially innovative role in financial development by devising banking practices, and enabling new forms of social organisation. In coastal and southern areas, maritime republics dominated the Mediterranean and monopolised trade to the Orient. They were independent [[thalassocratic]] city-states, in which merchants had considerable power. Although oligarchical, the relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement. The best-known maritime republics were Venice, [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]], and [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]]. Each had dominion over overseas lands, islands, lands on the Adriatic, Aegean, and Black seas, and commercial colonies in the Near East and North Africa.

Venice and Genoa were Europe's gateways to the East, and producers of fine glass, while Florence was a centre of silk, wool, banking, and jewellery. The wealth generated meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned. The republics participated in the [[Crusades]], providing support, transport, but mostly taking political and trading opportunities.  first felt the economic changes which led to the [[commercial revolution]]: Venice was able to [[Sack of Constantinople|sack Byzantine's capital]] and finance [[Marco Polo]]'s voyages to Asia; the first universities were formed in  cities, and scholars such as [[Aquinas]] obtained international fame; capitalism and banking families emerged in Florence, where [[Dante]] and [[Giotto]] were active around 1300. In the south, Sicily had become an [[Emirate of Sicily|Arab Islamic emirate]] in the 9th century, thriving until the [[Italo-Normans]] conquered it in the late 11th century, together with most of the Lombard and Byzantine principalities of southern . The region was subsequently divided between the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] and [[Kingdom of Naples]].{{efn|Kingdom of Naples is used by historians, but not by its rulers, who kept the original 'Kingdom of Sicily' (i.e., there existed two Kingdoms of Sicily).}} The [[Black Death]] of 1348 killed perhaps a third of 's population.

=== Early modern period ===

[[File: 1494.svg|thumb|upright=.8|left|[[List of historic states of #Late Middle Ages| states]] before the [[ Wars]] in 1494]]

During the 1400s and 1500s,  was the birthplace and heart of the [[Renaissance]]. This era marked the transition from the medieval period to the modern age and was fostered by the wealth accumulated by merchant cities and the patronage of dominant families.  polities were now regional states effectively ruled by princes, in control of trade and administration, and their courts became centres of the arts and sciences. These princedoms were led by political dynasties and merchant families, such as the [[Medici]] of Florence. After the end of the [[Western Schism]], newly elected [[Pope Martin V]] returned to the [[Papal States]] and restored  as the sole centre of Western Christianity. The [[Medici Bank]] was made the credit institution of the Papacy, and significant ties were established between the Church and new political dynasties.

In 1453, despite activity by [[Pope Nicholas V]] to support the Byzantines, the city of [[Constantinople]] fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. This led to the migration of [[ scholars in the Renaissance| scholars]] and texts to , fuelling the rediscovery of  [[humanism]]. Humanist rulers such as [[Federico da Montefeltro]] and [[Pope Pius II]] worked to establish [[ideal city|ideal cities]], founding [[Urbino]] and [[Pienza]]. [[Pico della Mirandola]] wrote the ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'', considered the manifesto of the Renaissance. In the arts, the  Renaissance exercised a dominant influence on European art for centuries, with artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Botticelli]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Giotto]], [[Donatello]], and [[Titian]], and architects such as [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Andrea Palladio]], and [[Donato Bramante]].  [[List of  explorers|explorers]] and navigators from the maritime republics, eager to find an alternative route to the Indies to bypass the Ottomans, offered their services to monarchs of Atlantic countries and played a key role in ushering the [[Age of Discovery]] and colonisation of the Americas. The most notable were: [[Christopher Columbus]], who opened the Americas for conquest by Europeans; [[John Cabot]], the first European to explore North America since the [[Norsemen|Norse]]; and [[Amerigo Vespucci]], for whom the continent of [[Naming of the Americas|America]] is named.

A defensive alliance known as the [[Italic League]] was formed between Venice, Naples, Florence, Milan, and the Papacy. [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo ''the Magnificent'' de Medici]] was the Renaissance's greatest patron, his support allowed the League to [[Siege of Otranto|abort invasion]] by the Turks. The alliance, however, collapsed in the 1490s; the invasion of [[Charles VIII of ]] initiated a series of wars in the peninsula. During the [[High Renaissance]], popes such as [[Julius II]] (1503–1513) fought for control of  against foreign monarchs; [[Paul III]] (1534–1549) preferred to mediate between the European powers to secure peace. In the middle of such conflicts, the Medici popes [[Leo X]] (1513–1521) and [[Clement VII]] (1523–1534) faced the [[Protestant Reformation]] in , England and elsewhere.

In 1559, at the end of the [[ wars]] between  and the Habsburgs, about half of  (the southern Kingdoms of [[kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], and the [[Duchy of Milan]]) was under  rule, while the other half remained independent (many states continued to be formally part of the Holy Roman Empire). The Papacy launched the [[Counter-Reformation]], whose key events include: the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563); adoption of the [[Gregorian calendar]]; the [[Jesuit  mission]]; the [[ Wars of Religion]]; end of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648); and the [[Great  War]]. The  economy declined in the 1600s and 1700s.

During the [[War of the  Succession]] (1700–1714),  acquired most of the  domains in , namely Milan, Naples and Sardinia; the latter was given to the House of Savoy in exchange for Sicily in 1720. Later, a branch of the Bourbons ascended to the throne of Sicily and Naples. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], north and central  were reorganised as [[Sister Republics]] of  and, later, as a [[Kingdom of  (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of ]]. The south was administered by [[Joachim Murat]], Napoleon's brother-in-law. 1814's [[Congress of Vienna]] restored the situation of the late 18th century, but the ideals of the [[ Revolution]] could not be eradicated, and re-surfaced during the [[political upheaval]]s that characterised the early 19th century. The first adoption of the [[ tricolour]] by an  state, the [[Cispadane Republic]], occurred during [[Flags of Napoleonic |Napoleonic ]], following the  Revolution, which advocated national [[self-determination]]. This event is celebrated by [[Tricolour Day]].

=== Unification ===
{{Main|Unification of }}
The [[birth of the Kingdom of ]] was the result of efforts of  nationalists and monarchists loyal to the [[House of Savoy]] to establish a  encompassing the entire [[ Peninsula]]. By the mid-19th century, rising [[ nationalism]] led to revolution. Following the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, the political and social  unification movement, or [[Risorgimento]], emerged to unite  by consolidating the states and liberating them from foreign control. A radical figure was the patriotic journalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], founder of the political movement [[Young ]] in the 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement. 1847 saw the first public performance of "[[Il Canto degli Italiani]]", which became the national anthem in 1946.

}}

The most famous member of Young  was the revolutionary and general [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] who led the republican drive for unification in southern . However, the  monarchy of the House of Savoy, in the [[Kingdom of Sardinia (1720–1861)|Kingdom of Sardinia]], whose government was led by [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]], also had ambitions of establishing a united  state. In the context of the [[1848 liberal revolutions]] that swept Europe, an unsuccessful [[First  War of Independence]] was declared against [[-|]]. In 1855, Sardinia became an ally of Britain and  in the [[Crimean War]]. Sardinia fought the  Empire in the [[Second  War of Independence]] of 1859, with the aid of , resulting in liberating [[Lombardy]]. On the basis of the [[Plombières Agreement]], the Sardinia ceded [[Savoy]] and [[Nice]] to , an event that caused the [[Niçard exodus]].

In 1860–1861, Garibaldi led the drive for unification in Naples and Sicily. [[Teano]] was the site of a famous meeting between Garibaldi and [[Victor Emmanuel II]], the last king of Sardinia, during which Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel's hand and hailed him as [[King of ]]. Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's southern  in a union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. This allowed the Sardinian government to [[Proclamation of the Kingdom of |declare a united  kingdom]] on 17 March 1861, with Victor Emmanuel II as its first king. In 1865, the kingdom's capital was moved from Turin to Florence. In 1866, Victor Emmanuel II, allied with [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War]], waged the [[Third  War of Independence]], which resulted in  annexing [[Veneto|Venetia]]. Finally, in 1870, as  abandoned Rome during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the  [[Capture of Rome|captured the Papal States]], unification was completed, and the capital moved to Rome.

Sardinia's constitution was extended to all of  in 1861, and provided basic freedoms for the new state; but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied classes. The new kingdom was governed by a parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberals. As northern  quickly industrialised, southern and northern rural areas remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions to migrate and fuelling [[ diaspora|a large and influential diaspora]]. The [[ Socialist Party]] increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment. In the last two decades of the 19th century,  developed into [[ Empire|a colonial power]] by subjugating [[ |]], [[ |]], [[ Tripolitania|Tripolitania]], and [[ Cyrenaica|Cyrenaica]] in Africa. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. The pre-[[World War I]] period was dominated by [[Giovanni Giolitti]], prime minister five times between 1892 and 1921.

[[ entry into World War I| entered into the First World War]] in 1915 with the aim of completing national unity, so it is also considered the Fourth  War of Independence, from a historiographical perspective, as the conclusion of the [[unification of ]]. , nominally allied with the [[ Empire|]] and [[Austro-]] empires in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], in 1915 joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], entering World War I with a [[Treaty of London (1915)|promise]] of substantial territorial gains that included west [[Inner Carniola]], the former [[ Littoral]], and [[Dalmatia]], as well as parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The country's contribution to the Allied victory earned it a place as one of the "[[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]]" powers. Reorganisation of the army and conscription led to  victories. In October 1918, the  launched a massive offensive, culminating in victory at the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]]. This marked the end of war on the  Front, secured dissolution of the Austro- Empire, and was instrumental in [[Armistice with |ending]] the war less than two weeks later.

During the war, more than 650,000  soldiers and as many civilians died, and the kingdom was on the brink of bankruptcy. The [[Treaty of -Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of -Germain-en-Laye]] (1919) and [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] (1920) allowed for annexation of [[Trentino Alto-Adige]], the [[Julian March]], [[Istria]], the [[Kvarner Gulf]], and the Dalmatian city of [[Zadar|Zara]]. The subsequent [[Treaty of Rome (1924)|Treaty of Rome]] (1924) led to annexation of [[Fiume]] by .  did not receive other territories promised by the Treaty of London, so this outcome was denounced as a "[[mutilated victory]]", by [[Benito Mussolini]], which helped lead to the [[Fascist  (1922–1943)|rise of  fascism]].

[[File:Mussolini mezzobusto.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|left|The fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] titled himself ''[[Duce]]'' and ruled the country from 1922 until [[Fall of the Fascist regime in |his overthrow]] in 1943.]]

The [[Biennio Rosso|socialist agitations]] that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the [[ Revolution]], led to counter-revolution and repression throughout . The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small [[National Fascist Party]], led by Mussolini. In October 1922, the [[Blackshirts]] of the National Fascist Party organised a [[mass demonstration]] and the "[[March on Rome]]" [[coup]]. King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] appointed Mussolini as [[Prime Minister of |prime minister]], transferring power to the fascists without armed conflict. 
Mussolini banned political parties and curtailed personal liberties, establishing a dictatorship. These actions attracted international attention and inspired similar dictatorships in [[Nazi ]] and [[Francoist ]].

[[Fascism]] was based upon  nationalism and imperialism, seeking to expand  possessions via [[Irredentism|irredentist claims]] based on the legacy of the Roman and [[Venetian empire]]s. 
For this reason the fascists engaged in [[interventionist foreign policy]]. In 1935, Mussolini [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded ]] and founded [[ East Africa]], resulting in international isolation.  withdrew from the [[League of Nations]].  then [[Pact of Steel|allied with Nazi ]] and the [[Tripartite Pact|Empire of ]], and strongly supported [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[ Civil War]]. In April 1939,  [[ invasion of |invaded ]].

 entered World War II on 10 June 1940. At this date,  practically had lost the [[Battle of ]].
At different times,  advanced in [[ conquest of  Somaliland| Somaliland]], [[ invasion of |]], the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]], and eastern fronts. They were, however, [[ participation on the Eastern Front|defeated on the Eastern Front]] as well as in the [[East African campaign (World War II)|East African]] and [[North African campaign|North African]] campaigns, losing their territories in Africa and the Balkans. [[ war crimes]] included [[extrajudicial killing]]s and [[ethnic cleansing]] by deportation of about 25,000 people – mainly Yugoslavs – to [[ concentration camps]] and elsewhere. [[Yugoslav Partisans]] perpetrated their own crimes against the ethnic  population during and after the war, including the [[foibe massacres]]. An [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] began in July 1943, leading to the [[Fall of the Fascist regime in |collapse of the Fascist regime]] on 25 July. Mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of King [[Victor Emmanuel III]]. On 3 September,  signed the [[Armistice of Cassibile]],<!-- it became effective on 8 Sept---> ending its war with UK and USA. The , with the assistance of  fascists, succeeded in taking control of north and central  ([[Operation Achse]]). The country remained a battlefield, with the Allies moving up from the south.
[[File:01 partigiani a milano1.jpg|thumb|[[ resistance movement| partisans]] in Milan during the final insurrection leading to the [[liberation of ]] in April 1945]]

In the north, the  set up the [[ Social Republic]] (RSI), a Nazi [[puppet state]] and [[collaborationist]] regime with Mussolini installed as leader after he was [[Gran Sasso raid|rescued]] by  paratroopers. What remained of the  troops was organised into the [[ Co-belligerent Army]], which fought alongside the Allies, while other  forces, loyal to Mussolini, opted to fight alongside the  in the [[National Republican Army]].  troops, with RSI collaboration, committed massacres and deported thousands of Jews to death camps. The post-armistice period saw the emergence of the [[ Resistance]], who fought a guerrilla war against the [[Operation Achse|Nazi  occupiers]] and collaborators. 
An aspect of this period was the [[ civil war]] due to fighting between partisans and fascist RSI forces. In April 1945, with defeat looming, Mussolini attempted to escape north, but was captured and [[Death of Benito Mussolini|summarily executed]] by partisans.

Hostilities ended on 29 April 1945, [[Surrender of Caserta|when the  forces in  surrendered]]. Nearly half a million  died in the war, society was divided, and the economy all but destroyed – per capita income in 1944 was at its lowest point since 1900. 
In the aftermath of the war there was a revival of  republicanism, leading to the [[1946  institutional referendum]].

{{Main|History of the  Republic}}
 became a republic after the 1946 referendum held on 2 June, a day celebrated since as ''[[Festa della Repubblica]]''. This was the first time women voted nationally. Victor Emmanuel III's son, [[Umberto II]], was forced to abdicate. The [[Constitution of |Republican Constitution]] was approved in 1948. Under the [[Treaty of Paris between  and the Allied Powers]], areas next to the [[Adriatic Sea]] were annexed by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], resulting in the [[Istrian-Dalmatian exodus]], which involved the emigration of around 300,000 [[Istrian |Istrian]] and [[Dalmatian ]].  lost all colonial possessions, ending the [[ Empire]].

Fears of a Communist takeover proved crucial in [[ general election, 1948|1948]], when the [[Christian Democracy ()|Christian Democrats]], under [[Alcide De Gasperi]], won a landslide victory. Consequently, in 1949  became a member of [[NATO]]. The [[Marshall Plan]] revived the economy, which, until the late 1960s, enjoyed a period called the [[ economic miracle]]. In the 1950s,  became a founding country of the [[European Communities]], a forerunner of the European Union. From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, the country experienced the ''[[Years of Lead ()|Years of Lead]]'', characterised by economic difficulties, especially after the [[1973 oil crisis]]; social conflicts; and terrorist massacres.

The economy recovered and  became the world's fifth-largest industrial nation after it gained entry into the [[G7]] in the 1970s. However, national debt skyrocketed past 100% of GDP. Between 1992 and 1993,  faced terror attacks perpetrated by the [[Sicilian Mafia]] as a consequence of new anti-mafia measures by the government. Voters – disenchanted with political paralysis, massive public debt and extensive corruption uncovered by the [[Mani pulite|Clean Hands]] investigation – demanded radical reform. The Christian Democrats, who had ruled for almost 50 years, underwent a crisis and disbanded, splitting into factions. The Communists reorganised as a [[social-democratic]] force. During the 1990s and 2000s, [[Centre-right coalition ()|centre-right]] (dominated by media magnate [[Silvio Berlusconi]]) and [[Centre-left coalition ()|centre-left]] coalitions (led by professor [[Romano Prodi]]) alternately governed.

In 2011, amidst the [[Great Recession]], Berlusconi [[Resignation of Silvio Berlusconi|resigned]] and was replaced by the technocratic cabinet of [[Mario Monti]]. In 2014, [[Matteo Renzi]] became [[Prime Minister of |prime minister]] and the government started constitutional reform. This was rejected in a 2016 [[ constitutional referendum, 2016|referendum]] and [[Paolo Gentiloni]] became prime minister.

During the [[European migrant crisis]] of the 2010s,  was the entry point and leading destination for most asylum seekers entering the EU. Between 2013 and 2018, it took in over 700,000 migrants, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, which put a strain on the public purse and led to a surge in support for far-right or euro-sceptic parties. After the [[ general election, 2018|2018 general election]], [[Giuseppe Conte]] became prime minister of [[Government of Change|a populist coalition]].

With almost 200,000 victims,  was one of the countries with the most deaths in the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] and one of the most [[Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic|affected economically]]. In February 2021, after [[2021  government crisis|a government crisis]], Conte resigned. [[Mario Draghi]], former president of the [[European Central Bank]], formed a [[Draghi Cabinet|national unity government]] supported by most main parties, pledging to implement an economic stimulus to face the crisis caused by the pandemic. In 2022, [[Giorgia Meloni]] was sworn in as 's first female prime minister.
