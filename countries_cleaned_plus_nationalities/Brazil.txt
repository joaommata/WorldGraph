[[File:Pinturas Rupestres - Serra da Capivara I.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rock art]] at [[Serra da Capivara National Park]], one of the largest and oldest concentrations of prehistoric sites in the [[Americas]]]]

Some of the earliest human remains found in the Americas, [[Luzia Woman]], were found in the area of [[Pedro Leopoldo]], [[Minas Gerais]], and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years. The earliest pottery ever found in the Western Hemisphere was excavated in the Amazon basin of  and [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to over 8,000 years ago (6000 BC). The pottery was found near [[Santarém, Pará|Santarém]] and provides evidence that the region supported a complex prehistoric culture. The [[Marajoara culture]] flourished on [[Marajó]] in the Amazon delta from AD 400 to 1400, developing sophisticated pottery, [[social stratification]], large populations, [[mound building]], and complex social formations such as [[chiefdom]]s.

Around the time of the  arrival, the territory of present day  had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people, mostly semi-nomadic, who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migrant agriculture. The population comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups (e.g., the Tupis, [[Guaraní people|Guaranis]], [[Gê peoples|Gês]], and [[Arawak peoples|Arawaks]]). The Tupi people were subdivided into the [[Tupiniquim|Tupiniquins]] and [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambás]].{{sfnp|Levine|2003|p=31}}

Before the arrival of the Europeans, the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture, language and moral beliefs. These wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water, with [[Human cannibalism|cannibalistic]] rituals on prisoners of war.{{sfnp|Fausto|2000|pp=78–80}} While heredity had some weight, leadership was a status more won over time than assigned in succession ceremonies and conventions. Slavery among the indigenous groups had a different meaning than it had for Europeans, since it originated from a diverse socioeconomic organization, in which asymmetries were translated into [[kinship]] relations.{{sfnp|Fausto|2000|p=50}}

Following the 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], the land now called  was claimed for the [[ Empire]] on 22 April 1500, with [[Discovery of |the arrival of the  fleet commanded by Pedro Álvares Cabral]]. The  encountered indigenous peoples divided into several ethnic societies, most of whom spoke languages of the [[Tupi–Guaraní|Tupi–Guarani]] family and fought among themselves. Though the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization effectively began in 1534, when King [[John III of |John&nbsp;III of ]] divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous [[Captaincies of |captaincies]].

However, the decentralized and unorganized captaincy system proved problematic, and in 1549 the  king restructured them into the [[Governorate General of ]] in the city of [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], which became the capital of a single and centralized  colony in South America. In the first two centuries of colonization, Indigenous and European groups lived in constant war, establishing opportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other.{{sfnp|Crocitti|Vallance|2012}}

By the mid-16th century, [[Sugar#Sugarcane|cane sugar]] had become [[ sugar cycle|'s most important export]], while slaves purchased in Sub-Saharan Africa in the [[Slavery in Africa#Atlantic slave trade|slave market of Western Africa]] (not only those from  allies of their colonies in [[ |]] and [[ |]]), had become its largest import, to cope with [[Engenho|sugarcane plantations]], due to increasing international demand for  sugar.  received more than 2.8 million slaves from Africa between the years 1500 and 1800.

By the end of the 17th century, sugar exports began to decline and the discovery of gold by [[bandeirantes]] in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colony's economy, fostering a [[ Gold Rush|gold rush]] which attracted thousands of new settlers to  from  and all  colonies around the world. This increased level of immigration in turn caused [[War of the Emboabas|some conflicts]] between newcomers and old settlers.

 expeditions known as ''bandeiras'' gradually [[Uti possidetis#The  frontier movement into -claimed lands|expanded 's original colonial frontiers]] in South America to its approximately current borders. In this era, other European powers tried to colonize parts of , in incursions that the  had to fight, notably the  [[ Antarctique|in Rio during the 1560s]], [[Equinoctial |in Maranhão during the 1610s]], and the [[ invasions of | in Bahia and Pernambuco]], during the [[– War]], after the end of [[Iberian Union]].

The  colonial administration in  had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of 's wealthiest and largest colony: to keep under control and eradicate all forms of slave rebellion and resistance, such as the [[Palmares (quilombo)|Quilombo of Palmares]], and to repress all movements for autonomy or independence, such as the [[Inconfidência Mineira|Minas Gerais Conspiracy]].

In late 1807,  and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of [[continental ]], causing [[John VI of |Prince Regent John]], in the name of [[Maria I of |Queen Maria I]], to [[Transfer of the  court to |move the royal court]] from [[Lisbon]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]]. There they established some of 's first financial institutions, such as its local [[stock exchange]]s and its [[Banco do Brasil|National Bank]], additionally ending the  monopoly on  trade and opening 's ports to other nations. In 1809, in retaliation for being forced into exile, the Prince Regent ordered the [[ conquest of  Guiana|conquest of  Guiana]].

With the end of the [[Peninsular War]] in 1814, the courts of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent John return to , deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony. In 1815, to justify continuing to live in , where the royal court had thrived for six years, the Crown established the [[ of ,  and the Algarves]], thus creating a [[pluricontinental]] transatlantic monarchic state. However, the leadership in , resentful of the new status of its larger colony, continued to demand the return of the court to Lisbon (see [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]]). In 1821, acceding to the demands of revolutionaries who had taken the city of [[Porto]], John VI departed for Lisbon. There he swore an oath to the new constitution, leaving his son, [[Pedro I of |Prince Pedro de Alcântara]], as Regent of the [[Kingdom of ]].

=== Independent empire ===
{{Main|Independence of |Empire of }}

[[File:Pedro Américo - Independência ou Morte - cores ajustadas.jpg|thumb|right|Declaration of the  independence by Pedro I on [[Independence Day ()|7 September 1822]]]]
Tensions between  and Brazilians increased and the [[ Cortes]], guided by the new political regime imposed by the Liberal Revolution, tried to re-establish  as a colony. The Brazilians refused to yield, and Prince Pedro decided to side with them, [[ Declaration of Independence|declaring the country's independence from ]] on 7 September 1822. A month later, Prince Pedro was proclaimed the first [[Emperor of ]], with the royal title of Dom [[Pedro I of |Pedro&nbsp;I]], resulting in the founding of the [[Empire of ]].

The [[ War of Independence]], which had already begun along this process, spread through the northern, northeastern regions and in the [[Cisplatina]] province. The last  soldiers surrendered on 8 March 1824;  [[Treaty of Rio de Janeiro (1825)|officially recognized]]  independence on 29 August 1825.

On 7 April 1831, worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissent with both liberals and conservatives, including an attempt of [[Confederation of the Equator|republican secession]]{{sfnp|Fausto|1999|pp=82–83}} and unreconciled to the way that absolutists in  had given in the succession of King John VI, Pedro&nbsp;I departed for  to [[Liberal Wars|reclaim his daughter's crown]] after [[Abdication of Pedro I of |abdicating the  throne]] in favor of his five-year-old son and heir (Dom [[Pedro II of |Pedro&nbsp;II]]).
[[File:Pedro Américo - D. Pedro II na abertura da Assembléia Geral.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Pedro II of |Pedro II]], [[List of monarchs of |Emperor of ]] between 1831 and 1889]]

As the new Emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he came of age, a [[Regency period (Empire of )|regency]] was set up by the [[General Assembly ()|General Assembly]]. In the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power, a series of localized rebellions took place, such as the [[Cabanagem]] in [[Grão-Pará Province|Grão-Pará]], the [[Malê Revolt]] in Salvador, the [[Balaiada]] ([[Maranhão]]), the [[Sabinada]] ([[Bahia]]), and the [[Ragamuffin War]], which began in [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and was supported by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]. These emerged from the provinces' dissatisfaction with the central power, coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar to a vast, slaveholding and newly independent nation state.{{sfnp|Fausto|1999|loc=Chapter 2, 2.1 to 2.3}} This period of internal political and social upheaval, which included the [[Praieira revolt]] in [[Pernambuco]], was overcome only at the end of the 1840s, years after the end of the regency, which occurred with the [[Dom Pedro II#Early coronation|premature coronation of Pedro II]] in 1841.{{sfnp|Fausto|1999}}

During the last phase of the monarchy, internal political debate centered on the issue of slavery. The [[Atlantic slave trade to |Atlantic slave trade]] was outlawed in 1850, as a result of the British [[Aberdeen Act]] and the [[Eusébio de Queirós Law]], but only in May 1888, after a long process of [[Abolitionism in |internal mobilization and debate]] for an ethical and legal dismantling of [[Slavery in |slavery in the country]], was the institution formally abolished with the approval of the [[Lei Áurea|Golden Law]].

The foreign-affairs policies of the monarchy dealt with issues pertaining 's neighboring countries in the [[Southern Cone]]. Long after the [[Cisplatine War]] that resulted in the independence of [[]],  won three international wars during the 58-year reign of Pedro&nbsp;II: the [[Platine War]], the [[ War]] and the devastating [[ War]], the largest war effort in  history.{{sfnp|Fausto|1999|loc=Chapter 2, p. 83, and 2.6 "The  War"}}

Although there was no desire among the majority of Brazilians to change the country's form of government,{{sfn|Ermakoff|2006|p=189}} on 15 November 1889, in disagreement with the majority of the [[Imperial  Army|Imperial Army]] officers, as well as with rural and financial elites, the monarchy was overthrown by a [[Proclamation of the Republic ()|military coup]]. A few days later, the [[Flag of |national flag]] was replaced with a new design that included the national motto "''Ordem e Progresso''", influenced by [[positivism]]. 15 November is now [[Republic Day]], a national holiday.

The [[Republic of the Sword|early republican government]] was a military dictatorship, with the army dominating affairs both in Rio de Janeiro and in the states. Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power.{{sfnp|Smallman|2002|loc=end of Chapter 1, from p. 18 "Military rule"}} Not until 1894, following an [[Encilhamento|economic crisis]] and [[Revolta da Armada|a military one]], did civilians take power, remaining there until October 1930.{{sfnp|Smallman|2002|pp=21–26}}

In this first republican period,  maintained a relative balance characterized by a success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries, only broken by the [[Acre War]] (1899–1902) and [[ during World War I|its involvement]] in [[World War I]] (1914–1918), followed by a [[Presidency of Artur Bernardes#Withdrawal from the League of Nations|failed attempt to exert a prominent role]] in the [[League of Nations]]; Internally, from the crisis of ''Encilhamento'' and the [[Revolta da Armada|Navy Revolts]], a prolonged cycle of financial, political and social instability began until the 1920s, keeping the country besieged by various rebellions, both civilian and military.

Little by little, [[Rebellions and revolutions in #1st Republican period (1889–1930)|a cycle of general instability]] sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent that in the wake of the murder of his running mate, the defeated opposition presidential candidate [[Getúlio Vargas]], supported by most of the military, successfully led the [[ Revolution of 1930|Revolution of 1930]]. Vargas and the military were supposed to assume power temporarily, but instead closed down Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with his own supporters.

In the 1930s, three attempts to remove Vargas and his supporters from power failed. The first was the [[Constitutionalist Revolution]] in 1932, led by São Paulo's oligarchy. The second was a [[ uprising of 1935|Communist uprising]] in November 1935, and the last one a ''[[Integralist Uprising|putsch]]'' attempt by [[ Integralist Action|local fascists]] in May 1938. The 1935 uprising created a security crisis in which Congress transferred more power to the executive branch. The [[1937  coup d'état|1937 ''coup d'état'']] resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election and formalized Vargas as dictator, beginning the [[Estado Novo ()|Estado Novo]] era. During this period, government brutality and censorship of the press increased.

During [[World War II]],  remained neutral until August 1942, when the country suffered [[Submarine warfare#Atlantic ocean|retaliation]] by [[Nazi ]] and [[ under fascism|Fascist ]] in a strategic dispute over the South Atlantic, and, therefore, [[ in World War II|entered the war]] on the [[Allies of World War II|allied side]]. In addition to [[Battle of the Atlantic#South Atlantic (May 1942 – September 1943)|its participation in the battle of the Atlantic]],  also sent an [[ Expeditionary Force|expeditionary force]] to fight in the [[ Campaign (World War II)| campaign]].

With the Allied victory in 1945 and the end of the fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas' position became untenable, and he was [[1945  coup d'état|swiftly overthrown]] in another military coup, with democracy reinstated by the same army that had ended it 15 years earlier. Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis, after having returned to power by election in 1950.

Several brief interim governments followed Vargas' suicide. [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory stance towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises. The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably, but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of [[Brasília]], inaugurated in 1960. Kubitschek's successor, [[Jânio Quadros]], resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office. His vice-president, [[João Goulart]], assumed the presidency, but aroused strong political opposition and was [[1964  coup d'état|deposed in April 1964]] by a coup that resulted in a [[Military dictatorship in |military dictatorship]].

The new regime was intended to be transitory, but gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the [[AI-5|Fifth Institutional Act]] in 1968. Oppression was not limited to those who resorted to [[Armed struggle against the  military dictatorship|guerrilla tactics to fight the regime]], but also reached institutional opponents, artists, journalists and other members of civil society,{{sfnp|Crocitti|Vallance|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VhkvhllLooUC&pg=PA395 395], last paragraph}} inside and outside the country through "[[Operation Condor]]".{{sfnp|Crocitti|Vallance|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VhkvhllLooUC&pg=PA396 396]}} Like other [[authoritarianism|authoritarian regimes]], due to an economic boom, known as the "[[ Miracle|economic miracle]]", the  military dictatorship reached a peak in popularity in the early 1970s.{{sfnp|Crocitti|Vallance|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VhkvhllLooUC&pg=PA395 395–97]}}

Slowly, however, the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power had not slowed the repression, even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas. The inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure made a redemocratization policy inevitable, which from the regime side was led by Generals [[Ernesto Geisel]] and [[Golbery do Couto e Silva]].{{sfnp|Fausto|1999|loc=Chapter 6 "The military government and the transition to democracy (1964–1984)"}} With the enactment of the [[Amnesty law#|Amnesty Law]] in 1979,  began a slow [[Redemocratization in |return to democracy]], which was completed during the 1980s.{{sfnp|Fausto|1999}}

[[File:Ulyssesguimaraesconstituicao restored.jpg|thumb|[[Ulysses Guimarães]] holding the [[Constitution of |Constitution of 1988]]]]

Civilians returned to power in 1985 when [[José Sarney]] assumed the presidency. He became unpopular during his tenure through failure to control the economic crisis and [[hyperinflation]] he inherited from the military regime. Sarney's unsuccessful government led to the [[ presidential election, 1989|election in 1989]] of the almost-unknown [[Fernando Collor de Mello|Fernando Collor]], who was subsequently [[Impeachment of Fernando Collor de Mello|impeached by the National Congress]] in 1992. Collor was succeeded by his vice-president, [[Itamar Franco]], who appointed [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] as Minister of Finance. In 1994, Cardoso devised a highly successful [[Plano Real]] that, after decades of [[Timeline of  economic stabilization plans|failed economic plans]] made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation, finally stabilized the  economy.{{sfnp|Fausto|1999|loc=Epilogue}} Cardoso won the [[1994  general election|1994 election]], and [[1998  general election|again in 1998]].

The [[peaceful transition of power]] from Cardoso to his main opposition leader, [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] ([[ presidential election, 2002|elected in 2002]] and [[ presidential election, 2006|re-elected in 2006]]), was seen as proof that  had achieved a long-sought political stability. However, sparked by discontent accumulated over decades from corruption, [[Police brutality by country#|police brutality]], inefficiencies of the political [[The Establishment|establishment]] and [[public service]], [[2013 protests in |numerous peaceful protests]] erupted in  in the middle of the first term of [[Dilma Rousseff]], who had succeeded Lula after winning election [[ presidential election, 2010|in 2010]] and again [[ presidential election, 2014|in 2014]] by narrow margins.

Rousseff [[Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff|was impeached]] by the [[ Congress]] in 2016, halfway into her second term, and replaced by her vice-president [[Michel Temer]], who assumed full presidential powers after Rousseff's impeachment was accepted on 31 August. Large street [[2015–16 protests in |protests for and against her]] took place during the impeachment process. The charges against her were fueled by political and economic crises along with evidence of involvement with politicians from all the primary political parties. In 2017, the Supreme Court requested the investigation of 71  lawmakers and nine ministers of President [[Michel Temer]]'s cabinet who were allegedly linked to the [[Operation Car Wash|Petrobras corruption scandal]]. President Temer himself was also accused of [[Corruption in |corruption]].

In the fiercely contested [[2018  general election|2018 elections]], the controversial conservative candidate [[Jair Bolsonaro]] of the [[Social Liberal Party ()|Social Liberal Party]] (PSL) was elected president, winning in the second round against [[Fernando Haddad]], of the [[Workers' Party ()|Workers Party]] (PT), with the support of 55.13% of the valid votes. In the early 2020s,  became [[COVID-19 pandemic in |one of the hardest hit countries]] during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], receiving the second-highest death toll worldwide after the . In May 2021, [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] stated that he would run for a third term in the [[2022  general election]] against Bolsonaro. In October 2022, Lula was in first place in the first round, with 48.43% of the support from the electorate, and received 50.90% of the votes in the second round.
