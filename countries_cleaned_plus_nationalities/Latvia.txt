{{Main|History of }}
Around 3000 BC, the Proto-Baltic ancestors of the  people settled on the eastern coast of the [[Baltic Sea]]. The [[Balts]] established trade routes to Rome and [[Byzantium]], trading local [[amber]] for precious metals. By 900 AD, four distinct Baltic tribes inhabited : [[Curonians]], [[Latgalians]], [[Selonians]], [[Semigallians]] (in : ''kurši'', ''latgaļi'', ''sēļi'' and ''zemgaļi''), as well as the Finnic tribe of [[Livonian people|Livonians]] (''lībieši'') speaking a Finnic language.

In the 12th century in the territory of , there were lands with their rulers: {{Interlanguage link|Vanema|lv|Vanema}}, {{Interlanguage link|Ventava (land)|lt=Ventava|lv|Ventava}}, [[Bandava]], [[Piemare]], {{Interlanguage link|Duvzare|lv|Duvzare}}, {{Interlanguage link|Selen (land)|lt=Selen|lv|Sēlija (zeme)}}, [[Principality of Koknese|Koknese]], [[Jersika]], [[Tālava]] and {{Interlanguage link|Atzele|lv|Atzele}}.

=== Medieval period ===
Although the local people had contact with the outside world for centuries, they became more fully integrated into the European socio-political system in the 12th century. The first missionaries, sent by the pope, sailed up the [[Daugava]] River in the late 12th century, seeking converts. The local people, however, did not convert to Christianity as readily as the church had hoped.

[[Prussian Crusade| crusaders]] were sent, or more likely decided to go of their own accord as they were known to do. [[ Meinhard]] of Segeberg arrived in [[Ikšķile]], in 1184, traveling with merchants to [[Livonia]], on a Catholic mission to convert the population from their original pagan beliefs. [[Pope Celestine III]] had called for [[Livonian Crusade#Wars against  (1208–27)|a crusade against pagans in northern Europe]] in 1193. When peaceful means of conversion failed to produce results, Meinhard plotted to convert Livonians by force of arms.

At the beginning of the 13th century,  ruled large parts of what is currently . The influx of  crusaders especially increased in the second half of the 13th century following the [[Crusades#Crusades and the Holy Land, 1095–1291|decline and fall of the Crusader States]] in the [[Middle East]]. Together with southern , these conquered areas formed the [[Crusader states|crusader state]] that became known as [[Terra Mariana]] ([[Medieval Latin]] for "Land of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]") or Livonia. In 1282, [[Riga]], and later the cities of [[Cēsis]], [[Limbaži]], [[Koknese]] and [[Valmiera]], became part of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Riga became an important point of east–west trading and formed close cultural links with [[western Europe]]. The first  settlers were knights from northern  and citizens of northern  towns who brought their [[Low ]] language to the region, which shaped many loanwords in the  language.

=== Reformation period and  and  rule ===

[[File:- Commonwealth at its maximum extent.svg|thumb|The [[– Commonwealth]] at its largest extent; modern-day boundaries are also shown.]]
[[File: Empire.svg|thumb|The [[ Empire]] (1560–1815)]]

After the [[Livonian War]] (1558–1583), Livonia (northern  and southern ) fell under the hegemony of the [[– Commonwealth]]. The lands were ceded to the [[Grand Duchy of ]] and formed into the [[Duchy of Livonia]] (''Ducatus Livoniae Ultradunensis''). [[Gotthard Kettler]], the last master of the [[Livonian Order|Order of Livonia]], formed the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]]. Though the duchy was a vassal state to the  Grand Duchy and later of –, it retained a considerable degree of autonomy and experienced a golden age in the 16th century. [[Latgalia]], the easternmost region of , became a part of the [[Inflanty Voivodeship]] of the – Commonwealth.

In the 17th and early 18th centuries, the – Commonwealth, [[ Empire|]], and [[ Empire|]] struggled for supremacy in the eastern Baltic. After the [[– War (1600–1611)|– War]], northern Livonia (including Vidzeme) came under  rule. Riga became the capital of [[ Livonia]] and the largest city in the entire  Empire. Fighting continued sporadically between  and  until the [[Truce of Altmark]] in 1629. In , the  period is generally remembered as positive; serfdom was eased, a network of schools was established for the peasantry, and the power of the regional [[baltic |barons]] was diminished.

Several important cultural changes occurred during this time. Under  and largely  rule, western  adopted [[Lutheranism]] as its main religion. The ancient tribes of the Couronians, Semigallians, Selonians, Livs, and northern Latgallians assimilated to form the  people, speaking one  language. An actual  state had not been established, so the borders and definitions of who fell within that group are largely subjective. Meanwhile, largely isolated from the rest of , southern Latgallians adopted [[Catholicism]] under /[[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] influence. The native dialect remained distinct, although it acquired many  and  loanwords.

=== Livonia and Courland in the  Empire ===
During the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721), up to 40 percent of  died from famine and plague. Half the residents of Riga were killed by [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague in 1710–1711]]. The [[capitulation of  and Livonia]] in 1710 and the [[Treaty of Nystad]], ending the Great Northern War in 1721, gave Vidzeme to  (it became part of the [[Governorate of Livonia|Riga Governorate]]).  The Latgale region remained part of the – Commonwealth as Inflanty Voivodeship until 1772, when it was incorporated into . The [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]], a vassal state of the – Commonwealth, was annexed by  in 1795 in the [[Third Partition of ]], bringing all of what is now  into the  Empire. All three Baltic provinces preserved local laws,  as the local [[official language]] and their own parliament, the [[Landtag]].

The emancipation of the serfs took place in Courland in 1817 and in Vidzeme in 1819. In practice, however, the emancipation was actually advantageous to the landowners and nobility, as it dispossessed peasants of their land without compensation, forcing them to return to work at the estates "of their own free will". During these two centuries  experienced economic and construction boom – ports were expanded (Riga became the largest port in the  Empire), railways built; new factories, banks, and a university were established; many residential, public (theatres and museums), and school buildings were erected; new parks formed; and so on. Riga's boulevards and some streets outside the Old Town date from this period. [[Numeracy]] was also higher in the Livonian and Courlandian parts of the  Empire, which may have been influenced by the Protestant religion of the inhabitants.

During the 19th century, the social structure changed dramatically. A class of independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the peasants to repurchase their land, but many landless peasants remained. Many  left for the cities and sought education and industrial jobs. There also developed a growing urban [[proletariat]] and an increasingly influential  [[bourgeoisie]]. The [[Young |Young ]] ({{langx|lv|Jaunlatvieši}}) movement laid the groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century, many of its leaders looking to the [[Slavophilia|Slavophiles]] for support against the prevailing -dominated social order. The rise in use of the  language in literature and society became known as the [[ National Awakening|First National Awakening]]. [[Russification]] began in Latgale after the  led the [[January Uprising]] in 1863: this spread to the rest of what is now  by the 1880s. The Young  were largely eclipsed by the [[New Current]], a broad leftist social and political movement, in the 1890s. Popular discontent exploded in the [[ Revolution of 1905|1905  Revolution]], which took a nationalist character in the Baltic provinces.

=== Declaration of independence and interwar period ===
[[File:Janis Cakste.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[Jānis Čakste]] (1859–1927), the first [[president of ]]]]

[[World War I]] devastated the territory and other western parts of the  Empire. Demands for [[self-determination]] were initially confined to [[autonomy]], until a power vacuum was created by the [[ Revolution]] in 1917, followed by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] between  and  in March 1918, then the Allied [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice with  on 11 November 1918]]. The [[People's Council of ]] proclaimed the independence, and [[Kārlis Ulmanis]] was entrusted to set up a government and he took the position of prime minister. The general representative of  [[August Winnig]] formally handed over political power to the  provisional government on 26 November, and he became its first prime minister.

The [[ War of Independence|war of independence]] that followed was part of a general chaotic period of civil and new border wars in eastern Europe. By the spring of 1919, there were actually three governments: the provisional government headed by Ulmanis, supported by the [[Tautas padome]] and the [[Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control|Inter-Allied Commission of Control]]; the [[ Socialist Soviet Republic| Soviet government]] led by [[Pēteris Stučka]], supported by the [[Red Army]]; and the provisional government headed by [[Andrievs Niedra]], supported by [[Freikorps in the Baltic|Baltic- forces]] composed of the ''[[Baltische Landeswehr]]'' ("Baltic Defence Force") and the [[Freikorps]] formation ''[[Eiserne Division]]'' ("Iron Division").  and  forces defeated the  at the [[Battle of Cēsis (1919)|Battle of Wenden]] in June 1919, and a massive attack by a predominantly  force—the [[West  Volunteer Army]]—under [[Pavel Bermondt-Avalov]] was repelled in November. Eastern  was cleared of Red Army forces by  and  troops in early 1920 (from the  perspective the [[Battle of Daugavpils]] was a part of the [[–Soviet War]]).

A freely elected [[constituent assembly]] convened on 1 May 1920 and adopted a liberal constitution, the ''[[Constitution of |Satversme]]'', in February 1922. On 15 May 1934, Ulmanis staged [[1934  coup d'état|a bloodless coup]], establishing a nationalist dictatorship that lasted until 1940. After 1934, Ulmanis established [[government corporation]]s to buy up private firms with the aim of "Latvianising" the economy. The constitution was partly suspended by Ulmanis after his coup in 1934 but reaffirmed in 1990. Since then, it has been amended and is still in effect in  today. With most of 's industrial base evacuated to the interior of  in 1915, radical land reform was the central political question for the young state. In 1897, 61.2% of the rural population had been landless; by 1936, that percentage had been reduced to 18%.

Early in the morning of 24 August 1939, the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi ]] signed a 10-year non-aggression pact, called the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. The pact contained a secret protocol, revealed only after 's defeat in 1945, according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into  and Soviet "[[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]". In the north, ,  and  were assigned to the Soviet sphere.

After the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, most of the [[Baltic ]] left  by agreement between Ulmanis's government and Nazi  under the [[Heim ins Reich]] programme. Most of those who remained left for  in summer 1940, when a second resettlement scheme was agreed. The racially approved being resettled mainly in , being given land and businesses in exchange for the money they had received from the sale of their previous assets.{{rp|46}}

On 5 October 1939,  was forced to accept a "mutual assistance" pact with the Soviet Union, granting the Soviets the right to station between 25,000 and 30,000 troops on  territory. State administrators were murdered and replaced by Soviet cadres. Elections were held with single pro-Soviet candidates listed for many positions. The resulting people's assembly immediately requested admission into the USSR, which the Soviet Union granted. , then a puppet government, was headed by [[Augusts Kirhenšteins]]. The Soviet Union incorporated  on 5 August 1940, as the ''[[ Soviet Socialist Republic]].''

The Soviets dealt harshly with their [[Enemy of the people#Soviet Union|perceived opponents]]&nbsp;– prior to [[Operation Barbarossa]], in less than a year, at least 34,250  were [[June deportation|deported]] or killed. Most were deported to Siberia where deaths were estimated at 40 percent.{{rp|48}}

On 22 June 1941,  troops attacked Soviet forces in Operation Barbarossa. There were some spontaneous uprisings by  against the Red Army which helped the . By 29 June [[Riga]] was reached and with Soviet troops killed, captured or retreating,  was left under the control of  forces by early July.{{rp|78–96}}

Under  occupation,  was administered as part of ''[[Reichskommissariat Ostland]]''.  paramilitary and [[Arajs Kommando|Auxiliary Police]] units established by the occupation authority participated in [[the Holocaust]] and other atrocities. 30,000 Jews were shot in  in the autumn of 1941.{{rp|127}} Another 30,000 Jews from the Riga ghetto were killed in the Rumbula Forest in November and December 1941, to reduce overpopulation in the ghetto and make room for more Jews being brought in from  and the West.{{rp|128}} There was a pause in fighting, apart from partisan activity, until after the [[Battle of Leningrad|siege of Leningrad]] ended in January 1944, and the Soviet troops advanced, entering  in July and eventually capturing Riga on 13 October 1944.{{rp|271}}

The Soviets reoccupied the country in 1944–1945, and further [[Operation Priboi|deportations]] followed as the country was [[collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivised]]
and [[Sovietisation|Sovietised]]. <!-- The first post-war years were marked by particularly dismal and sombre events in the fate of the  nation{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} I'll take this out; let the readers evaluate the events&nbsp;– they are quite self explanatory -->

In the post-war period,  was made to adopt Soviet farming methods. Rural areas were forced into [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]]. An extensive program to impose [[bilingualism]] was initiated in , limiting the use of  language in official uses in favor of using  as the main language. All of the minority schools (Jewish, , , , ) were closed down leaving only two media of instructions in the schools:  and . An influx of new colonists, including laborers, administrators, military personnel and their dependents from  and other Soviet republics started. By 1959 about 400,000  settlers arrived and the ethnic  population had fallen to 62%.

Since  had maintained a well-developed infrastructure and educated specialists, Moscow decided to base some of the Soviet Union's most advanced manufacturing in . New industry was created in , including a major [[Riga Autobus Factory|machinery factory RAF]] in [[Jelgava]], electrotechnical factories in [[Riga]], chemical factories in [[Daugavpils]], [[Valmiera]] and [[Olaine]]—and some food and oil processing plants.  manufactured trains, ships, minibuses, mopeds, telephones, radios and hi-fi systems, electrical and diesel engines, textiles, furniture, clothing, bags and luggage, shoes, musical instruments, home appliances, watches, tools and equipment, aviation and agricultural equipment and long list of other goods.  had its own film industry and musical records factory (LPs). However, there were not enough people to operate the newly built factories.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} To maintain and expand industrial production, skilled workers were migrating from all over the Soviet Union, decreasing the proportion of ethnic  in the republic. The population of  reached its peak in 1990 at just under 2.7 million people.

In the second half of the 1980s, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] started to introduce political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union that were called [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]]. In the summer of 1987, the first large demonstrations were held in Riga at the [[Freedom Monument]]—a symbol of independence. In the summer of 1988, a national movement, coalescing in the [[Popular Front of ]], was opposed by the [[International Front of the Working People of |Interfront]]. The  SSR, along with the other [[Baltic states|Baltic Republics]] was allowed greater autonomy, and in 1988, the old pre-war [[Flag of ]] flew again, replacing the Soviet  flag as the official flag in 1990. In 1989, the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] adopted a resolution on the ''[[Occupation of the Baltic states]]'', in which it declared the occupation "not in accordance with law", and not the "will of the Soviet people". Pro-independence Popular Front of  candidates gained a two-thirds majority in the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of |Supreme Council]] in the [[1990  Supreme Soviet election|March 1990 democratic elections]].

On 4 May 1990, the Supreme Council adopted the [[Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of ]], and the  SSR was renamed Republic of .

However, the central power in Moscow continued to regard  as a Soviet republic in 1990 and 1991. In January 1991, Soviet political and military forces unsuccessfully tried to overthrow the Republic of  authorities by occupying the central publishing house in Riga and establishing a Committee of National Salvation to usurp governmental functions. During the transitional period, Moscow maintained many central Soviet state authorities in .

[[Popular Front of |The Popular Front of ]] advocated that all permanent residents be eligible for  citizenship, however, universal citizenship for all permanent residents was not adopted. Instead, citizenship was granted to persons who had been citizens of  on the day of loss of independence in 1940 as well as their descendants. As a consequence, the majority of ethnic non- did not receive  citizenship since neither they nor their parents had ever been citizens of , becoming [[Non-citizens ()|non-citizens]] or citizens of other former Soviet republics. By 2011, more than half of non-citizens had taken [[naturalization]] exams and received  citizenship, but in 2015 there were still 290,660 non-citizens in , which represented 14.1% of the population. They have [[Statelessness|no citizenship of any country]], and cannot participate in the parliamentary elections. Children born to non-nationals or stateless persons after the re-establishment of independence on 21 August 1991 are automatically entitled to citizenship.

The Republic of  declared the end of the transitional period and restored full independence on 21 August 1991, in the aftermath of the failed [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|Soviet coup attempt]].  resumed diplomatic relations with Western states, including . The [[Saeima]], 's parliament, was again elected in 1993.  ended its military presence by completing its troop withdrawal in 1994 and shutting down the [[Skrunda-1]] radar station in 1998.

The major goals of  in the 1990s, to join [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], were achieved in 2004. The [[NATO Summit 2006]] was held in Riga. [[Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga]] was [[President of ]] from 1999 until 2007. She was the first female head of state in the former Soviet bloc state and was active in  joining both NATO and the European Union in 2004.  signed the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen agreement]] on 16 April 2003 and started its implementation on 21 December 2007.

In late 2018 the National Archives of  released a full alphabetical index of some 10,000 people recruited as agents or informants by the Soviet KGB. 'The publication, which followed two decades of public debate and the passage of a special law, revealed the names, code names, birthplaces and other data on active and former KGB agents as of 1991, the year  regained its independence from the Soviet Union.'

In May 2023, the parliament elected [[Edgars Rinkēvičs]] as new [[President of ]], making him the European Union's first openly gay head of state. After years of debates,  ratified the EU ''Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence'', otherwise known as the [[Istanbul Convention]] in November 2023.
