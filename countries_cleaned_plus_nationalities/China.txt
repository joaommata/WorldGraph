[[Archaeological excavation|Archaeological evidence]] suggests that early [[Hominidae|hominids]] inhabited  2.25 million years ago. The hominid fossils of [[Peking Man]], a ''[[Homo erectus]]'' who [[Control of fire by early humans|used fire]], have been dated to between 680,000 and 780,000 [[Before Present|years ago]]. The fossilized teeth of ''Homo sapiens'' (dated to 125,000–80,000 years ago) have been discovered in [[Fuyan Cave]].  [[proto-writing]] existed in [[Jiahu]] around 6600 BCE, at [[Damaidi]] around 6000 BCE, [[Dadiwan culture|Dadiwan]] from 5800 to 5400 BCE, and [[Banpo]] dating from the 5th millennium BCE. Some scholars have suggested that the [[Jiahu symbols]] (7th millennium BCE) constituted the earliest  writing system.

[[File:甲骨文发现地 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Yinxu]], the ruins of the capital of the late [[Shang dynasty]] (14th century BCE)]]

According to traditional [[ historiography]], the [[Xia dynasty]] was established during the late 3rd millennium&nbsp;BCE, marking the beginning of the dynastic cycle that was understood to underpin 's entire political history. In the modern era, the Xia's historicity came under increasing scrutiny, in part due to the earliest known attestation of the Xia being written millennia after the date given for their collapse. In 1958, archaeologists discovered sites belonging to the [[Erlitou culture]] that existed during the early [[Bronze Age]]; they have since been characterized as the remains of the historical Xia, but this conception is often rejected. The [[Shang dynasty]] that traditionally succeeded the Xia is the earliest for which there are both contemporary written records and undisputed archaeological evidence. The Shang ruled much of the [[Yellow River]] valley until the 11th century&nbsp;BCE, with the earliest hard evidence dated {{circa|1300&nbsp;BCE}}. The [[oracle bone script]], attested from {{circa|1250&nbsp;BCE|lk=no}} but generally assumed to be considerably older, represents the oldest known form of [[written ]], and is the direct ancestor of modern [[ characters]].

The Shang were overthrown by the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]], who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuries&nbsp;BCE, though the centralized authority of [[Son of Heaven]] was slowly eroded by ''[[fengjian]]'' lords. Some principalities eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou and continually waged war with each other during the 300-year [[Spring and Autumn period]]. By the time of the [[Warring States period]] of the 5th–3rd centuries&nbsp;BCE, there were seven major powerful states left.

==== Qin and Han ====
[[File:Han Expansion.png|The [[southward expansion of the Han dynasty]] during the 2nd century&nbsp;BCE|thumb|upright=1.1]]

The Warring States period ended in 221&nbsp;BCE after the [[Qin (state)|state of Qin]] conquered the other six states, reunited  and established the dominant order of [[autocracy]]. [[King Zheng of Qin]] proclaimed himself the Emperor of the [[Qin dynasty]], becoming the first emperor of a unified . He enacted Qin's [[Legalism ( philosophy)|legalist]] reforms, notably the standardization of  characters, [[ units of measurement|measurements]], road widths, and [[history of  currency|currency]]. His dynasty also [[Qin campaign against the Baiyue|conquered the Yue tribes]] in [[Guangxi]], [[Guangdong]], and [[Northern ]]. The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after the First Emperor's death.

Following [[Chu–Han Contention|widespread revolts]] during which the imperial library [[List of destroyed libraries#Human action|was burned]],{{efn|Owing to Qin Shi Huang's earlier policy involving the "[[burning of books and burying of scholars]]", the destruction of the confiscated copies at [[Xianyang]] was an event similar to the [[destruction of the Library of Alexandria|destructions]] of the [[Library of Alexandria]] in the west. Even those texts that did survive had to be painstakingly reconstructed from memory, luck, or forgery. The [[Old Texts]] of the [[Five Classics]] were said to have been found hidden in a wall at the Kong residence in [[Qufu]]. [[Mei Ze]]'s "rediscovered" edition of the [[Book of Documents]] was [[Yan Ruoqu|only shown to be a forgery in the Qing dynasty]].}} the [[Han dynasty]] emerged to rule  between 206&nbsp;BCE and 220&nbsp;CE, creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the modern [[Han ]]. The Han [[History of the Han dynasty|expanded the empire's territory considerably]], with military campaigns reaching [[Han–Xiongnu War|Central Asia, ]], [[Han conquest of Gojoseon|]], and [[Han campaigns against Dian|Yunnan]], and the [[Southward expansion of the Han dynasty|recovery of Guangdong and northern ]] from [[Nanyue]]. Han involvement in Central Asia and [[Sogdia]] helped establish the land route of the [[Silk Road]], replacing the earlier path over the [[Himalayas]] to . Han  gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world. Despite the Han's initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the Qin philosophy of Legalism in favor of [[Confucianism]], Qin's legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the Han government and its successors.

==== Three Kingdoms, Jin, Northern and Southern dynasties ====
After the [[end of the Han dynasty]], a period of strife known as [[Three Kingdoms]] followed, at the end of which [[Cao Wei|Wei]] was swiftly overthrown by the [[Jin dynasty (266–420)|Jin dynasty]]. The Jin fell to [[War of the Eight Princes|civil war]] upon the ascension of a [[Emperor Hui of Jin|developmentally disabled emperor]]; the [[Five Barbarians]] then [[Upheaval of the Five Barbarians|rebelled]] and ruled northern  as the [[Sixteen Kingdoms|Sixteen States]]. The [[Xianbei]] unified them as the [[Northern Wei]], whose [[Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaowen]] reversed his predecessors' apartheid policies and [[Northern dynasties|enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects]]. In the south, the general [[Emperor Wu of Liu Song|Liu Yu]] secured the abdication of the Jin in favor of the [[Liu Song]]. The various successors of these states became known as the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]], with the two areas finally reunited by the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] in 581.{{Citation needed|date=June 2024}}

==== Sui, Tang and Song ====
The Sui restored the Han to power through , reformed its agriculture, economy and [[imperial examination]] system, constructed the [[Grand Canal of |Grand Canal]], and patronized [[ Buddhism|Buddhism]]. However, they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a [[Goguryeo–Sui War|failed war]] in [[Goguryeo|northern ]] provoked widespread unrest.
Under the succeeding [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song dynasties]],  economy, technology, and culture entered a golden age. The Tang dynasty retained control of the [[Western Regions]] and the Silk Road, which brought traders to as far as [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Horn of Africa]], and made the capital [[Chang'an]] a cosmopolitan urban center. However, it was devastated and weakened by the [[An Lushan rebellion]] in the 8th century. In 907, the Tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable. The Song dynasty ended the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|separatist situation]] in 960, leading to a balance of power between the Song and the [[Liao dynasty]]. The Song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first  polity to establish a permanent navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade.

Between the 10th and 11th century CE, the population of  doubled to around 100 million people, mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern , and the production of abundant food surpluses. The Song dynasty also saw a [[Neo-Confucianism|revival of Confucianism]], in response to the growth of Buddhism during the Tang, and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts, as [[landscape art]] and [[porcelain]] were brought to new levels of complexity. However, the military weakness of the Song army was observed by the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]]. In 1127, [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Emeritus Huizong]], [[Emperor Qinzong of Song]] and the capital [[Kaifeng|Bianjing]] were captured during the [[Jin–Song wars]]. The remnants of the Song retreated to [[Northern and southern |southern ]] and reestablished [[Southern Song Dynasty|the Song]] at [[Nanjing|Jiankang]].

==== Yuan, Ming and Qing ====
[[File:Badaling  Great-Wall-of--01.jpg|'s first emperor, [[Qin Shi Huang]], is famed for having united the [[Warring States]]' walls to form the [[Great Wall of ]]. Most of the present structure dates to the [[Ming dynasty]].|thumb|upright=1.1]]
The [[Mongol conquest of ]] began in 1205 with the [[Mongol conquest of Western Xia|campaigns]] against [[Western Xia]] by [[Genghis Khan]], who also [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty|invaded Jin territories]]. In 1271, the Mongol leader [[Kublai Khan]] established the [[Yuan dynasty]], which [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|conquered the last remnant of the Song dynasty]] in 1279. Before the Mongol invasion, the population of Song  was 120 million citizens; this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300. A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang [[Red Turban Rebellions|overthrew the Yuan]] in 1368 and founded the [[Ming dynasty]] as the [[Hongwu Emperor]]. Under the Ming dynasty,  enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture. It was during this period that admiral [[Zheng He]] led the [[Ming treasure voyages]] throughout the  Ocean, reaching as far as East Africa.

In the early Ming dynasty, 's capital was moved from [[Nanjing]] to Beijing. With the budding of capitalism, philosophers such as [[Wang Yangming]] critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of [[individualism]] and equality of [[four occupations]]. The [[scholar-official]] stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements, which, together with the famines and defense against [[ invasions of  (1592–1598)]] and [[Later Jin (1616–1636)|Later Jin]] incursions led to an exhausted treasury. In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of [[Late Ming peasant rebellions|peasant rebel]] forces led by [[Li Zicheng]]. The [[Chongzhen Emperor]] committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu [[Qing dynasty]], then allied with Ming dynasty general [[Wu Sangui]], overthrew Li's short-lived [[Shun dynasty]] and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty.

[[File:Qing Empire circa 1820 EN.svg|The [[Qing conquest of the Ming]] and expansion of the empire|thumb|upright=1.1]]
The Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of . The [[Transition from Ming to Qing|Ming-Qing transition]] (1618–1683) cost 25 million lives, but the Qing appeared to have restored 's imperial power and inaugurated another flowering of the arts. After the [[Southern Ming]] ended, the further conquest of the [[Dzungar Khanate]] added , Tibet and Xinjiang to the empire. Meanwhile, 's population growth resumed and shortly began to accelerate. It is commonly agreed that pre-modern 's population experienced two growth spurts, one during the [[Northern Song]] period (960–1127), and other during the Qing period (around 1700–1830). By the [[High Qing era]]  was possibly the most commercialized country in the world, and imperial  experienced a second commercial revolution by the end of the 18th century. On the other hand, the centralized autocracy was strengthened in part to suppress [[anti-Qing sentiment]] with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce, like the ''[[Haijin]]'' during the early Qing period and ideological control as represented by the [[literary inquisition]], causing some social and technological stagnation.

=== Fall of the Qing dynasty ===

In the mid-19th century, the [[Opium Wars]] with Britain and [[]] forced  to pay compensation, open treaty ports, allow [[extraterritoriality]] for foreign nationals, and cede [[ Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] to the  under the 1842 [[Treaty of Nanking]], the first of what have been termed the [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]]. The [[First Sino- War]] (1894–1895) resulted in Qing 's loss of influence in the [[ Peninsula]], as well as the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|cession of Taiwan]] to [[Empire of |]]. The Qing dynasty also began experiencing [[Timeline of late anti-Qing rebellions|internal unrest]] in which tens of millions of people died, especially in the [[White Lotus Rebellion]], the failed [[Taiping Rebellion]] that ravaged southern  in the 1850s and 1860s and the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–1877)]] in the northwest. The initial success of the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s.

In the 19th century, the great [[ emigration| diaspora]] began. Losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the [[Northern  Famine of 1876–1879]], in which between 9 and 13 million people died. The [[Guangxu Emperor]] drafted a [[Hundred Days' Reform|reform plan]] in 1898 to establish a modern [[constitutional monarchy]], but these plans were thwarted by the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]]. The ill-fated anti-foreign [[Boxer Rebellion]] of 1899–1901 further weakened the dynasty. Although Cixi sponsored a program of reforms known as the [[late Qing reforms]], the [[1911 Revolution|Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911–1912 ended the Qing dynasty and established the [[Republic of  (1912–1949)|Republic of ]]. [[Puyi]], the last Emperor, [[Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor|abdicated in 1912]].

=== Establishment of the Republic and World War II ===

{{Further|1911 Revolution|Second Sino- War| Civil War| Communist Revolution}}
On 1 January 1912, the Republic of  (ROC) was established, and [[Sun Yat-sen]] of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) was proclaimed provisional president. In March 1912, the presidency was given to [[Yuan Shikai]], a former Qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself [[Empire of  (1915–1916)|Emperor of ]]. In the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own [[Beiyang Army]], he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republic in 1916. After Yuan Shikai's death in 1916,  was politically fragmented. Its Beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless; regional warlords controlled most of its territory. During this [[Warlord Era|period]],  [[ during World War I|participated in]] [[World War I]] and saw a far-reaching popular uprising called the [[May Fourth Movement]].
[[File:1945 Mao and Chiang.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chiang Kai-shek]] and [[Mao Zedong]] toasting together in 1945 following the [[End of World War II in Asia|end of World War II]]]]In the late 1920s, the Kuomintang under [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political maneuverings known collectively as the [[Northern Expedition]]. The Kuomintang moved the nation's capital to [[Nanjing]] and implemented "political tutelage", an intermediate stage of political development outlined in Sun Yat-sen's [[Three Principles of the People]] program for transforming  into a modern democratic state. The Kuomintang [[First United Front|briefly allied]] with the [[ Communist Party]] (CCP) during the Northern Expedition, though the alliance broke down in 1927 after Chiang [[Shanghai massacre|violently suppressed]] the CCP and other leftists in Shanghai, marking the beginning of the [[ Civil War]]. The CCP declared [[Communist-controlled  (1927–1949)|areas of the country]] as the [[ Soviet Republic]] (Jiangxi Soviet) in November 1931 in [[Ruijin]], [[Jiangxi]]. The Jiangxi Soviet was [[Encirclement campaigns|wiped out]] by the KMT armies in 1934, leading the CCP to initiate the [[Long March]] and relocate to [[Yan'an]] in [[Shaanxi]]. It would be the base of the communists before major combat in the  Civil War ended in 1949.

In 1931,  [[ invasion of Manchuria|invaded and occupied Manchuria]].  invaded other parts of  in 1937, precipitating the [[Second Sino- War]] (1937–1945), a [[Theater (warfare)|theater]] of [[World War II]]. The war forced an [[Second United Front|uneasy alliance]] between the Kuomintang and the CCP.  forces committed numerous [[ war crimes|war atrocities]] against the civilian population; as many as 20 million  civilians died. An estimated 40,000 to over 300,000  were [[Nanjing Massacre|massacred in Nanjing]] alone during the  occupation. The Republic of , along with the UK, the , and the [[Soviet Union]], were recognized as the Allied "[[Four Policemen|Big Four]]" in the [[Declaration by United Nations]]. Along with the other three great powers,  was one of the four major [[Allies of World War II]], and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war. After the [[surrender of ]] in 1945,  emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained. Taiwan, along with the [[Penghu]], were [[Retrocession of Taiwan|handed over to ROC control]]; however, the validity of this handover is controversial. In June 1946, fighting between CCP and KMT forces broke out and the country resumed a state of civil war that lasted more than three years. Constitutional rule was established in 1947, but because of the ongoing war, many provisions of the [[Constitution of the Republic of |ROC constitution]] were never implemented in mainland .

=== People's Republic ===

[[File:Mao Proclaiming New .JPG|thumb|[[Proclamation of the People's Republic of |The founding ceremony of the People's Republic of ]] was held at 3:00 pm on 1 October 1949. The picture above shows [[Mao Zedong]]'s announcement of the founding of the People's Republic of  in [[Tiananmen Square]].]]

By 1949, the CCP took control of most of mainland , and the [[Retreat of the government of the Republic of  to Taiwan|ROC government retreated offshore to Taiwan]]. On 1 October 1949, [[Chairman of the  Communist Party|CCP Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] formally [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of |proclaimed the People's Republic of ]] in [[Tiananmen Square]], [[Beijing]]. In 1950, the PRC [[Battle of Hainan Island|captured Hainan]] from the ROC and [[Annexation of Tibet by |annexed Tibet]]. The CCP consolidated its popularity among the peasants through the [[Land Reform Movement]], which included the state-tolerated executions of between 1 and 2 million landlords by peasants and former tenants. Though the PRC initially allied closely with the [[Soviet Union]], the relations between the two [[Communism|communist]] nations [[Sino-Soviet split|gradually deteriorated]], leading  to develop an independent industrial system and [[ and weapons of mass destruction|its own nuclear weapons]]. The  population increased from 550 million in 1950 to 900 million in 1974. The historical consensus is that the policies of the Mao-era significantly reduced [[Poverty in |poverty]]. However, the [[Great Leap Forward]], a massive [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] project, resulted in [[Great  Famine|an estimated 15 to 55 million deaths]] between 1959 and 1961, mostly from starvation. In 1964,  [[Project 596|detonated its first atomic bomb]]. In 1966, Mao and his allies launched the [[Cultural Revolution]], sparking a decade of political recrimination and social upheaval that lasted until Mao's [[Death and state funeral of Mao Zedong|death]] in 1976.[[File:Události na náměstí Tian an men, Čína 1989, foto Jiří Tondl.jpg|thumb|The [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests]] was ended by a military-led massacre.]]

After Mao's death, the [[Gang of Four]] were [[Smashing the Gang of Four|arrested]] by [[Hua Guofeng]] and held responsible for the Cultural Revolution. The Cultural Revolution was rebuked, with millions rehabilitated. [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power in 1978, and started the [[reform and opening up]], instituting large-scale [[Boluan Fanzheng|political]] and economic reforms, together with the "[[Eight Elders]]", most senior and influential members of the party. The economic reforms marked 's transition away from planned economy.  adopted its current [[Constitution of |constitution]] on 4 December 1982. In 1989, there were protests such [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre|those in Tiananmen Square]], and then throughout the entire nation. [[Jiang Zemin]] was elevated to become the CCP general secretary, becoming the paramount leader. 's economy grew sevenfold during this time. [[ Hong Kong]] and [[ Macau]] returned to  in [[Handover of Hong Kong|1997]] and [[Handover of Macau|1999]], respectively, as [[Special administrative regions of |special administrative regions]] under the principle of [[one country, two systems]]. The country joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2001.

At the [[16th National Congress of the  Communist Party|16th CCP National Congress]] in 2002, [[Hu Jintao]] succeeded Jiang as the general secretary. Under Hu,  maintained its high rate of economic growth, overtaking the , ,  and  to become the world's second-largest economy. However, the growth also severely impacted the country's resources and environment, and caused major social displacement. [[Xi Jinping]] succeeded Hu as paramount leader at the [[18th National Congress of the  Communist Party|18th CCP National Congress]] in 2012. Shortly after his ascension to power, Xi launched [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|a vast anti-corruption crackdown]], that prosecuted more than 2 million officials by 2022. During [[ under Xi Jinping|his tenure]], Xi has consolidated power unseen since the initiation of economic and political reforms.
