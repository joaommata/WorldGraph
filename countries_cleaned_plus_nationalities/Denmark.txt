The earliest [[Archaeology of |archaeological finds in ]] date back to the [[Eemian|Eem interglacial period]] from 130,000 to 110,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]].{{sfnp|Michaelsen|2002|p=19}}  has been inhabited since around 12,500 BC and agriculture has been evident since 3900 BC. The [[ Bronze Age]] (1800–600 BC) in  was marked by [[Tumulus|burial mounds]], which left an abundance of findings including [[lur]]s and the [[Trundholm sun chariot|Sun Chariot]].

During the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] (500 BC&nbsp;– AD 1), native groups began migrating south, and the first tribal [[Danes (tribe)|Danes]] came to the country between the Pre-Roman and the [[Germanic Iron Age]],{{sfnp|Busck|2002|p=20}} in the [[Roman Iron Age]] (AD 1–400). The [[Roman province]]s maintained [[trade route]]s and relations with native tribes in , and [[Roman currency|Roman coins]] have been found in . Evidence of strong [[Celtic nations|Celtic]] cultural influence dates from this period in  and much of North-West Europe and is among other things reflected in the finding of the [[Gundestrup cauldron]].

The tribal Danes came from the east [[List of islands of | islands]] ([[Zealand]]) and [[Scania]], today Skåne in Southern , and spoke an early form of [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]]. Historians believe that before their arrival, most of [[Jutland]] and the nearest islands were settled by tribal [[Jutes]]. Many Jutes migrated to [[Great Britain]], according to legend some as mercenaries of [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] King [[Vortigern]], and formed the south-eastern territories of [[Kent]], the [[Isle of Wight]] and other areas, where they settled. They were later absorbed or [[ethnic cleansing|ethnically cleansed]] by the invading [[Angles (tribe)|Angles]] and [[Saxons]], who formed the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. The remaining [[Jutes|Jutish]] population in Jutland assimilated in with the settling [[Danes (tribe)|Danes]].

A short note about the ''Dani'' in ''[[Getica]]'' by the historian [[Jordanes]] is believed to be an early mention of the Danes, one of the [[ethnic group]]s from whom modern [[Danes]] are descended.{{sfnp|Busck|2002|p=19}} The [[Danevirke]] defence structures were built in phases from the 3rd century forward and the sheer size of the construction efforts in AD 737 are attributed to the emergence of a  king.{{sfnp|Michaelsen|2002|pp=122–123}} A [[Younger Futhark|new runic alphabet]] was first used around the same time and [[Ribe]], the oldest town of , was founded about AD 700.

From the 8th to the 10th century the population of the wider [[History of Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] region was called [[Vikings]] by non-Scandinavians. While they mostly lived off agriculture, fishing and trade, they were excellent sailors and would travel as far as , Greenland and . They traded in all parts of Europe, down to Constantinople and beyond, but would also raid local settlements and set up colonies in far-flung places. The  Vikings were most actively raiding the eastern and southern [[British Isles]] and [[Western Europe]]. They settled in parts of [[England]] (known as the [[Danelaw]]) under King [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] in 1013, and in [[]] where Danes and Norwegians were allowed to settle in what would become [[Normandy]] in exchange of allegiance to [[Robert I of ]] with [[Rollo]] as first ruler. Some [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[pence]] of this period have been found in .

 was largely consolidated by the late 8th century and its rulers are consistently referred to in [[Frankish language|Frankish]] sources as kings (''reges''). Under the reign of [[Gudfred]] in 804 the  kingdom may have included all the [[Lands of |lands]] of Jutland, [[Scania]] and the  islands, excluding Bornholm.

The extant  monarchy traces its roots back to [[Gorm the Old]], who established his reign in the early 10th century.{{sfnp|Stone|Bain|Booth|Parnell|2008|p=31}} As attested by the [[Jelling stones]], the Danes were [[Christianised]] around 965 by [[Harald Bluetooth]], the son of [[Gorm the Old|Gorm]] and [[Thyra]]. It is believed that  became Christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. A rising Christian power in Europe, the Holy Roman Empire was an important trading partner for the Danes. As a deterrent against this threat, Harald built six [[fortresses]] around  called [[Viking ring fortress|Trelleborg]] and built a further [[Danevirke]]. In the early 11th century, [[Canute the Great]] won and united , England, and [[]] for almost 30 years with a Scandinavian army.

Throughout the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]],  also included [[Skåneland]] (the areas of Scania, [[Halland]], and [[Blekinge]] in present-day southern ) and  kings ruled [[ ]], as well as the [[duchy|duchies]] of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. Most of the latter two now form the state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in northern .

In 1397,  entered into a [[personal union]] known as the [[Kalmar Union]] with [[]] and [[]], united under Queen [[Margaret I of |Margaret I]].{{sfnp|Stone|Bain|Booth|Parnell|2008|p=33}} The three countries were to be treated as equals in the union. However, even from the start, Margaret may not have been so idealistic; treating  as the clear "senior" partner of the union. Thus, much of the next 125 years of [[History of Scandinavia|Scandinavian history]] revolves around this union, with  breaking off and being re-conquered repeatedly. The issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 June 1523, as [[List of  monarchs| King]] [[Gustav I of |Gustav Vasa]] conquered the city of [[Stockholm]]. The [[Protestant Reformation]] spread to Scandinavia in the 1530s, and following the [[Count's Feud]] civil war, [[Reformation in – and Holstein| converted]] to [[Lutheranism]] in 1536. Later that year,  entered into a union with .

After  permanently [[History of  (1523–1611)|broke away]] from the personal union,  tried on several occasions to reassert control over its neighbour. King [[Christian IV of |Christian IV]] attacked  in the 1611–1613 [[Kalmar War]] but failed to accomplish his main objective of forcing it to return to the union. The war led to no territorial changes, but  was forced to pay a [[war reparations|war indemnity]] of 1 million silver [[riksdaler]] to , an amount known as the ''[[Treaty of Stettin (1570)|Älvsborg ransom]]''. King Christian used this money to found several towns and fortresses, most notably [[Glückstadt]] (founded as a rival to [[Hamburg]]) and [[Oslo|Christiania]]. Inspired by the [[ East  Company]], he founded a similar [[ East  Company| company]] and planned to claim [[|Ceylon]] as a colony, but the company only managed to acquire [[Tharangambadi|Tranquebar]] on 's [[Coromandel Coast]]. 's large colonial aspirations included a few key [[trading posts]] in [[Africa]] and [[]]. While 's trading posts in  were of little note, it played an important role in the highly lucrative [[Atlantic slave trade]], through its trading outposts in [[Osu Castle|Fort Christiansborg]] in [[Osu, Accra|Osu]], [[]] through which 1.5 million slaves were traded. While the  colonial empire was sustained by trade with other major powers, and [[plantation]]s – ultimately a lack of resources led to its stagnation.

In the [[Thirty Years' War]], Christian tried to become the leader of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] states in  but suffered a crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Lutter]].{{sfnp|Parker|1984|p=78}} The result was that the Catholic army under [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] was able to invade, occupy, and pillage Jutland, forcing  [[Treaty of Lübeck|to withdraw from the war]].{{sfnp|Parker|1984|p=79}}  managed to avoid territorial concessions, but King [[Gustavus Adolphus of |Gustavus Adolphus]]' intervention in  was seen as a sign that the military power of  was on the rise while 's influence in the region was declining.  armies [[Torstenson War|invaded Jutland]] in 1643 and claimed Scania in 1644. In the 1645 [[Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645)|Treaty of Brømsebro]],  surrendered Halland, [[Gotland]], the last parts of  , and several provinces in .

Seeing an opportunity to tear up the Treaty of Brømsebro, King [[Frederick III of ]], in 1657, declared war on , the latter being deeply involved in the [[Second Northern War]] (1655–1660), and marched on [[Bremen-Verden]]. This led to a massive  defeat as the armies of King [[Charles X Gustav]] of  conquered [[Jutland]] and, following the [[March Across the Belts| March across]] the frozen [[ straits]], occupied [[Funen]] and much of [[Zealand]] before signing the [[Treaty of Roskilde|Peace of Roskilde]] in February 1658, which gave  control of Scania, [[Blekinge]], [[Bohuslän]], [[Trøndelag]], and the island of [[Bornholm]]. Charles X Gustav quickly regretted not having ruined  and in August 1658, he launched a [[Dano- War (1658–1660)|second attack on ]], conquered most of the  islands, and began a two-year-long siege of [[Copenhagen]]. King Frederick III actively led the defence of the city, rallying its citizens to take up arms, and [[Assault on Copenhagen (1659)|repelled the  attacks]].{{sfnp|Isacson|2002|p=229}}{{sfnp|Englund|2000|p=610}} The siege ended following the death of Charles X Gustav in 1660.{{sfnp|Stone|Bain|Booth|Parnell|2008|p=35}} In the ensuing [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|peace settlement]],  managed to maintain its independence and regain control of Trøndelag and Bornholm.{{sfnp|Frost|2000|pp=180–183}} Attaining great popularity following the war, Frederick III used this to [[King's Law|disband the elective monarchy]] in favour of [[absolute monarchy]], which lasted until 1848 in .

 tried but failed to regain control of Scania in the [[Scanian War]] (1675–1679). After the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–21),  managed to regain control of the parts of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]] ruled by the house of [[Holstein-Gottorp]] in the 1720 [[Treaty of Frederiksborg]] and the 1773 [[Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo]], respectively.  prospered greatly in the last decades of the 18th century due to its [[Country neutrality (international relations)|neutral status]] allowing it to trade with both sides in the many contemporary wars. In the [[Napoleonic Wars]],  traded with both [[First  Empire|]] and the [[ of Great Britain and |]] and joined the [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]] with [[ Empire|]], , and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. British fears that - would ally with  led to two attacks against  targets in Copenhagen in [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|1801]] and [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|1807]]. These attacks resulted in the British capturing most of the Dano- navy and led to the outbreak of the [[Gunboat War]]. In 1807 much of Copenhagen was burned down as a result of these bombardments, including Vor Frue Kirke, the main  cathedral. British control of the waterways between  and  proved disastrous to the union's economy and in 1813 – went bankrupt.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

The union was dissolved by the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814; the  monarchy "irrevocably and forever" renounced claims to the Kingdom of  in favour of the  king.  kept the possessions of [[]] (which retained the  monarchy until 1944), the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Greenland]], all of which had been governed by  for centuries. Apart from the  colonies,  continued to rule over [[ ]] from 1620 to 1869, the [[ Gold Coast]] () from 1658 to 1850, and the [[ West Indies]] from 1671 to 1917.

=== Constitutional monarchy (1849–present) ===
[[File:Grundlovgivende rigsforsamling - Constantin Hansen full.jpg|thumb|The National Constitutional Assembly was convened by King [[Frederick VII of |Frederick VII]] in 1848 to adopt the [[Constitution of ]]]]
A nascent  liberal and national movement gained momentum in the 1830s; after the European [[Revolutions of 1848]],  peacefully became a [[constitutional monarchy]] on 5 June 1849. A new constitution established a [[Rigsdagen|two-chamber parliament]].  faced war against both [[Prussia]] and the [[ Empire]] in what became known as the [[Second Schleswig War]], lasting from February to October 1864.  was defeated and obliged to [[cession|cede]] [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig and Holstein]] to [[Prussia]]. This loss came as the latest in the long series of defeats and [[ Royal Enclaves|territorial]] losses that had begun in the 17th century. After these events,  pursued a policy of neutrality in Europe.

[[Industrialization|Industrialisation]] came to  in the second half of the 19th century. The [[History of rail transport in |nation's first railways]] were constructed in the 1850s, and improved communications and overseas trade allowed industry to develop in spite of 's lack of natural resources. [[Trade union]]s developed, starting in the 1870s. There was a considerable migration of people from the countryside to the cities, and  agriculture became centred on the export of dairy and meat products.

 [[ during World War I|maintained its neutral stance]] during [[World War I]]. After the defeat of , the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles powers]] offered to return the region of Schleswig-Holstein to . Fearing  [[irredentism]],  refused to consider the return of the area without a [[plebiscite]]; the two [[Schleswig Plebiscites]] took place on 10 February and 14 March 1920, respectively. On 10 July 1920, Northern Schleswig was recovered by , thereby adding some 163,600 inhabitants and {{convert|3984|km2|sqmi}}. The country's first social democratic government took office in 1924.

In 1939,  signed a 10-year nonaggression pact with [[Nazi ]]. However, [[ invasion of  (1940)| invaded ]] on 9 April 1940, and the  government quickly surrendered. However, as around 10% of the  army's foodstuff was supplied by  agricultural output and  wanted that supply line to continue, the occupation was more cooperative and less harsh than many other countries in Europe.  [[ in World War II|World War II in ]] was characterised by economic co-operation with  until 1943, when the  government refused further co-operation and [[Royal  Navy|its navy]] [[Operation Safari|scuttled most of its ships]] and sent many of its officers to , which was neutral. At that point the government fell. The [[ resistance movement| resistance]] performed a [[Rescue of the  Jews|rescue operation]] that managed to evacuate several thousand [[History of the Jews in |Jews]] and their families to safety in  before the Germans could send them to death camps. Some Danes supported [[Nazism]] by joining the [[National Socialist Workers' Party of | Nazi Party]] or volunteering to fight with  as part of the [[Frikorps Danmark]].  severed ties with  and [[Founding of the republic of |became an independent republic]] in 1944; [[Liberation of | surrendered]] in May 1945. In 1948, the Faroe Islands gained [[home rule]]. In 1949,  became a founding member of [[NATO]].

 was a founding member of the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). During the 1960s, the EFTA countries were often referred to as the [[Outer Seven]], as opposed to the [[Inner Six]] of what was then the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC). In 1973, along with Britain and ,  joined the European Economic Community (now the [[European Union]]) after a [[1972  European Communities membership referendum|public referendum]]. The [[Maastricht Treaty]], which involved further European integration, [[1992  Maastricht Treaty referendum|was rejected]] by the  people in 1992; it was only accepted after a [[1993  Maastricht Treaty referendum|second referendum]] in 1993, which provided for [[Opt-outs in the European Union|four opt-outs]] from policies. The Danes rejected the euro as the national currency in [[2000  euro referendum|a referendum in 2000]]. Greenland gained home rule in 1979 and was awarded [[self-determination]] in 2009. Neither the [[Faroe Islands and the European Union|Faroe Islands]] nor [[Greenland–European Union relations#Outside the EU|Greenland]] are members of the European Union, the Faroese having declined membership of the EEC in 1973 and Greenland in 1986, in both cases because of fisheries policies.

Constitutional change in 1953 led to a [[unicameralism|single-chamber]] parliament elected by proportional representation, female accession to the  throne, and Greenland becoming an integral part of . The [[centre-left]] [[Social Democrats ()|Social Democrats]] led a string of coalition governments for most of the second half of the 20th century, introducing the [[ model| welfare model]]. The [[Venstre ()|Liberal Party]] and the [[Conservative People's Party ()|Conservative People's Party]] have also led [[centre-right]] governments.
