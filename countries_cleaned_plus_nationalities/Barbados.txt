=== Geological history ===
Around 700,000 years ago, the island emerged from the ocean as a body of soft rock known as a [[diapir]] rose from the mantle beneath its present-day location. This process is still ongoing, raising  at an average rate of 30 centimetres per thousand years. Dozens of inland sea reefs still dominate coastal features within terraces and cliffs on the island.

=== Pre-colonial period ===

Archeological evidence suggests humans may have first settled or visited the island {{circa|1600 BC}}. More permanent [[Amerindian]] settlement of  dates to about the 4th to 7th centuries AD, by a group known as the [[Saladoid]]-Barrancoid. Settlements of [[Arawaks]] from South America appeared by around 800 AD and again in the 12th–13th century. The [[Kalinago]] (called "[[Island Caribs|Caribs]]" by the ) visited the island regularly, although there is no evidence of permanent settlement.

=== European arrival ===

It is uncertain which European nation arrived first in , which probably would have been at some point in the 15th century or 16th century. One lesser-known source points to earlier revealed works antedating contemporary sources, indicating it could have been the . Many, if not most, believe the [[History of  (1415–1578)|]], en route to , were the first Europeans to come upon the island. The island was largely ignored by Europeans, though  slave raiding is thought to have reduced the native population, with many fleeing to other islands.

===  settlement in the 17th century ===

[[File:GEORGE WASHINGTON HOUSE - .jpg|thumb|right|[[George Washington House ()|George Washington House]] was visited by [[George Washington]] in 1751, in what is believed to have been his only trip outside the present-day .]]
The first  ship, which had arrived on 14 May 1625, was captained by John Powell. The first settlement began on 17 February 1627, near what is now [[Holetown]] (formerly Jamestown, after King James I of England), by a group led by John Powell's younger brother, [[Henry Powell (governor)|Henry]], consisting of 80 settlers and 10  [[Indentured servitude|indentured labourers]]. Some sources state that some Africans were among these first settlers.

The settlement was established as a [[proprietary colony]] and funded by Sir [[William Courten]], a [[City of London]] merchant who acquired the title to  and several other islands. The first colonists were actually tenants, and much of the profits of their labour returned to Courten and his company. Courten's title was later transferred to [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle]], in what was called the "Great  Robbery". Carlisle then chose as governor [[Henry Powell (governor)|Henry Powell]], who established the [[ House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] in 1639, in an effort to appease the planters, who might otherwise have opposed his controversial appointment.

In the period 1640–1660, the West Indies attracted more than two-thirds of the total number of  emigrants to the Americas. By 1650, there were 44,000 settlers in the West Indies, as compared to 12,000 on the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] and 23,000 in [[New England]]. Most  arrivals were indentured. After five years of labour, they were given "freedom dues" of about £10, usually in goods. Before the mid-1630s, they also received {{convert|5|to|10|acre|ha|abbr=off|0}} of land, but after that time the island filled and there was no more free land. During the [[Interregnum (England)|Cromwellian era]] (1650s) this included a large number of prisoners-of-war, vagrants and people who were illicitly kidnapped, who were forcibly transported to the island and sold as servants. These last two groups were predominantly , as several thousand were infamously rounded up by  merchants and sold into servitude in  and other Caribbean islands during this period, a practice that came to be known as being ''Barbadosed''. Cultivation of [[sugar]] was thus handled primarily by European indentured labour until it became difficult to bring more indentured servants from England.

[[Parishes of |Parish]] registers from the 1650s show that, for the white population, there were four times as many deaths as marriages. The mainstay of the infant colony's economy was the growth export of tobacco, but tobacco prices eventually fell in the 1630s as Chesapeake production expanded.

==== Effects of the  Civil War ====

Around the same time, fighting during the [[War of the Three Kingdoms]] and the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] spilled over into  and  territorial waters. The island was not [[ overseas possessions in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|involved in the war]] until after the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], when the island's government fell under the control of Royalists (ironically the Governor, Philip Bell, remaining loyal to [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] while the  [[House of Assembly]], under the influence of Humphrey Walrond, supported [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]). To try to bring the recalcitrant colony to heel, the [[Rump Parliament#Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth Parliament]] passed an act on 3 October 1650 prohibiting trade between England and , and because the island also traded with the , further [[Navigation Acts]] were passed, prohibiting any but  vessels trading with [[ Empire#Atlantic| colonies]]. These acts were a precursor to the [[First Anglo- War]]. The [[Commonwealth of England]] sent an invasion force under the command of [[George Ayscue|Sir George Ayscue]], which arrived in October 1651. Ayscue, with a smaller force that included  prisoners, surprised a larger force of Royalists, but had to resort to spying and diplomacy ultimately. On 11 January 1652, the Royalists in the House of Assembly led by [[Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham|Lord Willoughby]] surrendered, which marked the end of royalist privateering as a major threat. The conditions of the surrender were incorporated into the [[Charter of ]] ([[Oistins#History|Treaty of Oistins]]), which was signed at the Mermaid's Inn, [[Oistins]], on 17 January 1652.

===  people in  ===

{{Main| people in }}
Starting with [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]], a large percentage of the white labourer population were indentured servants and involuntarily transported people from .  servants in  were often treated poorly, and  planters gained a reputation for cruelty.{{rp|55}} The decreased appeal of an indenture on , combined with enormous demand for labour caused by sugar cultivation, led to the use of involuntary transportation to  as a punishment for crimes, or for political prisoners, and also to the kidnapping of labourers who were deported to .{{rp|55}}  indentured servants were a significant portion of the population throughout the period when white servants were used for plantation labour in , and while a "steady stream" of  servants entered the  throughout the 17th century, Cromwellian efforts to pacify  created a "veritable tidal wave" of  labourers who were sent to  during the 1650s.{{rp|56}} Due to inadequate historical records, the total number of  labourers sent to  is unknown, and estimates have been "highly contentious".{{rp|56}} While one historical source estimated that as many as 50,000  people were deported to either  or Virginia during the 1650s, this estimate is "quite likely exaggerated".{{rp|56}} Another estimate that 12,000  prisoners had arrived in  by 1655 has been described as "probably exaggerated" by historian Richard B. Sheridan.{{rp|236}} According to historian [[Thomas Bartlett (historian)|Thomas Bartlett]], it is "generally accepted" that approximately 10,000  were deported to the West Indies and approximately 40,000 came as voluntary indentured servants, while many also travelled as voluntary, un-indentured emigrants.{{rp|256}}

==== The sugar revolution ====
[[File:Mercado de los domingos, donde lo esclavos eran intercambiados por otros bienes y necesidades ( Museum, Bridgetown).jpg|thumb|Sunday market in  during the colonial era]]
The introduction of [[sugar cane]] from [[ ]] in 1640 completely transformed society, the economy and the physical landscape.  eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries. One group instrumental in ensuring the early success of the industry was the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jews]], who had originally been expelled from the [[Iberian peninsula]], to end up in [[ ]]. As the effects of the new crop increased, so did the shift in the ethnic composition of  and surrounding islands. The workable sugar plantation required a large investment and a great deal of heavy labour. At first,  traders supplied the equipment, financing, and African slaves, in addition to transporting most of the sugar to Europe. In 1644 the population of  was estimated at 30,000, of which about 800 were of African ancestry, with the remainder mainly of  ancestry. These  smallholders were eventually bought out and the island filled up with large sugar plantations worked by African slaves. By 1660 there was near parity with 27,000 Black people and 26,000 White people. By 1666 at least 12,000 white smallholders had been bought out, died, or left the island, many choosing to emigrate to [[]] or the [[Thirteen Colonies| Colonies]] (notably the Carolinas). As a result,  enacted a [[ Slave Code|slave code]] as a way of legislatively controlling its enslaved Black population. The law's text was influential in laws in other colonies.

By 1680 there were 20,000 free whites and 46,000 enslaved Africans; by 1724, there were 18,000 free whites and 55,000 enslaved Africans.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===

The harsh conditions endured by the slaves resulted in several planned slave rebellions, the largest of which was [[Bussa's rebellion]] in 1816 which was rapidly suppressed by the colonial authorities. In 1819, another slave revolt broke out on Easter Day. The revolt was put down in blood, with heads being displayed on stakes. Nevertheless, the brutality of the repression shocked even England and strengthened the abolitionist movement. Growing opposition to slavery led to its abolition in the  Empire in 1833. The [[plantocracy]] class retained control of political and economic power on the island, with most workers living in relative poverty.

The [[Great Hurricane of 1780|1780 hurricane]] killed more than 4,000 people on . In 1854, a [[cholera]] epidemic killed more than 20,000 inhabitants.

=== 20th century before independence ===

Deep dissatisfaction with the situation on  led many to emigrate. Things came to a head in the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]], as  [[ West  labour unrest of 1934–1939|began demanding]] better conditions for workers, the legalisation of trade unions and a widening of the franchise, which at that point was limited to male property owners. As a result of the increasing unrest the  sent a commission, called the [[Report of West  Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|West Indies Royal Commission, or Moyne Commission]], in 1938, which recommended enacting many of the requested reforms on the islands. As a result, Afro- began to play a much more prominent role in the colony's politics, with universal suffrage being introduced in 1950.

Prominent among these early activists was [[Grantley Herbert Adams]], who helped found the [[ Labour Party]] (BLP) in 1938. He became the first Premier of  in 1953, followed by fellow BLP-founder [[Hugh Gordon Cummins]] from 1958 to 1961. A group of left-leaning politicians who advocated swifter moves to independence broke off from the BLP and founded the [[Democratic Labour Party ()|Democratic Labour Party]] (DLP) in 1955. The DLP subsequently won the [[1961  general election]] and their leader [[Errol Barrow]] became premier.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}}

Full internal self-government was enacted in 1961.  joined the short-lived  [[West Indies Federation]] from 1958 to 1962, later gaining full independence on 30 November 1966. Errol Barrow became the country's first prime minister.  opted to remain within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

The effect of political independence meant that the  government ceased to having sovereignty over , [[Elizabeth II]], instead, reigning in the country became the [[Queen of ]]. The [[Monarchy of |monarch]] then was represented locally by a [[Governor-General of |governor-general]].

=== Post-independence era ===

The Barrow government sought to diversify the economy away from agriculture, seeking to boost industry and the tourism sector.  was also at the forefront of regional integration efforts, spearheading the creation of [[CARIFTA]] and [[CARICOM]]. The DLP lost the [[1976  general election]] to the BLP under [[Tom Adams (politician)|Tom Adams]]. Adams adopted a more conservative and strongly pro-Western stance, allowing the  to use  as the launchpad for their [[ invasion of |invasion of ]] in 1983. Adams died in office in 1985 and was replaced by [[Harold Bernard St. John]]; however, St. John lost the [[1986  general election]], which saw the return of the DLP under Errol Barrow, who had been highly critical of the US intervention in . Barrow, too, died in office, and was replaced by [[Lloyd Erskine Sandiford]], who remained Prime Minister until 1994.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}}

[[Owen Arthur]] of the BLP won the [[1994  general election]], remaining prime minister until 2008. Arthur was a strong advocate of republicanism, though a planned referendum to replace Queen Elizabeth as Head of State in 2008 never took place. The DLP won the [[2008  general election]], but the new Prime Minister [[David Thompson ( politician)|David Thompson]] died in 2010 and was replaced by [[Freundel Stuart]]. The BLP returned to power [[2018  general election|in 2018]] under [[Mia Mottley]], who became 's first female prime minister.

==== Transition to republic ====

{{Main|Republicanism in }}
The Government of  announced on 15 September 2020 that it intended to become a republic by 30 November 2021, the 55th anniversary of its independence, resulting in the replacement of the [[ monarchy]] with a president elected through [[electoral college]].  would then cease to be a [[Commonwealth realm]], but could maintain membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], like [[]] and [[]].

On 20 September 2021, just over a full year after the announcement for the transition was made, the [[Constitution (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2021]] was introduced to the Parliament of . Passed on 6 October, the Bill made amendments to the Constitution of , introducing the office of the [[president of ]] to replace the role of [[Elizabeth II]] as Queen of . The following week, on 12 October 2021, incumbent [[Governor-General of ]] [[Sandra Mason]] was jointly nominated by the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition as candidate to be the first [[president of ]], and was subsequently [[2021  presidential election|elected]] on 20 October. Mason took office on 30 November 2021. [[Prince Charles]], the heir apparent to the  Crown at the time, attended the swearing-in ceremony in Bridgetown at the invitation of the Government of .

Queen Elizabeth sent a message of congratulations to President Mason and the people of , saying: "As you celebrate this momentous day, I send you and all  my warmest good wishes for your happiness, peace and prosperity in the future."

A survey that was conducted between 23 October 2021 and 10 November 2021, by the [[University of the West Indies]] showed 34% of respondents being in favour of transitioning to a republic, while 30% were indifferent. Notably, no overall majority was found in the survey; with 24% not indicating a preference and the remaining 12% being opposed to the removal of Queen Elizabeth.

On 20 June 2022, a Constitutional Review Commission was formed and sworn in by Jeffrey Gibson (who at the time was serving temporarily as Acting President of ) to review the Constitution of .

The commission was given a 15-month timeline to complete its work, which included consulting the public about the new republic and drafting a constitution. Thus, the CRC engaged the public in a number of public meetings, lectures, and [[Twitter Spaces]]. The report was announced delayed by August 2023, with the final report submitted 30 June 2024.
