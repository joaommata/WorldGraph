Owing to its location, the present territory of  was a corridor of early human civilization from [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Caribbean]] to the [[Andes]] and [[Amazon basin]]. The oldest archaeological finds are from the Pubenza and El Totumo sites in the Magdalena Valley {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} southwest of Bogotá. These sites date from the [[Paleo-Indians|Paleoindian]] period (18,000–8000&nbsp;BCE). At [[Puerto Hormiga archaeological site|Puerto Hormiga]] and other sites, traces from the [[Archaic Period (Americas)|Archaic Period]] (~8000–2000&nbsp;BCE) have been found. Vestiges indicate that there was also early occupation in the regions of [[El Abra]] and [[Tequendama]] in [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]]. The oldest pottery discovered in the Americas, found in [[San Jacinto, Bolívar|San Jacinto]], dates to 5000–4000&nbsp;BCE.

Indigenous people inhabited the territory that is now  by 12,500&nbsp;BCE. Nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]] tribes at the El Abra, [[Tibitó]] and Tequendama sites near present-day [[Bogotá]] traded with one another and with other cultures from the [[Magdalena River]] Valley. A site including {{Convert|8|mi|0|spell=in|sp=us}} of [[Pictogram|pictographs]] that is under study at Serranía de la Lindosa was revealed in November 2020. Their age is suggested as being 12,500 years old (c. 10,480 B.C.) by the anthropologists working on the site, because of extinct fauna depicted. It was during the earliest known human occupation of the area.

Between 5000 and 1000&nbsp;BCE, hunter-gatherer tribes transitioned to agrarian societies; fixed settlements were established, and pottery appeared. Beginning in the 1st millennium BCE, groups of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] including the [[Muisca]], [[Zenú]], [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya]], and [[Tairona]] developed the political system of ''[[cacicazgo]]s'' with a pyramidal structure of power headed by ''caciques''. The Muisca inhabited mainly the area of what is now the [[Departments of |Departments]] of [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] and [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] high plateau (''[[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]]'') where they formed the [[Muisca Confederation]]. They farmed maize, potato, quinoa, and cotton, and traded gold, [[ emeralds|emeralds]], blankets, ceramic handicrafts, coca and especially [[Halite|rock salt]] with neighboring nations. The Tairona inhabited northern  in the isolated mountain range of [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]]. The Quimbaya inhabited regions of the [[Cauca River]] Valley between the [[Cordillera Occidental ()|Western]] and [[Cordillera Central ()|Central]] Ranges of the  Andes. Most of the Amerindians practiced agriculture and the social structure of each indigenous community was different. Some groups of indigenous people such as the Caribs lived in a state of permanent war, but others had less bellicose attitudes. During the 1200s, [[Austronesian expansion|Malayo-Polynesian]]s and [[Indigenous peoples in |Native Americans]] in  made contact, thereby spreading Native  genetics from Precolonial  to some Pacific Ocean islands.

[[Alonso de Ojeda]] (who had sailed with Columbus) reached the [[Guajira Peninsula]] in 1499.  explorers, led by [[Rodrigo de Bastidas]], made the first exploration of the [[Caribbean Basin|Caribbean coast]] in 1500. [[Christopher Columbus]] navigated near the Caribbean in 1502. In 1508, [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] accompanied an expedition to the territory through the region of [[Gulf of Urabá]] and they founded the town of [[Santa María la Antigua del Darién]] in 1510, the first stable settlement on the continent.{{efn|Balboa is best known for being the first European to see the Pacific Ocean in 1513, which he called ''Mar del Sur'' (or "Sea of the South") and would facilitate  exploration and settlement of South America.}} [[Santa Marta]] was founded in 1525, and [[Cartagena, |Cartagena]] in 1533.  [[conquistador]] [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] led an expedition to the interior in April 1536, and christened the districts through which he passed "[[New Kingdom of Granada]]". In August 1538, he provisionally founded its capital near the Muisca [[cacicazgo]] of [[Bacatá|Muyquytá]], and named it "Santa Fe". The name soon acquired a suffix and was called Santa Fe de Bogotá. Two other notable journeys by early conquistadors to the interior took place in the same period. [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]], conqueror of [[Quito]], traveled north and founded [[Cali]], in 1536, and [[Popayán]], in 1537; from 1536 to 1539,  conquistador [[Nikolaus Federmann]] crossed the [[Orinoquía natural region|Llanos Orientales]] and went over the [[Cordillera Oriental ()|Cordillera Oriental]] in a search for [[El Dorado]], the "city of gold". The legend and the gold would play a pivotal role in luring the  and other Europeans to New Granada during the 16th and 17th centuries.

The [[List of conquistadors in |conquistadors]] made frequent alliances with the enemies of different indigenous communities. [[ auxiliaries|Indigenous allies]] were crucial to conquest, as well as to creating and maintaining empire. Indigenous peoples in  experienced a decline in population due to conquest as well as Eurasian diseases, such as [[smallpox]], to which they had no immunity. Regarding the land as deserted, the  Crown sold properties to all persons interested in colonized territories, creating large farms and possession of mines. In the 16th century, the [[Navigation|nautical science]] in  reached a great development thanks to numerous scientific figures of the [[Casa de Contratación]] and nautical science was an essential pillar of the [[Iberian ship development, 1400–1600|Iberian expansion]]. In 1542, the region of New Granada, along with all other  possessions in South America, became part of the [[Viceroyalty of ]], with its capital in [[Lima]]. In 1547, New Granada became a separate captaincy-general within the viceroyalty, with its capital at Santa Fe de Bogota. In 1549, the [[Real Audiencia|Royal Audiencia]] was created by a royal decree, and New Granada was ruled by the [[Royal Audience of Santa Fe de Bogotá]], which at that time comprised the provinces of Santa Marta, Rio de San Juan, Popayán, Guayana and Cartagena. But important decisions were taken from the colony to  by the [[Council of the Indies]].

In the 16th century, European slave traders had begun to bring [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved Africans]] to the Americas.  was the only European power that did not establish [[Factory (trading post)|factories]] in Africa to purchase slaves; the  Empire instead relied on the [[asiento]] system, awarding merchants from other European nations the license to trade enslaved peoples to their overseas territories. This system brought Africans to , although many spoke out against the institution.{{efn|A royal decree of 1713 approved the legality of [[Palenque de San Basilio]] founded by runaway slaves as a refuge in the seventeenth century. The people of San Basilio fought against slavery, thereby giving rise to the first free place in the Americas. Its main leader was [[Benkos Bioho|Benkos Biohó]], who was born in West Africa.}}{{efn|[[Peter Claver]] was a Spaniard who traveled to Cartagena in 1610 and was ordained as a [[Jesuit]] priest in 1616. Claver cared for African slaves for thirty-eight years, defending their lives and the [[dignity]].}} The indigenous peoples could not be enslaved because they were legally [[Commoners|subjects]] of the  Crown. To protect the indigenous peoples, several forms of land ownership and regulation were established by the  colonial authorities: ''resguardos'', ''encomiendas'' and ''haciendas''.

However, secret anti- discontentment was already brewing for Colombians since  prohibited direct trade between the [[Viceroyalty of ]], which included , and the [[Viceroyalty of New ]], which included the , the source of Asian products like silk and porcelain which was in demand in the Americas. Illegal trade between Peruvians, Filipinos, and Mexicans continued in secret, as smuggled Asian goods ended up in [[Córdoba Department|Córdoba, ]], the distribution center for illegal Asian imports, due to the collusion between these peoples against the authorities in . They settled and traded with each other while disobeying the forced  monopoly.

The [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] was established in 1717, then temporarily removed, and then re-established in 1739. Its capital was Santa Fé de Bogotá. This Viceroyalty included some other provinces of northwestern South America that had previously been under the jurisdiction of the [[New |Viceroyalties of New ]] or [[Viceroyalty of |]] and correspond mainly to today's , , and . Bogotá became one of the principal administrative centers of the  possessions in the New World, along with [[Lima]] and [[ City]], though it remained less developed compared to those two cities in several economic and logistical ways.

[[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] declared war [[War of Jenkins' Ear|on ]] in 1739, and the city of Cartagena quickly became a top target for the British. A massive British expeditionary force was dispatched to capture the city, but, after achieving initial inroads, devastating outbreaks of disease crippled their numbers, and the British were forced to withdraw. The battle became one of 's most decisive victories in the conflict, and secured  dominance in the Caribbean until the [[Seven Years' War]]. The 18th-century priest, botanist, and mathematician [[José Celestino Mutis]] was delegated by Viceroy [[Antonio Caballero y Góngora]] to conduct an inventory of the nature of New Granada. Started in 1783, this became known as the [[Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada]]. It classified plants and wildlife, and founded the first astronomical observatory in the city of Santa Fe de Bogotá. In July 1801 the Prussian scientist [[Alexander von Humboldt]] reached Santa Fe de Bogotá where he met with Mutis. In addition, historical figures in the process of independence in New Granada emerged from the expedition as the astronomer [[Francisco José de Caldas]], the scientist [[Francisco Antonio Zea]], the zoologist [[Jorge Tadeo Lozano]] and the painter [[Salvador Rizo]].

Rebellions against  rule had occurred in the empire since the advent of conquest and colonization, but most were either crushed or remained too weak to change the overall situation. The last one that sought outright independence from  sprang up around 1810 and culminated in the  Declaration of Independence, issued on 20 July 1810, the day that is now celebrated as the nation's Independence Day. This movement followed the independence of [[Saint-Domingue]] (present-day ) in 1804, which provided some support to an eventual leader of this rebellion: [[Simón Bolívar]]. [[Francisco de Paula Santander]] also would play a decisive role.

A movement was initiated by [[Antonio Nariño]], who opposed  centralism and led the opposition against the [[Viceroyalty]]. [[Cartagena, |Cartagena]] became independent in November 1811. In 1811, the [[United Provinces of New Granada]] were proclaimed, headed by [[Camilo Torres Tenorio]]. The emergence of two distinct ideological currents among the patriots ([[federalism]] and [[Unitary state|centralism]]) gave rise to a period of instability called the [[Patria Boba]]. Shortly after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] ended, [[Ferdinand VII]], recently restored to the throne in , unexpectedly decided [[ reconquest of New Granada|to send military forces]] to retake most of northern South America. The viceroyalty was restored under the command of [[Juan de Sámano]], whose regime punished those who participated in the patriotic movements, ignoring the political nuances of the [[Junta (  Independence)|junta]]s. The retribution stoked renewed rebellion, which, combined with a weakened , made possible a successful rebellion led by the -born [[Military career of Simón Bolívar|Simón Bolívar]], who finally proclaimed [[  wars of independence|independence]] in 1819. The [[Royalist (  Independence)|pro- resistance]] was defeated in 1822 in the present territory of  and in 1823 in . During the Independence War, between 250 and 400 thousand people (12–20% of the pre-war population) died.

The territory of the Viceroyalty of New Granada became the [[Gran |Republic of ]], organized as a [[subdivisions of Gran |union of the current territories]] of , , , , parts of  and  and north of [[Marañón River]]. The [[Congress of Cúcuta]] in 1821 adopted a [[ Constitution of 1821|constitution]] for the new Republic. Simón Bolívar became the first [[President of ]], and Francisco de Paula Santander was made [[Vice President of |Vice President]]. However, the new republic was unstable and the Gran  ultimately collapsed.

[[Slavery]] was abolished in the country in 1851.

Internal political and territorial divisions led to the dissolution of [[Gran ]] in 1830. The so-called "[[Cundinamarca Province|Department of Cundinamarca]]" adopted the name "[[Republic of the New Granada|New Granada]]", which it kept until 1858 when it became the "Confederación Granadina" ([[Granadine Confederation]]). After a [[ Civil War (1860–1862)|two-year civil war]] in 1863, the [[ of ]] was created, which became known as the Republic of  in 1886. Internal divisions remained between the bipartisan political forces, occasionally igniting very bloody civil wars, the most significant being the [[Thousand Days' War]] (1899–1902), in which between 100 and 180 thousand Colombians lost their lives when the [[ Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], supported by [[ of |]], [[History of  (1895–1925)|]], [[]], and [[]] rebelled against the [[ Conservative Party|Nationalist government]] and took control of [[Santander State|Santander]], ultimately being defeated in 1902 by nationalist forces.

Soon after,  achieved some degree of political stability, which was interrupted by a bloody conflict that took place between the late 1940s and the early 1950s, a period known as ''[[La Violencia]]'' ("The Violence"). Its cause was mainly mounting tensions between the two leading political parties, which subsequently ignited after the assassination of the Liberal presidential candidate [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]] on 9 April 1948. The ensuing riots in Bogotá, known as [[El Bogotazo]], spread throughout the country and claimed the lives of at least 180,000 Colombians.

After Rojas' deposition, the  Conservative Party and the  Liberal Party agreed to create the [[National Front ()|National Front]], a coalition that would jointly govern the country. Under the deal, the presidency would alternate between conservatives and liberals every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices. The National Front ended "La Violencia", and National Front administrations attempted to institute far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the [[Alliance for Progress]]. Despite the progress in certain sectors, many social and political problems continued, and guerrilla groups were formally created such as the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of |FARC]], the [[National Liberation Army ()|ELN]] and the [[19th of April Movement|M-19]] to fight the government and political apparatus.

Since the 1960s, the country has suffered from an [[Asymmetric warfare|asymmetric]] [[Low intensity conflict|low-intensity]] [[ armed conflict (1964–present)|armed conflict]] between [[Military Forces of |government forces]], [[Guerrilla movements in |leftist guerrilla groups]] and [[Paramilitarism in |right wing paramilitaries]]. The conflict escalated in the 1990s, mainly in remote rural areas. Since the beginning of the armed conflict, [[human rights defenders]] have fought for the respect for human rights, despite staggering opposition.{{efn|[[Héctor Abad Gómez|Héctor Abad]] was a prominent medical doctor, university professor, and human rights leader whose holistic vision of healthcare led him to found the  National School of Public Health.

This was part of the U.S. fight against communism. [[Mercenarie]]s and multinational corporations such as [[Chiquita Brands International]] are some of the international actors that have contributed to the violence of the conflict.

Beginning in the mid-1970s  [[drug cartel]]s became major producers, processors and exporters of [[Illegal drug trade in |illegal drugs]], primarily [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[cocaine]].

On 4 July 1991, a new [[ Constitution of 1991|Constitution]] was promulgated. The changes generated by the new constitution are viewed as positive by  society.
