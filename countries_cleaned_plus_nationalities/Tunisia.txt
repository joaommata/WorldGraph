Farming methods reached the [[Nile|Nile Valley]] from the [[Fertile Crescent]] region about 5000 BC, and spread to the [[Maghreb]] by about 4000 BC. Agricultural communities in the humid coastal plains of central  then were ancestors of today's [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes.

It was believed in ancient times that Africa was originally populated by [[Gaetuli]]ans and , both nomadic peoples. According to the Roman historian [[Sallust]], the demigod Hercules died in  and his polyglot eastern army was left to settle the land, with some [[Human migration|migrating]] to Africa. Persians went to the West and intermarried with the Gaetulians and became the Numidians. The Medes settled and were known as Mauri, later Moors.

The Numidians and Moors belonged to the race from which the Berbers are descended. The translated meaning of Numidian is Nomad and indeed the people were semi-nomadic until the reign of [[Masinissa]] of the Massyli tribe.

At the beginning of recorded history,  was inhabited by [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes. Its coast was settled by [[Phoenicia]]ns starting as early as the 12th century BC ([[Bizerte]], [[Utica, |Utica]]). The city of [[Carthage]] was founded in the 9th century BC by Phoenicians. Legend says that [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] from Tyre, now in modern-day , founded the city in 814 BC, as retold by the [[|]] writer [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus of Tauromenium]]. The settlers of Carthage brought their culture and religion from Phoenicia, now present-day [[]] and adjacent areas.

After the series of wars with  city-states of Sicily in the 5th century BC, Carthage rose to power and eventually became the dominant civilization in the Western [[Mediterranean]]. The people of Carthage worshipped a pantheon of Middle Eastern gods including [[Baal]] and [[Tanit]]. Tanit's symbol, a simple female figure with extended arms and long dress, is a popular icon found in ancient sites. The founders of Carthage also established a [[Tophet]], which was altered in Roman times.

A Carthaginian invasion of  led by [[Hannibal]] during the [[Second Punic War]],  one of a series of wars with [[Roman Republic|Rome]], nearly crippled the rise of Roman power. From the conclusion of the Second Punic War in 202 BC, Carthage functioned as a client state of the Roman Republic for another 50 years.

Following the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]] which began in 149 BC during the [[Third Punic War]], Carthage was conquered by Rome in 146 BC.{{sfn|Steel|2013|p=9–10}} Following its conquest, the Romans renamed Carthage to [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], incorporating it as a province.

During the Roman period, the area of what is now  enjoyed a huge development. The economy, mainly during the Empire, boomed: the prosperity of the area depended on agriculture. Called the ''Granary of the Empire'', the area of actual  and coastal [[Tripolitania]], according to one estimate, produced one million tons of cereals each year, one quarter of which was exported to the Empire. Additional crops included beans, figs, grapes, and other fruits.

By the 2nd century, olive oil rivalled cereals as an export item. In addition to the cultivations and the capture and transporting of exotic wild animals from the western mountains, the principal production and exports included textiles, marble, wine, timber, livestock, pottery such as [[African Red Slip]], and wool.

There was even a huge production of mosaics and ceramics, exported mainly to , in the central area of [[El Djem]] (where there was the second biggest amphitheatre in the Roman Empire).

Berber bishop [[Donatus Magnus]] was the founder of a Christian group known as the [[Donatist]]s. During the 5th and 6th centuries (from 430 to 533 AD), the Germanic [[Vandals]] invaded and ruled over a kingdom in Northwest Africa that included present-day Tripoli. The region was easily reconquered in 533–534 AD, during the rule of Emperor [[Justinian I]], by the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Romans]] led by General [[Belisarius]], preluding a 165-year era of [[Byzantine North Africa|Byzantine rule]].

[[File:Statue de Okba ibn Nafi al Fihri en Algérie.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Uqba ibn Nafi]] led the [[Umayyad]] conquest of  in the late 7th century.]]
Sometime between the second half of the 7th century and the early part of the 8th century, [[Arab]] [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Muslim conquest occurred in the region]]. They founded the first Islamic city in Northwest Africa, [[Kairouan]]. It was there in 670 AD that the [[Mosque of Uqba]], or the Great Mosque of Kairouan, was constructed. This mosque is the oldest and most prestigious sanctuary in the Muslim West with the oldest standing [[minaret]] in the world; it is also considered a masterpiece of Islamic art and architecture. The [[Arab migration to the Maghreb]] began during this time.

The region in its entirety was taken in 695, retaken by the Byzantine Eastern Romans in 697, but lost permanently in 698. The transition from a Latin-speaking Christian Berber society to a Muslim and mostly Arabic-speaking society took over 400 years (the equivalent process in  and the Fertile Crescent took 600 years) and resulted in the final disappearance of Christianity and Latin in the 12th or 13th century. The majority of the population were not Muslim until quite late in the 9th century; a vast majority were during the 10th. Also, some  Christians emigrated; some richer members of society did so after the conquest in 698 and others were welcomed by Norman rulers to Sicily or  in the 11th and 12th centuries – the logical destination because of the 1200 year close connection between the two regions.

The Arab governors of Tunis founded the [[Aghlabids|Aghlabid dynasty]], which ruled , [[Tripolitania]] and eastern  from 800 to 909.  flourished under Arab rule when extensive systems were constructed to supply towns with water for household use and irrigation that promoted agriculture (especially olive production). This prosperity permitted luxurious court life and was marked by the construction of new palace cities such as al-Abbasiya (809) and Raq Adda (877).

After conquering [[Cairo]], the [[Fatimids]] abandoned  and parts of Eastern  to the local [[Zirids]] (972–1148). Zirid  flourished in many areas: agriculture, industry, trade, and religious and secular learning. Management by the later Zirid [[emirs]] was neglectful though, and political instability was connected to the decline of  trade and agriculture.

The depredation of the  campaigns by the [[Banu Hilal]], a warlike Arab tribe encouraged by the Fatimids of  to seize Northwest Africa, sent the region's rural and urban economic life into further decline. Consequently, the region underwent rapid urbanisation as famines depopulated the countryside and industry shifted from agriculture to manufactures. The Arab historian [[Ibn Khaldun]] wrote that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.

The main  cities were conquered by the [[Normans]] of [[Sicily]] under the [[Kingdom of Africa]] in the 12th century, but following [[Almohad conquest of Ifriqiya|the conquest of ]] in 1159–1160 by the [[Almohads]] the Normans were evacuated to Sicily. Communities of  Christians would still exist in [[Nefzaoua]] up to the 14th century. The Almohads initially ruled over  through a governor, usually a near relative of the Caliph. Despite the prestige of the new masters, the country was still unruly, with continuous rioting and fighting between the townsfolk and wandering Arabs and Turks, the latter being subjects of the Muslim  adventurer Karakush. Also,  was occupied by [[Ayyubids]] between 1182 and 1183 and again between 1184 and 1187.

The greatest threat to Almohad rule in  was the [[Banu Ghaniya]], relatives of the [[Almoravids]], who from their base in [[Mallorca]] tried to restore Almoravid rule over the Maghreb. Around 1200 they succeeded in extending their rule over the whole of  until they were crushed by Almohad troops in 1207. After this success, the Almohads installed Walid Abu Hafs as the governor of .  remained part of the Almohad state, until 1230 when the son of Abu Hafs declared himself independent.

During the reign of the [[Hafsid dynasty]] from their capital Tunis, fruitful commercial relationships were established with several Christian Mediterranean states. In the late 16th century the coast became a [[pirate]] stronghold.

In the last years of the [[Hafsid dynasty]],  seized many of the coastal cities, but these were recovered by the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The [[Conquest of Tunis (1534)|first Ottoman conquest of Tunis]] took place in 1534 under the command of [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha]], the younger brother of Oruç Reis, who was the [[Kapudan Pasha]] of the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman Fleet]] during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. However, it was not until the [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|final Ottoman reconquest of Tunis from ]] in 1574 under Kapudan Pasha [[Uluç Ali Reis]] that the Ottomans permanently acquired the former [[History of medieval #Hafsid dynasty of Tunis|Hafsid ]], retaining it until the [[ conquest of ]] in 1881.

Initially under  rule from Algiers, soon the [[Ottoman Porte]] appointed directly for [[Tunis]] a governor called the [[Pasha]] supported by [[janissary]] forces. Before long, however,  became in effect an autonomous province, under the local [[bey]]. Under its [[ People|]] governors, the beys,  attained virtual independence. The [[Husainid Dynasty|Hussein dynasty]] of beys, established in 1705, lasted until 1957. This evolution of status was from time to time challenged without success by Algiers. During this era, the governing councils controlling  remained largely composed of a foreign elite who continued to conduct state business in the [[ language]].

[[File:St Louis Cathedral - Carthage -  - 1899.jpg|thumb|St Louis Cathedral – Carthage –  – 1899]]
Attacks on European shipping were made by [[Barbary corsairs|corsairs]], primarily from Algiers, but also from Tunis and [[Tripoli, |Tripoli]], yet after a long period of declining raids the growing power of the European states finally forced its termination.

The [[Second plague pandemic|plague epidemics]] ravaged  in 1784–1785, 1796–1797 and 1818–1820.

In the 19th century, the rulers of  became aware of the ongoing efforts at political and social [[Tanzimat|reform in the Ottoman capital]]. The Bey of Tunis then, by his own lights but informed by the  example, attempted to effect a modernizing reform of institutions and the economy.  international debt grew unmanageable. This was the reason or pretext for  forces to establish a [[History of  era |protectorate]] in 1881.

===  Protectorate of  (1881–1956) ===
{{main| protectorate of }}

[[File:A Churchill tank and other vehicles parade through Tunis, 8 May 1943. NA2880.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95| tank moves through Tunis after the city was taken from Axis troops, 8 May 1943.]]
In 1869,  declared itself bankrupt and an international financial commission took control over its economy. In 1881, using the pretext of a  incursion into [[]], the  invaded with an army of about 36,000 and forced the Bey of Tunis, [[Muhammad III as-Sadiq]], to agree to the terms of the 1881 [[Treaty of Bardo]]. With this treaty,  was officially made a [[ occupation of | protectorate]], over the objections of . European settlements in the country were actively encouraged; the number of [[ people|]] colonists grew from 34,000 in 1906 to 144,000 in 1945. In 1910 there were also 105,000 [[ | in ]].

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the protectorate of  was controlled by the collaborationist [[Vichy |Vichy]] government in Metropolitan . The antisemitic [[Vichy anti-Jewish legislation|Statute on Jews]] enacted by the Vichy government was also implemented in Vichy-controlled Northwest Africa and other overseas  territories. Thus, the persecution and murder of the Jews from 1940 to 1943 was part of [[the Holocaust]] in .

From November 1942 until May 1943, Vichy-controlled  was occupied by . [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] Commander [[Walter Rauff]] continued to implement the "Final Solution" there. From 1942 to 1943,  was the scene of the [[ Campaign]], a series of battles between the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces. The battle opened with initial success by the  and  forces, but the massive supply and numerical superiority of the Allies led to the [[ Campaign|Axis surrender]] on 13 May 1943. The six-month campaign of 's liberation from Axis occupation signalled the end of the war in Africa.

=== Struggle for independence (1943–1956) ===

After the liberation of  from the , the  regained control over the government and made participation in a nationalist party illegal once more. [[Moncef Bey]], who was popular amongst , was deposed by the . The  claimed that his removal was due to him being sympathetic to the Axis countries during  occupation, but the real reason is up for debate.

In 1945 after escaping  surveillance,  nationalist [[Habib Bourguiba]] arrived in [[Cairo]]. While there, he was able to make contact with the [[Arab League]]. Later in 1946, after traveling to other Middle Eastern countries, he made his way to the  to speak to both the [[United Nations]] at their headquarters at [[Lake Success, New York|Lake Success]] and [[ Department of State|U.S. State Department]] officials in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]], pleading the case of the  nationalists.

As part of postwar , a new all- labor organization was formed, the [[ General Labour Union|Union Générale des Travailleurs (UGTT)]]. This was one of the stronger components of the nationalist group [[Neo-Destour]].

Habib Bourguiba made his way to the  on 13 September 1949. He attended the [[ Federation of Labor]] meeting in [[San Francisco]], California. The  were opposed to his presence there, and the US feared political change in North Africa due to the looming presence of possible [[Soviet Union]] communist expansion.

Bourguiba continued to plead to foreign leaders when he traveled to  on 6 November 1951. His contacts included [[Alberto Mellini Ponce De León]], [[Mario Toscano]], and [[Licinio Vestri]]. De León was an old friend of Bourguiba who had helped free him from  captivity, Toscano was the head of the ''Ufficio Studi e Documentazione'' in the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs ()|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], and Vestri was an [[Africanist (discipline)|Africanist]] scholar. Despite his best efforts, the  remained neutral as they did not want to ruin relations with [[NATO]] ally , nor did they want to hamper any possibility of future relations with  as it served as a key part of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].

The  Resident General in , {{ill|Jean de Hautecloque|de|Jean de Hauteclocque|fr}} left Tunis to go to Paris on 25 August 1953, when he was replaced by [[Pierre Voizard]]. Voizard had previously been the  Minister to [[]]. A month after his arrival in Tunis on 26 September 1953, Voizard made many changes to ease tensions in . He lifted press censorship and freed several political prisoners. He also restored the full powers of civil authorities and raised the state of siege in the [[Sahel, |Sahel]].

On 26 January 1954, Voizard announced that there would soon be new reforms in favor of granting more sovereignty to  while insuring the interests of the  and  citizens in , at the Cercle Republicain d'outre Mer in Paris. The Neo-Destour group was not in favor of these reforms if they themselves were not involved in their creation. They also demanded the freedom of Bourguiba who was imprisoned on the Isle of Galete.

[[File:Habib Bourguiba portrait4.jpg|thumb|[[Habib Bourguiba]] was the first president of , from 1957 to 1987.|192x192px]]
 achieved independence from  on 20 March 1956 with [[Habib Bourguiba]] as Prime Minister. 20 March is celebrated annually as  Independence Day. A year later,  was declared a republic, with Bourguiba as [[List of Presidents of |the first President]]. From independence in 1956 until the 2011 revolution, the government and the [[Constitutional Democratic Rally]] (RCD), formerly [[Neo Destour]] and the [[Socialist Destourian Party]], were effectively one. Following a report by [[Amnesty International]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' called  "one of the most modern but repressive countries in the Arab world". On 12 May 1964,  nationalized foreign farmlands. Immediately after,  canceled all financial assistance for the country, which was to amount to more than $40 million. This led to the  National Assembly passing a bill that required all residents of the country to subscribe to a "popular loan" in proportion to their income. From 1977 until 2005,  was a shooting location for five films of the ''[[Star Wars (franchise)|Star Wars]]'' film franchise.

In 1982,  became the center of the [[ Liberation Organization]], based in the capital Tunis. On 1 October 1985, the [[ Air Force]] [[Operation Wooden Leg|bombed the PLO Headquarters]], killing at least 60 people.

[[File:Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.jpg|thumb|[[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]], president of  from 1987 to 2011|209x209px]]
In November 1987, doctors declared Bourguiba unfit to rule and, in a bloodless coup d'état, Prime Minister [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] assumed the presidency in accordance with Article 57 of the [[ constitution]]. The anniversary of Ben Ali's succession, 7 November, was celebrated as a national holiday. He was consistently re-elected with enormous majorities every five years (well over 80 percent of the vote), the last being 25 October 2009, until he fled the country amid popular unrest in January 2011.

Ben Ali and his family were accused of corruption and plundering the country's money. Economic liberalisation provided further opportunities for financial mismanagement, while corrupt members of the Trabelsi family, most notably in the cases of [[Imed Trabelsi]] and [[Belhassen Trabelsi]], controlled much of the business sector in the country. The First Lady [[Leila Ben Ali]] was described as an "unabashed [[Oniomania|shopaholic]]" who used the state airplane to make frequent unofficial trips to Europe's fashion capitals.  refused a  request for the extradition of two of the President's nephews, from Leila's side, who were accused by the  State prosecutor of having stolen two mega-yachts from a  marina. According to ''[[Le Monde]]'', Ben Ali's son-in-law was being primed to eventually take over the country.

Independent human rights groups, such as [[Amnesty International]], [[Freedom House]], and Protection International, documented that basic human and political rights were not respected. The regime obstructed in any way possible the work of local human rights organizations. In 2008, in terms of [[press freedom]],  was ranked 143rd out of 173.

=== Post-revolution (since 2011) ===
{{see also| Revolution}}
[[File: Unrest - VOA - Tunis 14 Jan 2011 (2).jpg|thumb|Tunis on 14 January 2011 during the [[ Revolution]]|242x242px|left]]
The  Revolution was an intensive campaign of [[civil resistance]] that was precipitated by high [[unemployment]], [[food inflation]], [[corruption]], a lack of [[freedom of speech]] and other [[political freedom]]s and poor [[living conditions]]. Labour unions were said to be an integral part of the protests. The protests inspired the [[Arab Spring]], a wave of similar actions throughout the Arab world. The catalyst for mass demonstrations was the death of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]], a 26-year-old  street vendor, who set himself afire on 17 December 2010 in protest at the confiscation of his wares and the humiliation inflicted on him by a municipal official named [[Faida Hamdy]]. Anger and violence intensified following Bouazizi's death on 4 January 2011, ultimately leading longtime [[President of |President]] [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] to resign and flee the country on 14 January 2011, after 23 years in power.

Protests continued for banning of the ruling party and the eviction of all its members from the transitional government formed by [[Mohamed Ghannouchi|Mohammed Ghannouchi]]. Eventually the new government gave in to the demands. A Tunis court banned the ex-ruling party RCD and confiscated all its resources. A decree by the minister of the interior banned the "political police", special forces which were used to intimidate and persecute political activists.

On 3 March 2011, the interim president announced that [[ Constituent Assembly election, 2011|elections to a Constituent Assembly]] would be held on 24 July 2011. On 9 June 2011, the prime minister announced the election would be postponed until 23 October 2011. International and internal observers declared the vote free and fair. The [[Ennahda Movement]], formerly banned under the Ben Ali regime, came out of the election as the largest party, with 89 seats out of a total of 217. On 12 December 2011, former dissident and veteran human rights activist [[Moncef Marzouki]] was elected president. In March 2012, Ennahda declared it will not support making sharia the main source of legislation in the new constitution, maintaining the secular nature of the state. Ennahda's stance on the issue was criticized by hardline Islamists, who wanted strict sharia, but was welcomed by secular parties. On 6 February 2013, [[Chokri Belaid]], the leader of the leftist opposition and prominent critic of Ennahda, was assassinated. In 2014, President [[Moncef Marzouki]] established 's [[Truth and Dignity Commission ()|Truth and Dignity Commission]], as a key part of creating a national reconciliation.

 was hit by two terror attacks on foreign tourists in 2015, [[Bardo National Museum attack|first killing 22 people]] at the [[Bardo National Museum (Tunis)|Bardo National Museum]], and [[2015 Sousse attacks|later killing 38 people]] at the [[Sousse]] beachfront.  president [[Beji Caid Essebsi]] renewed the state of emergency in October for three more months. The [[ National Dialogue Quartet]] won the 2015 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for its work in building a peaceful, pluralistic political order in .

==== Presidency of Kais Saied (2019–present) ====
's first democratically elected president [[Beji Caid Essebsi]] died in July 2019. Following him, [[Kais Saied]] became 's president after a landslide victory in the [[2019  presidential election]]s in October. On 23 October 2019, Saied was sworn in as 's new president.

On 25 July 2021, amid ongoing demonstrations concerning government dysfunction and corruption and rises in [[COVID-19]] cases, Kais Saied unilaterally [[2021  political crisis|suspended parliament, dismissed the prime minister and withdrew immunity of parliament members]]. In September 2021, Saied said he would appoint a committee to help draft new constitutional amendments.{{Efn|The new constitution, which increased presidential powers, was passed in a [[2022  constitutional referendum|referendum]] the following year with a turnout of only around 30%, amidst a widespread boycott.}} On 29 September, he named [[Najla Bouden]] as the new prime minister and tasked her with forming a [[Bouden Cabinet|cabinet]], which was sworn in on 11 October. On 3 February 2022,  was voted to the African Union's (AU) Peace and Security Council for the term 2022–2024, according to the  Foreign Ministry. The poll took place on the fringes of the AU Executive Council's 40th ordinary session, which was held in the  capital of Addis Ababa, according to the ministry.

In February 2022,  and the International Monetary Fund held preliminary negotiations in the hopes of securing a multibillion-dollar bailout for an economy beset by recession, public debt, inflation, and unemployment.

In April 2023, the  government closed the headquarters of the [[Ennahda]] party and arrested its leader [[Rached Ghannouchi]]. In October 2023 [[Abir Moussi]], head of the [[Free Destourian Party|Free Destourian Party (FDL)]], became the latest prominent opponent of president Saied to have been detained or imprisoned. The FDL had emerged from the [[Democratic Constitutional Rally|Democratic Constitutional Assembly]].

In September 2023 Saied had asked to postpone a visit by a delegation of the [[European Commission|EU commission]] to discuss migration according to [[Ministry of the Interior ()|Minister of the Interior]] [[Kamel Feki]]. Meanwhile, human rights organisations were criticizing the July migration agreement. Feki said that , which is one of the most important transit countries for people on their way to Europe, cannot act as a border guard for other countries. In October 2023 Saied turned down 127 million in EU aid saying that the amount was small and doesn't square with a deal signed three months ago. This in turn caused surprise in Brussels. In April 2025,  dismantled dozens of makeshift camps housing African migrants, displacing as many as 7,000 people.

On 6 October 2024, President Kais Saied won a second term with more than 90% of the vote in a [[2024  presidential election|presidential election]] with a 28.8% turnout. Five political parties had urged people to boycott the elections.
