=== Pre-Columbian period ===
{{Main|Pre-Columbian history of }}
Historians have classified the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous people]] of  as belonging to the [[Intermediate Area]], where the peripheries of the [[Mesoamerican]] and [[Andean world|Andean]] native cultures overlapped. More recently, [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]]  has also been described as part of the [[Isthmo- Area]].

Stone tools, the oldest evidence of human occupation in , are associated with the arrival of various groups of [[hunter-gatherer]]s about 10,000 to 7,000 years [[Before Common Era|BCE]] in the [[Turrialba (district)|Turrialba Valley]]. The presence of [[Clovis culture]] type spearheads and arrows from [[South America]] opens the possibility that, in this area, two different cultures coexisted.

Agriculture became evident in the populations that lived in  about 5,000 years ago. They mainly grew [[tubers]] and roots. For the first and second millennia BCE there were already settled farming communities. These were small and scattered, although the timing of the transition from [[hunter-gatherer|hunting]] and gathering to agriculture as the main livelihood in the territory is still unknown.

The earliest use of [[pottery]] appears around 2,000 to 3,000 BCE. Shards of pots, cylindrical vases, platters, gourds, and other vases decorated with grooves, prints, and some modeled after animals have been found.

The influence of Indigenous peoples on modern  culture has been relatively small compared to other nations since the country lacked a strong native civilization to begin with.{{clarify|date=October 2024}}{{citation needed|date=October 2024}} Most of the native population was absorbed into the -speaking [[ colonization of the Americas|colonial society]] through inter-marriage,{{citation needed|date=October 2024}} except for some small remnants, the most significant of which are the [[Bribri people|Bribri]] and [[Boruca people|Boruca]] tribes who still inhabit the mountains of the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]], in the southeastern part of , near the frontier with [[]].

The name {{lang|es|la }}, meaning "rich coast" in the  language, was in some accounts first applied by [[Christopher Columbus]], who sailed to the eastern shores of  during his final voyage in 1502, and reported vast quantities of gold jewelry worn by natives. The name may also have come from conquistador [[Gil González Dávila]], who landed on the west coast in 1522, encountered natives, and obtained some of their gold, sometimes by violent theft and sometimes as gifts from local leaders.

During most of the colonial period,  was the southernmost province of the [[Captaincy General of ]], nominally part of the [[New |Viceroyalty of New ]]. The captaincy general was a largely autonomous entity within the [[ Empire]]. 's distance from the capital of the captaincy in [[]], its legal prohibition under [[mercantilism|mercantilist]]  law from trade with its southern neighbor , then part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (i.e. [[]]), and lack of resources such as gold and silver, made  into a poor, isolated, and sparsely inhabited region within the  Empire.  was described as "the poorest and most miserable  colony in all America" by a  governor in 1719.

=== Independence ===
{{See also|Free State of |First  Republic}}
Like the rest of [[Central America]],  never fought for independence from . On 15 September 1821, after the final  defeat in the [[ War of Independence]] (1810–1821), the authorities in  declared the independence of all of Central America. That date is still celebrated as Independence Day in  even though, technically, under the [[ Constitution of 1812]] that had been readopted in 1820, [[]] and  had become an autonomous province with its capital in [[León, |León]].

On 3 March 1824, the government of the State of  officially proposed to the municipality of [[Nicoya]] its voluntary incorporation into the country, through a document in which it invited it "if it was convenient to join its Province without going against its will." On 4 July, an open town hall was convened in Nicoya to discuss the matter, but attendees declined the invitation under the argument "that this Party... cannot be dissident."

On 25 July 1824, a second [[plebiscite]] was called in the city of Nicoya. After deliberation, the incorporation into  was decided in an open town hall meeting, preparing a record in which the main reasons for it were noted, pointing out the advantages in terms of trade, the desire to participate in the advances that are palpable in , the economic, administrative and public service benefits, the creation of schools, security and quiet, referring to the state of war that  was experiencing at that time and the fear that it would spread to the Partido populations, in addition to point out the poverty in which its towns find themselves and the geography of the territory as justifications for the union. Three days later, another similar plebiscite was held in [[Santa Cruz (canton), |Santa Cruz]], with the same result. The election was by majority vote, with 77% of the Party's population in favor of incorporation, and 23% against it. The town of Guanacaste was the only one that declined annexation, due to the ties its residents had with the city of [[Rivas, ]].

Upon independence,  authorities faced the issue of officially deciding the future of the country. Two bands formed: the Imperialists, defended by [[Cartago, |Cartago]] and [[Heredia Province|Heredia cities]], which were in favor of [[Central America under  rule|joining]] the [[First  Empire| Empire]], and the Republicans, represented by the cities of [[San José, |San José]] and [[Alajuela]] who defended full independence. Because of the lack of agreement on these two possible outcomes, the first civil war in  occurred. The [[Battle of Ochomogo]] took place on the Hill of [[Ochomogo]], located in the [[ Central Valley|Central Valley]] in 1823. The conflict was won by the Republicans and, as a consequence, the city of [[Cartago, |Cartago]] lost its status as the capital, which moved to [[San José, |San José]].

In 1838, long after the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] ceased to function in practice,  formally withdrew and proclaimed itself sovereign. The considerable distance and poor communication routes between [[ City]] and the Central Plateau, where most of the  population lived then and still lives now, meant the local population had little allegiance to the federal government in . Since colonial times,  has been reluctant to become economically tied with the rest of Central America. Even today, despite most of its neighbors'{{Efn|, , , , and }} efforts to increase regional integration,  has remained more independent.

Until 1849, when it became part of [[]], [[Chiriquí province|Chiriquí]] was part of .  pride was assuaged for the loss of this eastern (or southern) territory with the acquisition of [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]], in the north.

=== Economic growth in the 19th century ===
{{See also|Liberal State}}
[[Coffee]] was first planted in  in 1808, and by the 1820s, it surpassed [[tobacco]], [[sugar]], and [[cacao bean|cacao]] as a primary [[export]]. Coffee production remained 's principal source of wealth well into the 20th century, creating a wealthy class of growers, the so-called Coffee Barons. The revenue helped to modernize the country.

Most of the coffee exported was grown around the main centers of population in the Central Plateau and then transported by [[Bullock cart|oxcart]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] port of [[Puntarenas]] after the main road was built in 1846. By the mid-1850s the main market for coffee was Britain. It soon became a high priority to develop an effective transportation route from the Central Plateau to the Atlantic Ocean. For this purpose, in the 1870s, the  government contracted with U.S. businessman [[Minor C. Keith]] to build a railroad from San José to the [[Western Caribbean Zone|Caribbean]] port of [[Limón]]. Despite enormous difficulties with construction, disease, and financing, the railroad was completed in 1890.

Most Afro-Costa Ricans descend from [[]]n immigrants who worked in the construction of that railway and now make up about 3% of 's population.{{Citation needed|date=February 2022}} U.S. convicts, Italians, and  immigrants also participated in the construction project. In exchange for completing the railroad, the  government granted Keith large tracts of land and a lease on the train route, which he used to produce [[banana]]s and export them to the . As a result, bananas came to rival coffee as the principal  export, while foreign-owned corporations (including the [[United Fruit Company]] later) began to hold a major role in the national economy and eventually became a symbol of the exploitative export economy. The major labor dispute between the peasants and the United Fruit Company (The Great Banana Strike) was a major event in the country's history and was an important step that would eventually lead to the formation of effective [[trade unions in ]], as the company was required to sign a collective agreement with its workers in 1938.

=== 20th century ===
{{See also|Reform State}}
Historically,  has generally enjoyed greater peace and more consistent political stability than many of its fellow Latin  nations. During the 20th century, however,  experienced two significant periods of violence. In 1917–1919, General [[Federico Tinoco Granados]] ruled as a military dictator until he was overthrown and forced into exile. The unpopularity of [[Dictatorship of the Tinoco Brothers|Tinoco's regime]] led, after he was overthrown, to a considerable decline in the size, wealth, and political influence of the  military. In 1948, [[José Figueres Ferrer]] led an [[ Civil War|armed uprising]] in the wake of a disputed presidential election between [[Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia]] (who had been president between 1940 and 1944) and [[Otilio Ulate Blanco]]. With more than 2,000 dead, the resulting 44-day [[ Civil War]] was the bloodiest event in  during the 20th century.

The victorious rebels formed a government junta that [[military of |abolished the military]] all together and oversaw the drafting of a new constitution by a democratically elected assembly. Having enacted these reforms, the junta transferred power to Ulate on 8 November 1949. After the ''coup d'état'', Figueres became a national hero, winning the country's first democratic election under the new constitution [[ general election, 1953|in 1953]]. Since then,  has held 15 additional presidential elections, the latest [[ general election, 2022|in 2022]]. With uninterrupted democracy dating back to at least 1948, the country is the region's most stable.
