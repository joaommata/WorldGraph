[[File: Map Gallia Tribes Towns.png|thumb|left|''[[Gallia Belgica]]'' at the time of [[Julius Caesar]]'s conquest of [[Gaul]] in 54 BCE]]

According to [[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's]] ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', the [[Belgae]] inhabited the northernmost part of [[Gaul]], a region extending from the [[Seine]] and [[Marne (river)|Marne]] rivers to the [[Rhine]]. This area was larger than present-day  and included parts of modern [[]], , [[]], and [[]]. Caesar noted that the Belgae were the bravest among the Gauls due to their distance from the civilization and refinement of the [[Roman province|Roman Province]], minimal contact with merchants importing luxury goods, and their continual warfare with the neighboring [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] across the Rhine. Within this broad region, Caesar referred to a specific area as "," which was politically dominant and located in what is now northern .

Modern , along with neighboring regions of the  and , corresponds to the territories of the northernmost Belgae tribes, including the [[Morini]],{{efn|The Morini were located along the coast of modern , particularly in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] region, centered around [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]. Their territory extended from the [[Canche|River Canache]] to the [[River Scheldt]].}} [[Menapii]],{{efn|The Menapii dwelt near the [[North Sea]], around present-day [[Cassel, Nord|Cassel]], in the region now part of .}} [[Nervii]],{{efn|The Nervii inhabited the central part of modern , including Brussels, extending southwards to [[Cambrai]] in [[ Hainaut]]. Their territory included areas along the [[Haine]] and [[Sambre]] rivers.}} [[Germani cisrhenani|Germani Cisrhenani]],{{efn|The Germani Cisrhenani inhabited regions on the eastern side of the [[Rhine]], corresponding to parts of modern-day , but their influence extended into the northeastern part of Gaul.}} and [[Atuatuci|Aduatuci]].{{efn|The [[Aduatuci]] lived in the eastern part of modern-day , particularly in the [[Meuse|Meuse valley]] and the [[Hesbaye|Hesbaye region]].}} Julius Caesar described these tribes as particularly warlike and economically undeveloped, noting their kinship with the Germanic tribes east of the Rhine. Additionally, the area around [[Arlon]] in southern  was part of the territory of the powerful [[Treveri]] tribe, whose lands extended into present-day  and adjacent regions of  and .

Following Caesar's conquests, Gallia Belgica became the [[Latin]] name for a large Roman province encompassing most of [[Gaul|Northern Gaul]], including the lands of the Belgae and Treveri. Subsequently, areas closer to the lower Rhine frontier, such as the eastern part of modern , were incorporated into the frontier province of [[Germania Inferior]]. As the central government of the [[Western Roman Empire]] collapsed, the provinces of Belgica and Germania were inhabited by a mix of Romanized populations and Germanic-speaking [[Franks]], who came to dominate the military and political spheres.

===Middle Ages===
During the 5th century, the area came under the rule of the Frankish [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] kings, who initially established a kingdom ruling over the Romanized population in what is now northern , and then conquered the other Frankish kingdoms. During the 8th century, the empire of the Franks came to be ruled by the [[Carolingian dynasty]], whose centre of power included the area which is now eastern . Over the centuries, it was divided up in many ways, but the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843 divided the Carolingian Empire into three kingdoms whose borders had a lasting impact on medieval political boundaries. Most of modern  was in the [[Middle Francia|Middle Kingdom]], later known as [[Lotharingia]], but the coastal [[county of Flanders]], west of the [[Scheldt]], became the northernmost part of [[West Francia]], the predecessor of [[]]. In 870 in the [[Treaty of Meerssen]], modern  lands all became part of the western kingdom for a period, but in 880 in the [[Treaty of Ribemont]], Lotharingia came under the lasting control of the eastern kingdom, which became the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The lordships and bishoprics along the "March" (frontier) between the two great kingdoms maintained important connections between each other. For example, the county of Flanders expanded over the Scheldt into the empire, and during several periods was ruled by the same lords as the [[county of Hainaut]].

In the 13th and 14th centuries, the cloth industry and commerce boomed especially in the County of Flanders and it became one of the richest areas in Europe. This prosperity played a role in conflicts between Flanders and the [[king of ]]. Famously, Flemish militias scored a surprise victory at the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] against a strong force of mounted knights in 1302, but  soon regained control of the rebellious province.

===Burgundian and Habsburg ===
[[File:Karte-Haus-Burgund 4-FR.png|thumb|upright|The [[Burgundian |Burgundian State]] of [[Charles the Bold]] in the 15th century]]

In the 15th century, the [[Duke of Burgundy]] in  took control of Flanders, and from there [[Burgundian inheritance in the Low Countries|proceeded to unite]] much of what is now the Benelux, the so-called [[Burgundian ]]. "Burgundy" and "Flanders" were the first two common names used for the Burgundian  which was the predecessor of the  , the predecessor of modern . The union, technically stretching between two kingdoms, gave the area economic and political stability which led to an even greater prosperity and artistic creation.

Born in , the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles&nbsp;V]] was heir of the Burgundians, but also of the royal families of [[House of Habsburg|]], [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]]. With the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]] he gave the [[Seventeen Provinces]] more legitimacy as a stable entity, rather than just a temporary [[personal union]]. He also increased the influence of these  over the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]], which continued to exist as a large semi-independent enclave.

=== and  ===
The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) was triggered by the  government's policy towards [[Protestantism]], which was becoming popular in the Low Countries. The rebellious northern [[ Republic|United Provinces]] (''Belgica Foederata'' in [[Latin]], the "Federated ") eventually separated from the [[Southern ]] (''Belgica Regia'', the "Royal "). The southern part continued to be ruled successively by the [[Habsburg |]] ([[ ]]) and the [[History of |]] [[House of Habsburg]]s ([[ ]]) and comprised most of modern . This was the theatre of several more protracted conflicts during much of the 17th and 18th centuries involving , including the [[Franco- War]] (1672–1678), the [[Nine Years' War]] (1688–1697), the [[War of the  Succession]] (1701–1714), and part of the [[War of the  Succession]] (1740–1748).

Following the [[ Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1794|campaigns of 1794 in the  Revolutionary Wars]], the Low Countries{{snd}}including territories that were never nominally under Habsburg rule, such as the Prince-Bishopric of Liège{{snd}}were annexed by the [[ First Republic]], ending  rule in the region. After the dissolution of the [[First  Empire]] and the abdication of [[Napoleon]] following his defeat on the [[Battle of Waterloo|battlefield of Waterloo]], the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1814–15 created the [[ of the ]]. This [[buffer state]], located between the major European powers, united the former territories of the  Republic, the   and the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, under King [[William I of the |William I of Orange]].

In 1830, the [[ Revolution]] led to the re-separation of the Southern Provinces from the  and to the establishment of a Catholic and bourgeois, officially -speaking and neutral, independent  under a [[Provisional Government of |provisional government]] and a [[national Congress of |national congress]]. Since the installation of [[Leopold I of |Leopold&nbsp;I]] as king on {{nowrap|21 July}} 1831, now celebrated as 's [[National Day]],  has been a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary democracy]], with a [[Secularism in |''laicist'']] constitution based on the [[Napoleonic Code]]. Although the franchise was initially restricted, [[universal suffrage]] for men was introduced after the [[ general strike of 1893|general strike of 1893]] (with [[plural voting]] until 1919) and for women in 1949.

The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885 ceded control of the [[Congo Free State]] to [[Leopold II of |King Leopold&nbsp;II]] as his private possession. From around 1900 there was growing international concern for the [[Atrocities in the Congo Free State|extreme and savage treatment of the  population under Leopold&nbsp;II]], for whom the Congo was primarily a source of revenue from ivory and rubber production. Many  were killed by Leopold's agents for failing to meet production quotas for ivory and rubber. In 1908, this outcry led the  state to assume responsibility for the government of the colony, henceforth called the [[ Congo]]. A  commission in 1919 estimated that Congo's population was half what it was in 1879.
