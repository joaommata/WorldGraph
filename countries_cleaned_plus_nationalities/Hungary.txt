The [[Roman Empire]] conquered the territory between the [[Alps]] and the area west of the [[Danube]] River from 16 to 15 BC, the Danube being the frontier of the empire. In 14 BC, [[Pannonia]], the western part of the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]], which includes the west of today's , was recognised by emperor [[Augustus]] in the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'' as part of the Roman Empire. The area south-east of [[Pannonia]] was organised as the Roman province [[Moesia]] in 6 BC. An area east of the river [[Tisza]] became the Roman province of [[Dacia]] in 106 AD, which included today's east . It remained under Roman rule until 271.

From 235, the Roman Empire went through troubled times, caused by revolts, rivalry and rapid succession of emperors. The Western Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century under the stress of the migration of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] and [[Carpi people|Carpian]] pressure. This period brought many invaders into Central Europe, beginning with the [[Huns|Hunnic Empire]] ({{circa|370}}–469). The most powerful ruler of the Hunnic Empire was [[Attila]] the Hun (434–453), who later became a central figure in  mythology. After the disintegration of the Hunnic Empire, the [[Gepids]], an Eastern Germanic tribe, who had been vassalised by the Huns, established their own kingdom in the Carpathian Basin. Other groups which reached the Carpathian Basin during the Migration Period were the [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], [[Lombards]], and [[Early Slavs|Slavs]].

In the 560s, the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] founded the Avar Khaganate, a state that maintained supremacy in the region for more than two centuries. The [[Franks]] under [[Charlemagne]] defeated the Avars in a series of campaigns during the 790s. Between 804 and 829, the [[First  Empire]] conquered the lands east of the Danube and took over the rule of the local Slavic tribes and remnants of the Avars. By the mid-9th century, the [[Slavs in Lower Pannonia#Principality|Balaton Principality]], also known as Lower Pannonia, was established west of the Danube as part of the Frankish [[March of Pannonia]].

===Middle Ages (895–1526)===

[[File:Kalandozasok.jpg|thumb|[[ invasions of Europe| raids in the 9–10th centuries]]: Between 899 and 970, the researchers count 47 (38 to West and 9 to East) raids in different parts of Europe.

Foundation of the [[Principality of | state]] is connected to the [[ conquest of the Carpathian Basin| conquerors]], who arrived from the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe|Pontic-Caspian steppe]] as a confederation of [[Seven chieftains of the Magyars|seven tribes]]. The [[]] arrived in the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]] as a frame of a strong centralised steppe-empire under the leadership of Grand Prince [[Álmos]] and his son [[Árpád]]: founders of the [[Árpád dynasty]], the  ruling dynasty and the  state. The [[Árpád dynasty]] claimed to be a direct descendant of [[Attila|Attila the Hun]]. The  took possession of the area in a pre-planned manner, with a long move-in between 862 and 895. The rising  conducted successful [[ invasions of Europe|fierce campaigns and raids]], from [[Constantinople]] to as far as today's . The  defeated [[ invasions of Europe|three major East Frankish imperial armies]] between 907 and 910. A defeat at the [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 signaled a provisory end to most campaigns on foreign territories, at least towards the west.

====Age of Árpádian kings====
{{Main|Kingdom of  (1000–1301)|Árpád dynasty}}
[[File:A Szent Korona elölről 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Holy Crown of |Holy Crown]] (''Szent Korona''), one of the key symbols of . It was gifted to [[Stephen I of | Stephen]], the first [[King of ]], who converted the nation to Christianity]]

In 972, the ruling prince ({{langx|hu|fejedelem}}) [[Géza, Grand Prince of the |Géza]] of the [[Árpád dynasty]] officially started to integrate  into Christian Western Europe. His son [[Stephen I of | Stephen I]] became the first [[King of ]] after defeating his [[paganism|pagan]] uncle [[Koppány]]. Under Stephen,  was recognised as a Catholic [[Apostolic Majesty|Apostolic Kingdom]]. Applying to [[Pope Sylvester II]], Stephen received the insignia of royalty (including probably a part of the [[Holy Crown of ]]) from the papacy.

By 1006, Stephen consolidated his power and started sweeping reforms to convert  into a Western-style [[Feudalism|feudal state]]. The country switched to using Latin for administration purposes, and until as late as 1844, Latin remained the official language of administration. King [[Ladislaus I of | Ladislaus]] completed the work of King [[Stephen I of | Stephen]], consolidating the  state's power and strengthening [[Christianity]]. His charismatic personality, strategic leadership and military talents resulted in the termination of internal power struggles and foreign military threats. The wife of the  king [[Demetrius Zvonimir of |Demetrius Zvonimir]] was Ladislaus's sister. At [[Helen of , Queen of |Helen's]] request, Ladislaus intervened in the conflict and invaded  in 1091.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=282, 284}} The [[Kingdom of  (925–1102)|Kingdom of ]] entered a [[ in personal union with |personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of  (1000–1301)|Kingdom of ]] in 1102 with the coronation of King [[Coloman, King of |Coloman]] as "King of  and Dalmatia" in 1102 in [[Biograd na Moru|Biograd]].

[[File:Europe_mediterranean_1097.jpg|alt=1097, Europe, map|thumb|Europe in 1097]]

One of the most powerful and wealthiest king of the Árpád dynasty was [[Béla III of |Béla III]], who disposed of the equivalent of 23 tonnes of silver per year, according to a contemporary [[Income register of Béla III of |income register]]. This exceeded the income of the  king (estimated at 17 tonnes) and was double the receipts of the  Crown. [[Andrew II of |Andrew II]] issued the ''[[Diploma Andreanum]]'' which secured the special privileges of the [[Transylvanian Saxons]] and is considered the first [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomy]] law in the world. He led the [[Fifth Crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]] in 1217, setting up the largest royal army in the history of Crusades. His [[Golden Bull of 1222]] was the first constitution in [[Continental Europe]]. The lesser nobles also began to present Andrew with grievances, a practice that evolved into the institution of the parliament (''parlamentum publicum'').

In 1241–1242, the kingdom received a major blow with the [[ invasion of |Mongol (Tatar) invasion]]. Up to half of 's population of 2 million were victims of the invasion. King [[Béla IV of |Béla IV]] let [[Cumans]] and [[Jasz people|Jassic people]] into the country, who were fleeing the Mongols. Over the centuries, they were fully assimilated. After the Mongols retreated, King Béla ordered the construction of hundreds of stone castles and fortifications, to defend against a possible second Mongol invasion. The [[Second Mongol invasion of |Mongols returned to ]] in 1285, but the newly built stone-castle systems and new tactics (using a higher proportion of heavily armed knights) stopped them. The invading Mongol force was defeated near Pest by the royal army of King [[Ladislaus IV of |Ladislaus IV]]. As with later invasions, it was repelled handily, the Mongols losing much of their invading force.

==== Age of elected kings ====
{{Main|Kingdom of  (1301–1526)|Ottoman– Wars}}

The [[Kingdom of ]] reached one of its greatest extents during the Árpádian kings, yet royal power was weakened at the end of their rule in 1301. After a destructive period of [[interregnum]] (1301–1308), the first [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] king, [[Charles I of ]] – a bilineal descendant of the [[Árpád dynasty]] – successfully restored royal power and defeated oligarch rivals, the so-called "little kings". The second Angevin  king, [[Louis I of |Louis the Great]] (1342–1382), led many successful military campaigns from  to southern  ([[Kingdom of Naples]]) and was also [[List of  monarchs|King of ]] from 1370. After King Louis died without a male heir, the country was stabilised only when [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of ]] (1387–1437) succeeded to the throne, who in 1433 also became [[Holy Roman Emperor]].
The first  [[Bible translations|Bible translation]] was completed in 1439. For half a year in 1437, there was an antifeudal and anticlerical [[Transylvanian peasant revolt|peasant revolt in Transylvania]] which was strongly influenced by [[Hussite]] ideas. From a small noble family in Transylvania, [[John Hunyadi]] grew to become one of the country's most powerful lords, thanks to his capabilities as a mercenary commander. He was elected governor, then regent. He was a successful crusader against the [[Ottoman Turks]], one of his greatest victories being the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|siege of Belgrade]] in 1456.

[[File:Portrait of Matthias Corvinus, King of .jpg|alt=Portrait, Matthias Corvinus, King of , Hunyadi, relief|thumb|upright|Renaissance portrait of [[Matthias Corvinus]], King of  and  (1458–1490), King of Bohemia (1469–1490) and Archduke of  (1487–1490)]]

The last strong king of medieval  was the [[Renaissance]] king [[Matthias Corvinus]] (1458–1490), son of John Hunyadi. His election was the first time that a member of the nobility mounted to the  royal throne without dynastic background. He was a successful military leader and an enlightened patron of the arts and learning. His library, the [[Bibliotheca Corviniana]], was Europe's greatest collection of historical chronicles, philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century, and second only in size to the [[Vatican Library]]. Items from the Bibliotheca Corviniana were inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]] in 2005. The serfs and common people considered him a just ruler because he protected them from excessive demands and other abuses by the magnates. Under his rule, in 1479, the  army destroyed the Ottoman and Wallachian troops at the [[Battle of Breadfield]]. Abroad he defeated the  and  imperial armies of Frederick at Breslau ([[Wrocław]]). Matthias' mercenary standing army, the [[Black Army of ]], was an unusually large army for its time, and it conquered [[Vienna]] as well as parts of  and [[Bohemia]].

King Matthias died without lawful sons, and the  magnates procured the accession of the Pole [[Vladislaus II of |Vladislaus II]] (1490–1516), supposedly because of his weak influence on  aristocracy. 's international role declined, its political stability was shaken, and social progress was deadlocked. In 1514, the weakened old King Vladislaus II faced a major peasant rebellion led by [[György Dózsa]], which was ruthlessly crushed by the [[ nobility|nobles]], led by [[John Zápolya]]. The resulting degradation of order paved the way for Ottoman preeminence. In 1521, the strongest  fortress in the South, Nándorfehérvár (today's [[Belgrade]], ), [[Siege of Belgrade (1521)|fell to the Turks]]. The early appearance of Protestantism further worsened internal relations in the country.

After some [[Ottoman wars in Europe|150 years of wars]] with the  and other states, the Ottomans gained a decisive victory over the  army at the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526, where King [[Louis II of |Louis II]] died while fleeing. Amid political chaos, the divided  nobility elected two kings simultaneously, [[John Zápolya]] and [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg dynasty]]. With the conquest of [[Buda]] by the Turks in 1541,  was divided into three parts and remained so until the end of the 17th century. The north-western part, termed as [[Royal ]], was annexed by the Habsburgs who ruled as kings of . The eastern part of the kingdom became independent as the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]], under Ottoman (and later Habsburg) [[suzerainty]]. The remaining central area, including the capital Buda, was known as the Pashalik of Buda.

In 1686, the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League's]] army, containing over 74,000 men from various nations, [[Siege of Buda (1686)|reconquered Buda]] from the Turks. After some more crushing [[Austro- War (1716–1718)|defeats of the Ottomans]] in the next few years, the entire Kingdom of  was removed from Ottoman rule by 1718. The last raid into  by the Ottoman vassals [[Crimean Khanate|Tatars]] from [[Crimea]] took place in 1717. The constrained Habsburg Counter-Reformation efforts in the 17th century reconverted the majority of the kingdom to Catholicism. The ethnic composition of  was fundamentally changed as a consequence of the prolonged warfare with the Turks. A large part of the country became devastated, population growth was stunted, and many smaller settlements perished. The -Habsburg government settled large groups of [[Serbs]] and other Slavs in the depopulated south, and settled [[ of |]] (called [[Danube Swabians]]) in various areas, but  were not allowed to settle or re-settle in the south of the Carpathian Basin.

=== From the 18th century to World War I (1699–1918) ===

[[File:Mányoki, Ádam - Portrait of Prince Ferenc Rákóczi II - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francis II Rákóczi]], leader of the war of independence against Habsburg rule (1703–1711)]]

Between 1703 and 1711, there was a large-scale [[Rákóczi's War of Independence|war of independence]] led by [[Francis II Rákóczi]], who after the dethronement of the Habsburgs in 1707 at the Diet of [[Ónod]], took power provisionally as the ruling prince for the wartime period, but refused the  crown and the title "king". The uprisings lasted for years. The  [[Kuruc]] army, although taking over most of the country, lost the main [[Battle of Trenčín|battle at Trencsén]] (1708). Three years later, because of the growing desertion, defeatism, and low morale, the Kuruc forces surrendered.

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and afterward, the  Diet had not convened for decades. In the 1820s, the emperor was forced to convene the Diet, which marked the beginning of a Reform Period (1825–1848, {{langx|hu|reformkor}}). The  Parliament was reconvened in 1825 to handle financial needs. A liberal party emerged and focused on providing for the peasantry. [[Lajos Kossuth]] emerged as a leader of the lower [[gentry]] in the Parliament. A remarkable upswing started as the nation concentrated its forces on modernisation even though the Habsburg monarchs obstructed all important liberal laws relating to [[civil and political rights]] and economic reforms. Many reformers ([[Lajos Kossuth]], [[Mihály Táncsics]]) were imprisoned by the authorities.

[[File:E. Poulton Portrait of Lajos Kossuth 1860s.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Lajos Kossuth]], Regent-President during the [[ Revolution of 1848]]]]

On 15 March 1848, mass demonstrations in Pest and Buda enabled  reformists to push through a list of [[12 points of the  Revolutionaries of 1848|12 demands]]. Under Governor and President [[Lajos Kossuth]] and Prime Minister [[Lajos Batthyány]], the House of Habsburg was dethroned. The Habsburg ruler and his advisors skillfully manipulated the ,  and  peasantry, led by priests and officers firmly loyal to the Habsburgs, into rebelling against the  government, though the  were supported by the vast majority of the ,  and [[Rusyns|Rusyn]] nationalities and by all the Jews of the kingdom, as well as by a large number of ,  and  volunteers. In July 1849 the  Parliament proclaimed and enacted the first laws of ethnic and [[minority rights]] in the world. Many members of the nationalities gained the coveted highest positions within the  Army, like [[János Damjanich]] and [[Józef Bem]]. The  forces (''[[Royal  Landwehr|Honvédség]]'') defeated  armies. To counter the successes of the  revolutionary army, Habsburg Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of |Franz Joseph I]] asked for help from the "Gendarme of Europe", Tsar [[Nicholas I of |Nicholas I]], whose  armies invaded . This made [[Artúr Görgei|Artúr Görgey]] surrender in August 1849. The leader of the  army, [[Julius Jacob von Haynau]], became governor of  for a few months and ordered the execution of [[the 13 Martyrs of Arad]], leaders of the  army, and Prime Minister Batthyány in October 1849. Kossuth escaped into exile. Following the war of 1848–1849, the whole country was in "passive resistance".

Because of external and internal problems, reforms seemed inevitable, and major military defeats of  forced the Habsburgs to negotiate the [[Austro- Compromise of 1867]], by which the dual monarchy of [[-]] was formed. This empire had the second largest area in Europe (after the [[ Empire]]), and it was the third most populous (after  and the [[ Empire]]). The two realms were governed separately by two parliaments from two capital cities, with a common monarch and common external and military policies. Economically, the empire was a customs union. The old  Constitution was restored, and Franz Joseph I was crowned as [[King of ]]. The era witnessed impressive economic development. The formerly backward  economy became relatively modern and industrialised by the turn of the 20th century, although agriculture remained dominant until 1890. In 1873, the old capital Buda and [[Óbuda]] were officially united with [[Pest, |Pest]], creating the new metropolis of Budapest. Many of the state institutions and the modern administrative system of  were established during this period.

[[File:- map.svg|thumb|The [[Lands of the Crown of  Stephen]] consisted of the territories of the [[Kingdom of ]] (16) and the [[Kingdom of -Slavonia]] (17)]]

After the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in Sarajevo, Prime Minister [[István Tisza]] and his cabinet tried to avoid the outbreak and escalating of a war in Europe, but their diplomatic efforts were unsuccessful. - drafted over 4&nbsp;million soldiers from the Kingdom of  on the side of , , and . The troops raised in the Kingdom of  spent little time defending the actual territory of , with the exceptions of the [[Brusilov offensive]] in June 1916 and a few months later when the  army made an attack into Transylvania,{{self-published inline|date=January 2021}} both of which were repelled. The [[Central Powers]] conquered .  declared war. The Central Powers conquered southern  and the  capital [[Bucharest]]. In 1916 Franz Joseph died, and the new monarch [[Charles I of |Charles IV]] sympathised with the pacifists. With great difficulty, the Central Powers stopped and repelled the attacks of the  Empire.

The [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] of the Allied ([[Allies of World War I|Entente]]) Powers completely collapsed. The Austro- Empire then withdrew from all defeated countries. Despite great success on the Eastern Front,  suffered complete defeat on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. By 1918, the economic situation had deteriorated (strikes in factories were organised by leftist and pacifist movements) and uprisings in the army had become common. In the capital cities, the  and  leftist liberal movements and their leaders supported the separatism of ethnic minorities. - signed a general armistice in [[Padua]] on 3 November 1918. In October 1918, 's union with  was dissolved.

=== Between the World Wars (1918–1941) ===
{{Main| between the World Wars| interwar economy|Treaty of Trianon}}{{More sources|subsection|date=April 2025}}[[File:Trianon consequences.png|left|thumb|With the 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon]],  lost 72% of its territory, its sea ports, and 3,425,000 ethnic .{{legend|#cd3318|Majority  areas (according to the 1910 census) detached from }}]]

Following the First World War,  underwent a period of profound political upheaval, beginning with the [[Aster Revolution]] in 1918, which brought the social-democratic [[Mihály Károlyi]] to power as prime minister. The [[Royal  Honvéd| Royal Honvéd army]] still had more than 1,400,000 soldiers when Károlyi was installed. Károlyi yielded to U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s demand for [[pacifism]] by ordering the disarmament of the  army. Disarmament meant that  was to remain without a national defence at a time of particular vulnerability. During the rule of Károlyi's pacifist cabinet,  lost control over approximately 75% of its pre-war territories ({{Convert|325411|km2|sqmi}}) without a fight and was subject to foreign occupation. The [[Little Entente]], sensing an opportunity, invaded the country from three sides—[[- War| invaded Transylvania]],  annexed [[Upper ]] (today's ), and a joint [[Kingdom of |Serb]]-[[ Army|]] coalition annexed [[Vojvodina]] and other southern regions. In March 1919, communists led by [[Béla Kun]] ousted the Károlyi government and proclaimed the [[ Soviet Republic]] (''Tanácsköztársaság''), followed by a thorough [[Red Terror ()|Red Terror]] campaign. Despite some successes on the Czechoslovak front, Kun's forces were ultimately unable to resist the  invasion; by August 1919,  troops occupied Budapest and ousted Kun.

[[File:Portraits de Miklós Horthy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Miklós Horthy]], Regent of the Kingdom of  (1920–1944)]]

In November 1919, rightist forces led by former Austro- admiral [[Miklós Horthy]] entered Budapest; exhausted by the war and its aftermath, the populace accepted Horthy's leadership. In January 1920, parliamentary elections were held, and Horthy was proclaimed regent of the reestablished [[Kingdom of  (1920–1946)|Kingdom of ]], inaugurating the so-called "Horthy era" (''Horthy-kor''). The new government worked quickly to normalise foreign relations while turning a blind eye to a [[White Terror ()|White Terror]] that swept through the countryside; extrajudicial killings of suspected communists and Jews lasted well into 1920.

On 4 June 1920, the [[Treaty of Trianon]] established new borders for . The country lost 71% of its territory and 66% of its pre-war population, as well as many sources of raw materials and its sole port at [[Rijeka|Fiume]]. An estimated 3.3 million [[ diaspora|ethnic  were living in the ceded territories]], mostly in what is now [[]], [[]] and [[]], although modern sources for this figure range from 2 million to 5 million. Though the revision of the treaty quickly rose to the top of the national political agenda, the Horthy government was not willing to resort to military intervention to do so.

The initial years of the Horthy regime were preoccupied with putsch attempts by [[Charles IV of |Charles IV]], the Austro- [[pretender]]; continued suppression of communists; and a migration crisis triggered by the Trianon territorial changes. The government's actions continued to drift right with the passage of [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] laws and, because of the continued isolation of the Little Entente, economic and then political gravitation towards [[Kingdom of #Fascist regime (1922–1943)|]] and [[Nazi |]]. The [[Great Depression]] further exacerbated the situation, and the popularity of fascist politicians increased, such as [[Gyula Gömbös]] and [[Ferenc Szálasi]], promising economic and social recovery. Horthy's nationalist agenda reached its apogee in 1938 and 1940, when the Nazis rewarded 's staunchly pro- foreign policy in the [[First Vienna Award|First]] and [[Second Vienna Award]]s, peacefully restoring ethnic--majority areas lost after Trianon. In 1939,  regained further territory from  [[– War|through force]].  [[Tripartite Pact|formally joined]] the [[Axis powers]] on 20 November 1940 and in 1941 participated in the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], gaining some of its former territories in the south.

 formally entered World War II as an Axis power on 26 June 1941, declaring war on the Soviet Union after unidentified planes bombed [[Košice|Kassa]], [[Munkacheve|Munkács]], and [[Rakhiv|Rahó]].  troops fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] for two years. Despite early success at the [[Battle of Uman]], the government began seeking a secret peace pact with [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] after the [[Second Army ()|Second Army]] suffered catastrophic losses [[Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh offensive|at the River Don]] in January 1943. Learning of the planned defection,  troops [[Operation Margarethe|occupied ]] on 19 March 1944 to guarantee Horthy's compliance.

In October, as the Soviet front approached, and the government made further efforts to disengage from the war,  troops ousted Horthy and installed a puppet government under Szálasi's fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]]. Szálasi pledged all the country's capabilities in service of the  war machine. By October 1944, the Soviets had reached the river Tisza, and despite [[Battle of Debrecen|some losses]], succeeded in encircling and [[Siege of Budapest|besieging Budapest]] in December.

On 13 February 1945, Budapest surrendered; by April,  troops left the country under Soviet military occupation. 200,000  were expelled from  in exchange for 70,000  living in . 202,000 ethnic  were expelled to , and through the 1947 [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaties]],  was again reduced to its immediate post-Trianon borders.

The war left  devastated, destroying over 60% of the economy and causing significant [[World War II casualties#endnote |loss of life]]. In addition to the over 600,000  Jews killed, as many as 280,000 other  were raped, murdered and executed or deported for slave labour. After  occupation,  participated in [[the Holocaust]], deporting nearly 440,000 Jews, mainly to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]; nearly all of them were murdered. The Horthy government's complicity in the Holocaust remains a point of controversy and contention.

Following the defeat of Nazi ,  became a [[satellite state]] of the Soviet Union. The Soviet leadership selected [[Mátyás Rákosi]] to front the [[Stalinism|Stalinisation]] of the country, and Rákosi ''[[de facto]]'' ruled  from 1949 to 1956. His government's policies of militarisation, industrialisation, collectivisation, and war compensation led to a severe decline in living standards. In imitation of Stalin's [[KGB]], the Rákosi government established a secret political police, the [[State Protection Authority|ÁVH]], to enforce the regime; approximately 350,000 officials and intellectuals were imprisoned or executed from 1948 to 1956. Many freethinkers, democrats, and Horthy-era dignitaries were secretly arrested and extrajudicially interned in domestic and foreign [[gulag]]s. Some 600,000  were deported to Soviet labour camps, where at least 200,000 died.{{Better source needed|date=November 2025}}

After Stalin's death in 1953, the Soviet Union pursued a programme of [[De-Stalinization|de-Stalinisation]] that was inimical to Rákosi, leading to his deposition. The following political cooling saw the ascent of [[Imre Nagy]] to the premiership. Nagy promised market liberalisation and political openness. Rákosi eventually managed to discredit Nagy and replace him with the more hard-line [[Ernő Gerő]].  joined the [[Warsaw Pact]] in May 1955, as societal dissatisfaction with the regime swelled. Following the firing on peaceful demonstrations by Soviet soldiers and secret police, and rallies throughout the country on 23 October 1956, protesters took to the streets in Budapest, initiating the [[ Revolution of 1956|1956 Revolution]].

In an effort to quell the chaos, Nagy returned as premier, promised free elections, and took  out of the Warsaw Pact. The violence nonetheless continued as revolutionary militias sprung up against the Soviet Army and the ÁVH; the roughly 3,000-strong resistance fought Soviet tanks using [[Molotov cocktail]]s and machine-pistols. Though the preponderance of the Soviets was immense, they suffered heavy losses, and by 30 October 1956, most Soviet troops had withdrawn from Budapest to garrison the countryside. For a time, the Soviet leadership was unsure how to respond but eventually decided to intervene to prevent a destabilisation of the Soviet bloc. On 4 November, reinforcements of more than 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks entered the country from the Soviet Union. Nearly 20,000  were killed resisting the intervention, while an additional 21,600 were imprisoned afterward for political reasons. Some 13,000 were interned and 230 brought to trial and executed. Nagy was secretly tried, found guilty, sentenced to death, and executed by hanging in June 1958. Because borders were briefly opened, nearly a quarter of a million people fled the country by the time the revolution was suppressed.

After a second, briefer period of Soviet military occupation, [[János Kádár]], Nagy's former minister of state, was chosen by the Soviet leadership to head the new government and chair the new ruling [[ Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]]. Kádár quickly normalised the situation. In 1963, the government granted a general amnesty. Kádár proclaimed a new policy line, according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the socialist regime as a fact of life. Kádár introduced new planning priorities in the economy, such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system (''háztáji gazdálkodás''). The living standard rose as consumer goods and food production took precedence over military production, which was reduced to one-tenth of prerevolutionary levels.

In 1968, the [[New Economic Mechanism]] introduced free-market elements into the socialist command economy. From the 1960s through the late 1980s,  was often referred to as "the happiest barrack" within the Eastern bloc. During the latter part of the Cold War 's [[Lists of countries by GDP per capita|GDP per capita]] was fourth only to [[East ]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|]], and the Soviet Union. As a result of this relatively high [[standard of living]], a more liberalised economy, a less censored press, and less restricted travel rights,  was generally considered one of the more liberal countries in which to live in Central Europe during communism. In 1980,  sent a [[Cosmonaut]] into space as part of the [[Interkosmos]]. The first  astronaut was [[Bertalan Farkas]].  became [[Timeline of space travel by nationality|the seventh nation to be represented in space]] by him. In the 1980s, however, living standards steeply declined again because of [[Early 1980s recession|a worldwide recession]] to which communism was unable to respond. By the time Kádár died in 1989, the Soviet Union was in steep decline and a younger generation of reformists saw liberalisation as the solution to economic and social issues.

's transition from communism to capitalism (''rendszerváltás'', "regime change") was peaceful and prompted by economic stagnation, domestic political pressure, and changing relations with other Warsaw Pact countries. Although the [[ Socialist Workers' Party]] began [[ Round Table Talks|Round Table Talks]] with various opposition groups in March 1989, the reburial of Imre Nagy as a revolutionary martyr that June is widely considered the symbolic end of communism in . Free elections were held [[1990  parliamentary election|in May 1990]], and the [[ Democratic Forum]], a major conservative opposition group, was elected to the head of a coalition government. [[József Antall]] became the first democratically elected prime minister since World War II.

With the removal of state subsidies and rapid privatisation in 1991,  was affected by a severe economic recession. The Antall government's austerity measures proved unpopular, and the Communist Party's legal and political heir, the [[ Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], won the subsequent [[1994  parliamentary election|1994 elections]]. This abrupt shift in the political landscape was repeated in [[1998  parliamentary election|1998]] and [[2002  parliamentary election|2002]]; in each electoral cycle, the governing party was ousted and the erstwhile opposition elected. Like most other post-communist European states, however,  broadly pursued an [[European integration|integrationist]] agenda, [[Enlargement of NATO|joining NATO]] in 1999 and the European Union [[2003  European Union membership referendum|in 2004]]. As a NATO member,  was involved in the [[Yugoslav Wars]].

[[File:Police car at - border barrier.jpg|thumb|Police car at - border barrier]]In 2006, [[2006 protests in |major nationwide protests]] erupted after it was revealed that Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]] had claimed in [[Őszöd speech|a closed-door speech]] that his party "lied" to win the [[2006  parliamentary election|recent elections]]. The popularity of left-wing parties plummeted in the ensuing political upheaval, and in 2010, [[Viktor Orbán]]'s national-conservative [[Fidesz]] party was [[2010  parliamentary election|elected]] to a parliamentary [[supermajority]]. The legislature consequently approved a [[Constitution of |new constitution]], among other sweeping governmental and legal changes. Fidesz has won supermajorities in [[2014  parliamentary election|every]] [[2018  parliamentary election|subsequent]] [[2022  parliamentary election|election]].

Since Orbán's election in 2010,  has undergone [[democratic backsliding]]. It has been characterised as an [[illiberal democracy]],{{rp|95}} [[hybrid regime]], [[kleptocracy]], [[dominant-party system]], and [[mafia state]]. Orbán has publicly embraced illiberalism,{{Rp|page=9}} characterising  as an "illiberal Christian democracy". As a result of these developments, 's relationship with the [[]] and the [[European Union]] have entered a period of protracted strain. Various EU bodies and member states have moved to penalize  or curtail its EU voting rights. Past and ongoing areas of conflict include [[LGBT rights in |LGBT rights]], migration, the ''[[lex CEU]],'' 's decision to authorise [[Sputnik vaccine|]] and [[CoronaVac| vaccines]] during the [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]], and [[International sanctions during the  invasion of |international sanctions against ]]. The Orbán government has simultaneously come under increased international scrutiny over [[rule of law]] concerns.  has and continues to dispute these allegations.
