The [[Nilotic]] people of —the [[Dinka people|Dinka]], [[Anuak people|Anyuak]], [[Bari people|Bari]], [[Acholi people|Acholi]], [[Nuer people|Nuer]], [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]], [[Kaligi people|Kaligi]] (Arabic Feroghe), and others—first entered  sometime before the tenth century, coinciding with the fall of [[medieval ]]. From the 15th to the 19th century, tribal migrations, largely from the area of [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of )|Bahr el Ghazal]], brought the Anyuak, Dinka, Nuer, and Shilluk to their modern locations in Bahr El Ghazal and the Upper Nile Region, while the Acholi and Bari settled in [[Equatoria]]. The [[Zande people|Zande]], [[Mundu people|Mundu]], [[Avukaya]] and [[Baka people ( and )|Baka]], who entered  in the 16th century, established the region's largest state of Equatoria Region.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

Of 's ethnic, groups the Dinka are the largest, the Nuer the second-largest, the Zande the third-largest, and the Bari the fourth-largest. They are found in the [[Maridi]], [[Yambio]], and Tombura districts in the [[tropical rainforest]] belt of [[Western Equatoria]], the Adio of Azande client in [[Yei]], [[Central Equatoria]], and [[Western Bahr el Ghazal]]. In the 18th century, the Avungara [[Sib (anthropology)|sib]] rose to power over the rest of Azande society, a domination that continued into the 20th century.  policies favouring Christian missionaries, such as the Closed District Ordinance of 1922 (see [[History of Anglo- ]]), and geographical barriers such as the swamplands along the [[White Nile]] curtailed the spread of Islam to the south, thus allowing the southern tribes to retain much of their political and religious institutions.

 colonial policy in  had a long history of emphasising the development of the Arabised north and largely ignoring the non-Arabised south, which lacked schools, hospitals, roads, bridges, and other basic infrastructure. After 's first independent elections in 1958, the continued neglect of the southern region by the [[Khartoum]] government led to uprisings, revolts, and the longest civil war on the continent. People affected by the violence included the Dinka, Nuer, Shilluk, Anyuak, [[Murle people|Murle]], Bari, [[Mundari people|Mundari]], Baka, [[Balanda Bviri]], [[Boya people|Boya]], [[Didinga]], [[Jiye people|Jiye]], [[Kakwa people|Kakwa]], Kaligi, [[Kuku people|Kuku]], [[Lotuka]], Nilotic, [[Toposa people|Toposa]], and Zande.

The Azande/Zande have had good relations with their neighbours, namely the [[Moru people|Moru]], Mundu, [[Pojulu people|Pöjulu]], Avukaya, Baka, and the small groups in Bahr el Ghazal, due to the expansionist policy of their king [[Gbudwe]], in the 18th century. In the 19th century, the Azande fought the , the [[|]] and the [[Muhammad Ahmed|Mahdists]] to maintain their independence. [[Ottoman ]], under the rule of [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail Pasha]], first attempted to control the region in the 1870s, establishing the province of [[Equatoria]] in the southern portion. 's first appointed governor was [[Samuel Baker]], commissioned in 1869, followed by [[Charles George Gordon]] in 1874, and by [[Emin Pasha]] in 1878.

The [[Muhammad Ahmed|Mahdist Revolt]] of the 1880s destabilised the nascent province, and Equatoria ceased to exist as an  outpost in 1889. Important settlements in Equatoria included [[Lado District|Lado]], [[Gondokoro]], [[Dufile]], and [[Wadelai]]. European colonial manoeuvrings in the region came to a head in 1898, when the [[Fashoda Incident]] occurred at present-day [[Kodok]]; Britain and  almost went to war over the region. Britain then treated  as a distinct entity with a different stage of development than the North. This policy was legalised in 1930 by the announcement of the Southern Policy. In 1946, without consulting Southern opinion, the  administration reversed its Southern Policy and began instead to implement a policy of uniting the North and the South.

The region has been negatively affected [[ wars of independence|by two civil wars]] since  independence: from 1955 to 1972, the  government fought the [[Anyanya]] rebel army (Anya-Nya is a term in the [[Madi language ( and )|Madi]] language which means "snake venom") during the [[First  Civil War]], followed by the [[ People's Liberation Army/Movement]] (SPLA/M) in the [[Second  Civil War]] for over twenty years, from 1983 to 2005. As a result, the country suffered serious neglect, a lack of infrastructure development, and major destruction and displacement. More than 2.5 million people have been killed, and millions more have become [[refugee]]s both within and outside the country.

 has an estimated population of 12.7 million people in 2024, but, given the lack of a census in several decades, this estimate may be severely distorted. The economy is predominantly rural and relies chiefly on [[subsistence farming]]. Around 2005, the economy began a transition from this rural dominance, and urban areas within  have seen extensive development.

===Independence (2011)===
[[File:A  girl at independence festivities (5926735716).jpg|thumb|upright|A  girl at independence festivities]]

Between 9 and 15 January 2011, as a consequence of the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]], the [[2011  independence referendum| independence referendum]] was held to determine whether  should become an independent country, separate from . Following that, 98.83% of those who took part in the referendum voted for separation or independence. And on 23 January 2011, members of a steering committee on post-independence governing told reporters that upon independence the land would be named the Republic of  "out of familiarity and convenience". Other names that had been considered were [[Azania]], Nile Republic, [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] Republic and even Juwama, a [[portmanteau]] for [[Juba (Southern )|Juba]], [[Wau, |Wau]] and [[Malakal]], three major cities.  formally became independent from  on 9 July, although certain disputes still remained, including the division of oil revenues, as 75% of all the former 's oil reserves are in . As of March 2025, the region of [[Abyei]] still remains disputed. A separate referendum was to be held in Abyei on whether they want to join  or ; however an official referendum was never held. The [[South Kordofan conflict]] broke out in June 2011 between the [[ People's Armed Forces|Army of ]] and the SPLA over the [[Nuba Mountains]].

On 9 July 2011,  became the 54th independent country in Africa (9 July is now celebrated as [[List of national independence days|Independence Day]], a national holiday) and since 14 July 2011,  is the 193rd member of the [[United Nations]]. On 27 July 2011,  became the 54th country to join the [[African Union]]. In September 2011, [[Google Maps]] recognised  as an independent country, after a massive crowdsourcing mapping initiative was launched.

In 2011 it was reported that  was at war with at least seven armed groups in 9 of its 10 states, with tens of thousands displaced. The fighters accuse the government of plotting to stay in power indefinitely, not fairly representing and supporting all tribal groups while neglecting development in rural areas. The [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA) also operates in a wide area that includes .

Inter-ethnic warfare in some cases predates the war of independence and is widespread. In December 2011, [[Ethnic violence in #Murle-Nuer fighting|tribal clashes]] intensified between the [[Nuer White Army]] of the [[Luo peoples|Lou]] [[Nuer people|Nuer]] and the [[Murle people|Murle]]. The White Army warned it would wipe out the Murle and would also fight  and [[United Nations Mission in |UN forces]] sent to the area around [[Pibor]].

In March 2012,  forces seized the [[Heglig]] oil fields in lands claimed by both  and  in the province of [[South Kordofan]] after [[2012 – border conflict|conflict with  forces]] in the  state of [[Unity (state)|Unity]].  withdrew on 20 March, and the  Army entered Heglig two days later.

On 5 September 2013, an article written by analyst Duop Chak Wuol was published by the US-based  News Agency (SSNA). The writer raised critical questions surrounding what he described as the rise of autocracy within the top leadership of the  People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) and warned of monumental repercussions unless the ruling elites restored the founding principles of the party. Duop also berated the ruling party, arguing that the party has replaced its founding principles with "forgotten promises and deceptions". In December 2013, a political power struggle broke out between President Kiir and his former deputy [[Riek Machar]], as the president accused Machar and ten others of attempting a [[2013  coup d'état attempt|coup d'état]]. Fighting broke out, igniting the [[ Civil War]].  troops were deployed to fight alongside  government forces against the rebels. The United Nations has peacekeepers in the country as part of the [[United Nations Mission in ]] (UNMISS). Numerous ceasefires were mediated by the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]] (IGAD) between the  People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) and [[SPLM-IO|SPLM – in opposition]] and were subsequently broken. A peace agreement was signed in  under threat of United Nations sanctions for both sides in August 2015. Machar returned to Juba in 2016 and was appointed vice-president. Following a second break-out of violence in Juba, Machar was replaced as vice-president and he fled the country as the conflict erupted again. Rebel in-fighting has become a major part of the conflict. Rivalry among Dinka factions led by the President and Malong Awan has also led to fighting. In August 2018, another power-sharing agreement came into effect.

About 400,000 people are estimated to have been killed in the war, including notable atrocities such as the [[2014 Bentiu massacre]]. Although both men have supporters from across 's ethnic divides, subsequent fighting has been communal, with rebels targeting members of Kiir's Dinka ethnic group and government soldiers attacking Nuers. More than 4 million people have been displaced, with about 1.8 million of those internally displaced, and about 2.5 million having fled to neighbouring countries, especially  and .

On 20 February 2020, [[Salva Kiir Mayardit]] and [[Riek Machar]] agreed to a peace deal; further, a [[Cabinet of |national unity government]] on 22 February 2020, as Machar was sworn in as the [[Vice President of |First Vice-President]] of the country.

Despite the official cessation of the civil war, violence between armed militia groups at the community level has continued in the country; according to [[Yasmin Sooka]], Chair of the Commission of Human Rights in , the level of violence "far exceeds the violence between 2013 and 2019".

=== Admission into the EAC and planned democratic elections (2016–present) ===
 acceded to the Treaty of the [[East African Community|East Africa Community]] on 15 April 2016 and became a full member on 15 August 2016. , [[|Democratic Republic of ]] and [[Federal Republic of ]] are the newest members of the [[East African Community]].

The [[2024  general election|first democratic elections in  since the start of the civil war]] were scheduled for 2023 by the peace agreement that ended the war officially, but the transitional government and opposition agreed in 2022 to move them to late 2024 instead. In September 2024, Kiir's office announced that the elections would be postponed an additional two years, to December 2026.

=== 2017 famine ===
{{Further|2017  famine}}
On 20 February 2017,  and the United Nations declared a [[famine]] in parts of former [[Unity State]], with the warning that it could spread rapidly without further action. Over 100,000 people were affected. The [[UN World Food Programme]] said that 40% of the population of , 4.9 million people, need food urgently. U.N. officials said that President [[Salva Kiir Mayardit]] was blocking food deliveries to some areas. Furthermore, UNICEF warned that more than 1 million children in  were subjected to malnutrition.

An outbreak of [[fall armyworm]] further threatened [[sorghum]] and maize production by July 2017.

===2025 tensions===
In early March, [[2025 Nasir clashes|clashes]] between the Army and the rebel [[Nuer White Army]] in the town of [[Nasir, |Nasir]] left dozens dead. On 26 March 2025, Vice-President Riek Machar was arrested on orders of President Salva Kiir claiming he had instigated and supported the White Army, despite the White Army denying any ties. The arrest was met by a response from the [[SPLM-IO]] stating such an act violates the ceasefire that ended the  civil war in 2020. Machar's arrest was accompanied by the mass sacking of his supporters, and the arrival of a unit from the [[ armed forces]] invited into the country by Kiir to help fight against the White Army.

UN Secretary-General [[Antonio Guterres]] stated that the "peace agreement is in shambles" and  is on "the edge of a collapse into civil war" while the [[African Union]] has sent a delegation to try to deescalate the conflict.
