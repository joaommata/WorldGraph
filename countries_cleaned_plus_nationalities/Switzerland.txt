The state of  took its present form with the adoption of the [[ Federal Constitution]] in 1848. 's precursors established a defensive alliance in 1291, forming a loose [[confederation]] that persisted for centuries.

=== Beginnings ===
{{Main|Early history of | in the Roman era}}

The oldest traces of hominid existence in  date to about 150,000 years ago. The oldest known farming settlements in , which were found at [[Gächlingen]], date to around 5300 BC.

[[File:Theater Kaiseraugst.jpg|thumb|Founded in 44 BC by [[Lucius Munatius Plancus]], [[Augusta Raurica]] (near Basel) was the first Roman settlement on the Rhine and is now among the most important archaeological sites in .]]

The earliest known tribes formed the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and [[La Tène culture]]s, named after the archaeological site of La Tène on the north side of [[Lake Neuchâtel]]. La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late [[Iron Age]] from around 450 BC, possibly influenced by [[Ancient |]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] civilisations. One of the most prominent La Tène tribes were the [[Helvetii]], who primarily occupied the [[ Plateau]], alongside the [[Rhaetians]] in the eastern regions. Facing pressures from Germanic tribes, in 58 BC, the Helvetii, influenced by [[Orgetorix]], a wealthy aristocrat, decided to abandon the  Plateau for better opportunities in western Gallia. After Orgetorix's mysterious death, the tribe continued their migration but was decisively defeated by Julius Caesar's armies at the [[Battle of Bibracte]], in present-day eastern . Following their defeat, the Helvetii were forced by Caesar to return to their original lands, where they were subjected to stringent restrictions on their autonomy and movements. In 15 BC, [[Tiberius]] (later the second Roman emperor) and his brother [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] conquered the Alps, integrating them into the [[Roman Empire]]. The area occupied by the Helvetii first became part of Rome's [[Gallia Belgica]] province and then of its [[Germania Superior]] province. The eastern portion of modern  was integrated into the [[Roman province]] of [[Raetia]]. Sometime around the start of the [[Common Era]], the Romans maintained a large camp called [[Vindonissa]], now a ruin at the confluence of the [[Aare]] and [[Reuss (river)|Reuss]] rivers, near the town of [[Windisch, |Windisch]].

The first and second century AD was an age of prosperity on the  Plateau. Towns such as [[Aventicum]], [[Iulia Equestris]] and [[Augusta Raurica]] reached a remarkable size, while hundreds of agricultural estates ([[Villae rusticae]]) were established in the countryside.

Around 260 AD, the fall of the [[Agri Decumates]] territory north of the [[Rhine]] transformed today's  into a frontier land of the Empire. Repeated raids by the [[Alamanni]] tribes provoked the ruin of the Roman towns and economy, forcing the population to shelter near Roman fortresses, like the [[Castrum Rauracense]] near Augusta Raurica. The Empire built another line of defence at the north border (the so-called Donau-Iller-Rhine-Limes). At the end of the fourth century, the increased Germanic pressure forced the Romans to abandon the linear defence concept. The  Plateau was finally open to [[Germanic tribes]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], from the end of the fourth century, the western extent of modern-day  was part of the territory of the [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Kings of the Burgundians]], who introduced the  language to the area. The [[Alemanni]] settled the  Plateau in the fifth century and the [[valleys of the Alps]] in the eighth century, forming [[Alemannia]]. Modern-day  was then divided between the kingdoms of Alemannia and [[Burgundy]]. The entire region became part of the expanding [[Frankish Empire]] in the sixth century, following [[Clovis I]]'s victory over the Alemanni at [[Tolbiac]] in 504 AD, and later Frankish domination of the Burgundians.

Throughout the rest of the sixth, seventh and eighth centuries,  regions continued under Frankish hegemony ([[Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] dynasties) but after its extension under [[Charlemagne]], the [[Frankish Empire]] was divided by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843. The territories of present-day  became divided into [[Middle Francia]] and [[East Francia]] until they were reunified under the [[Holy Roman Empire]] around 1000&nbsp;AD.

In the 10th century, as the rule of the Carolingians waned, [[Magyars]] destroyed [[Basel]] in 917 and [[St. Gallen]] in 926. In response, [[Henry the Fowler]], the then ruler of East Francia, decreed the fortification of key settlements to defend against these invasions. Large villages and towns, including strategic locations like Zurich and St.Gallen, were fortified. This initiative led to the development of what were essentially early urban strongholds and city governments in Eastern .

By 1200, the  Plateau comprised the dominions of the houses of [[House of Savoy|Savoy]], [[Zähringer]], [[Habsburg]], and [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]]. Some regions ([[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]], later known as {{lang|de|[[Waldstätte]]n}}) were accorded the [[Imperial immediacy]] to grant the empire direct control over the mountain passes. With the extinction of its male line in 1263, the Kyburg dynasty fell in AD 1264. The Habsburgs under [[Rudolph I of |King Rudolph I]] (Holy Roman Emperor in 1273) laid claim to the Kyburg lands and annexed them, extending their territory to the eastern  Plateau.

=== Old  Confederacy ===

{{Main|Old  Confederacy}}

[[File:Bundesbrief.jpg|thumb|right|The 1291 ''Bundesbrief'' (federal charter)]]

The Old  Confederacy was an alliance among the valley communities of the central Alps. The Confederacy was governed by [[ nobility|nobles]] and [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patricians]] of various cantons who facilitated management of common interests and ensured peace on mountain trade routes. The [[Federal Charter of 1291]] is considered the confederacy's founding document, even though similar alliances likely existed decades earlier. The document was agreed among the [[Medieval commune|rural communes]] of [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], and [[Unterwalden]].{{Page needed|date=April 2023}}

By 1353, the three original [[Cantons of |cantons]] had joined with the cantons of [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]] and [[Canton of Zug|Zug]] and the [[Lucerne]], [[Zurich]] and [[Bern]] city-states to form the "Old Confederacy" of eight states that obtained through the end of the 15th century. The expansion led to increased power and wealth for the confederation. By 1460, the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the Rhine to the Alps and the [[Jura mountains]], and the [[University of Basel]] was founded (with a faculty of medicine) establishing a tradition of chemical and medical research. This increased after victories against the Habsburgs ([[Battle of Sempach]], [[Battle of Näfels]]), over [[Charles the Bold]] of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] during the 1470s, and the success of the [[ mercenaries]]. The  victory in the [[Swabian War]] against the [[Swabian League]] of [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in 1499 amounted to ''de facto'' independence within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1501, Basel and Schaffhausen joined the Old  Confederacy.

The Confederacy acquired a reputation of invincibility during these earlier wars, but [[Growth of the Old  Confederacy|expansion of the confederation]] suffered a setback in 1515 with the  defeat in the [[Battle of Marignano]]. This ended the so-called "heroic" epoch of  history. The success of [[Zwingli]]'s [[Reformation in |Reformation]] in some cantons led to inter-cantonal religious conflicts in 1529 and 1531 ([[Wars of Kappel]]). It was not until more than one hundred years after these internal wars that, in 1648, under the [[Peace of Westphalia]], European countries recognised 's independence from the Holy Roman Empire and its [[neutral country|neutrality]].

During the [[Early Modern |Early Modern]] period of  history, the growing authoritarianism of the patriciate families combined with a financial crisis in the wake of the [[Thirty Years' War]] led to the [[ peasant war of 1653]]. In the background to this struggle, the conflict between [[Roman Catholicism in |Catholic]] and [[Protestantism in |Protestant]] cantons persisted, erupting in further violence at the [[First War of Villmergen]], in 1656, and the [[Toggenburg War]] (or Second War of Villmergen), in 1712.

=== Napoleonic era ===
{{Main| in the Napoleonic era|Helvetic Republic|Act of Mediation}}

[[File:Acte de Médiation mg 0643.jpg|thumb|The Act of Mediation was Napoleon's attempt at a compromise between the [[Ancien Régime]] and a Republic.]]
In 1798, the [[ Revolution|revolutionary ]] government invaded  and imposed a new unified constitution. This centralised the government of the country, effectively abolishing the cantons: moreover, [[Mülhausen]] left  and the [[Valtellina]] valley became part of the [[Cisalpine Republic]]. The new regime, known as the Helvetic Republic, was highly unpopular. An invading foreign army had imposed and destroyed centuries of tradition, making  nothing more than a  [[satellite state]]. The fierce  suppression of the [[Nidwalden]] Revolt in September 1798 was an example of the oppressive presence of the [[ Army]] and the local population's resistance to the occupation.

When war broke out between  and its rivals,  and [[Habsburg monarchy|]] forces invaded . The  refused to fight alongside the  in the name of the Helvetic Republic. In 1803 [[Napoleon]] organised a meeting of the leading  politicians from both sides in Paris. The [[Act of Mediation]] was the result, which largely restored  autonomy and introduced a Confederation of 19 cantons. Henceforth, much of  politics would concern balancing the cantons' tradition of self-rule with the need for a central government.

In 1815, the [[Congress of Vienna]] fully re-established  independence, and the European powers recognised permanent  neutrality.  troops served foreign governments until 1860 when they fought in the [[Siege of Gaeta (1860)|siege of Gaeta]]. The treaty allowed  to increase its territory, with the admission of the cantons of [[Valais]], [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]] and [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]]. 's borders saw only minor adjustments thereafter.

=== Federal state ===
{{Main|Restoration and Regeneration ()| as a federal state}}

[[File:Bern, Federal Palace, 1857.jpg|thumb|The first [[Federal Palace]] in Bern (1857). One of the three cantons presiding over the [[Tagsatzung]] (former legislative and executive council), Bern was chosen as the permanent seat of federal legislative and executive institutions in 1848, in part because of its closeness to the -speaking area.]]

The restoration of power to the patriciate was only temporary. After a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes, such as the [[Züriputsch]] of 1839, civil war (the ''[[Sonderbundskrieg]]'') broke out in 1847 when some Catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance (the ''Sonderbund''). The war lasted less than a month, causing fewer than 100 casualties, most of which were through [[friendly fire]]. The Sonderbundskrieg had a significant impact on the psychology and society of .{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}{{who|date=September 2022}}

The war convinced most  of the need for unity and strength.  from all strata of society, whether Catholic or Protestant, from the liberal or conservative current, realised that the cantons would profit more from merging their economic and religious interests.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Thus, while the rest of Europe saw [[revolutions of 1848|revolutionary uprisings]], the  drew up a constitution that provided for a [[ Federal Constitution|federal layout]], much of it inspired by the [[ Constitution| example]]. This constitution provided central authority while leaving the cantons the right to self-government on local issues. Giving credit to those who favoured the power of the cantons (the Sonderbund Kantone), the national assembly was divided between an [[upper house]] (the [[ Council of States|Council of States]], two representatives per canton) and a [[lower house]] (the [[National Council of |National Council]], with representatives elected from across the country). [[Referendum]]s were made mandatory for any amendments. This new constitution ended the legal power of [[ nobility#Current situation|nobility in ]].

[[File:Gotthard Eröffnungszug Bellinzona.jpg|thumb|left|Inauguration in 1882 of the [[Gotthard rail tunnel]] connecting the southern canton of Ticino, the longest in the world at the time]]
A single system of weights and measures was introduced, and in 1850 the [[ franc]] became the  [[single currency]], complemented by the WIR franc in 1934. Article 11 of the constitution forbade sending troops to serve abroad, marking the end of foreign service. It came with the expectation of serving the [[Holy See]], and the  were still obliged to serve [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies]] with  Guards present at the [[Siege of Gaeta (1860)|siege of Gaeta in 1860]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

An important clause of the constitution was that it could be entirely rewritten, if necessary, thus enabling it to evolve as a whole rather than being modified one amendment at a time.{{Page needed|date=April 2023}}

This need soon proved itself when the rise in population and the [[Industrial Revolution]] that followed led to calls to modify the constitution accordingly. The population rejected an early draft in 1872, but modifications led to its acceptance in 1874. It introduced the [[Referendum#|facultative referendum]] for laws at the federal level. It also established federal responsibility for defence, trade, and legal matters.

In 1891, the constitution was revised with uncommonly strong elements of [[direct democracy]], which remain unique today.

 was not invaded during either of the world wars. During [[World War I]],  was home to the revolutionary and founder of the [[Soviet Union]] Vladimir Illych Ulyanov ([[Vladimir Lenin]]) who remained there until 1917.  neutrality was seriously questioned by the short-lived [[Grimm–Hoffmann affair]] in 1917. In 1920,  joined the [[League of Nations]], which was based in [[Geneva]], after it was exempted from military requirements.

During [[World War II]], [[Operation Tannenbaum|detailed invasion plans]] were drawn up by the Germans, but  was never attacked.  was able to remain independent through a combination of military deterrence, concessions to , and good fortune, as larger events during the war intervened. General [[Henri Guisan]], appointed the [[General ()|commander-in-chief for the duration]] of the war, ordered a general mobilisation of the armed forces. The  military strategy changed from static defence at the borders to organised long-term attrition and withdrawal to strong, well-stockpiled positions high in the Alps, known as the [[National Redoubt ()|Reduit]].  was an important base for espionage by both sides and often mediated communications between the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] powers.

's trade was blockaded by both the Allies and the Axis. Economic cooperation with [[Nazi ]]; such as purchasing gold (enabling  to purchase foreign goods) and extension of credit varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion and the availability of other trading partners. Concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through [[Vichy ]] was severed in 1942, leaving  (together with [[]]) entirely isolated from the wider world by Axis-controlled territory. Over the course of the war,  interned over 300,000 refugees aided by the [[International Red Cross]], based in Geneva. Strict immigration and [[Right of asylum|asylum]] policies and the financial relationships with Nazi  became controversial by the end of the 20th century.{{rp|521}}

During the war, the  Air Force engaged aircraft of both sides, shooting down 11 intruding [[Luftwaffe]] planes in May and June 1940, then forcing down other intruders after a change of policy following threats from . Over 100 Allied bombers and their crews were interned. Between 1940 and 1945, [[Bombings of  in World War II| was bombed by the Allies]], causing fatalities and property damage. Among the cities and towns bombed were [[Basel]], [[Brusio]], [[Chiasso]], [[Cornol]], Geneva, [[Koblenz, |Koblenz]], [[Niederweningen]], [[Rafz]], [[Renens]], [[Samedan]], [[Schaffhausen]], [[Stein am Rhein]], [[Tägerwilen]], [[Thayngen]], [[Vals, |Vals]], and Zurich. Allied forces maintained that the bombings, which violated the 96th [[Article of War]], resulted from navigation errors, equipment failure, weather conditions, and pilot errors. The  expressed fear and concern that the bombings were intended to put pressure on  to end economic cooperation and neutrality with Nazi . Court-martial proceedings took place in England. The US paid SFR 62M for reparations.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

's attitude towards [[ during the World Wars#Refugees|refugees]] was complicated and controversial; over the course of the war, it admitted as many as 300,000 refugees while refusing tens of thousands more,{{rp|107}} including Jews persecuted by the Nazis.{{rp|114}}

After the war, the  government exported credits through the charitable fund known as the {{lang|de|Schweizerspende}} and donated to the [[Marshall Plan]] to help Europe's recovery, efforts that ultimately benefited the [[ economy]].{{rp|521}}

During the [[Cold War]],  authorities [[ and weapons of mass destruction|considered the construction]] of a  [[nuclear bomb]]. Leading nuclear physicists at the [[Federal Institute of Technology Zurich]] such as [[Paul Scherrer]] made this a realistic possibility. In 1988, the [[Paul Scherrer Institute]] was founded in his name to explore the therapeutic uses of [[neutron scattering]] technologies. Financial problems with the defence budget and ethical considerations prevented the substantial funds from being allocated, and the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] of 1968 was seen as a valid alternative. Plans for building nuclear weapons were dropped by 1988.  joined the [[Council of Europe]] in 1963.

 was the last Western republic (the [[Principality of ]] followed in 1984) to [[Women's suffrage in |grant women the right to vote]]. Some  cantons approved this in 1959, while at the federal level, it was achieved in 1971 and, after resistance, in the last canton [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] (one of only two remaining ''[[Landsgemeinde]]'', along with [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]]) in 1990. After obtaining suffrage at the federal level, women quickly rose in political significance. The first woman on the seven-member [[Federal Council ()|Federal Council]] executive was [[Elisabeth Kopp]], who served from 1984 to 1989, and the first female president was [[Ruth Dreifuss]] in 1999.

In 1979 areas from the canton of [[Bern]] attained independence from the Bernese, forming the new [[canton of Jura]]. On 18 April 1999, the  population and the cantons voted in favour of a completely revised [[ Federal Constitution|federal constitution]].

In 2002  became a full member of the United Nations, leaving [[Holy See| City]] as the last widely recognised state without full UN membership.  is a founding member of the [[EFTA]] but not the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA). An application for membership in the [[European Union]] was sent in May 1992, but did not advance since rejecting the EEA in December 1992 when  conducted a referendum on the EEA. Several referendums on the EU issue ensued; due to opposition from the citizens, the membership application was withdrawn. Nonetheless,  law is gradually changing to conform with that of the EU, and the government signed [[Bilateralism|bilateral agreements]] with the European Union. , together with , has been surrounded by the EU since 's entry in 1995. On 5 June 2005,  voters agreed by a 55% majority to join the [[Schengen treaty]], a result that EU commentators regarded as a sign of support. In September 2020, a referendum calling for a vote to end the pact that allowed a free movement of people from the [[European Union]] was introduced by the [[ People's Party]] (SVP). However, voters rejected the attempt to retake control of immigration, defeating the motion by a roughly 63%–37% margin.

On 9 February 2014, 50.3% of  voters approved a ballot [[Popular initiative ()|initiative]] launched by the  People's Party (SVP/UDC) to [[Federal popular initiative "Against mass immigration"|restrict immigration]]. This initiative was mostly backed by rural (57.6% approval) and suburban groups (51.2% approval), and isolated towns (51.3% approval) as well as by a strong majority (69.2% approval) in Ticino, while metropolitan centres (58.5% rejection) and the -speaking part (58.5% rejection) rejected it. In December 2016, a political compromise with the EU was attained that eliminated quotas on EU citizens, but still allowed favourable treatment of -based job applicants. On 27 September 2020, 62% of  voters rejected the anti-free movement referendum by SVP.
