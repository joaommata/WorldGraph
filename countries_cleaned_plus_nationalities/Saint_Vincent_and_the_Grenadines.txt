===Pre-colonial period===
[[Saint Vincent ()|Saint Vincent]] was first inhabited by the [[Ciboney]] people from [[South America]] around 5000 B.C. They were succeeded by the [[Arawak]]s around the 3rd century A.D., who were later displaced by the [[Kalinago]] in the 14th century. The Kalinago named the island Youloumain.

=== European arrival and early colonial period ===
It is thought that [[Christopher Columbus]] sighted the island in 1498, giving it the name St Vincent. The [[Kalinago]] people aggressively opposed European settlement on Saint Vincent.

===  and British colonisation and First Carib War ===

Various attempts by the  and  to claim the island proved unsuccessful, and it was the  who were first able to colonise the island, settling in the town of [[Barrouallie]] on the [[Windward and leeward|leeward]] side of St Vincent in 1719. The  imported Black slaves to work on plantations producing sugar, coffee, indigo, tobacco, cotton and cocoa.

The British captured the island and drove out the  from Barrouallie during the [[Seven Years' War]], a claim confirmed by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]]. On taking control of the island in 1763, the British laid the foundations of [[Fort Charlotte, Saint Vincent|Fort Charlotte]] and also continued the importation of slaves to work on the island's plantations. The [[Garifuna]], an Afro-Indigenous creole people on the island, were opposed to the British presence and entered into open conflict against the British, starting the [[First Carib War]], which lasted from 1772 to 1773.

During the [[Anglo- War (1778–1783)]], the  [[ capture of Saint Vincent|recaptured St Vincent]] in 1779. However, the British regained control under the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)]].

=== British colonial period and Second Carib War ===
{{Main|British Windward Islands}}
The uneasy peace between the British and the Garifuna led to the [[Second Carib War]], which lasted from 1795 to 1797. The Garifuna were led by paramount chief [[Joseph Chatoyer]] and supported by the , notably [[Victor Hugues]] who was based on the island of [[Martinique]]. They were eventually defeated in 1797 by British forces under the command Sir [[Ralph Abercromby]]; a peace treaty agreement was made which resulted in almost 5,000 Garifuna being deported to [[Roatán]], an island off the coast of [[]], and to [[]] and [[Baliceaux]] in the Grenadines.
 
In 1806, the construction of Fort Charlotte was completed.

The [[La Soufrière (volcano)|La Soufrière]] volcano erupted in 1812, resulting in considerable destruction.

The British [[abolitionism in the |abolished]] slavery in Saint Vincent (as well as in all other [[British West Indies]] colonies) in 1834, and an apprenticeship period followed which ended in 1838. After its end, labour shortages on the plantations resulted, and were initially addressed by the immigration of indentured servants; starting from 1845, many [[Catholic Church in | Catholic]] settlers arrived from [[Madeira]], with around 2,100 arrivals from [[]] recorded from 1845 to 1850. Between 1861 and 1888, a new wave of immigration occurred, with shiploads of [[Indo-Caribbeans| labourers]] arriving.

In 1902, the [[La Soufrière (volcano)|La Soufrière]] volcano erupted again, killing 1,500–2,000 people; much farmland was damaged, and the economy deteriorated.

 passed through various stages of colonial status under the British. A representative assembly was authorised in 1776, Crown Colony government was installed in 1877, a [[legislative council]] was created in 1925 with a limited franchise, and [[Universal suffrage|universal adult suffrage]] was granted in 1951. During the period of its control of , Britain made several attempts to unify the island with the other Windward Islands as a single entity, to simplify British control in the sub-region through a single unified administration. In the 1960s, the British again tried to unify all of its regional islands, including Saint Vincent, into a single politically unified entity under British control. The unification was to be called the [[West Indies Federation]] and was driven by a desire to gain independence from the British government. However, the attempt collapsed in 1962.

Saint Vincent was granted "associate statehood" status by Britain on 27 October 1969. This gave Saint Vincent complete control over its internal affairs but fell short of full independence in law.

In April 1979, [[La Soufrière (volcano)|La Soufrière]] erupted once more. Although no one was killed, thousands were evacuated and extensive agricultural damage occurred.

On 27 October 1979,  gained full independence; the date is now the country's [[List of national independence days|Independence Day]], a [[Public holidays in |public holiday]]. The country opted to remain within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], retaining the then-Queen [[Elizabeth II]] as [[Monarchy of |Monarch]], represented locally by a [[Governor-General of |Governor-General]].

===Post-independence era===

[[Milton Cato]] of the centre-left [[Saint Vincent Labour Party]] (SVLP) was the country's first Prime Minister (he had been Premier since 1974), ruling until his defeat in the [[1984 Vincentian general election]] by [[James Fitz-Allen Mitchell]] of the centre-right [[New Democratic Party ()|New Democratic Party]] (NDP). During Cato's time in office, there was a brief rebellion on [[Union Island]] in December 1979 led by Lennox 'Bumba' Charles. Inspired by the recent revolution on , Charles alleged neglect of the Union by the central government. However, the revolt was swiftly put down and Charles was arrested. There were also a series of strikes in the early 1980s. James Mitchell remained Prime Minister for 16 years until 2000, winning three consecutive [[Elections in |elections]]. Mitchell was at the forefront of attempts to improve regional integration. In [[Hurricane Allen|1980]] and 1987, hurricanes damaged many banana and coconut plantations. Hurricane seasons were also very active in 1998 and 1999, with [[Hurricane Lenny]] in 1999 causing extensive damage to the west coast of the island.

In 2000, [[Arnhim Eustace]] became Prime Minister after taking over the leadership of the NDP following Mitchell's retirement; he was [[2001 Vincentian general election|defeated]] a year later by [[Ralph Gonsalves]] of the [[Unity Labour Party]] (successor party to the SVLP). Gonsalves—a left-winger known in the country as "Comrade Ralph"—argued that European nations owe Caribbean nations [[Reparations for slavery|reparations]] for their role in the Atlantic slave trade. Gonsalves won a second term in 2005, a third in 2010, and a fourth in 2015.

In 2009, [[Vincentian constitutional referendum, 2009|a referendum was held on a proposal to adopt a new constitution]] that would make the country a [[republic]], replacing Queen [[Elizabeth II]] as head of state with a non-executive President, a proposal supported by Prime Minister Gonsalves. A two-thirds majority was required, but the referendum was defeated 29,019 votes (55.64 per cent) to 22,493 (43.13 per cent).

 was elected as a non-permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council]] 2020–21.

In November 2020, Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister of  since 2001, made history by securing the fifth consecutive victory of his [[Unity Labour Party]] (ULP) in general election.

In 2021, on 9 April, the [[2021 eruption of La Soufrière|La Soufrière]] volcano erupted, sending ash several miles into the atmosphere. Approximately 16,000 people were evacuated in the days leading up to the eruption.
