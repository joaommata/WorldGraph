's prehistory begins in the [[Allerød oscillation]], a warm period around 12,000 BC, with Late [[Palaeolithic]] [[reindeer]]-hunting camps of the [[Bromme culture]] at the edge of the ice in what is now the country's southernmost province, [[Scania]]. This period was characterised by small clans of [[hunter-gatherer]]s who relied on [[flint]] technology.

 and its people were first described by the Roman historian [[Publius Cornelius Tacitus]] in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' (98 AD). In [[s:Germania#XLIV|''Germania'' 44 and 45]] he mentions the Swedes (''Suiones'') as a powerful tribe with ships that had a [[prow]] at each end ([[longship]]s). Which kings ({{Lang|gem-x-proto|kuningaz}}) ruled these Suiones is unknown, but [[Norse mythology]] presents a long line of legendary and semi-legendary kings going back to the last centuries BC. The [[Runes|runic script]] was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the second century AD, but all that has survived from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke [[Proto-Norse]] at the time, a language ancestral to  and other [[North Germanic languages]].

In the sixth century, the Byzantine historian [[Jordanes]] names two tribes living in [[Scandza]], both of which are now considered to be synonymous with the Swedes: the {{Lang|la|Suetidi}} and {{Lang|la|Suehans}}. The {{Lang|la|Suehans}} were known to the Roman world as suppliers of black fox skins and, according to Jordanes, had very fine horses, similar to those of the ''[[Thuringians|Thyringi]]'' of {{Lang|la|Germania}} ("{{Lang|la|alia vero gens ibi moratur Suehans, quae velud Thyringi equis utuntur eximiis}}").

===Viking Age===

[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|upright=1.3|thumb|left|[[Viking]] expeditions (blue lines)]]

The  [[Viking Age]] lasted roughly from the eighth century to the 11th century. It is believed that  Vikings and [[Gutes|Gutar]] mainly travelled east and south, going to , , the [[Baltic countries]], , , , the [[Black Sea]] and even as far as [[Baghdad]]. Their routes passed [[The Trade Route from the Varangians to the Greeks|through the Dnieper]] south to [[Constantinople]], on which they carried out numerous raids. The [[Byzantine Emperor|Byzantine emperor]] [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] noticed their great skills in war and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard, known as the [[Varangian Guard]]. The  Vikings, called [[Rus (people)|Rus]], are believed to be the founders of [[Kievan Rus']]. The Vikings were described by many outside sources, such as the Arab traveler [[Ibn Fadlan]]. The actions of these [[Vikings| Vikings]] are commemorated on many [[runestone]]s in , such as the [[ runestones]] and the [[Varangian runestones]]. There was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards, which are commemorated on stones such as the [[England runestones]]. The last major  Viking expedition appears to have been the ill-fated expedition of [[Ingvar the Far-Travelled]] to [[Serkland]], the region south-east of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Its members are commemorated on the [[Ingvar runestones]], none of which mentions any survivor.

During the early stages of the Viking Age, a centre of trade in [[Northern Europe]] developed at [[Birka]] on the island of [[Björkö, Ekerö|Björkö]], not far from where Stockholm was later constructed, in mid-latitude . Birka was founded around 750 AD as a trading port by a king or merchants trying to control trade. Birka was the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] link in the [[Dnieper trade route]] through [[Staraya Ladoga|Ladoga]] (''Aldeigja'') and [[Novgorod Land|Novgorod]] (''Holmsgard'') to the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. It was abandoned around 975, at about the same time [[Sigtuna]] was founded as a town some 35&nbsp;km to the northeast. It has been estimated that the population in Viking Age Birka was between 500 and 1000 people. Archaeological finds indicate that Birka still was wealthy in the 9th and 10th centuries. Thousands of graves, coins, jewelry and other luxury items have been found there.

===Kingdom of ===
[[File:Map of  ca 1280.png|thumb|right|A rough map of the extent of  rule, {{circa|1280}}]]
The exact age of the kingdom of  is unknown. Determining its age depends mostly on whether  is considered a nation when the {{Lang|sv|[[Svear]]}} (Swedes) ruled Svealand or when the {{Lang|sv|Svear}} and the {{Lang|sv|[[Götar]]}} (Geats) of Götaland were united under a single ruler. Svealand was described by [[Tacitus]] in 98 AD as being under a single ruler, though it is unknown how long this had been the case. The epic poem ''Beowulf'' describes semi-legendary [[-Geatish wars]] in the sixth century.

However, historians typically start the line of [[ monarchs]] from when Svealand and Götaland were ruled under the same king, namely [[Erik the Victorious]] and his son [[Olof Skötkonung]] in the tenth century. These events are often described as the [[consolidation of ]], although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later. In this context, "Götaland" primarily refers to the provinces of [[Östergötland]] and [[Västergötland]]. [[Småland]] was of little interest at the time due to its deep pine forests, with only the city of [[Kalmar]] and its castle holding any significant importance. There were also  settlements along the southern coastline of [[Norrland]], one of the four [[lands of ]].

[[Ansgar|Saint Ansgar]] is traditionally credited with introducing Christianity to  in 829, but the new religion did not begin to fully replace [[paganism]] until the 12th century. During that century,  was undergoing dynastic struggles between the [[House of Eric|Erik]] and [[House of Sverker|Sverker]] clans. The conflict ended when a third clan married into the Erik clan, founding the [[House of Bjälbo|Bjälbo]] dynasty, which gradually consolidated  into a stronger state. According to the ''Legend of [[Saint Erik]]'' and the ''[[Erik's Chronicle]]'',  kings conducted [[ Crusades (disambiguation)|a series of Crusades]] to pagan  and started conflicts with the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']], who by then had no further connections with . As a result of the Crusades, mostly with the Second  Crusade led by [[Birger Jarl]]  gradually became part of the kingdom of  and the sphere of influence of the [[Catholic Church]]. The Swedes built fortresses in [[Häme|Tavastland]] and [[Åbo]], while a  royal council was instituted, an administrative structure and fiscal apparatus was created, and law codes were codified during the reigns of [[Magnus Ladulås]] (1275–1290) and [[Magnus Eriksson]] (1319–1364). As a result, the  lands were firmly integrated into the  realm.

Except for the provinces of Scania, Blekinge, and Halland in the southwest of the Scandinavian peninsula, which were part of the Kingdom of  during this period, [[feudalism]] never developed in  as it did in much of Europe. As a result, the peasantry remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of  history. [[Slavery]], also known as [[thrall]]dom, was not common in , and the institution gradually diminished due to the spread of Christianity, the difficulty of obtaining slaves from lands east of the Baltic Sea, and by the development of cities before the 16th century. Indeed, both slavery and [[serfdom]] were abolished altogether by a decree of King [[Magnus Eriksson]] in 1335.  remained a poor and economically underdeveloped country, where barter was the primary means of exchange.

In 1319,  and  were united in a [[personal union]] under King Magnus Eriksson, the grandson of King [[Magnus Ladulås]] of  and of King [[Haakon V of |Haakon V]] of . Magnus Eriksson also ruled Scania from 1332 to 1360. In the mid-14th century,  was struck by the [[Black Death]]. The population of  and most of Europe was decimated. The population did not reach its pre-1348 levels until the beginning of the 19th century, with one third of the population dying between 1349 and 1351. During this period, the cities began to acquire greater rights and were heavily influenced by  merchants of the [[Hanseatic League]], active especially at [[Visby]]. In 1397, Queen [[Margaret I of ]] (the former daughter-in-law of Magnus Eriksson) established the personal union of , , and  through the [[Kalmar Union]]. However, Margaret's successors, whose rule was centred in , were unable to control the  nobility.

[[File:Gustav Vasa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Gustav I of |Gustav I]] [[ War of Liberation|liberated]]  from [[Christian II of ]], ending the [[Kalmar Union]]. He established the [[House of Vasa]] which ruled  and  until the 17th century.]]

In 1520, King [[Christian II of ]], who attempted to restore the Union of Kalmar through military force, ordered the massacre of  nobles in Stockholm, an event known as the "[[Stockholm Bloodbath]]." This atrocity incited the  nobility to renew their resistance, and on 6 June 1523 (now celebrated as [[National Day of |'s National Day]]), they made [[Gustav Vasa]] their king. This is sometimes considered as the [[foundation of modern ]]. Shortly afterwards the new king rejected Catholicism and led  into the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The term {{Lang|sv|riksdag}} was used for the first time in the 1540s, although the first meeting where representatives of different social groups were called to discuss and determine affairs affecting the country as a whole took place as early as 1435, in the town of [[Arboga]]. During the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Riksdag assemblies]] of 1527 and 1544, under King Gustav Vasa, representatives of all four [[estates of the realm]] (clergy, [[ nobility|nobility]], [[Bourgeoisie|townsmen]] and [[peasant]]s) were called on to participate for the first time. The monarchy became hereditary in 1544. When Gustav Vasa broke the monopoly power of the [[Hanseatic League]], he was regarded as a hero by the  people. Furthermore, when  became more developed, after breaking the trade monopoly of the Hanseatic League, and entered its golden age, the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that a greater share of the economic benefits went to them rather than to a feudal landowning class.

The end of the 16th century was marked by a final phase of rivalry between the remaining Catholics and the new Protestant communities. In 1592, Gustav Vasa's Catholic grandson and [[king of ]], [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund]], ascended the  throne. He pursued to strengthen [[Holy See|Rome]]'s influence by initiating [[Counter-Reformation]] and created a dual monarchy that temporarily became known as the [[- Union]]. His despotic rule, strongly characterised by intolerance towards the Protestants, sparked a [[War against Sigismund|civil war]] that plunged  into poverty. In opposition, Sigismund's uncle and successor, [[Charles IX of |Charles Vasa]], summoned the [[Uppsala Synod]] in 1593 which officially confirmed the modern [[Church of ]] as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]. Following his [[deposition (politics)|deposition]] in 1599, Sigismund attempted to reclaim the throne sparing no expense, and hostilities between [[– Commonwealth|]] and  continued for the next hundred years.

In the middle of the 17th century,  was the third-largest country in Europe by land area.  reached its largest territorial extent under the rule of [[Charles X of |Charles X]] after the [[treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658, following Charles X's [[March Across the Belts|crossing of the  Belts]]. The foundation of 's success during this period is credited to Gustav I's major changes to the [[Economy of | economy]] in the 16th century, and his introduction of [[Protestantism]]. One-third of the  population died in the devastating [[Great Famine of 1695–1697]] that struck the country. Famine also hit , killing roughly 10% of 's population.

In the 17th century,  was engaged in many wars, for example with –, with both sides competing for territories of today's [[Baltic states]]. The – War (1626–1629) ended with a ceasefire in [[Stary Targ]] ([[Truce of Altmark]]) on 26 September 1629 that was in favour of the Swedes, to whom  ceded the larger part of [[Livonia]] together with its important port of [[Riga]]. The Swedes also gained the right to tax ’s Baltic trade (3.5% on the value of goods), and kept control of several cities in [[Royal Prussia]] and [[Ducal Prussia]] (including [[Pillau]] (Baltiysk), [[Klaipėda|Memel]] (Klaipėda) and [[Elbing]] (Elbląg)). The Swedes later conducted a series of invasions into the – Commonwealth, known as the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]].{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=156}} After more than half a century of almost constant warfare, the  economy had deteriorated.

In addition, [[The plague during the Great Northern War|the plague raging in East Central Europe]] devastated the [[ dominions]] and reached Central  in 1710. Returning to  in 1715, Charles XII launched [[Great Northern War and |two campaigns against ]] in 1716 and 1718, respectively. During the second attempt, he was shot to death during the [[siege of Fredriksten]] fortress.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=295}} The Swedes were not militarily defeated at Fredriksten, but the whole structure and organisation of the campaign fell apart with the king's death.

Executive power was historically shared between the King and an aristocratic [[Privy council]] until 1680, followed by the King's [[autocracy|autocratic rule]] initiated by the commoner estates of the [[Riksdag]]. As a reaction to the failed Great Northern War, a parliamentary system was introduced in 1719, followed by three different flavours of constitutional monarchy in 1772, 1789 and 1809, [[ constitution of 1809|the latter]] granting several civil liberties. Already during the first of those three periods, the 'Era of Liberty' (1719–72) the  Riksdag had developed into a very active parliament, and this tradition continued into the nineteenth century, laying the basis for the transition towards modern democracy at the end of that century.
In the 18th century,  did not have enough resources to maintain its territories outside Scandinavia, and most of them were lost, culminating with [[ War|the loss in 1809]] of eastern  to , which became the highly autonomous [[Grand Duchy of |Grand Principality of ]] in [[ Empire|Imperial ]].

In interest of re-establishing  dominance in the Baltic Sea,  allied itself against its traditional ally and benefactor, , in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. However, in 1810, a  Marshal, [[Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]], was chosen as heir presumptive to [[Charles XIII]]; in 1818, he established the [[House of Bernadotte]], taking the [[regnal name]] of Charles XIV. 's role in the [[Battle of Leipzig]] gave it the authority to force –, an ally of , to cede  to the King of  on 14 January 1814 in exchange for the northern  provinces, at the [[Treaty of Kiel]]. The  attempts to keep their status as a sovereign state were rejected by the  king, [[Charles XIII]]. He launched a [[– War (1814)|military campaign against ]] on 27 July 1814, ending in the [[Convention of Moss]], which forced  into a [[Union between  and |personal union]] with  under the  crown, which lasted until 1905.

The [[ East  Company]] began in 1731. The obvious choice of home port was [[Gothenburg]] ({{langx|sv|Göteborg}}) at 's west coast, as the mouth of [[Göta älv|Göta älv river]] was very wide and had the county's largest and best harbour for high-seas journeys. The trade continued into the 19th century, and caused the little town to become 's second city.
Between 1750 and 1850, the population in  doubled. According to some scholars, mass emigration to America became the only way to prevent famine and rebellion; over 1% of the population emigrated annually during the 1880s. It is thought that between 1850 and 1910 more than one million [[ emigration to the |Swedes moved to the ]]. Nevertheless,  remained poor, retaining a nearly entirely agricultural economy even as Western European countries began to industrialise.

Despite the slow rate of industrialisation into the 19th century, many important changes were taking place in the agrarian economy due to constant innovations and a rapid population growth. These innovations included government-sponsored programmes of [[enclosure]], aggressive exploitation of agricultural lands, and the introduction of new crops such as the potato. The  farming culture began to take on a critical role in  politics, which has continued through modern times with modern Agrarian party (now called the Centre Party). Between 1870 and 1914,  began developing the industrialised economy that exists today.

Strong grassroots movements sprang up in  during the latter half of the 19th century (trade unions, [[temperance movement|temperance]] groups, and independent religious groups), creating a strong foundation of democratic principles. These movements precipitated 's migration into a modern parliamentary democracy, achieved by the time of World War I. As the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed during the 20th century, people gradually moved into cities to work in factories and became involved in socialist unions. A communist revolution was avoided in 1917, following the re-introduction of [[parliamentarism]], and the country was [[Democracy|democratised]].

Like many industrialised countries,  entered a period of economic decline and upheaval following the oil embargoes of 1973–74 and 1978–79. In the 1980s several key  industries were significantly restructured. Shipbuilding was discontinued, wood pulp was integrated into modernised paper production, the steel industry was concentrated and specialised, and mechanical engineering was robotised.

Since the postwar period, [[LGBTQ rights in ]] have gradually expanded through the steady extension of legal and social protections for LGBTQ+ people. Over subsequent decades, anti-discrimination laws, adoption rights, and the ability to change legal gender were progressively strengthened, contributing to high levels of public support for LGBTQ+ equality.
