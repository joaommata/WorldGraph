===Before colonisation===
What is now  has been inhabited for millennia. Nine [[Indigenous peoples in |indigenous]] tribes reside in : the [[Wai-wai people|Wai Wai]], [[Macushi]], [[Patamona people|Patamona]], [[Lokono]], [[Kalina people|Kalina]], [[Wapishana]], [[Pemon]], [[Akawaio people|Akawaio]], and [[Warao people|Warao]]. Many of these peoples practised [[shifting agriculture]] alongside [[hunting]]. Historians speculate that the Arawaks and Caribs originated in the South  hinterland and migrated northward, first to the present-day Guianas and then to the Caribbean islands. The Arawak, mainly cultivators, hunters, and fishermen, migrated to the Caribbean islands before the Carib and settled throughout the region.

===Colonial period===
Although [[Christopher Columbus]] was the first European to sight  during his third voyage (in 1498), and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] wrote an account in 1596, the [[ Republic|]] were the first Europeans to establish colonies: [[Pomeroon (colony)|Pomeroon]] (1581), [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] (1616), [[Berbice]] (1627), and [[Demerara]] (1752). After  invaded the  Republic ([[Batavian Republic|1795]]), the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] assumed control in 1796, with the  and British signing the [[Anglo- Treaty of 1814]] in London that ceded [[Demerara-Essequibo]] and Berbice to Britain.

In 1831, the united colonies of Demerara-Essequibo and separate colony of Berbice together became a single British colony known as [[British Guiana]].

Since its independence in 1824,  has claimed the area of land to the west of the [[Essequibo River]]. [[Simón Bolívar]] wrote to the British government warning against the Berbice and Demerara settlers settling on land which the Venezuelans, as assumed heirs of  claims on the area dating to the 16th century, claimed was theirs. In 1899, an international tribunal ruled that the land belonged to Great Britain. From the [[Anglo- Treaty of 1814]], the British inherited [[ colonisation of the Guianas| territory]] which included lands between the [[Orinoco river|Orinoco]] and [[Courantyne River|Courantyne]] rivers.  sovereignty over these settlements was recognised in 1648 by  with the [[Peace of Münster]], which stated under Article 5 that the  would retain all of the "lordships, cities, castles, fortresses, trades and lands in the... West Indies" under their possession at the time. However, the treaty did not specify the boundary between [[ Guiana]] and [[ colonisation of the Guianas| Guiana]].

Following independence, [[Forbes Burnham]] of the [[People's National Congress Reform|People's National Congress]] rose to power, quickly becoming a repressive authoritarian leader. Politics became divided on race with the Afro- supporting Burnham's [[People's National Congress Reform|People's National Congress]] and the Indo- supporting [[Cheddi Jagan]]'s [[People's Progressive Party/Civic|People's Progressive Party]], in what became known as ''aapan [[Jāti|jaat]]'' politics, loosely translated from [[Caribbean Hindustani# Hindustani| Hindustani]] as "for your own kind".

[[Cheddi Jagan]] of the PPP was elected and sworn in as president on 9 October 1992. This reversed the monopoly that Afro- traditionally had over  politics. The poll was marred by violence however.
