=== Early history ===
The first great indigenous empire to cover the territory was the [[Maurya Empire]] ({{Circa}} 320–185 BC). Following its decline, the kingdom of [[Samatata]] arose, which was a tributary state of the [[Gupta Empire]] (ca. 319-ca. 540 AD). [[Harsha]] (606–47 AD) drew Samatata into its loosely administered political structure. The Buddhist [[Pala Empire]] ruled the region from 750 to 1150 AD. It was overthrown by the Hindu [[Sena dynasty]], which ruled the territory until the [[Muslim conquests in the  subcontinent|Muslim conquests]] led by [[Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji]] of the [[Ghurid dynasty]] in 1204.

Bengal was then incorporated into the [[Delhi Sultanate]] (1206–1526 AD). In 1341, the independent [[Bengal Sultanate]] was established by [[Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah]]. Amidst geographic expansion and economic prosperity, it was regarded by European and  visitors as the "richest country to trade with".{{rp|10}} The [[Mughal Empire]] conquered Bengal in 1576. By the 18th century, the [[Bengal Subah]] emerged as the wealthiest province of the empire and was described as the "Paradise of Countries" and the "breadbasket of ". Its citizens enjoyed some of the best [[standard of living|standards of living]] in the world, as the region was a major global exporter and producer of cotton textiles ([[Muslin trade in Bengal|muslin]] in particular), silk and [[shipbuilding in |shipbuilding]].{{rp|174}} Following the decline of the Mughal Empire in the early 1700s, the region became a semi-independent state under the [[Nawabs of Bengal]], founded by [[Murshid Quli Khan]] in 1717.

=== British colonial rule ===
{{main|Bengal Presidency}}

In 1757, the state led by [[Siraj-ud-Daulah]] was defeated by the British [[East  Company]] in the [[Battle of Plassey]]—which was key in establishing colonial [[British Raj|British rule]] over Bengal and the wider  subcontinent. Bengal played a crucial role in the [[Industrial Revolution]] at the expense of an extraordinary [[capital flight]] and deindustrialisation following British colonial loot and the collapse of the Bengali textile industry.{{rp|7–10}} The catastrophic [[Great Bengal famine of 1770]] caused over ten million deaths, killing one-third of the total population of the Bengal Presidency,{{rp|47}} and remains one of the [[List of famines|deadliest man-made famines]] in history.

{{further|West |Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition of }}
In the aftermath of [[Bengal Presidency|direct British rule]] for nearly two centuries, the borders of modern  were established with the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|partition of Bengal]] between  and  by the [[Radcliffe Line]] during the [[partition of ]] on 15 August 1947, when the region became [[East Bengal]] as the eastern and most populous wing of the newly formed [[Dominion of ]]—alongside [[West ]]. The western and eastern wings of the newly formed  were geographically separated by a distance of over 1,000 miles, which became the root cause of deep [[economic inequality]]. Khawaja Nazimuddin was East Bengal's first [[Chief Minister of East Bengal|chief minister]] with [[Frederick Chalmers Bourne]] its governor. The [[All  Awami Muslim League]] was formed in 1949. In 1950, the [[East Bengal Legislative Assembly]] enacted [[land reform]], abolishing the Permanent Settlement and the zamindari system. The Awami Muslim League was renamed as a more "secular" [[Awami League]] in 1953. The first constituent assembly was dissolved in 1954. The [[United Front (East )|United Front]] coalition swept aside the Muslim League in a landslide victory in the [[1954 East Bengali legislative election]]. The following year, East Bengal was renamed [[East ]] as part of the [[One Unit]] programme, and the province became a vital part of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]].

Amidst rising cultural and societal differences—the brutal government crackdown on the 1952 [[Bengali language movement]] to establish [[Bengali language|Bengali]] as the official language of  spurred [[Bengali nationalism]] and [[pro-democracy]] movements.  adopted a new constitution in 1956. The [[ Armed Forces]] imposed [[martial law]] in 1958, following a [[1958  coup d'état|coup d'état]], with [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]] establishing a dictatorship for over a decade. A new constitution was introduced in 1962, replacing the [[parliamentary system]] with a presidential and gubernatorial system (based on [[electoral college]] selection) known as "Basic Democracy". In 1962, Dhaka became the seat of the [[National Assembly of ]], a move seen as appeasing increased Bengali nationalism. In 1966, Awami League leader [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] announced a [[six point movement|six-point movement]] for a federal parliamentary democracy.

Ethnic, linguistic, and cultural discrimination was common in 's civil and military services, in which Bengalis were under-represented; leading to East  forging a distinct political identity. Authorities banned Bengali literature and music in the state media. The  government practised extensive [[economic discrimination]] against East , including the refusal for foreign aid allocation. Despite generating 70% of 's export revenue with jute and tea, East  received much less government spending. Notable economists from East , including [[Rehman Sobhan]] and [[Nurul Islam (economist)|Nurul Islam]] demanded a separate foreign exchange account for the eastern wing, also pointing to the existence of two different economies within  itself, dubbed the Two-Economies Theory. The populist leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested for treason in the [[Agartala Conspiracy Case]] and was released during the [[1969 uprising in East ]] which resulted in Ayub Khan's resignation. General [[Yahya Khan]] assumed power, reintroducing martial law.

A [[1970 Bhola cyclone|cyclone]] devastated the coast of East  in 1970, killing an estimated 500,000 people, and the central government was criticised for its poor response. After the December 1970 elections, the Bengali-nationalist Awami League won 167 of 169 East  seats in the National Assembly. The League claimed the right to form a government and develop a new constitution but was strongly opposed by the  military and the [[ Peoples Party]] led by [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]].

The [[7 March Speech of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|7 March Speech]] of Mujib led to a [[Non-cooperation movement (1971)|non-cooperation movement]]. The autocratic  government then initiated [[Operation Searchlight]] on 25 March 1971 in response. Mujib signed the [[Proclamation of  Independence|Proclamation of Independence]] on 26 March 1971, leading to the nine-month-long bloody [[ Liberation War|liberation war]], which led to [[ genocide|a genocide]], and the culmination of  as a sovereign nation following [[ Instrument of Surrender| surrender]] on 16 December 1971.

=== Independent  ===
The [[Constitution of ]] was enacted on 4 November 1972. Following independence, the Mujib-led government engaged in large-scale corruption and mismanagement, leading to nationwide lawlessness and economic devastation. Efforts to establish [[BAKSAL|One-party socialism]] and a [[ famine of 1974|large famine in 1974]] led to [[Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|Mujib's assassination]] in 1975 following a significant decline in his popularity.{{rp|131}} The presidency was then transferred to [[Ziaur Rahman]], who re-established public order, industrialised agriculture, founded the [[ Nationalist Party]]  and initiated the creation of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]]. Following [[Assassination of Ziaur Rahman|Rahman's assassination]] in 1981, the ensuing decade was a [[military dictatorship]] under [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] that saw infrastructural development, [[devolution]] reforms, privatisation of nationalised industries and the declaration of Islam as the [[state religion]] in 1988.

After the restoration of [[parliamentary democracy]] in 1991, power alternated between [[Khaleda Zia]] of the BNP and [[Sheikh Hasina]] of the Awami League, an era dubbed the "Battle of the [[Begum]]s"—which defined 's politics and history for next 34 years.{{rp|130}} The return of the Awami League to power following a [[landslide victory]] in the [[2008  general election|2008 general election]] under [[Sheikh Hasina]]'s leadership saw unprecedented economic progress alongside [[democratic backsliding]], increasing authoritarianism, endemic [[Corruption in |corruption]], and widespread [[Human rights in |human rights abuse]]s. Hasina won her second, third and fourth consecutive terms in the [[2014  general election|2014]], [[2018  general election|2018]] and the [[2024  general election|2024 general elections]]—all of which were shams and neither [[Free and fair election|free nor fair]]. Following a [[July Revolution ()|July Mass Uprising]] against the authoritarian government, Hasina was [[Non-cooperation movement (2024)|forced to resign and flee]] to  on 5 August 2024. An [[2024  interim government|interim government]] was formed on 8 August 2024, with Nobel laureate [[Muhammad Yunus]] as the [[Chief Adviser of |Chief Adviser]].
