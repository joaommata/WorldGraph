It remained a British colony from 1814 until its independence in 1976.  has never been inhabited by [[indigenous people]], but its islanders maintain their own [[ Creole people|Creole heritage]].

===Early history===
 was uninhabited throughout most of recorded history, although simulations of [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] migration patterns indicate a good probability that they visited the islands. Tombs visible until 1910 at Anse Lascars on Silhouette Island have also been conjectured to belong to later [[Maldivians|]] and [[Arabs|Arab]] traders visiting the archipelago. [[Vasco da Gama]] and his [[4th   Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th   Armada]] discovered the  on 15 March 1503; the first sighting was made by [[Thomé Lopes]] aboard ''Rui Mendes de Brito''. Da Gama's ships passed close to an elevated island, probably [[Silhouette Island]], and the following day [[Desroches Island]]. Later, the  mapped a group of seven islands and named them ''The Seven Sisters.'' The earliest recorded landing was in January 1609, by the crew of the ''Ascension'' under Captain [[Alexander Sharpeigh]] during the fourth voyage of the British [[East  Company]].

A transit point for trade between Africa and Asia, the islands were said to be occasionally used by pirates until the  began to take control in 1756 when a Stone of Possession was laid on [[Mahé, |Mahé]] by Captain [[Corneille Nicholas Morphey]]. The islands were named after  politician [[Jean Moreau de Séchelles]], and were formally part of the colony of [[Isle de  ()|Isle de ]]. In August 1770, the  ship ''Thélémaque'' under Captain Leblanc Lécore landed 15 white settlers and 13 African and  slaves on [[Ste. Anne Island]].

During the [[ Revolutionary Wars]], the [[Royal Navy]] frigate [[HMS Orpheus (1780)|HMS ''Orpheus'']] under Captain Henry Newcombe arrived at Mahé on 16 May 1794. {{ill|Jean-Baptiste Quéau de Quinssy|fr}}, the senior administrator in the , refused to resist ''Orpheus'' and instead successfully negotiated with the British, resulting the islands remaining under  control as "neutral" territory. After British forces completed their [[invasion of Isle de ]] in December 1810, they assumed control over the , which was formalised in the 1814 [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] that ended the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]].  became a separate [[crown colony]] from  in 1903. [[Elections in ]] were held in 1966 and 1970.

=== Independence ===
In 1976,  gained independence from the [[]] as a republic. It has since become a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. In the 1970s  was "the place to be seen, a playground for film stars and the international jet set". In 1977, a [[1977  coup d'état|coup d'état]] by [[ Albert René]] ousted the first president of the republic, [[James Mancham]]. René discouraged over-dependence on tourism and declared that he wanted "to keep  for the ".

The 1979 constitution declared a [[One party rule in |socialist one-party state]], which lasted until 1991.

In the 1980s there were a series of coup attempts against President René, some of which were supported by . In 1981, [[Mike Hoare]] led a team of 43  mercenaries masquerading as holidaying rugby players in the [[1981  coup d'état attempt]]. There was a gun battle at the airport, and most of the mercenaries later escaped in a hijacked [[Air ]] plane. The leader of this hijacking was  mercenary D. Clodo, a former member of the [[Rhodesian Special Air Service|Rhodesian SAS]]. Clodo later stood trial in  (where he was acquitted) as well as in his home country  for air piracy.

In 1986, an attempted coup led by the  Minister of Defence, Ogilvy Berlouis, caused President René to request assistance from . In [[Operation Flowers are Blooming]], the  Navy's {{sclass|Nilgiri|frigate|1||1972}} {{INS|Vindhyagiri|F42|2}} arrived in Port Victoria to help avert the coup.

The first draft of a new constitution failed to receive the requisite 60% of voters in 1992, but an amended version was approved in 1993.

In June 2012, during a conference at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], a commitment was made by the  government to protect 30% of its 1.35 million square kilometre marine waters within the country's marine protected areas.

Following the coup in 1977, the president always represented the same political party until the October [[2020  general election]], which was historic in that the opposition party won. [[Wavel Ramkalawan]] was the first president who did not represent United  (the current name of the former  People's Progressive Front).

In January 2023,  announced its final stages of completing its marine spatial plan. It would become the second largest ocean area at {{convert|1.35|e6km2|sqmi|abbr=unit}} behind [[]], in support of its [[blue economy]].

In October 2025, [[2025  general election|presidential runoff]] was won by former parliamentary speaker and main opposition leader, [[Patrick Herminie]], meaning Herminie's party, [[United ]] (US) returned to power. On 26 October 2025, Patrick Herminie was sworn in as ’ sixth president.
