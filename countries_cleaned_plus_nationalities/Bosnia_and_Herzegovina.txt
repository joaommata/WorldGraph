===Early history===
 has been inhabited since at least the [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic era]]. Notably, the [[Badanj Cave]] near [[Stolac]] features one of the oldest known cave engravings, depicting an animal figure believed to be a horse, dating back to approximately 13,000 to 12,000 BC. During the [[Neolithic|Neolithic period]], significant cultures such as the [[Butmir]] and [[Kakanj]] emerged along the [[Bosna (river)|Bosna River]]. The Butmir culture, flourishing around 5100 to 4500 BC, is renowned for its distinctive ceramics and anthropomorphic figurines. Excavations near [[Sarajevo]] have uncovered intricately decorated pottery and realistic human figurines from this culture.

From the 8th century BCE, Illyrian tribes evolved into kingdoms. The most notable Illyrian kingdoms and dynasties were those of [[Bardylis|Bardylis of the Dardani]] and of [[Agron of Illyria|Agron of the Ardiaei]] who created the last and best-known Illyrian kingdom. Agron ruled over the Ardiaei and had extended his rule to other tribes as well.

From the 7th century BCE, bronze was replaced by iron, after which only jewelry and art objects were still made out of bronze. Illyrian tribes, under the influence of [[Hallstatt culture]]s to the north, formed regional centers that were slightly different. Parts of Central  were inhabited by the [[Daesitiates]] tribe. The Iron Age [[Glasinac-Mati culture]] is associated with the [[Autariatae]] tribe.

A very important role in their life was the cult of the dead, which is seen in their careful burials and burial ceremonies, as well as the richness of their burial sites. In northern parts, there was a long tradition of cremation and burial in shallow graves, while in the south the dead were buried in large stone or earth [[Tumulus|tumuli]] (natively called ''gromile'') that in  were reaching monumental sizes, more than 50 m wide and 5 m high.{{cn|date=May 2025}} ''Japodian tribes'' had an affinity to decoration (heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, and large bronze [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulas]], as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze foil).{{cn|date=May 2025}}

In the 4th century BCE, the first invasion of [[Celts]] is recorded. They brought the technique of the [[Potter's wheel|pottery wheel]], new types of fibulas and different bronze and iron belts. They only passed on their way to , so their influence in  is negligible. Celtic migrations displaced many [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria|Illyrian tribes]] from their former lands, but some Celtic and Illyrian tribes mixed. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears the region was populated by a number of different peoples speaking distinct languages.{{cn|date=May 2025}}

In the [[Neretva Delta]] in the south, there were important [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] influences of the Illyrian [[Daorson|Daors]] tribe. Their capital was ''Daorson'' in Ošanići near [[Stolac]]. Daorson, in the 4th century BCE, was surrounded by [[megalith]]ic, 5 m high stonewalls (as large as those of [[Mycenae]] in ), composed of large trapezoid stone blocks. Daors made unique bronze coins and sculptures.

Conflict between the Illyrians and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] started in 229&nbsp;BCE, but Rome did not complete its annexation of the region until AD&nbsp;9. It was precisely in modern-day  that Rome fought one of the most difficult battles in its history since the [[Punic Wars]], as described by the Roman historian [[Suetonius]]. This was the Roman campaign against [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], known as {{Lang|la|[[Bellum Batonianum]]}}. The conflict arose after an attempt to recruit Illyrians, and a revolt spanned for four years (6–9 AD), after which they were subdued.{{pn|date=May 2025}} In the Roman period, Latin-speaking settlers from the entire [[Roman Empire]] settled among the Illyrians, and Roman soldiers were encouraged to retire in the region.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002|p=3}}

Following the split of the Empire between 337 and 395 AD, Dalmatia and Pannonia became parts of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The region was conquered by the [[Ostrogoths]] in 455 AD. It subsequently changed hands between the [[Alans]] and the [[Huns]]. By the 6th century, Emperor [[Justinian I]] had reconquered the area for the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Slavs overwhelmed the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries. Illyrian cultural traits were adopted by the South Slavs, as evidenced in certain customs and traditions, and placenames.

===Middle Ages===

The [[Early Slavs]] raided the Western Balkans, including , in the 6th and early 7th century (amid the [[Migration Period]]), and were composed of small tribal units drawn from a single Slavic confederation known to the Byzantines as the ''[[Sclaveni]]'' (whilst the related ''[[Antes people|Antes]]'', roughly speaking, colonized the eastern portions of the Balkans).
Tribes recorded by the ethnonyms of "Serb" and "Croat" are described as a second, later, migration of different people during the second quarter of the 7th century who could not have been particularly numerous;{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=53, 56}} these early "Serb" and "Croat" tribes, whose exact identity is subject to scholarly debate, came to predominate over the Slavs in the neighbouring regions. According to Noel Malcolm, the tribal Croats "settled in an area roughly corresponding to modern , and probably also including most of  proper, apart from the eastern strip of the Drina valley" while the tribal Serbs settled an area "corresponding to modern south-western  (later known as [[Raška (region)|Raška]]), and gradually extended their rule into the territories of [[Duklja]] and [[Zachlumia|Hum]]".{{sfn|Malcolm|2002|p=8|ps=: The Serbs settled in an area corresponding to modern south-western  (a territory which later in the middle ages became known as Raška or Rascia), and gradually extended their rule into the territories of Duklje or Dioclea () and Hum or Zachumlje ().

[[File:Medieval  State Expansion-en.svg|thumb| in the Middle Ages spanning the [[Banate of ]] and the succeeding [[Kingdom of ]]]]

In the [[High Middle Ages]], political circumstance led to the area being contested between the [[Kingdom of ]] and the Byzantine Empire. Following another shift of power between the two in the early 12th century,  found itself outside the control of both and emerged as the [[Banate of ]] (under the rule of local ''[[Ban (title)|bans]]'').{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} The first  ban known by name was [[Ban Borić]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=288}} The second was [[Ban Kulin]], whose rule marked the start of a controversy involving the [[ Church]] – considered heretical by the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. In response to  attempts to use church politics regarding the issue as a way to reclaim sovereignty over , Kulin held a council of local church leaders to renounce the heresy and embraced Catholicism in 1203. Despite this,  ambitions remained unchanged long after Kulin's death in 1204, waning only after an unsuccessful invasion in 1254. During this time, the population was called ''Dobri [[Bošnjani]]'' ("Good "). The names Serb and Croat, though occasionally appearing in peripheral areas, were not used in  proper.

 history from then until the early 14th century was marked by a power struggle between the [[Šubić family|Šubić]] and [[Kotromanić dynasty|Kotromanić]] families. This conflict came to an end in 1322, when [[Stephen II, Ban of |Stephen II Kotromanić]] became ''Ban''. By the time of his death in 1353, he was successful in annexing territories to the north and west, as well as Zahumlje and parts of Dalmatia. He was succeeded by his ambitious nephew [[Tvrtko I of |Tvrtko]] who, following a prolonged struggle with nobility and inter-family strife, gained full control of the country in 1367. By the year 1377,  was elevated into a kingdom with the coronation of Tvrtko as the first [[List of rulers of | King]] in Mile near [[Visoko during the Middle Ages|Visoko]] in the  heartland.

Following his death in 1391, however,  fell into a long period of decline. The [[Ottoman Empire]] had started its [[Ottoman wars in Europe|conquest of Europe]] and posed a major threat to the [[Balkans]] throughout the first half of the 15th century. Finally, after decades of political and social instability, the Kingdom of  ceased to exist in 1463 after its conquest by the Ottoman Empire.

There was a general awareness in medieval , at least amongst the nobles, that they shared a joint state with  and that they belonged to the same ethnic group. That awareness diminished over time, due to differences in political and social development, but it was kept in  and parts of  which were a part of  state.

===Ottoman Empire===
{{Main|Ottoman conquest of |Ottoman }}
[[File: Eyalet, Central europe 1683.png|thumb|The [[ Eyalet]] in 1683]]

The [[Ottoman conquest of |Ottoman conquest of ]] marked a new era in the country's history and introduced drastic changes in the political and cultural landscape. The Ottomans incorporated  as an integral province of the Ottoman Empire with its historical name and territorial integrity. Within , the Ottomans introduced a number of key changes in the territory's socio-political administration; including a new landholding system, a reorganization of administrative units, and a complex system of social differentiation by class and religious affiliation.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

Following Ottoman occupation, there was a steady flow of people out of  and a large number of abandoned villages in  are mentioned in the Ottoman registers, while those who stayed eventually became [[Muslims]]. Many Catholics in  fled to neighboring Catholic lands in the early Ottoman occupation. The evidence indicates that the early Muslim conversions in Ottoman  in the 15th–16th century were among the locals who stayed rather than mass Muslim settlements from outside . In , many [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] people had also embraced Islam. By the late 16th and early 17th century, Muslims are considered to have become an absolute majority in . The  Catholic priest [[Pjetër Mazreku]] reported in 1624 that there were 450,000 Muslims, 150,000 Catholics and 75,000 Eastern Orthodox in .

There was a lack of [[ Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] activity in  proper in the pre-Ottoman period. An Orthodox Christian population in  was introduced as a direct result of Ottoman policy. From the 15th century and onwards, Orthodox Christians (Orthodox [[Vlachs]] and non-Vlach Orthodox Serbs) from  and other regions settled in . Favored by the Ottomans over the Catholics, many Orthodox churches were allowed to be built in  by the Ottomans. Quite a few Vlachs also became Islamized in , and some (mainly in ) became Catholics.
[[File:-02166 - Počitelj (10476710854).jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Počitelj Citadel]] in [[Čapljina]], built by [[King Tvrtko I of ]] in 1383.]]
The four centuries of Ottoman rule also had a drastic impact on 's population make-up, which changed several times as a result of the empire's conquests, frequent wars with European powers, forced and economic migrations, and epidemics. A native Slavic-speaking Muslim community emerged and eventually became the largest of the ethno-religious groups due to a lack of strong Christian church organizations and continuous rivalry between the Orthodox and Catholic churches, while the indigenous [[ Church]] disappeared altogether (ostensibly by conversion of its members to Islam). The Ottomans referred to them as ''kristianlar'' while the Orthodox and Catholics were called ''gebir'' or ''kafir'', meaning "unbeliever".{{sfn|Velikonja|2003|pp=29–30}} The  [[Franciscans]] (and the Catholic population as a whole) were protected by official imperial decrees and in accordance and the full extent of Ottoman laws; however, in effect, these often merely affected arbitrary rule and behavior of powerful local elite.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

As the Ottoman Empire continued its rule in the Balkans ([[Rumelia]]),  was somewhat relieved of the pressures of being a frontier province and experienced a period of general welfare. A number of cities, such as [[Sarajevo]] and [[Mostar]], were established and grew into regional centers of trade and urban culture and were then visited by Ottoman traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]] in 1648. Within these cities, various Ottoman Sultans financed the construction of many works of [[Architecture of | architecture]] such as the country's first library in Sarajevo, [[Madrasa|madrassas]], a school of [[Sufi philosophy]], and a clock tower (''Sahat Kula''), bridges such as the [[Stari Most]], the [[Emperor's Mosque]] and the [[Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque]].
[[File:Stari Most 2006.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Stari Most|Mostar Bridge]] was commissioned by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in 1557]]
Furthermore, several  Muslims played influential roles in the Ottoman Empire's cultural and [[political history]] during this time.  recruits formed a large component of the Ottoman ranks in the battles of [[Battle of Mohács|Mohács]] and [[Battle of Krbava Field|Krbava field]], while numerous other  rose through the ranks of the Ottoman military to occupy the highest positions of power in the Empire, including admirals such as [[Matrakçı Nasuh]]; generals such as [[Isa Bey Ishaković|Isa-Beg Ishaković]], [[Gazi Husrev Bey|Gazi Husrev-beg]], [[Telli Hasan Pasha]] and [[Sarı Süleyman Pasha]]; administrators such as [[Ferhad Pasha Sokolović]] and [[Osman Gradaščević]]; and Grand [[Vizier]]s such as the influential [[Sokollu Mehmed Pasha]] and [[Damat Ibrahim Pasha]]. Some  emerged as [[Sufism|Sufi]] mystics, scholars such as [[Muhamed Hevaji Uskufi Bosnevi]], [[Ali Džabić]]; and poets in the [[ language|]], [[ language|]], [[Arabic]], and [[Persian language]]s.

However, by the late 17th century the Empire's military misfortunes caught up with the country, and the end of the [[Great  War]] with the [[treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699 again made  the Empire's westernmost province. The 18th century was marked by further military failures, numerous revolts within , and several outbreaks of plague.
The Porte's efforts at modernizing the Ottoman state were met with distrust growing to hostility in , where local aristocrats stood to lose much through the proposed [[Tanzimat]] reforms. This, combined with frustrations over territorial, political concessions in the north-east, and the plight of [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[Muslims|Muslim]] refugees arriving from the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] into [[ Eyalet]], culminated in a partially unsuccessful revolt by [[Husein Gradaščević]], who endorsed a  Eyalet autonomous from the authoritarian rule of the Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]], who persecuted, executed and abolished the [[Janissary|Janissaries]] and reduced the role of autonomous [[Pasha]]s in Rumelia. Mahmud II sent his [[Grand vizier]] to subdue  Eyalet and succeeded only with the reluctant assistance of [[Ali Pasha Rizvanbegović]]. Related rebellions were extinguished by 1850, but the situation continued to deteriorate.

New nationalist movements appeared in  by the middle of the 19th century. Shortly after 's breakaway from the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century,  and  nationalism rose up in , and such nationalists made irredentist claims to 's territory. This trend continued to grow in the rest of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Agrarian unrest eventually sparked the [[ uprising (1875–1877)|Herzegovinian rebellion]], a widespread peasant uprising, in 1875. The conflict rapidly spread and came to involve several Balkan states and Great Powers, a situation that led to the [[Congress of Berlin]] and the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

At the Congress of [[Berlin]] in 1878, the [[-|Austro-]] Foreign Minister [[Gyula Andrássy]] obtained the occupation and administration of , and he also obtained the right to station garrisons in the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], which would remain under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administration until 1908, when the Austro- troops withdrew from the Sanjak.

Although Austro- officials quickly came to an agreement with the , tensions remained and a mass emigration of  occurred.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} However, a state of relative stability was reached soon enough and Austro- authorities were able to embark on a number of social and administrative reforms they intended would make  into a "model" colony.

[[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg rule]] had several key concerns in . It tried to dissipate the South Slav nationalism by disputing the earlier Serb and Croat claims to  and encouraging identification of  or [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] identity.{{sfn|Hajdarpasic|2015|p=161–165}} Habsburg rule also tried to provide for modernisation by codifying laws, introducing new political institutions, establishing and expanding industries.

– began to plan the annexation of , but due to international disputes the issue was not resolved until the [[ Crisis|annexation crisis]] of 1908.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=94}} Several external matters affected the status of  and its relationship with –. [[May Coup ()|A bloody coup]] occurred in  in 1903, which brought a radical anti- government into power in [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=140}} Then in 1908, the revolt in the Ottoman Empire raised concerns that the [[Istanbul]] government might seek the outright return of . These factors caused the Austro- government to seek a permanent resolution of the  question sooner, rather than later.

Taking advantage of the turmoil in the Ottoman Empire, Austro- diplomacy tried to obtain provisional  approval for changes over the status of  and published the annexation proclamation on 6 October 1908.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=227}} Despite international objections to the Austro- annexation,  and their client state, , were compelled to accept the Austro- annexation of  in March 1909.

In 1910, Habsburg Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of |Franz Joseph]] proclaimed the first constitution in , which led to relaxation of earlier laws, elections and formation of the [[Diet of | parliament]] and growth of new political life.
[[File:DC-1914-27-d-Sarajevo-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of ]] and [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg]] by [[Gavrilo Princip]] in Sarajevo, 28 June 1914]]
On 28 June 1914, [[Gavrilo Princip]], a [[Serbs of | Serb]] member of the revolutionary movement [[Young ]], [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassinated]] the heir to the Austro- throne, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of |Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], in Sarajevo—an event that was the spark that set off [[World War I]]. At the end of the war, the  Muslims had lost more men per capita than any other ethnic group in the Habsburg Empire whilst serving in the [[-Herzegovinian Infantry]] of the [[Austro- Army]]. Nonetheless,  as a whole managed to escape the conflict relatively unscathed.

The Austro- authorities established an auxiliary militia known as the [[Schutzkorps]] with a moot role in the empire's policy of [[Anti-Serb sentiment|anti-Serb]] repression. Schutzkorps, predominantly recruited among the  Muslim population, were tasked with hunting down rebel Serbs (the ''[[Chetniks]]'' and ''[[Komitadji]]''){{sfn|Velikonja|2003|p=141}} and became known for their persecution of [[Serbs]] particularly in Serb populated areas of eastern , where they partly retaliated against  Chetniks who in fall 1914 had carried out attacks against the Muslim population in the area. The proceedings of the Austro- authorities led to around 5,500 citizens of Serb ethnicity in  being arrested, and between 700 and 2,200 died in prison while 460 were executed.{{sfn|Velikonja|2003|p=141}} Around 5,200 Serb families were forcibly expelled from .{{sfn|Velikonja|2003|p=141}}

===Kingdom of Yugoslavia===
{{Main|History of #Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918–41)}}
[[File:Čuvajte Jugoslaviju.jpg|thumb|"Keep/Protect Yugoslavia" (Čuvajte Jugoslaviju), a variant of the alleged last words of [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander I]], in an illustration of Yugoslav peoples dancing the [[Kolo (dance)|kolo]]]]

Following World War I,  joined the South Slav [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and ]] (soon renamed Yugoslavia). Political life in  at this time was marked by two major trends: social and economic unrest over [[Distribution (economics)|property redistribution]] and the formation of several political parties that frequently changed coalitions and alliances with parties in other Yugoslav regions.

The dominant ideological conflict of the Yugoslav state, between  regionalism and  centralization, was approached differently by 's major [[ethnic group]]s and was dependent on the overall political atmosphere.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} The political reforms brought about in the newly established Yugoslav kingdom saw few benefits for the  Muslims; according to the 1910 final census of land ownership and population according to religious affiliation conducted in -, Muslims owned 91.1%, Orthodox Serbs owned 6.0%, Croat Catholics owned 2.6% and others, 0.3% of the property. Following the reforms,  Muslims were dispossessed of a total of 1,175,305 hectares of agricultural and forest land.

Although the initial split of the country into 33 [[oblast]]s erased the presence of traditional geographic entities from the map, the efforts of  politicians, such as [[Mehmed Spaho]], ensured the six oblasts carved up from  corresponded to the six sanjaks from Ottoman times and, thus, matched the country's traditional boundary as a whole.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

The establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, however, brought the redrawing of administrative regions into [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia#Subdivisions|banates]] or ''[[Banovina (region)|banovinas]]'' that purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines, removing any trace of a  entity.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} Serbo-Croat tensions over the structuring of the Yugoslav state continued, with the concept of a separate  division receiving little or no consideration.

The [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement|Cvetković-Maček Agreement]] that created the [[Banovina of | banate]] in 1939 encouraged what was essentially a [[partition of ]] between  and . However the rising threat of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi ]] forced Yugoslav politicians to shift their attention. Following a period that saw attempts at appeasement, the signing of the [[Tripartite Pact|Tripartite Treaty]], and a [[Yugoslav coup d'état|coup d'état]], Yugoslavia was finally invaded by  on 6 April 1941.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

===World War II (1941–45)===
{{Main|History of  (1941–1945)}}
[[File:Neretva most.jpg|thumb|left|The railway bridge over the [[Neretva]] River in [[Jablanica, |Jablanica]], twice destroyed during the 1943 [[Operation Weiss]] offensive]]

Once the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was conquered by  forces in [[World War II]], all of  was ceded to the Nazi puppet regime, the [[Independent State of ]] (NDH) led by the [[Ustaše]]. The NDH leaders embarked on a [[Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of |campaign of extermination]] of Serbs, Jews, [[Romani people|Romani]] as well as dissident Croats, and, later, [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] by setting up a number of [[Jasenovac concentration camp|death camps]]. The regime systematically and brutally massacred Serbs in villages in the countryside, using a variety of tools. The scale of the violence meant that approximately every sixth Serb living in  was the victim of a massacre and virtually every Serb had a family member that was killed in the war, mostly by the Ustaše. The experience had a profound impact in the collective memory of Serbs in  and . An estimated 209,000 Serbs or 16.9% of its  population were killed on the territory of  during the war.

The Ustaše recognized both Catholicism and Islam as the national religions, but held the position [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], as a symbol of Serb identity, was their greatest foe. Although Croats were by far the largest ethnic group to constitute the Ustaše, the Vice President of the NDH and leader of the Yugoslav Muslim Organization [[Džafer Kulenović]] was a Muslim, and Muslims in total constituted nearly 12% of the Ustaše military and civil service authority.{{sfn|Velikonja|2003|p=179}}

[[File:Vječna vatra in 2019.jpg|thumb|[[Eternal flame (Sarajevo)|Eternal flame]] memorial to military and civilian [[World War II]] victims in Sarajevo]]

Many Serbs themselves took up arms and joined the Chetniks, a Serb nationalist movement with the aim of establishing an ethnically homogeneous '[[Greater ]]n' state within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Chetniks, in turn, pursued a [[Chetnik war crimes in World War II|genocidal campaign]] against ethnic Muslims and Croats, as well as persecuting a large number of [[Communism|communist]] Serbs and other Communist sympathizers, with the Muslim populations of ,  and [[Sandžak]] being a primary target. Once captured, Muslim villagers were systematically massacred by the Chetniks. Of the 75,000 Muslims who died in  during the war, approximately 30,000 (mostly civilians) were killed by the Chetniks. Massacres against Croats were smaller in scale but similar in action.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=259}} Between 64,000 and 79,000  Croats were killed between April 1941 to May 1945. Of these, about 18,000 were killed by the Chetniks.

A percentage of Muslims served in Nazi [[13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st )|''Waffen-SS'']] units. These units were responsible for massacres of Serbs in northwest and eastern , most notably in [[Vlasenica]]. On 12 October 1941, a group of 108 prominent Sarajevan Muslims signed the [[Resolution of Sarajevo Muslims]] by which they condemned the persecution of Serbs organized by the Ustaše, made distinction between Muslims who participated in such persecutions and the Muslim population as a whole, presented information about the persecutions of Muslims by Serbs, and requested security for all citizens of the country, regardless of their identity.

Starting in 1941, Yugoslav communists under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito organized their own multi-ethnic resistance group, the Partisans, who fought against both [[Axis powers|Axis]] and Chetnik forces. On 29 November 1943, the [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] (AVNOJ) with Tito at its helm held a founding conference in [[Jajce]] where  was reestablished as a republic within the Yugoslav federation in its Habsburg borders. During the entire course of [[World War II in Yugoslavia]], 64.1% of all  Partisans were Serbs, 23% were Muslims and 8.8% Croats.

Military success eventually prompted the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to support the Partisans, resulting in the successful [[Maclean Mission]], but Tito declined their offer to help and relied on his own forces instead. All the major military offensives by the antifascist movement of Yugoslavia against Nazis and their local supporters were conducted in  and its peoples bore the brunt of the fighting. More than 300,000 people died in  in World War II, or more than 10% of the population. At the end of the war, the establishment of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], with the [[1946 Yugoslav Constitution|constitution of 1946]], officially made  one of six constituent republics in the new state.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

Due to its central geographic position within the Yugoslav federation, post-war  was selected as a base for the development of the military defense industry. This contributed to a large concentration of arms and military personnel in ; a significant factor in [[ War|the war that followed the break-up of Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} However, 's existence within Yugoslavia, for the large part, was relatively peaceful and very prosperous, with high employment, a strong industrial and export oriented economy, a good education system and social and medical security for every citizen of . Several international corporations operated in —[[Volkswagen]] as part of TAS (car factory in Sarajevo, from 1972), [[Coca-Cola]] (from 1975), SKF  (from 1967), [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] (a tobacco factory in Sarajevo), and [[Holiday Inn]] hotels. Sarajevo was the site of the [[1984 Winter Olympics]].

During the 1950s and 1960s,  was a political backwater of Yugoslavia. In the 1970s, a strong  political elite arose, fueled in part by Tito's leadership in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and  serving in Yugoslavia's diplomatic corps. While working within the Socialist system, politicians such as [[Džemal Bijedić]], [[Branko Mikulić]] and [[Hamdija Pozderac]] reinforced and protected the sovereignty of . Their efforts proved key during the turbulent period following Tito's death in 1980, and are today considered some of the early steps towards [[Independence Day ()| independence]]. However, the republic did not escape the increasingly nationalistic climate of the time. With the fall of communism and the start of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], doctrine of tolerance began to lose its potency, creating an opportunity for nationalist elements in the society to spread their influence.

On 18 November 1990, [[1990  general election|multi-party parliamentary elections]] were held throughout . A second round followed on 25 November, resulting in a [[Parliamentary Assembly of |national assembly]] where communist power was replaced by a coalition of three ethnically based parties. Following [[]] and [[]]'s declarations of independence from Yugoslavia, a significant split developed among the residents of  on the issue of whether to remain within Yugoslavia (overwhelmingly favored by Serbs) or seek independence (overwhelmingly favored by [[Muslims (ethnic group)|Muslims]] and Croats).

The Serb members of parliament, consisting mainly of the [[Serb Democratic Party ()|Serb Democratic Party]] members, abandoned the central parliament in Sarajevo, and formed the [[National Assembly (Republika Srpska)|Assembly of the Serb People of ]] on 24 October 1991, which marked the end of the three-ethnic coalition that governed after the elections in 1990. This Assembly established the  Republic of  in part of the territory of  on 9 January 1992. It was renamed [[Republika Srpska (1992–1995)|Republika Srpska]] in August 1992. On 18 November 1991, the party branch in  of the ruling party in the Republic of , the [[ Democratic Union]] (HDZ), proclaimed the existence of the [[ Republic of Herzeg-| Community of Herzeg-]] in a separate part of the territory of  with the [[ Defence Council]] (HVO) as its military branch. It went unrecognized by the [[Council of Ministers of |Government of ]], which declared it illegal.

A declaration of the sovereignty of  on 15 October 1991 was followed by a [[1992  independence referendum|referendum for independence]] on 29 February and 1 March 1992, which was boycotted by the great majority of Serbs. The turnout in the independence referendum was 63.4 per cent and 99.7 per cent of voters voted for independence.  declared independence on 3 March 1992 and received international recognition the following month on 6 April 1992. The [[Republic of ]] was admitted as a member state of the [[United Nations]] on 22 May 1992.  leader [[Slobodan Milošević]] and  leader [[Franjo Tuđman]] are believed to have agreed on a [[partition of ]] in March 1991, with the aim of establishing [[Greater ]] and [[Greater ]].

Following 's declaration of independence,  Serb militias mobilized in different parts of the country. Government forces were poorly equipped and unprepared for the war. International recognition of  increased diplomatic pressure for the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) to withdraw from the republic's territory, which they officially did in June 1992. The  Serb members of the JNA simply changed insignia, formed the [[Army of Republika Srpska]] (VRS), and continued fighting. Armed and equipped from JNA stockpiles in , supported by volunteers and various paramilitary forces from , and receiving extensive humanitarian, logistical and financial support from the [[ and |Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], [[Republika Srpska]]'s offensives in 1992 managed to place much of the country under its control.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} The  Serb advance was accompanied by the [[ethnic cleansing]] of Bosniaks and  Croats from VRS-controlled areas. Dozens of concentration camps were established in which inmates were subjected to violence and abuse, including rape. The ethnic cleansing culminated in the [[Srebrenica massacre]] of more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys in July 1995, which was ruled to have been a [[genocide]] by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY). Bosniak and  Croat forces also committed war crimes against civilians from different ethnic groups, though on a smaller scale. Most of the Bosniak and Croat atrocities were committed during the [[Croat–Bosniak War]], a sub-conflict of the  War that pitted the [[Army of the Federation of ]] (ARBiH) against the HVO. The Bosniak-Croat conflict ended in March 1994, with the signing of the [[Washington Agreement (1994)|Washington Agreement]], leading to the creation of a joint Bosniak-Croat [[Federation of ]], which amalgamated HVO-held territory with that held by the [[Army of the Republic of ]] (ARBiH).

On 4 February 2014, the [[2014 unrest in |protests]] against the [[Government of the Federation of ]], one of the country's two entities, dubbed the  Spring, the name being taken from the [[Arab Spring]], began in the northern town of [[Tuzla]]. Workers from several factories that had been privatised and gone bankrupt assembled to demand action over jobs, unpaid salaries and pensions. Soon protests spread to the rest of the Federation, with violent clashes reported in close to 20 towns, the biggest of which were [[Sarajevo]], [[Zenica]], [[Mostar]], [[Bihać]], [[Brčko]] and Tuzla. The  news media reported that hundreds of people had been injured during the protests, including dozens of police officers, with bursts of violence in Sarajevo, in the northern city of Tuzla, in Mostar in the south, and in Zenica in central . The same level of unrest or activism did not occur in Republika Srpska, but hundreds of people also gathered in support of protests in the city of [[Banja Luka]] against its separate government.

The protests marked the largest outbreak of public anger over high unemployment and two decades of political inertia in the country since the end of the  War in 1995. According to a report made by [[Christian Schmidt]] of the [[High Representative for |Office of High Representative]] in late 2021,  has been experiencing intensified political and ethnic tensions, which could potentially break the country apart and slide it back into war once again. The [[European Union]] fears this will lead to further [[Balkanization]] in the region.
