By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the  subcontinent from [[Africa]], where they had earlier evolved. The earliest known modern human remains in [[South Asia]] date to about 30,000 years ago. The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human settlements in  dates to around the same time.

After 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in [[Mehrgarh]] and other sites in what is now [[Balochistan]]. These gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], the first urban culture in South Asia. Prehistoric sites of [[Paleolithic|palaeolithic]], [[mesolithic]] and [[neolithic]] origins have been discovered in the [[Sivalik Hills|Siwalik hills]] of [[Dang District, |Dang district]]. The earliest inhabitants of modern  and adjoining areas are believed to be people from the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]. It is possible that the [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] people whose history predates the onset of the [[Bronze Age]] in the  subcontinent (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other ethnic groups like the Tibeto- and [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryans]] from across the border. By 4000 BC, the Tibeto- people had reached  either directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via [[]] and [[Northeast |north-east ]] or both. [[Stella Kramrisch]] (1964) mentions a substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and Dravidians, who were in  even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient inhabitants of the valley of Kathmandu.

By the late [[Vedic period]],  was being mentioned in various Hindu texts, such as the late Vedic ''[[Pariśiṣṭa#Atharvaveda|Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa]]'' and in the post-Vedic ''Atharvashirsha'' [[Upanishads|Upanishad]]. The [[Gopal Bansa]] was the oldest dynasty to be mentioned in various texts as the earliest rulers of the central Himalayan kingdom known by the name ''. The Gopalas were followed by [[Kirata Kingdom|Kiratas]] who ruled for over 16 centuries by some accounts. According to the [[Mahabharata]], the then Kirata king went to take part in the [[Battle of Kurukshetra]]. 

Around 600 BC, small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of . From one of these, the [[Shakya]] polity, arose a prince who later renounced his status to lead an ascetic life, founded [[Buddhism]], and came to be known as [[Gautama Buddha]] (traditionally dated 563–483 BC).  came to be established as a land of spirituality and refuge in the intervening centuries, played an important role in transmitting Buddhism to [[East Asia]] via Tibet, and helped preserve Hindu and Buddhist manuscripts.

By 250 BC, the southern regions had come under the influence of the [[Maurya Empire]]. [[Emperor Ashoka]] made a pilgrimage to [[Lumbini]] and [[Pillars of Ashoka|erected a pillar]] at Buddha's birthplace, the [[Lumbini pillar inscription|inscriptions]] on which mark the starting point for properly recorded history of .{{sfn|Landon|1928|p=11}} Ashoka also visited the Kathmandu valley and built monuments commemorating Gautama Buddha's visit there. By the 4th century AD, much of  was under the influence of the [[Gupta Empire]].{{efn|On [[Samudragupta]]'s [[Allahabad Pillar]],  is mentioned as a border country.}}

In the Kathmandu valley, the Kiratas were pushed eastward by the [[Licchavi (tribe)|Licchavis]], and the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi dynasty]] came into power {{circa}} 400 AD. The Lichchhavis built monuments and left a series of inscriptions; 's history of the period is pieced together almost entirely from them.{{sfn|Landon|1928|p=19}} In 641, [[Songtsen Gampo]] of the [[Tibetan Empire]] sends [[Narendradeva]] back to [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi]] with an army and subjugates . Parts of  and Licchavi was later under the direct influences of the Tibetan empire. The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late 8th century and was followed by a [[Thakuri]] rule. Thakuri kings ruled over the country up to the middle of the 11th century AD; not much is known of this period that is often called the dark period.

=== Medieval  ===
[[File: Sinja_Valley, Karnali.jpg| thumb|upright=0.8|[[Sinja Valley]], thought to be the place of origin of the [[Khas]]as and the [[Nepali language]], was at the heart of the Khas Malla empire.]]
In the 11th century, a [[Khasa Kingdom|powerful empire]] of [[Khas people]] emerged in western  whose territory at its highest peak included much of western  as well as parts of western Tibet and [[Uttarakhand]] of . By the 14th century, the empire had splintered into loosely associated {{transliteration|ne|[[Baise rajya]]s}}, literally 22 states) as they were counted. The rich culture and language of the Khas people spread throughout  and as far as Indo- in the intervening centuries; [[Khas language|their language]], later renamed the Nepali language, became the lingua franca of  as well as much of North-east .

In south-eastern  on the border with Bihar, [[Simraungadh (medieval city)|Simraungadh]] was the capital of the [[Karnats of Mithila]] around 1100 AD, and the unified Tirhut stood as a powerful kingdom for more than 200 years, even ruling over Kathmandu for a time.{{sfn|Landon|1928|pp=32–33}} After another 300 years of Muslim rule, Tirhut came under the control of the [[Senas of Makwanpur]]. In the eastern hills, a confederation of Kirat principalities ruled the area between Kathmandu and [[Bengal]].

[[File:Patan Durbar Square-2644.jpg| thumb|left|upright=0.8| [[Patan Durbar Square]], one of the three palace squares in the Kathmandu Valley, was built by the Mallas in the 17th century. The Durbar Squares are a culmination of over a millennium of development in Nepali art and architecture.]]
In the Kathmandu valley, the [[Malla ()|Mallas]], who make several appearances in  history since ancient times, had established themselves in Kathmandu and Patan by the middle of the 14th century. The Mallas ruled the valley first under the suzerainty of Tirhut but established independent reign by late 14th century as Tirhut went into decline. In the late 14th century, [[Jayasthiti Malla]] introduced widespread socio-economic reforms, principal of which was the caste system. By dividing the indigenous non-Aryan Buddhist population into castes modelled after the four [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna system]] of Hinduism, he provided an influential model for the Sanskritisation and Hinduisation of the indigenous non-Hindu tribal populations in all principalities throughout . By the middle of the 15th century, Kathmandu had become a powerful empire which, according to [[William Kirkpatrick (East  Company officer)|Kirkpatrick]], extended from Digarchi or [[Shigatse]] in Tibet to Tirhut and [[Gaya, |Gaya]] in .{{sfn|Landon|1928|p=39}} 

In the late 15th century, Malla princes divided their kingdom in four – Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur in the valley and Banepa to the east. The competition for prestige among these brotherly kingdoms saw the flourishing of art and architecture in central , and the building of famous [[Kathmandu Durbar Square|Kathmandu]], [[Patan Durbar Square|Patan]] and [[Bhaktapur Durbar Square]]s; their division and mistrust led to their fall in the late 18th century, and ultimately, the unification of  into a modern state.{{sfn|Landon|1928|pp=52–61}}

Apart from one destructive sacking of Kathmandu valley in the mid 14th century,  remains largely untouched by the [[Muslim invasion of ]] that began in the 11th century. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal period]] saw an influx of high-caste Hindus from  into . They soon intermingled with the Khas people and by the 16th century, there were about 50 Rajput-ruled principalities in , including the 22 (Baisi) states and, to their east in west-central , 24 [[Chaubisi rajya|''Chaubisi'' states]]. There emerged a view that  remained the true bastion of unadulterated Hinduism at a time when  culture had been influenced by centuries of Mughal, followed by [[ Raj| rule]]. [[Gorkha Kingdom|Gorkha]], one of the Baisi states, emerged as an influential and ambitious kingdom with a reputation for justice, after it codified the first Hinduism-based laws in the  hills.

In the mid-18th century, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], a [[Gurkha|Gorkha]] king, set out to put together what would become present-day . He embarked on his mission by securing the neutrality of the bordering mountain kingdoms. After several bloody battles and sieges, notably the [[Battle of Kirtipur]], he managed to conquer the Kathmandu Valley in 1769.
The Gorkha control reached its height when the [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] and [[Garhwal Kingdom]]s in the west to [[Sikkim]] in the east came under  control. A dispute with [[Tibet]] over the control of mountain passes and inner Tingri valleys of Tibet prompted the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Emperor]] of  to start the [[Sino- War|Sino-Nepali War]] compelling the Nepali to retreat to their own borders in the north.{{sfn|Landon|1928|pp=68–69}} The rivalry between the Kingdom of  and the [[East  Company]] over the control of states bordering  eventually led to the [[Anglo- War|Anglo-Nepali War]] (1815–16). At first, the  underestimated the Nepali and were soundly defeated until committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing. Thus began the reputation of [[Gurkha]]s as fierce and ruthless soldiers. The war ended in the [[Sugauli Treaty]], under which  ceded recently captured lands.{{sfn|Landon|1928|pp=75–80}}

Factionalism inside the royal family led to a period of instability. In 1846, a plot was discovered revealing that the reigning queen had planned to overthrow Jung Bahadur Kunwar, a fast-rising military leader. This led to the [[Kot massacre]]; armed clashes between military personnel and administrators loyal to the queen led to the execution of several hundred princes and chieftains around the country. Bir Narsingh Kunwar emerged victoriously and founded the [[Rana dynasty]], and came to be known as [[Jung Bahadur Rana]]. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Ranas were staunchly pro- and assisted them during the [[ Rebellion of 1857]] (and later in both World Wars). In 1860 some parts of the western Terai region were gifted to  by the  as a friendly gesture because of its military help to sustain  control in  during the rebellion (known as ''[[Naya Muluk]]'', new country). In 1923, the [[]] and  formally signed [[–Britain Treaty of 1923|an agreement of friendship]] that superseded the Sugauli Treaty of 1816.

The Hindu practice of [[Sati (practice)|Sati]], in which a widow sacrificed herself in the funeral pyre of her husband, was banned in 1919, and [[History of slavery in Asia|slavery]] was officially abolished in 1924.{{sfn|Hutt|2004|p=22}} Rana rule was marked by tyranny, [[wikt:debauchery|debauchery]], economic exploitation and religious persecution.

=== Contemporary history ===
In the late 1940s, newly emerging pro-democracy movements and political parties in  were critical of the Rana autocracy. Following the success of [[ Independence Movement]] which  activists had taken part in, with 's support and cooperation of King Tribhuvan, [[Nepali Congress]] was successful in toppling the Rana regime, establishing a parliamentary democracy. After a decade of power wrangling between the king and the government, [[Mahendra of |King Mahendra]] (ruled 1955–1972) scrapped the democratic experiment in 1960, and a "partyless" [[Panchayat ()|Panchayat]] system was made to govern . The political parties were banned and politicians imprisoned or exiled.{{sfn|Hutt|2004|pp=3–7}} The Panchayat rule modernised the country, introducing reforms and developing infrastructure, but curtailed liberties and imposed heavy [[Censorship in |censorship]]. In 1990, the [[People's Movement I (1990)|People's Movement]] forced [[Birendra of |King Birendra]] (ruled 1972–2001) to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty democracy.{{sfn|Hutt|2004|pp=3–7}}

In 1996, the [[Unified Communist Party of  (Maoist)|Maoist Party]] started a violent bid to replace the royal parliamentary system with a people's republic.{{sfn|Hutt|2004|pp=3–7}} This led to the long [[ Civil War]] and more than 16,000 deaths. With the death of both the King and the Crown Prince in a [[ royal massacre|massacre in the royal palace]], King Birendra's brother [[Gyanendra of |Gyanendra]] inherited the throne in 2001{{sfn|Hutt|2004|pp=3–7}} and subsequently assumed full executive powers aiming to quash the Maoist insurgency himself.

The Maoist Party joined mainstream politics following the success of the peaceful [[2006  revolution|democratic revolution of 2006]];  became a [[secular state]], and on 28 May 2008, it was declared a federal republic, ending its time-honoured status as the world's only [[Hindu king]]dom. After a decade of instability and internal strife which saw two constituent assembly elections, the [[Constitution of |new constitution]] was promulgated on 20 September 2015, making  a [[Federated state|federal]] democratic republic divided into [[Provinces of |seven provinces]].

====2025 protests and government crisis====
[[File:2025  Gen Z protesters infront of Bharatpur mahanagarpalika office.jpg|thumb|Angry protesters and rioters in [[Kathmandu]] during the [[2025  Gen Z protests]].]]
Between March and June 2025, a half-dozen [[2025  pro-monarchy protests|pro-monarchy protests]] took place in Kathmandu, in favour of restoring the old [[Kingdom of ]], with the former King [[Gyanendra of |Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah]] as its head.

On 19 February 2025, a public holiday commemorating the [[1951  revolution|1951 Revolution]], Shah delivered a video speech which discussed widespread frustrations with the ruling communist government. While he stopped short of explicitly calling for a restoration of the monarchy, the speech's emphasis on unity and sacrifice was interpreted by some as hinting at a possible royal revival. 

On 9 March 2025, thousands of supporters welcomed Shah as he arrived in Kathmandu. A spokesperson for the pro-monarchy [[Rastriya Prajatantra Party]] stated the turnout "shows how frustrated the people are with the present government, and they are in search of an alternative to the present system."

In September 2025, [[2025_Nepalese_Gen_Z_protests|widespread protests]] over a social media ban and economic inequality led to rioting that killed or injured dozens of people, damaged Parliament and other buildings, and brought about the resignation of Prime Minister [[KP Sharma Oli]], who fled the country. In response to the crisis, the [[Nepali Army|Nepali army]] assumed control of nationwide security and engaged in talks with protest leaders, who selected former chief justice [[Sushila Karki]] as interim prime minister.
