At Aybut Al Auwal, in the [[Dhofar|Dhofar Governorate]] of , a site was discovered in 2011 containing more than 100 surface scatters of stone tools, belonging to a regionally specific African [[lithic industry]]—the late [[Nubia]]n Complex—known previously only from the northeast and [[Horn of Africa]]. Two optically stimulated luminescence age estimates place the Arabian Nubian Complex at 106,000 years old. This supports the proposition that early human populations moved from Africa into Arabia during the [[Late Pleistocene]].

In recent years{{when|date=April 2025}} surveys have uncovered Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites on the eastern coast. Main Palaeolithic sites include Saiwan-Ghunaim in the Barr al-Hikman. Archaeological remains are particularly numerous for the Bronze Age [[Umm an-Nar]] and [[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq]] periods. At the archaeological sites of Bat, Al-Janah, and Al-Ayn wheel-turned pottery, hand-made stone vessels, metals industry artifacts, and monumental architecture have been preserved.

=== Ancient history ===

==== Magan civilisation ====
{{Main|Magan (civilization)}}

[[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] tablets referred to  as "[[Magan (civilization)|Magan]]" and in the [[Akkadian language]] "Makan", a name that links 's ancient copper resources. This is a clear reference to the Magan civilisation, an ancient region in what is now modern day  and [[]], which was referred to in [[Sumer]]ian [[Cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] texts of around 2300 BCE and existed until 550 BCE as a source of [[copper]] and [[diorite]] for [[Mesopotamia]].

==== Iron Age to pre-Islamic period ====
There is considerable agreement in sources that [[frankincense]] was used by traders in 1500 BCE. The [[Land of Frankincense]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], dramatically illustrates that the incense constituted testimony to [[South Arabia]]n civilisations.

During the 8th century BCE, it is believed that the Yaarub, the descendant of [[Qahtanite|Qahtan]], ruled the entire region of , including . Wathil bin Himyar bin [[Sheba|Abd-Shams (Saba)]] bin Yashjub ([[|Yaman]]) bin Yarub bin [[Joktan|Qahtan]] later ruled . It is thus believed that the Yaarubah were the first settlers in  from .

In the 1970s and 1980s, scholars like [[John C. Wilkinson]] believed by virtue of oral history that in the 6th century BCE, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] exerted control over the  peninsula, most likely ruling from a coastal centre such as [[Suhar]]. Central  has its own indigenous Samad Late Iron Age cultural assemblage named eponymously from [[Samad al-Shan]]. In the northern part of the  Peninsula the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|Recent Pre-Islamic Period]] begins in the 3rd century BCE and extends into the 3rd century CE. Whether or not Persians brought south-eastern Arabia under their control is a moot point, since the lack of Persian archeological finds speak against this belief. [[Armand-Pierre Caussin de Perceval]] suggests that Shammir bin Wathil bin Himyar recognised the authority of [[Cyrus the Great]] over  in 536 BCE.

===Azd tribal migration===
Over centuries, tribes from western Arabia settled in ; they made a living by fishing, farming, herding or stock breeding. Further, many present-day  families trace their ancestral roots to other parts of Arabia. Arab migration to  started from northern-western and south-western Arabia and those who chose to settle had to compete with the indigenous population for the best arable land. When Arab tribes started to migrate to , there were two distinct groups. One group, a segment of the [[Azd]] tribe migrated from [[]] in 120/200 CE following the collapse of [[Marib Dam]], while the other group migrated a few centuries before the birth of Islam from [[Nejd]] (present-day [[]]), named [[Nizar ibn Ma'ad|Nizari]]. Other historians believe that the Yaarubah from Qahtan, which belong to an older branch, were the first settlers of  from , and then came the Azd. 
[[File:Ruins6.JPG|thumb|200px|right|upright|Ruins of [[Khor Rori]], built between 100 [[Before Common Era|BCE]] and 100 [[Common Era|CE]]]]
The Azd settlers in  are descendants of Nasr bin Azd and were later known as "the Al-Azd of ". Seventy years after the first Azd migration, another branch of [[Azd|Alazdi]] under Malik bin Fahm, the founder of Kingdom of [[Tanukhids|Tanukhites]] on the west of [[Euphrates]], is believed to have settled in . According to Al-Kalbi, Malik bin Fahm was the first settler of Alazd. He is said to have first settled in [[Qalhat]]. By this account, Malik, with an armed force of more than 6000 men and horses, fought against the [[Marzban]], who served an ambiguously named Persian king in the battle of Salut in  and eventually defeated the Persian forces.{{sfn|Maisel|Shoup|2009|p=193}} This account is, however, semi-legendary and seems to condense multiple centuries of migration and conflict as well as an amalgamation of various traditions from not only the Arab tribes but also the region's original inhabitants.

During the 7th century CE, Omanis came in contact with and accepted [[Islam]]. The conversion of Omanis to Islam is ascribed to [[Amr ibn al-As]], who was sent by the prophet [[Muhammad]] during the [[Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha (Hisma)]]. Amr was dispatched to meet with Jaifer and Abd, the sons of Julanda who ruled . They appear to have readily embraced Islam.

===Imamate of ===
{{Main|Imamate of }}

 [[Azd]] used to travel to [[Basra]] for trade, which was a centre of Islam, during the [[Umayyad]] empire.  Azd were granted a section of Basra, where they could settle and attend to their needs. Many of the  Azd who settled in Basra became wealthy merchants and, under their leader [[al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra]], started to expand their influence of power eastwards towards [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. [[Ibadism]] originated in Basra through its founder, [[Abdallah ibn Ibad|Abd Allah ibn Ibad]], around the year 650; the  Azd in  would subsequently adopt this as their predominant faith. Later, [[Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf|al-Hajjaj]], the governor of , came into conflict with the Ibadis, which forced them back to . Among those who returned was the scholar [[Jābir ibn Zayd|Jaber bin Zaid]]. His return (and the return of many other scholars) greatly enhanced the Ibadhi movement in . Alhajjaj also made an attempt to subjugate , then ruled by Suleiman and Said (the sons of Abbad bin Julanda). Alhajjaj dispatched Mujjaah bin Shiwah, who was confronted by Said bin Abbad. This confrontation devastated Said's army, after which he and his forces retreated to the [[Jebel Akhdar ()|Jebel Akhdar]] (mountains). Mujjaah and his forces went after Said, successfully flushing them out from hiding in Wadi Mastall. Mujjaah later moved towards the coast, where he confronted Suleiman bin Abbad. The battle was won by Suleiman's forces. Alhajjaj, however, sent another force (under Abdulrahman bin Suleiman); he eventually won the war, taking over the governance of .
[[File:Bahla Fort-109699.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Bahla Fort]], a UNESCO World Heritage site, was built between 12th and 15th c. by the [[Nabhani dynasty]].]]
The first elective [[Imamate of ]] is believed to have been established shortly after the fall of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Dynasty]] in 750/755 CE, when Janaħ bin ʕibadah Alħinnawi was elected. Other scholars claim that Janaħ bin Ibadah served as a [[Wāli]] (governor) under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] dynasty (and later ratified the Imamate), and that Julanda bin Masud was the first elected Imam of , in 751 CE. The first Imamate reached its peak power in the ninth century CE. The Imamate established a maritime empire whose fleet controlled the Gulf, during the time when trade with the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Dynasty]], the Far East, and Africa flourished. The authority of the Imams started to decline due to power struggles, the constant interventions of Abbasid, and the rise of the [[Seljuk Empire]].

===Nabhani dynasty===
{{further|Nabhani dynasty}}
During the 11th and 12th centuries, the  coast was in the sphere of influence of the [[Seljuk Empire]]. They were expelled in 1154, when the Nabhani dynasty came to power. The Nabhanis ruled as ''muluk'', or kings, while the Imams were reduced to largely symbolic significance. The capital of the dynasty was [[Bahla]]. The Banu Nabhan controlled the trade in frankincense on the overland route via [[Sohar]] to the [[Yabrin]] oasis, and then north to , Baghdad and Damascus. The mango-tree was introduced to  during the time of Nabhani dynasty, by ElFellah bin Muhsin. The Nabhani dynasty started to deteriorate in 1507 when  colonisers captured the coastal city of [[Muscat, |Muscat]], and gradually extended their control along the coast up to [[Sohar]] in the north and down to [[Sur, |Sur]] in the southeast. Other historians argue that the Nabhani dynasty ended earlier in 1435 CE when conflicts between the dynasty and Alhinawis arose, which led to the restoration of the elective Imamate.

===  era ===
{{Main|Battle of the Gulf of }}

[[File:Seydi Ali-Ambush.png|thumb|right|The [[ Empire]] ruled [[Muscat|]] for 143 years (1507–1650)]]

A decade after [[Vasco da Gama]] succeeded in his voyage around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and to  in 1497–1498, the  arrived in  and [[Capture of Muscat (1507)|occupied Muscat]] for a 143-year period, from 1507 to 1650. In need of an outpost to protect their sea lanes, the  built up and fortified the city. Remnants of  architectural style still exist. Later, several more  cities were colonised in the early 16th century by the , to control the entrances of the [[Persian Gulf]] and trade in the region as part of a web of fortresses in the region, from [[Basra]] to [[Hormuz Island]].

However, in 1552 an [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman fleet]] briefly [[Capture of Muscat (1552)|captured the fort in Muscat]], during their fight for control of the Persian Gulf and the  Ocean, but soon departed after destroying the surroundings of the fortress.

Later in the 17th century, using its bases in ,  engaged in the [[Battle off Hormuz (1625)|largest naval battle ever fought in the Persian Gulf]]. The [[ Empire|]] force fought against a combined armada of the [[ East  Company]] (VOC) and [[ East  Company]] supported by the Safavid empire. The result of the battle was a draw but it resulted in the loss of  influence in the Gulf.

===Yaruba dynasty (1624–1744)===
{{further| Empire}}
[[File:Areas under  influence 18th-19th century.svg|thumb|Following the expulsion of the [[ Empire]],  became one of the powers in the western  Ocean from 1698 onwards.]]
The [[Ottoman Empire]] temporarily captured Muscat from the  again in 1581 and held it until 1588. During the 17th century, the Omanis were reunited by the [[Yaruba dynasty|Yaruba Imams]]. Nasir bin Murshid became the first Yaarubah Imam in 1624, when he was elected in Rustaq. Imam Nasir and his successor succeeded in the 1650s in expelling the  from their coastal domains in . The Omanis over time established a maritime empire that pursued the  and expelled them from all their possessions in East Africa, which were then incorporated into the  domains. To capture Zanzibar [[Saif bin Sultan]], the [[Imam]] of , pressed down the [[Swahili Coast]]. A major obstacle to his progress was [[Fort Jesus]], housing the garrison of a  settlement at [[Mombasa]]. After a two-year siege, the fort fell to Imam Saif bin Sultan in 1698. Saif bin Sultan occupied  in 1700.  The rivalry within the house of Yaruba over power after the death of Imam Sultan in 1718 weakened the dynasty. With the power of the Yaruba Dynasty dwindling, Imam Saif bin Sultan II eventually asked for help against his rivals from [[Nader Shah]] of Persia. A Persian force arrived in March 1737 to aid Saif. From their base at Julfar, the Persian forces eventually rebelled against the Yaruba in 1743. The Persian empire then tried to take possession of the coast of  until 1747.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
[[File:Dares 222.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Palace Museum, Zanzibar|Sultan's Palace]] in [[Zanzibar]], which was once 's capital and residence of its sultans]]
After the Omanis expelled the [[Persians]], [[Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi|Ahmed bin Sa'id Albusaidi]] became the elected Imam of  on 20 November 1744, with [[Rustaq]] serving as the capital. His dynasty, the Al Bu Said, continues to rule  into the year 2025. Since the revival of the Imamate, the Omanis continued with the elective system but, provided that the person is deemed qualified, gave preference to a member of the ruling family.

Following Imam Ahmed's death in 1783, his son, [[Said bin Ahmad Al Busaidi|Said bin Ahmed]] became the elected Imam. Said's son, [[Hamad bin Said|Hamed bin Said]], overthrew the governor of Muscat and soon obtained the possession of most of the fortress' in the region, giving himself the title of "Seyyid". Afterwards, Seyyid [[Sultan bin Ahmad|Sultan bin Ahmed]], the uncle of Seyyid Hamed, took over power. Sultan's son, Seyyid [[Said bin Sultan]] succeeded him. 

During the entire 19th century, in addition to Imam Said bin Ahmed who retained the title until he died in 1803, [[Azzan bin Qais]] was the only elected Imam of . His rule started in 1868. However, the British refused to accept Imam Azzan as a ruler, as he was viewed as inimical to their interests. This view played an instrumental role in supporting the deposition of Imam Azzan in 1871 by his cousin, [[Turki bin Said|Sayyid Turki]], a son of the late Sayyid Said bin Sultan, and brother of [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Sultan Barghash of Zanzibar]], who Britain deemed to be more acceptable. 

's Imam Sultan, defeated ruler of Muscat, was granted sovereignty over [[Gwadar]], an area of modern-day .

==== British protectorate status ====
The [[British Empire]] was keen to dominate southeast Arabia to stifle the growing power of other European states and to curb the  maritime power that grew during the 17th century. The British empire over time, starting from the late 18th century, began to establish a series of treaties with the sultans with the objective of advancing British political and economic interest in Muscat, while granting the sultans military protection. In 1798, the first treaty between the British [[East  Company]] and the Albusaidi dynasty was signed by Sayyid Sultan bin Ahmed. The treaty aimed to block commercial competition of the  and the  as well as obtain a concession to build a British factory at [[Bandar Abbas]]. A second treaty was signed in 1800, which stipulated that a British representative shall reside at the port of Muscat and manage all external affairs with other states. As the  Empire weakened, the British influence over Muscat grew throughout the nineteenth century.

In 1854, a deed of cession of the  [[Kuria Muria]] islands to Britain was signed by the sultan of Muscat and the British government. The British government achieved predominating control over Muscat, which, for the most part, impeded competition from other nations. Between 1862 and 1892, the Political Residents, [[Lewis Pelly]] and Edward Ross, played an instrumental role in securing British supremacy over the Persian Gulf and Muscat by a system of indirect governance. By the end of the 19th century, and with the loss of its African dominions and its revenues, British influence increased to the point that the sultans became heavily dependent on British loans and signed declarations to consult the British government on all important matters. The Sultanate thus came ''de facto'' under the British sphere.

Zanzibar was a valuable property as the main [[ Ocean slave trade|slave market]] of the Swahili Coast as well as being a major producer of cloves, and became an increasingly important part of the  empire, a fact reflected by the decision of the Sayyid [[Sa'id ibn Sultan|Sa'id bin Sultan]], to make it the capital of the empire in 1837. In 1856, under British arbitration, Zanzibar and Muscat became two different sultanates.

==== Treaty of Seeb ====
[[File:Maskat &  map.png|thumb|left|The split between the interior region (orange) and the coastal region (red) of  and Muscat]]
The [[Hajar Mountains]], of which the [[Jebel Akhdar ()|Jebel Akhdar]] is a part, separate the country into two distinct regions: the interior, and the coastal area dominated by the capital, Muscat.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}} The British imperial development over Muscat and  during the 19th century led to the renewed revival of the cause of the Imamate in the interior of , which has appeared in cycles for more than 1,200 years in . The British Political Agent, who resided in Muscat, owed the alienation of the interior of  to the vast influence of the British government over Muscat, which he described as being completely self-interested and without any regard to the social and political conditions of the locals. In 1913, Imam Salim Alkharusi instigated an anti-Muscat rebellion that lasted until 1920 when the Sultanate established peace with the Imamate by signing the [[Treaty of Seeb]]. The treaty was brokered by Britain, which had no economic interest in the interior of  during that point of time. The treaty granted autonomous rule to the Imamate in the interior of  and recognised the sovereignty of the coast of , the [[Muscat and |Sultanate of Muscat]]. In 1920, Imam Salim Alkharusi died and Muhammad Alkhalili was elected.

On 10 January 1923, an agreement between the Sultanate and the British government was signed in which the Sultanate had to consult with the British [[Political officer (British Empire)|political agent]] residing in Muscat and obtain the approval of the [[British Raj|High Government of ]] to extract oil in the Sultanate. On 31 July 1928, the [[Red Line Agreement]] was signed between Anglo-Persian Company (later renamed British Petroleum), Royal /Shell, Compagnie Française des Pétroles (later renamed Total), Near East Development Corporation (later renamed ExxonMobil) and Calouste Gulbenkian (an  businessman) to collectively produce oil in the post-[[Ottoman Empire]] region, which included the Arabian peninsula, with each of the four major companies holding 23.75 percent of the shares while [[Calouste Gulbenkian]] held the remaining 5 percent shares. The agreement stipulated that none of the signatories was allowed to pursue the establishment of oil concessions within the agreed on area without including all other stakeholders. In 1929, the members of the agreement established [[ Petroleum Company]] (IPC). On 13 November 1931, Sultan Taimur bin Faisal abdicated.

=== Reign of Sultan Said (1932–1970) ===
[[File:Said bin Taimur (cropped).png|thumb|right|upright|Sultan [[Said bin Taimur]] ruled from 1932 to 1970]]
[[Said bin Taimur]] became the sultan of Muscat officially on 10 February 1932. The rule of sultan Said, a very complex character, was backed by the British government, and has been characterised as being [[feudal]], [[reactionary]] and isolationist. The British government maintained vast administrative control over the Sultanate as the defence secretary and chief of intelligence, chief adviser to the sultan and all ministers except for two were British. In 1937, an agreement between the sultan and [[ Petroleum Company]] (IPC), a consortium of oil companies that was 23.75% British owned, was signed to grant oil concessions to IPC. After failing to discover oil in the Sultanate, IPC was intensely interested in some promising geological formations near [[Fahud]], an area located within the Imamate. IPC offered financial support to the sultan to raise an armed force against any potential resistance by the Imamate.

Upon the outbreak of [[World War II]], the sultan of  declared war on  on September 10, 1939. During the war,  had a strategic role in the defence of the 's trade routes.  was never attacked during the war. In 1943, the [[Royal Air Force]] established stations on [[Masirah Island]] ([[RAF Masirah]]) and at [[Ras al Hadd]]. [[Air-sea rescue]] units were also stationed in . [[No. 244 Squadron RAF]] flew [[Bristol Blenheim V]] [[light bomber]]s and [[Vickers Wellington XIII]]s out of RAF Masirah on anti-submarine duties in the Gulf of  and the northern [[Arabian Sea]], while [[No. 209 Squadron RAF]], [[No. 265 Squadron RAF]], and [[No. 321 Squadron RAF]] flew [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]]s out of Umm Ruşayş on Masirah Island. On October 16, 1943, the  [[U-Boat]] ''[[ submarine U-533|U-533]]'' was sunk in the Gulf of  after being struck by [[depth charge]]s dropped by a Bristol Blenheim from No. 244 Squadron RAF. The wreck settled at a depth of 108 meters (354 feet) approximately 25 nautical miles (46 kilometres) off the [[Fujairah]] coast. 52 crew members died, with the sole survivor, ''[[Matrosengefreiter]]'' Günther Schmidt, taken aboard HMIS ''Hiravati'' near [[Khor Fakkan]] and made a [[prisoner of war]]. The wreck is now a popular recreational diving site.

The December 1951 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation (covering commerce, oil reserves and navigation) between  and the  recognised the Sultanate of Muscat and  as a fully independent state.

In 1955, the [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] coastal [[Makran]] strip acceded to  and was made a district of its [[Balochistan ()|Balochistan province]], while [[Gwadar]] remained in . On 8 September 1958,  [[Gwadar Purchase|purchased the Gwadar enclave]] from  for [[ dollar|US$]]3&nbsp;million. Gwadar then became a [[tehsil]] in the Makran district.

====Jebel Akhdar War====
{{further|Jebel Akhdar War}}
Sultan Said bin Taimur expressed his interest in occupying the Imamate right after the death of Imam Alkhalili, thus taking advantage of any potential instability that might occur within the Imamate when elections were due, to the British government. The British political agent in Muscat believed that the only method of gaining access to the oil reserves in the interior was by assisting the sultan in taking over the Imamate. In 1946, the British government offered arms and ammunition, auxiliary supplies and officers to prepare the sultan to attack the interior of . In May 1954, Imam Alkhalili died and [[Ghalib Alhinai]] was elected Imam. Relations between the Sultan Said bin Taimur, and Imam Ghalib Alhinai frayed over their dispute about oil concessions.

In December 1955, Sultan Said bin Taimur sent troops of the Muscat and  Field Force to occupy the main centres in , including [[Nizwa]], the capital of the Imamate of , and [[Ibri]]. The Omanis in the interior led by Imam Ghalib Alhinai, Talib Alhinai, the brother of the Imam and the Wali (governor) of Rustaq, and Suleiman bin Hamyar, who was the Wali (governor) of Jebel Akhdar, defended the Imamate in the [[Jebel Akhdar War]] against British-backed attacks by the Sultanate. In July 1957, the Sultan's forces were withdrawing, but they were repeatedly ambushed, sustaining heavy casualties. Sultan Said, however, with the intervention of British infantry (two companies of the [[Cameronians ( Rifles)|Cameronians]]), armoured car detachments from the British Army and [[RAF]] aircraft, was able to suppress the rebellion. The Imamate's forces retreated to the inaccessible [[Jebel Akhdar ()|Jebel Akhdar]].

Colonel [[David Smiley]], who had been seconded to organise the Sultan's Armed Forces, managed to isolate the mountain in autumn 1958 and found a route to the plateau from Wadi Bani Kharus. On 4 August 1957, the British Foreign Secretary gave the approval to carry out air strikes without prior warning to the locals residing in the interior of . Between July and December 1958, the British RAF made 1,635 raids, dropping 1,094 tons and firing 900 rockets at the interior of  targeting insurgents, mountain top villages, water channels and crops. On 27 January 1959, the Sultanate's forces occupied the mountain in a surprise operation. Imam Ghalib, his brother Talib and Sulaiman managed to escape to [[]], where the Imamate's cause was promoted until the 1970s. The exiled partisans of the now abolished Imamate of  presented the case of  to the [[Arab League]] and the United Nations. On 11 December 1963, the UN General Assembly decided to establish an Ad-Hoc Committee on  to study the 'Question of ' and report back to the General Assembly. The UN General Assembly adopted the 'Question of ' resolution in 1965, 1966 and again in 1967 that called upon the British government to cease all repressive action against the locals, end British control over  and reaffirmed the inalienable right of the  people to self-determination and independence.

====Dhofar War====
{{further|Dhofar War}}
In the [[Dhofar War]], which began in 1963, pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces were pitted against government troops. As the rebellion threatened the Sultan's control of [[Dhofar]], Sultan Said bin Taimur was deposed in a [[1970  coup d'état|bloodless coup]] in 1970 by his son [[Qaboos bin Said]] with [[|British]] support. Qaboos expanded the [[Sultan of 's Armed Forces]], modernised the state's administration and introduced social reforms. The uprising was finally put down in 1976 with the help of forces from , , ,  and Britain.{{Citation needed|date=August 2025}}

After deposing his father in 1970, [[Sultan Qaboos]] opened up the country, removed "Muscat and" from the country's name, embarked on economic reforms, and followed a policy of modernisation marked by increased spending on health, education and welfare.  invested in the development of the  education system, sending  teachers on its own expense.

In 1981,  became a founding member of the six-nation [[Gulf Cooperation Council]]. Political reforms were eventually introduced. The country adopted its present [[Flag of |national flag]] in 1995, resembling the previous flag but with a thicker stripe. In 1997, a royal decree was issued granting women the right to vote, and stand for election to the Majlis al-Shura, the [[Consultative Assembly of ]]. Two women were duly elected to the body. In 2002, voting rights were extended to all citizens over the age of 21, and the first elections to the Consultative Assembly under the new rules were held in 2003. In 2004, the Sultan appointed 's first female minister with portfolio, [[Aisha bint Khalfan bin Jameel|Sheikha Aisha bint Khalfan bin Jameel al-Sayabiyah]], to the post of National Authority for Industrial Craftsmanship. Despite these changes, there was little change to the actual political makeup of the government. The Sultan continued to rule by decree. Nearly 100 suspected Islamists were arrested in 2005 and 31 people were convicted of trying to overthrow the government. They were ultimately pardoned in June of the same year.

Inspired by the [[Arab Spring]] uprisings that were taking place throughout the region, [[2011  protests|protests occurred in ]] during the early months of 2011. While they did not call for the ousting of the regime, demonstrators demanded political reforms, improved living conditions and the creation of more jobs. They were dispersed by riot police in February 2011. Sultan Qaboos reacted by promising jobs and benefits. In October 2011, elections were held to the Consultative Assembly, to which Sultan Qaboos promised greater powers. The following year, the government began a crackdown on internet criticism. In September 2012, trials began of 'activists' accused of posting "abusive and provocative" criticism of the government online. Six were given jail terms.
