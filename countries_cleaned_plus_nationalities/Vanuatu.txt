===Prehistory===
The history of  before European colonisation is mostly obscure because of the lack of written sources, which predate European contact, and because only limited archaeological work has been conducted; 's volatile geology and climate are also likely to have destroyed or hidden many prehistoric sites. Archaeological evidence gathered since the 1980s supports the theory that the  islands were first settled about 3,000 years ago, in the period roughly between 1100 [[Common Era|BCE]] and 700 BCE.{{sfn|Bedford|Spriggs|2008}} These were almost certainly people of the [[Lapita culture]]. The formerly widespread idea that  might have been only marginally affected by this culture was rendered obsolete by the evidence uncovered in recent decades at numerous sites on most of the islands in the archipelago, ranging from the [[Banks Islands]] in the north to [[Aneityum]] in the south.

Notable Lapita sites include [[Teouma]] on [[Éfaté]], [[Uripiv]], and [[Vao Island|Vao]] off the coast of [[Malakula]], and Makue on [[Aore]]. Several ancient burial sites have been excavated, most notably Teouma on Éfaté, which has a large ancient cemetery containing the remains of 94 individuals. There are also sites – on Éfaté and on the adjacent islands of [[Lelepa Island|Lelepa]] and [[Eretoka]] – associated with the 16th–17th century chief or chiefs called [[Roy Mata]]. (This may be a title held by different men over several generations.) Roy Mata is said to have united local clans and instituted and presided over an era of peace.

The stories about Roy Mata come from local oral tradition and are consistent with centuries-old evidence uncovered at archaeological sites. The Lapita sites became 's first [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 2008.

[[File:Fels Cave Drawings 1.jpg|thumb|Cave drawings, [[Lelepa Island]], associated with the [[Roy Mata]] World Heritage Site]]
The immediate origins of the Lapita lie to the northwest, in the [[ (archipelago)| archipelago]] and the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] of [[]], though DNA studies of a 3,000-year-old skeleton found near [[Port Vila]] in 2016 indicates that some may have arrived directly from the [[]] or [[Taiwan]], pausing only briefly en route. They brought with them crops such as [[yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[taro]], and [[banana]], as well as domesticated animals such as pigs and chickens. Their arrival is coincident with the extinction of several species, such as the [[Mekosuchus|land crocodile]] (''Mekosuchus kalpokasi''), [[Meiolania|land tortoise]] (''Meiolania damelipi'') and various flightless bird species. Lapita settlements reached as far east as [[]] and [[]] at their greatest extent.

Over time, the Lapita culture lost much of its early unity; as such, it became increasingly fragmented, the precise reasons for which are unclear. Over the centuries, pottery, settlement and burial practices in  all evolved in a more localised direction, with long-distance trade and migration patterns contracting. Nevertheless, some limited long-distance trade did continue, with similar cultural practices and late-period items also being found in [[]], [[New Caledonia]], the Bismarcks and the Solomons. Finds in central and southern , such as distinctive adzes, also indicate some trade connections with, and possibly population movements of, Polynesian peoples to the east.

Over time, it is thought that the Lapita either mixed with, or acted as pioneers for, migrants coming from the Bismarks and elsewhere in Melanesia, ultimately producing the darker-skinned physiognomy that is typical of modern Ni-. Linguistically, the Lapita peoples' Austronesian languages were maintained, with all of the numerous 100+ autochthonous [[languages of ]] being classified as belonging to the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] branch of the [[Austronesian language family]].

This linguistic hyperdiversity resulted from a number of factors: continuing waves of migration, the existence of numerous decentralised and generally self-sufficient communities, hostilities between people groups, with none able to dominate any of the others, and the difficult geography of  that impeded inter- and intra-island travel and communication. The geological record also shows that a huge volcanic eruption occurred on [[Ambrym]] in {{Citation needed span|{{Circa|200}}|date=July 2025}} CE, which would have devastated local populations and likely resulted in further population movements. 

[[Human cannibalism]], at least for some parts of , is often mentioned, both by indigenous sources (myths, oral history, popular culture) and by foreign observers. However, its existence and exact prevalence remain to be confirmed with empirical evidence.

===Arrival of Europeans (1606–1906)===
[[File:Pedro Fernández de Quirós.JPG|thumb|upright| explorer [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]] was the first European to arrive in , in 1606. He named [[Espiritu Santo]], the largest island in .]]

The  islands first had contact with Europeans in April 1606, when the [[ people|]] explorer [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], sailing for the [[ Empire| Crown]], departed [[Callao|El Callao]], sailed by the [[Banks Islands]], landing briefly on [[Gaua]] (which he called Santa María). Continuing further south, Queirós arrived at the largest island, naming it {{lang|es|La Austrialia del [[Espíritu Santo]]}} or "The Southern Land of the Holy Spirit", believing he had arrived in [[Terra Australis]] (). The  established a settlement named ''Nueva Jerusalem'' at Big Bay on the north side of the island, but it was a short-lived endeavor.

Regardless of Queirós's intention, relations with the Ni- turned violent within days. The  subsequent attempts to make contact were met with the islanders fleeing or leading the explorers into an ambush. Many of the crew, including Queirós, were also suffering from ill health, with Queirós's mental state also deteriorating. The encampment was abandoned after a month, with Queirós continuing his search for the southern continent.

Europeans did not return until 1768, when the  explorer [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] sailed by the islands on 22 May, naming them the Great [[Cyclades]]. Of the various  toponyms Bougainville devised, only [[Pentecost Island]] has stuck.

The  landed on [[Ambae]], trading with the native people in a peaceful manner, though Bougainville stated that they were later attacked, necessitating him to fire warning shots with his muskets, before his crew left and continued their voyage. In July–September 1774 the islands were explored extensively by  explorer [[Captain James Cook]], who named them the New Hebrides, after the [[Hebrides]] off the west coast of [[Scotland]], a name that lasted until independence in 1980. Cook managed to maintain generally cordial relations with the Ni- by giving them presents and refraining from violence.

In 1789, [[William Bligh]] and the remainder of his crew sailed through the Banks Islands on their return voyage to [[]] following the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|mutiny on the ''Bounty'']]; Bligh later returned to the islands, naming them after his benefactor [[Joseph Banks]].

Whaleships were among the first regular visitors to this group of islands. The first recorded visit was by the ''Rose'' in February 1804, and the last known visit by the New Bedford ship ''John and Winthrop'' in 1887. In 1825, the trader [[Peter Dillon]]'s discovery of [[sandalwood]] on the island of [[Erromango]], highly valued as an incense in [[]] where it could be traded for tea, resulted in rush of incomers that ended in 1830 after a clash between immigrant Polynesian workers and indigenous [[Ni-|Ni-.]]{{sfn|Van Trease|1987|p=12-14}} Further sandalwood trees were found on Efate, Espiritu Santo, and Aneityum, prompting a series of boom and busts, though supplies were essentially exhausted by the mid-1860s, and the trade largely ceased.

During the 1860s, [[plantations|planters]] in , , New Caledonia, and the  islands, in need of labourers, encouraged a long-term [[indentured labour]] trade called "[[blackbirding]]". At the height of the labour trade, more than one-half the adult male population of several of the islands worked abroad. Because of this, and the poor conditions and abuse often faced by workers, as well the introduction of common diseases to which native Ni- had no immunity, the population of  declined severely, with the current population being greatly reduced compared to pre-contact times. Greater oversight of the trade saw it gradually wind down, with  barring any further 'blackbird' labourers in 1906, followed by  and  in 1910 and 1913 respectively.

From 1839 onwards, [[missionary|missionaries]], both [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]], arrived on the islands. At first, they faced hostility, most notably with the killings of [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]] and James Harris of the [[London Missionary Society]] on Erromango in 1839.{{sfn|Van Trease|1987|p=15}} Despite this, they pressed on, resulting in many conversions. To the consternation of the Europeans, Ni- [[syncretism|syncretised]] Christianity with traditional ''[[kastom]]'' beliefs. The Anglican [[Melanesian Mission]] also took young converts for further training in  and [[Norfolk Island]]. Presbyterian missionaries were particularly successful on Aneityum, though less so on Tanna, with missionaries being repeatedly chased off the island by locals throughout the 1840s–60s.  The waves of illnesses and deaths the missionaries brought with them may have been partly to blame for the hostile response.

Other European settlers also came, looking for land for [[cotton plantation]]s, the first of these being [[Henry Ross Lewin]] on Tanna in 1865 (which he later abandoned).{{sfn|Van Trease|1987|p=19}} When international cotton prices collapsed after the ending of the [[ Civil War]], they switched to coffee, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], bananas, and, most successfully, [[coconut]]s. Initially  subjects from  made up the majority of settlers, but with little support from the  government they frequently struggled to make a success of their settlements.

 planters also began arriving, beginning with Ferdinand Chevillard on Efate in 1880, and later in larger numbers following the creation of the ''Compagnie Caledonienne des Nouvelles-Hébrides'' (CCNH) I. 1882 by [[John Higginson (entrepreneur)|John Higginson]] (a fiercely pro- Irishman), which soon tipped the balance in favour of  subjects.{{sfn|Van Trease|1987|p=26-7}} The [[ government]] took over the CCNH in 1894 and actively encouraged  settlement. By 1906,  settlers (at 401) outnumbered the  (228), almost two to one.

===Colonial era (1906–1980)===
{{Main|New Hebrides}}
The jumbling of  and  interests in the islands and the near-lawlessness prevalent there brought petitions for one or both of the two powers to annex the territory. The Convention of 16 October 1887 established the [[Anglo- Joint Naval Commission]] for the sole purpose of protecting  and  citizens, with no claim to jurisdiction over internal native affairs. This commission governed during the period 1887–1889 and again in 1890–1906. For a short period in 1889 to 1890,  [[Franceville, New Hebrides|Franceville]], an area around present-day Port Vila, declared itself an independent commune under the leadership of elected [[mayor]]/[[President (government title)#Sub-national|president]] Ferdinand Chevillard.

Hostilities between settlers and Ni- were commonplace, often centring on disputes over land which had been purchased in dubious circumstances. There was pressure from  settlers in New Caledonia to annex the islands, though Britain was unwilling to relinquish their influence completely.

====Early period (1906–1945)====
[[File:Native men of Tanna, New Hebrides.jpg|thumb|Tanna men on a boat, {{Circa|1905}}]]



As a result, in 1906,  and the  agreed to administer the islands jointly; called the Anglo- [[Condominium (international law)|Condominium]] of the New Hebrides ({{langx|fr|link=yes|Condominium des Nouvelles-Hébrides}}), it was a unique form of government with two separate governmental, legal, judicial and financial systems that came together only in a Joint Court. Land expropriation and exploitation of Ni- workers on plantations continued apace. In an effort to curb the worst of the abuses, and with the support of the missionaries, the Condominium's authority was extended via the Anglo- Protocol of 1914, although this was not formally ratified until 1922. While this resulted in some improvements, labour abuses continued, and Ni- were barred from acquiring the [[citizenship]] of either power, being officially stateless. The underfunded Condominium government proved dysfunctional, with the duplication of administrations making effective governance difficult and time-consuming. Education, healthcare and other such services were left in the hands of the missionaries.

During the 1920s–1930s, indentured workers from [[]] (then part of [[ Indochina]]) came to work in the plantations in the New Hebrides. By 1929, there were some 6,000  people in the New Hebrides. There was some social and political unrest among them in the 1940s due to the poor working conditions and the social effects of Allied troops, who were generally more sympathetic to their plight than the planters. Most  were repatriated in 1946 and 1963, though a small  community remains in  today.

[[File:F6F-3 Hellcats of VF-40 at Espiritu Santo 1944.jpg|thumb|US Navy [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|Hellcats]] on [[Espiritu Santo]] island in February 1944]]
The [[Second World War]] brought immense change to the archipelago. The [[fall of ]] to [[Nazi ]] in 1940 allowed Britain to gain a greater level of authority on the islands. The  military stationed a 2,000-strong force on Malakula in a bid to protect  from a possible  invasion. Following the  [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, the  joined the war on the Allied side;  soon advanced rapidly throughout Melanesia and was in possession of much of what is now  and the  by April 1942, leaving the New Hebrides on the frontline of any further advance. To forestall this, from May 1942 US troops were stationed on the islands, where they built airstrips, roads, military bases and an array of other supporting infrastructure on Efate and Espiritu Santo.

At the peak of the deployment, some 50,000  were stationed on the two military bases, outnumbering the native population of roughly 40,000, with thousands more Allied troops passing through the islands at some point. A small Ni- force of some 200 men (the New Hebrides Defence Force) was established to support the , and thousands more were engaged in the construction and maintenance work as part of the [[ Labor Corps]]. The  presence effectively sidelined the Anglo- authorities for the duration of their stay, with the ' more tolerant and friendly attitude to the Ni-, informal habits, relative wealth, and the presence of African  troops serving with a degree of equality (albeit in a [[Racial segregation in the  Armed Forces|segregated force]]) seriously undermining the underlying ethos of colonial superiority.

Wartime  was the setting for [[James A. Michener|James Michener]]'s novel ''[[Tales of the South Pacific]]''.

With the successful [[ campaign|reoccupation of the Solomons]] in 1943 the New Hebrides lost their strategic importance, and the  withdrew in 1945, selling much of their equipment at bargain prices and dumping the rest in the sea, at a place now called [[Naval Advance Base Espiritu Santo#Million dollar point|Million Dollar Point]] on [[Espiritu Santo]]. The rapid  deployment and withdrawal led to growth in '[[cargo cult]]s', most notably that of [[John Frum]], whereby Ni- hoped that by returning to traditional values whilst mimicking aspects of the  presence that 'cargo' (i.e. large quantities of  goods) would be delivered to them. Meanwhile, the Condominium government returned, though understaffed and underfunded, it struggled to reassert its authority.

====Lead-up to independence (1945–1980)====
[[File:Flag of New Hebrides.svg|thumb|1966 flag of the Anglo- Condominium of the New Hebrides]]

Decolonisation began sweeping the European empires after the war, and from the 1950s the Condominium government began a somewhat belated campaign of modernisation and economic development. Hospitals were built, doctors trained and immunisation campaigns carried out. The inadequate mission-run school system was taken over and improved, with primary enrollment greatly increasing to be near-universal by 1970. There was greater oversight of the plantations, with worker exploitation being clamped down on and Ni- paid higher wages.

New industries, such as [[cattle ranching]], commercial fishing and [[manganese]] mining were established. Ni- began gradually to take over more positions of power and influence within the economy and the church. Despite this, the  and  still dominated the politics of the colony, with an Advisory Council set up in 1957 containing some Ni- representation having little power.

The economic development had unintended consequences. In the 1960s, many planters began fencing off and clearing large areas of bushland for cattle ranching, which were often deemed to be communally-held ''kastom'' lands by Ni-. On Espiritu Santo, the [[Nagriamel]] movement was founded in 1966 by Chief Buluk and [[Jimmy Stevens (politician)|Jimmy Stevens]] on a platform of opposing any further land clearances and gradual, Ni--led, economic development. The movement gained a large following, prompting a crackdown by the authorities, with Buluk and Stevens being arrested in 1967. Upon their release, they began to press for complete independence. In 1971, Father [[Walter Lini]] established another party: the New Hebrides Cultural Association, later renamed the [[New Hebrides National Party]] (NHNP), which also focused on achieving independence and opposition to land expropriation. The NNDP first came to prominence in 1971, when the Condominium government was forced to intervene after a rash of land speculation by foreign nationals.

Meanwhile,  settlers, and Francophone and mixed-race Ni-, established two separate parties on a platform of more gradual political development – the ''Mouvement Autonomiste des Nouvelles-Hébrides'' (MANH), based on Espiritu Santo, and the ''Union des Communautés des Nouvelles-Hébrides'' (UCNH) on Efate. The parties aligned on linguistic and religious lines: the NHNP was seen as the party of Anglophone Protestants, and were backed by the  who wished to exit the colony altogether, whereas the MANH, UCNH, Nagriamel and others (collectively known as the 'Moderates') represented Catholic Francophone interests, and a more gradual path to independence.  backed these groups as they were keen to maintain their influence in the region, most especially in their mineral-rich colony of New Caledonia where they were attempting to suppress an independence movement.

Meanwhile, economic development continued, with numerous banks and financial centres opening up in the early 1970s to take advantage of the territory's [[tax haven]] status. A mini-building boom took off in Port Vila and, following the building of a deep-sea wharf, cruise ship tourism grew rapidly, with annual arrivals reaching 40,000 by 1977. The boom encouraged increasing urbanisation and the populations of Port Vila and [[Luganville]] grew rapidly.

In November 1974, the  and  met and agreed to create [[New Hebrides Representative Assembly]] in the colony, based partly on universal suffrage and partly on appointed persons representing various interest groups. The first [[1975 New Hebridean general election|election]] took place in November 1975, resulting in an overall victory for the NHNP. The Moderates disputed the results, with Jimmy Stevens threatening to secede and declare independence. The Condominium's Resident Commissioners decided to postpone the opening of the Assembly, though the two sides proved unable to agree on a solution, prompting protests and counter-protests, some of which turned violent. After discussions and some fresh elections in disputed areas, the Assembly finally convened in November 1976. The NHNP renamed itself the [[Vanua'aku Pati]] (VP) in 1977, and now supported immediate independence under a strong central government and an [[Anglicisation]] of the islands. The Moderates meanwhile supported a more gradual transition to independence and a federal system, plus the maintenance of  as an official language.

In March 1977, a joint Anglo- and Ni- conference was held in London, at which it was agreed to hold fresh Assembly elections and later an independence referendum in 1980; the VP boycotted the conference and the subsequent [[1977 New Hebridean general election|election]] in November. They set up a parallel 'People's Provisional Government' which had de facto control of many areas, prompting violent confrontations with Moderates and the Condominium government.

A compromise was eventually brokered, a Government of National Unity formed under a new constitution, and fresh [[1979 New Hebridean general election|elections]] held in November 1979, which the VP won with a comfortable majority. Independence was now scheduled for 30 July 1980. Performing less well than expected, the Moderates disputed the results.

[[File:Flag of Vemerana.svg|thumb|right|Flag of the short-lived Republic of Vemarana]]

Tensions continued throughout 1980. Violent confrontations occurred between VP and Moderate supporters on several islands. On Espiritu Santo Nagriamel and Moderate activists under Jimmy Stevens, funded by the  [[libertarian]] organisation [[Phoenix Foundation]], took over the island's government in January and declared the independent Republic of Vemarana, prompting VP supporters to flee and the central government to institute a blockade. In May, an abortive Moderate rebellion broke out on Tanna, in the course of which one of their leaders was shot and killed. The  and  sent in troops in July in a bid to forestall the Vemarana secessionists. Still ambivalent about independence, the  effectively neutered the force, prompting a collapse of law and order on Espiritu Santo resulting in large scale looting.

===Independence (1980–present)===
The New Hebrides, now renamed , achieved independence as planned on 30 July 1980 under Prime Minister [[Walter Lini]], with a ceremonial [[President of |President]] replacing the Resident Commissioners.{{sfn|Shears|1980}} The Anglo- forces withdrew in August, and Lini called in troops from [[]], sparking the brief '[[Coconut War]]' against [[Jimmy Stevens (politician)|Jimmy Stevens]]' Vemarana separatists. The PNG forces quickly quelled the Vemarana revolt and Stevens surrendered on 1 September; he was later jailed. Lini remained in office until 1991, running an Anglophone-dominated government and winning both the 1983 and 1987 elections.

In foreign affairs, Lini joined the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], opposed [[Apartheid]] in  and all forms of colonialism, established links with [[– relations|]] and [[– relations|]], and opposed the  presence in [[New Caledonia]] and their nuclear testing in [[ Polynesia]]. Opposition to Lini's tight grip on power grew and in 1987, after he had suffered a stroke whilst on a visit to the , a section of the [[Vanua'aku Pati]] (VP) under [[Barak Sopé]] broke off to form a new party (the [[Melanesian Progressive Party]], MPP), and an attempt was made by President [[Ati George Sokomanu]] to unseat Lini. This failed, and Lini became increasingly distrustful of his VP colleagues, firing anyone he deemed to be disloyal.

One such person, [[Donald Kalpokas]], subsequently declared himself to be VP leader, splitting the party in two. On 6 September 1991 a vote of no confidence removed Lini from power; Kalpokas became prime minister, and Lini formed a new party, the [[National United Party ()|National United Party]] (NUP). Meanwhile, the economy had entered a downturn, with foreign investors and foreign aid put off by Lini's flirtation with Communist states and tourist numbers down due to the political turmoil, compounded by a crash in the price of [[copra]], 's main export. As a result, the Francophone [[Union of Moderate Parties]] (UMP) won the [[1991  general election|1991 election]], but not with enough seats to form a majority. A coalition was thus formed with Lini's NUP, with the UMP's [[Maxime Carlot Korman]] becoming prime minister.

Since the 1991 general election,  politics have been unstable with a series of fractious coalition governments and the use of [[Motion of no confidence|no confidence votes]] resulting in frequent changes of prime ministers. The democratic system as a whole has been maintained and  remains a peaceful and reasonably prosperous state. Throughout most of the 1990s the UMP were in power, the prime ministership switching between UMP rivals Korman and [[Serge Vohor]], and the UMP instituting a more free market approach to the economy, cutting the public sector, improving opportunities for Francophone Ni- and renewing ties with . The government struggled with splits in their NUP coalition partner and a series of strikes within the Civil Service in 1993–1994, the latter dealt with by a wave of firings. Financial scandals dogged both Korman and Vohor, with the latter implicated in a scheme to sell [[ passport]]s to foreigners.

In 1996, Vohor and President [[Jean-Marie Léyé]] were briefly abducted by the [[ Mobile Force]] over a pay dispute and later released unharmed. A riot occurred in Port Vila in 1998 when savers attempted to withdraw funds from the [[ National Provident Fund]] following allegations of financial impropriety, prompting the government to declare a brief state of emergency. A Comprehensive Reform Program was enacted in the 1998 with the aim of improving economic performance and cracking down on government corruption. At the [[1998  general election]] the UMP were unseated by the VP under Donald Kalpokas. He lasted only a year, resigning when threatened with a no confidence vote, replaced by Barak Sopé of the MPP in 1999, himself unseated in a no confidence vote in 2001. Despite the political uncertainty 's economy continued to grow in this period, fuelled by high demand for  beef, tourism, remittances from foreign workers, and large aid packages from the [[Asian Development Bank]] (in 1997) and the US [[Millennium Challenge Corporation|Millennium Challenge]] fund (in 2005).  was removed from the [[OECD]] list of 'uncooperative tax havens' in 2003 and joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2011.

[[File:Devastation after Cyclone Pam 14 March 2015.jpg|thumb|Devastation caused by [[Cyclone Pam]] in 2015]]
[[Edward Natapei]] of the VP became prime minister in 2001 and went on to win the [[2002  general election]]. The [[2004  general election]] saw Vohor and the UMP return to power. He lost much support over a secret deal to recognise [[Taiwan]] in the [[Political status of Taiwan|-Taiwan dispute]] and was unseated in a confidence vote less than five months after taking office, being replaced by [[Ham Lini]]. Lini switched back recognition to the People's Republic of , and the PRC remains a major aid donor to the  government. In 2007, violent clashes broke out in Port Vila between migrants from Tanna and Ambrym, in which two people died. Lini lost the [[2008  general election]], with Natapei returning to power as  politics entered a period of turmoil. There were frequent attempts by the opposition to unseat Natapei via the use of no confidence votes – though unsuccessful, he was briefly removed on a procedural technicality in November 2009, an action that was then overturned by the Chief Justice. [[Sato Kilman]] of the [[People's Progressive Party ()|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP) ousted Natapei in another no confidence vote in December 2010. He was removed in the same manner by Vohor's UMP in April 2011. This was invalidated on a technical point and he returned as PM. The Chief Justice then overturned his victory. Natapei returned to power for ten days, until Parliament voted in Kilman again. Kilman managed to remain in office for two years, before being ousted in March 2013.

The new government was the first time the [[Green Confederation]] was in power, and the new prime minister, [[Moana Carcasses Kalosil]], was the first non-Ni- to hold the position (Kalosil is of mixed -Tahitian ancestry and a naturalised  citizen). Kalosil took steps to institute a review of diplomatic passport sales in his country. He also expressed his support for the West Papuan independence movement. Support for this move was also expressed by former Prime Ministers Kilman and Carlot Korman. Kalosil was ousted in another confidence vote in 2014, with the VP returning under [[Joe Natuman]], who himself was ousted the following year in a confidence vote led by Kilman. Meanwhile, the country was devastated by [[Cyclone Pam]] in 2015, which resulted in 16 deaths and enormous destruction.

A corruption investigation in 2015 resulted in the conviction of numerous MPs in Kilman's government for bribery, including former PM Moana Carcasses Kalosil. His authority was severely weakened, and Kilman lost the [[2016  general election]] to [[Charlot Salwai]]'s [[Reunification Movement for Change]] (RMC). Salwai in turn lost the [[2020  general election]] amidst allegations of perjury, bringing back in the VP under [[Bob Loughman]] as the country dealt with the aftermath of [[Cyclone Harold]] and the global [[COVID-19 pandemic]].  was one of the last places on Earth to suffer a coronavirus outbreak, recording its first case of COVID-19 in November 2020. In October 2023,  aimed itself at being the first Pacific country to eliminate [[cervical cancer]].

In December 2024, [[2024 Port Vila earthquake|a magnitude 7.3 earthquake]] reportedly damaged almost every single house in [[Efate]], where the capital, [[Port Vila]], is located, resulting in 19 fatalities. The [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] estimated that 116,000 people had been directly affected by the earthquake, equivalent to a third of 's population.
