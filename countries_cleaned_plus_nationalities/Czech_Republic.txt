Archaeological evidence indicates that the area now known as the  has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic era]]. Notably, the [[Venus of Dolní Věstonice]], a ceramic figurine dated to approximately 29,000–25,000 BCE, was discovered in this region. This artifact is considered the oldest known ceramic figurine in the world.

In the [[Classical antiquity|classical era]], as a result of the 3rd century BC [[Celts|Celtic]] migrations, Bohemia became associated with the [[Boii]]. The Boii founded an [[oppidum]] near the site of modern Prague. Later in the 1st century, the Germanic tribes of the [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]] settled there.

[[Slavs]] from the [[Black Sea]]–[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] region settled in the area (their migration was pushed by an invasion of peoples from [[Siberia]] and Eastern Europe into their area: [[Huns]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and [[Hungarians|Magyars]]). In the sixth century, the Huns had moved westwards into Bohemia, Moravia, and some of present-day  and .

During the 7th century, the Frankish merchant [[Samo]], supporting the Slavs fighting against nearby settled [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], became the ruler of the first documented Slavic state in Central Europe, [[Samo's Empire]]. The principality of [[Great Moravia]], controlled by [[Moymirid dynasty|Moymir dynasty]], arose in the 8th century. It reached its zenith in the 9th (during the reign of [[Svatopluk I of Moravia]]), holding off the influence of the Franks. Great Moravia was Christianized, with a role being played by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] mission of [[Cyril and Methodius]]. They codified the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language, the first literary and liturgical language of the [[Slavs]], and the [[Glagolitic script]].

=== Bohemia ===
{{Main|Bohemia}}

[[File:Locator Lands of the Bohemian Crown within the Holy Roman Empire (1618).svg|thumb|left|The [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Crown of Bohemia]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (1600). The  lands were part of the Empire in 1002–1806, and Prague was the imperial seat in 1346–1437 and 1583–1611.]]
The [[Duchy of Bohemia]] emerged in the late 9th century when it was unified by the [[Přemyslid dynasty]]. Bohemia was from 1002 until 1806 an [[Imperial Estate]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

In 1212, [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Přemysl Ottokar I]] extracted the [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] from the emperor, confirming Ottokar and his descendants' royal status; the [[Duchy]] of Bohemia was raised to a [[Realm|Kingdom]]. [[Germans| immigrants]] settled in the Bohemian periphery in the 13th century. The [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] in the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|invasion of Europe]] carried their raids into [[Moravia]] but were defensively defeated at [[Olomouc]].

After a series of dynastic wars, the [[House of ]] gained the Bohemian throne.

Efforts for a [[Bohemian Reformation|reform of the church in Bohemia]] started already in the late 14th century. [[Jan Hus]]' followers seceded from some practices of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Church]] and in the [[Hussite Wars]] (1419–1434) defeated five crusades organized against them by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]]. During the next two centuries, 90% of the population in Bohemia and Moravia were considered [[Hussites]]. The pacifist thinker [[Petr Chelčický]] inspired the movement of the [[Unity of the Brethren ()|Moravian Brethren]] (by the middle of the 15th century) that completely separated from the Roman Catholic Church.

On 21 December 1421, [[Jan Žižka]], a successful military commander and mercenary, led his group of forces in the [[Battle of Kutná Hora]], resulting in a victory for the Hussites. He is honoured to this day as a [[Hero (title)|national hero]].

After 1526, Bohemia came increasingly under [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] control as the Habsburgs became first the elected and then in 1627 the hereditary rulers of Bohemia. Between 1583 and 1611 Prague was the official seat of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] and his court.

The [[Defenestrations of Prague|Defenestration of Prague]] and subsequent revolt against the Habsburgs in 1618 marked the start of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. In 1620, the rebellion in Bohemia was crushed at the [[Battle of White Mountain]] and the ties between Bohemia and the Habsburgs' hereditary lands in  were strengthened. The leaders of the [[Bohemian Revolt]] were [[Old Town Square execution|executed in 1621]]. The nobility and the middle class Protestants had to either convert to Catholicism or leave the country.

The following era of 1620 to the late 18th century became known as the "Dark Age". During the Thirty Years' War, the population of the [[ lands]] declined by a third through the expulsion of  Protestants as well as due to the war, disease and [[Famines in the  lands|famine]]. The Habsburgs prohibited all Christian confessions other than [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. The flowering of [[ Baroque architecture|Baroque culture]] shows the ambiguity of this historical period.
[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] and [[Crimean Khanate|Tatars]] invaded Moravia in 1663. In 1679–1680 the  lands faced the [[Great Plague of Vienna]] and an uprising of serfs.

There were peasant uprisings influenced by famine. [[Serfdom]] was abolished between 1781 and 1848. Several battles of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] took place on the current territory of the .

The end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806 led to degradation of the political status of Bohemia which lost its position of an [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of the Holy Roman Empire as well as its own political representation in the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]. Bohemian lands became part of the [[ Empire]]. During the 18th and 19th century the [[ National Revival]] began its rise, with the purpose to revive [[ language]], culture, and national identity. The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the  Empire|Revolution of 1848]] in Prague, striving for liberal reforms and autonomy of the Bohemian Crown within the  Empire, was suppressed.

It seemed that some concessions would be made also to Bohemia, but in the end, the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of |Franz Joseph I]] affected a compromise with  only. The [[Austro- Compromise of 1867]] and the never realized coronation of Franz Joseph as King of Bohemia led to a disappointment of some  politicians. The Bohemian Crown lands became part of the so-called [[Cisleithania]].

The  Social Democratic and progressive politicians started the fight for universal suffrage. The first elections under [[Universal suffrage|universal male suffrage]] were held in 1907.

=== Czechoslovakia ===
{{Main|History of Czechoslovakia}}[[File:Czechoslovakia I.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[First Czechoslovak Republic]] comprised 27% of the population of the former - and nearly 80% of the industry.|alt=]]In 1918, during the collapse of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] at the end of World War I, the independent republic of [[Czechoslovakia]], which joined the winning Allied powers, was created, with [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] in the lead. This new country incorporated the [[Bohemian Crown]].

The [[First Czechoslovak Republic]] comprised only 27% of the population of the former -, but nearly 80% of the industry, which enabled it to compete with Western industrial states. In 1929 compared to 1913, the gross domestic product increased by 52% and industrial production by 41%. In 1938 Czechoslovakia held 10th place in the world industrial production. Czechoslovakia was the only country in Central and Eastern Europe to remain a liberal democracy throughout the entire 
interwar period. Although the First Czechoslovak Republic was a [[unitary state]], it provided certain rights to its minorities, the largest being [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|Germans]] (23.6% in 1921), [[Hungarians in |Hungarians]] (5.6%) and [[Rusyns and Ukrainians in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|Ukrainians]] (3.5%).

Western Czechoslovakia was [[ occupation of Czechoslovakia|occupied by Nazi ]], which placed most of the region into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. The Protectorate was proclaimed part of the Third Reich, and the president and prime minister were subordinated to Nazi 's ''[[Protector (title)|Reichsprotektor]]''. [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|One Nazi concentration camp]] was located within the  territory at [[Terezín]], north of Prague. The vast majority of the Protectorate's Jews were murdered in [[Nazi concentration camps|Nazi-run concentration camps]]. The Nazi {{Lang|de|[[Generalplan Ost]]}} called for the extermination, expulsion, [[Germanization]] or enslavement of most or all Czechs for the purpose of providing more [[Lebensraum|living space]] for the  people. There was [[Resistance in -occupied Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak resistance to Nazi occupation]] as well as [[ war crimes|reprisals]] against the Czechoslovaks for their anti-Nazi resistance. The  occupation ended on 9 May 1945, with the arrival of the Soviet and  armies and the [[Prague uprising]]. Most of Czechoslovakia's -speakers were forcibly [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|expelled]] from the country, first as a result of local acts of violence and then under the aegis of an "organized transfer" confirmed by the Soviet Union, the , and Great Britain at the [[Potsdam Conference]].
[[File:Praga 11.jpg|thumb|Prague during the 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]]]]
In the [[Czechoslovakian parliamentary election, 1946|1946 elections]], the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist Party]] gained 38% of the votes and became the largest party in the Czechoslovak parliament, formed a coalition with other parties, and consolidated power. A [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|coup d'état]] came in 1948 and a single-party government was formed. For the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)|next 41 years]], the Czechoslovak Communist state conformed to [[Eastern Bloc]] economic and political features. The [[Prague Spring]] political liberalization was stopped by the 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. Analysts believe that the invasion caused the communist movement to fracture, ultimately leading to the Revolutions of 1989.

In November 1989, Czechoslovakia again became a liberal democracy through the [[Velvet Revolution]]. However,  national aspirations strengthened ([[Hyphen War]]) and on 31 December 1992, the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|country peacefully split]] into the independent [[country|countries]] of the  and [[]]. Both countries went through economic reforms and [[privatization]]s, with the intention of creating a [[market economy]], as they have been trying to do since 1990, when Czechs and Slovaks still shared the common state. This process was largely successful; in 2006 the  was recognized by the World Bank as a "developed country", and in 2009 the [[Human Development Index]] ranked it as a nation of "Very High Human Development".

From 1991, the , originally as part of Czechoslovakia and since 1993 in its own right, has been a member of the [[Visegrád Group]] and from 1995, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]. The  joined [[NATO]] on 12 March 1999 and the [[European Union]] on 1 May 2004. On 21 December 2007 the  joined the [[Schengen Area]].

Until 2017, either the centre-left [[ Social Democratic Party]] or the centre-right [[Civic Democratic Party ()|Civic Democratic Party]] led the governments of the . In October 2017, the populist movement [[ANO 2011]], led by the country's second-richest man, [[Andrej Babiš]], won the [[2017  legislative election|elections]] with three times more votes than its closest rival, the Civic Democrats. In December 2017,  president [[Miloš Zeman]] appointed Andrej Babiš as the new prime minister.

In the [[2021  legislative election|2021 elections]], [[ANO 2011]] was narrowly defeated and [[Petr Fiala]] became the new prime minister. He formed a government coalition of the alliance [[Spolu ()|SPOLU]] ([[Civic Democratic Party ()|Civic Democratic Party]], [[KDU-ČSL]] and [[TOP 09]]) and the alliance of [[Pirates and Mayors]]. In January 2023, retired general [[Petr Pavel]] won the [[2023  presidential election|presidential election]], becoming new  president to succeed Miloš Zeman. Following the [[2022  invasion of ]], the country took in half a million [[2022–2023  refugee crisis| refugees]], the largest number per capita in the world.
