{{main|Prehistory of |Migration period of ancient Burma}}
[[File:Pyu city-states map.svg|thumb|[[Pyu city-states]], {{circa|8th century}}]]

Archaeological evidence shows that ''[[Homo erectus]]'' lived in the region now known as  as early as 750,000 years ago, with no more ''erectus'' finds after 75,000 years ago. The first evidence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is dated to about 25,000 BP with discoveries of stone tools in central . Evidence of [[Neolithic]] age domestication of plants and animals and the use of polished stone tools dating to sometime between 10,000 and 6,000 BCE has been discovered in the form of [[cave painting]]s in [[Padah-Lin Caves]].

The [[Bronze Age]] arrived {{circa|1500 BCE}} when people in the region were turning copper into bronze, growing rice and domesticating poultry and pigs; they were among the first people in the world to do so. Human remains and artefacts from this era were discovered in [[Monywa District]] in the [[Sagaing Region]]. The [[Iron Age]] began around 500 BCE with the emergence of iron-working settlements in an area south of present-day [[Mandalay]]. Evidence also shows the presence of rice-growing settlements of large villages and small towns that traded with their surroundings as far as  between 500 BCE and 200 CE. Iron Age  cultures also had influences from outside sources such as [[]] and [[]], as seen in their funerary practices concerning child burials. This indicates some form of communication between groups in  and other places, possibly through trade.

=== Early city-states ===
{{main|Pyu city-states|Mon kingdoms}}
Around the second century BCE the first-known [[city-state]]s emerged in central . The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu people, the earliest inhabitants of  of whom records are extant, from present-day [[Yunnan]]. The Pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with , importing Buddhism as well as other cultural, architectural and political concepts, which would have an enduring influence on later  culture and political organisation.

By the 9th century, several city-states had sprouted across the land: the Pyu in the central dry zone, Mon along the southern coastline and Arakanese along the western littoral. The balance was upset when the Pyu came under repeated attacks from [[Nanzhao]] between the 750s and the 830s. In the mid-to-late 9th century the [[Bamar people]] founded a small settlement at [[Bagan]]. It was one of several competing city-states until the late 10th century, when it grew in authority and grandeur.

=== Pagan Kingdom ===
{{main|Pagan Kingdom|Toungoo dynasty|Konbaung dynasty}}
{{see also|Kingdom of Ava|Hanthawaddy Kingdom|Kingdom of Mrauk U|Shan States}}

[[File:Bagan, Burma.jpg|thumb|[[Pagoda]]s and [[kyaung]]s in present-day [[Bagan]], the capital of the [[Pagan Kingdom]]]]
[[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan]] gradually grew to absorb its surrounding states until the 1050s–1060s when [[Anawrahta]] founded the Pagan Kingdom, the first ever unification of the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Pagan Empire and the [[Khmer Empire]] were two main powers in mainland Southeast Asia. The [[ language]] and culture gradually became dominant in the upper Irrawaddy valley, eclipsing the [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu]], [[Mon language|Mon]] and [[Pali]] norms{{clarify|date=January 2023}} by the late 12th century. Theravada [[Buddhism]] slowly began to spread to the village level, although [[Vajrayana|Tantric]], [[Mahayana]], [[Hinduism]], and [[ folk religion|folk religion]] remained heavily entrenched. Pagan's rulers and wealthy built over 10,000 [[Buddhist]] temples in the Pagan capital zone alone. Repeated Mongol invasions in the late 13th century toppled the four-century-old kingdom in 1287.

[[File:MysticalMraukU.jpg|thumb|Temples at [[Mrauk U]]]]
Pagan's collapse was followed by 250 years of political fragmentation that lasted well into the 16th century. Like the Burmans four centuries earlier, [[Shan people|Shan]] migrants who arrived with the Mongol invasions stayed behind. Several competing [[Shan States]] came to dominate the entire northwestern to eastern arc surrounding the Irrawaddy valley. The valley too was beset with petty states until the late 14th century when two sizeable powers, [[Ava Kingdom]] and [[Hanthawaddy kingdom]], emerged. In the west, a politically fragmented Arakan was under competing influences of its stronger neighbours until the [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] unified the Arakan coastline for the first time in 1437. The kingdom was a protectorate of the [[Bengal Sultanate]] at different time periods.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, Ava fought [[Forty Years' War|wars of unification]] but could never quite reassemble the lost empire. Having held off Ava, the [[Mon people|Mon]]-speaking Hanthawaddy entered its golden age, and Arakan went on to become a power in its own right for the next 350 years. In contrast, constant warfare left Ava greatly weakened, and it slowly disintegrated from 1481 onward. In 1527, the Confederation of Shan States conquered Ava and ruled Upper  until 1555.

Like the Pagan Empire, Ava, [[Hanthawaddy]] and the Shan states were all [[multi-ethnic]] polities. Despite the wars, cultural synchronisation continued. This period is considered a golden age for [[ culture]]. [[ literature]] "grew more confident, popular, and stylistically diverse", and the second generation of  law codes as well as the earliest [[ chronicles|pan-Burma chronicles]] emerged. Hanthawaddy monarchs introduced religious reforms that later spread to the rest of the country.

=== Taungoo and Konbaung ===
{{Main|– conflicts}}
[[File:Elefante Portugues.jpg|thumb| ruler mounting an Elephant and his soldiers. Philips, Jan Caspar (draughtsman and engraver)]]
[[File:Map of Taungoo Empire (1580).png|thumb|[[First Toungoo Empire|Toungoo Empire]] under [[Bayinnaung]] in 1580]]
Political unification returned in the mid-16th century, through the efforts of [[Toungoo dynasty|Taungoo]], a former vassal state of Ava. Taungoo's young, ambitious King [[Tabinshwehti]] defeated the more powerful Hanthawaddy in the [[Toungoo–Hanthawaddy War]]. His successor [[Bayinnaung]] went on to conquer a vast swath of mainland Southeast Asia including the Shan states, [[Lan Na]], Manipur, [[Mong Mao]], the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], [[Lan Xang]] and southern Arakan. However, the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia unravelled soon after Bayinnaung's death in 1581, completely collapsing by 1599. Ayutthaya seized Tenasserim and Lan Na, and  mercenaries established [[ rule]] at [[Thanlyin]] (Syriam).

The dynasty regrouped and defeated the  in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing [[Lower ]], [[Upper ]], [[Shan states]], [[Lan Na]] and upper [[Tenasserim Division|Tenasserim]]. The restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features continued well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated [[Meitei people|Meithei]] raids into Upper  and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower  founded the [[Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom]]. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.[[File:Shwedagon pagoda.jpg|thumb|A British 1825 lithograph of [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] shows British occupation during the [[First Anglo- War]].]]
After the fall of Ava, the [[Konbaung–Hanthawaddy War]] involved one resistance group under [[Alaungpaya]] defeating the Restored Hanthawaddy, and by 1759 he had reunited all of  and Manipur and driven out the  and the British, who had provided arms to Hanthawaddy. By 1770, Alaungpaya's heirs had subdued much of  and fought and won the [[–Siamese War (1765–1767)|–Siamese War]] against [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] and the [[Sino- War]] against [[Qing ]].

With Burma preoccupied by the  threat, Ayutthaya recovered its territories by 1770 and went on to capture Lan Na by 1776. Burma and Siam went to war until 1855, but all resulted in a stalemate, exchanging [[Tenasserim Island|Tenasserim]] (to Burma) and Lan Na (to Ayutthaya). Faced with a powerful  and a resurgent Ayutthaya in the east, King [[Bodawpaya]] turned west, acquiring Arakan (1785), Manipur (1814) and Assam (1817). It was the second-largest empire in  history but also one with a long ill-defined border with [[British ]].

In 1826, Burma lost Arakan, [[Manipur]], Assam and Tenasserim to the British in the [[First Anglo- War]]. In 1852, the British easily seized Lower Burma in the [[Second Anglo- War]]. King [[Mindon Min]] tried to modernise the kingdom and in 1875 narrowly avoided annexation by ceding the [[Karenni States]]. The British, alarmed by the consolidation of [[ Indochina]], annexed the remainder of the country in the [[Third Anglo- War]] in 1885.

Konbaung kings extended Restored Toungoo's administrative reforms and achieved unprecedented levels of internal control and external expansion. For the first time in history, the  language and culture came to predominate the entire Irrawaddy valley. The evolution and growth of  literature and theatre continued, aided by an extremely high adult male literacy rate for the era (half of all males and 5% of females). Nonetheless, the extent and pace of reforms were uneven and ultimately proved insufficient to stem the advance of British colonialism.

=== British Burma (1885–1948) ===
{{main|British rule in Burma|Burma campaign}}
[[File:British forces arrival mandalay1885.jpg|thumb|The landing of British forces in Mandalay after the last of the [[Anglo- War]]s, which resulted in the abdication of the last  monarch, King [[Thibaw Min]]]]

In the 19th century,  rulers sought to maintain their traditional influence in the western areas of Assam, Manipur and Arakan. Pressing them, however, was the [[British East ]] Company, which was expanding its interests eastwards over the same territory. Over the next 60 years, diplomacy, raids, treaties and compromises, known collectively as the [[Anglo- Wars]], continued until Britain proclaimed control over most of Burma. With the fall of Mandalay, all of Burma came under British rule, being [[Third Anglo- War#Annexation and resistance|annexed]] on 1 January 1886.

Throughout the colonial era, many Indians arrived as soldiers, civil servants, construction workers and traders and, along with the [[Anglo-]] community, dominated commercial and civil life in Burma. [[Rangoon]] became the capital of British Burma and an important port between [[Calcutta]] and [[]].  resentment was strong, and was vented in violent riots that periodically paralysed Rangoon until the 1930s. Some of the discontent was caused by a disrespect for  culture and traditions. [[Buddhist monks]] became the vanguards of the independence movement. [[U Wisara]], an activist monk, died in prison after a 166-day hunger strike.

On 1 April 1937, Burma became a separately administered colony of Britain, and [[Ba Maw]] became the first Prime Minister and Premier of Burma. Ba Maw was an outspoken advocate for  self-rule, and he opposed the participation of Britain, and by extension Burma, in [[World War II]]. He resigned from the Legislative Assembly and was arrested for sedition. In 1940, before [[ during World War II| formally entered the war]], [[Aung San]] formed the [[Burma Independence Army]] in .

As a major battleground, Burma was devastated during World War II by the [[ invasion of Burma| invasion]]. Within months after they entered the war,  troops had advanced on Rangoon, and the British administration had collapsed. A [[ occupation of Burma| Executive Administration]] headed by Ba Maw was established by the  in August 1942. [[Orde Wingate|Wingate]]'s British [[Chindits]] were formed into [[long-range penetration]] groups trained to operate deep behind  lines. A similar  unit, [[Merrill's Marauders]], followed the Chindits into the  jungle in 1943.

Beginning in late 1944, allied troops launched a [[Burma campaign 1944|series of offensives]] that led to the [[Burma campaign 1944–45|end of  rule]] in July 1945. The battles were intense with much of Burma laid waste by the fighting. Overall, the  lost some 150,000 men in Burma with 1,700 prisoners taken. Although many  fought initially for the  as part of the Burma Independence Army, many , mostly from the ethnic minorities, served in the British Burma Army. The [[Burma National Army]] and the Arakan National Army fought with the  from 1942 to 1944 but switched allegiance to the Allied side in 1945. Overall, 170,000 to 250,000  civilians died during World War II.

Following World War II, [[Aung San]] negotiated the [[Panglong Agreement]] with ethnic leaders that guaranteed the independence of Burma as a unified state. [[Aung Zan Wai]], Pe Khin, [[Bo Hmu Aung]], Sir Maung Gyi, Sein Mya Maung, [[Myoma U Than Kywe]] were among the negotiators of the historic [[Panglong Conference]] negotiated with Bamar leader General Aung San and other ethnic leaders in 1947. In 1947, Aung San became Deputy Chairman of the Executive Council of Burma, a transitional government. But in July 1947, political rivals [[ Martyrs' Day|assassinated Aung San]] and several cabinet members.

=== Independence (1948–1962) ===
{{main|Post-independence Burma (1948–1962)}}{{See also|Independence Day ()}}
On 4 January 1948, the nation became an independent republic, under the terms of the [[Burma Independence Act 1947]]. The new country was named the ''Union of Burma'', with [[Sao Shwe Thaik]] as its first president and [[U Nu]] as its first prime minister. Unlike most other former British colonies and overseas territories, Burma did not become a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. A [[bicameral]] parliament was formed, consisting of a [[Chamber of Deputies (Burma)|Chamber of Deputies]] and a [[Chamber of Nationalities]], and [[multi-party]] elections were held in [[1951–52  general election|1951–1952]], [[1956  general election|1956]] and [[1960  general election|1960]].

The geographical area Burma encompasses today can be traced to the [[Panglong Agreement]], which combined Burma Proper, which consisted of Lower Burma and Upper Burma, and the Frontier Areas, which had been administered separately by the British.

In 1961, [[U Thant]], the Union of Burma's Permanent Representative to the United Nations and former secretary to the prime minister, was elected [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], a position he held for ten years.

When the non-Burman ethnic groups pushed for autonomy or federalism, alongside having a weak civilian government at the centre, the military leadership staged a coup d'état in 1962. Though incorporated in the 1947 Constitution, successive military governments construed the use of the term '[[federalism]]' as being anti-national, anti-unity and pro-disintegration.

=== Military rule (1962–2011) ===
On 2 March 1962, the military led by General [[Ne Win]] [[1962  coup d'état|took control of Burma through a coup d'état]], and the government had been under direct or indirect control by the military since then. Between 1962 and 1974,  was ruled by a [[Union Revolutionary Council|revolutionary council]] headed by the general. Almost all aspects of society (business, media, production) were [[nationalised]] or brought under government control under the [[ Way to Socialism]], which combined Soviet-style nationalisation and [[Economic planning|central planning]].

A [[Constitution of |new constitution]] of the [[Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma]] was adopted in 1974. Until 1988, the country was ruled as a [[one-party system]], with the general and other military officers resigning and ruling through the [[Burma Socialist Programme Party]] (BSPP). During this period,  became one of the world's most impoverished countries. There were sporadic protests against military rule during the Ne Win years, and these were almost always violently suppressed. On 7 July 1962, the government broke up [[1962 Rangoon University protests|demonstrations at Rangoon University]], killing 15 students. In 1974, the military violently suppressed [[U Thant funeral crisis|anti-government protests]] at the funeral of U Thant. Student protests in 1975, 1976, and 1977 were quickly suppressed by overwhelming force.

In 1988, unrest over economic mismanagement and political oppression by the government led to widespread pro-democracy demonstrations throughout the country known as the [[8888 Uprising]]. Security forces killed thousands of demonstrators, and General [[Saw Maung]] staged a coup d'état and formed the [[State Law and Order Restoration Council]] (SLORC). In 1989, SLORC declared martial law after widespread protests. The military government finalised plans for People's Assembly elections on 31 May 1989. SLORC changed the country's official  name from the "Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma" to the "Union of " on 18 June 1989 by enacting the adaptation of the expression law.

In May 1990, the government held free multiparty elections for the first time in almost 30 years, and the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD), the party of Aung San Suu Kyi, won [[1990  general election|earning 392 out of a total 492 seats]] (i.e., 80% of the seats). However, the military junta refused to cede power and continued to rule the nation, first as SLORC and, from 1997, as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) until its dissolution in March 2011. General [[Than Shwe]] took over the Chairmanship – effectively the position of 's top ruler – from General Saw Maung in 1992 and held it until 2011.

On 23 June 1997,  was admitted into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. On 27 March 2006, the military junta, which had moved the national capital from Yangon to a site near [[Pyinmana]] in November 2005, officially named the new capital [[Naypyidaw]], meaning "city of the kings".

[[File:Cyclone Nargis --3May2008.jpg|thumb|[[Cyclone Nargis]] in southern , May 2008]]
In August 2007, an increase in the price of fuel led to the [[Saffron Revolution]] led by Buddhist monks that were dealt with harshly by the government. The government cracked down on them on 26 September 2007, with reports of barricades at the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] and monks killed. There were also rumours of disagreement within the  armed forces, but none was confirmed. The military crackdown against unarmed [[protest]]ers was widely condemned as part of the [[international reactions to the Saffron Revolution]] and led to an increase in economic sanctions against the [[Politics of | Government]].

In May 2008, [[Cyclone Nargis]] caused extensive damage in the densely populated rice-farming delta of the [[Irrawaddy Division]]. It was the worst natural disaster in  history with reports of an estimated 200,000 people dead or missing, damages totalled to 10&nbsp;billion US dollars, and as many as 1 million were left homeless. In the critical days following this disaster, 's [[isolationist]] government was accused of hindering United Nations recovery efforts. [[Humanitarian aid]] was requested, but concerns about foreign military or intelligence presence in the country delayed the entry of  military planes delivering medicine, food, and other supplies.

In early August 2009, [[2009 Kokang incident|a conflict broke out]] in Shan State in northern . For several weeks, junta troops fought against ethnic minorities including the [[Kokang |Han ]], [[Wa people|Wa]], and [[Jingpo people|Kachin]]. During 8–12 August, the first days of the conflict, as many as 10,000  civilians fled to Yunnan in neighbouring .

=== Civil wars ===
{{main|Internal conflict in }}
[[Civil war]]s have been a constant feature of 's socio-political landscape since the attainment of independence in 1948. These wars are predominantly struggles for ethnic and sub-national autonomy, with the areas surrounding the ethnically Bamar central districts of the country serving as the primary geographical setting of conflict. Foreign journalists and visitors require a special travel permit to visit the areas in which 's civil wars continue.

In October 2012, the ongoing conflicts in  included the [[Kachin conflict]], between the Pro-Christian [[Kachin Independence Army]] and the government; a civil war between the [[Rohingya]] Muslims, and the government and non-government groups in [[Rakhine State]]; and a conflict between the [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Lahu people|Lahu]], and [[Karen people|Karen]] minority groups, and the government in the eastern half of the country. In addition, [[al-Qaeda]] signalled an intention to become involved in .

Armed conflict between [[ National Democratic Alliance Army|ethnic  rebels]] and the [[ Armed Forces]] resulted in the [[2015 Kokang offensive|Kokang offensive]] in February 2015. The conflict had forced 40,000 to 50,000 civilians to flee their homes and seek shelter on the  side of the border. During the incident, the government of  was accused of giving military assistance to the [[Kokang |ethnic ]] rebels. Clashes between  troops and local insurgent groups have continued, fuelling tensions between  and .

=== Period of liberalisation, 2011–2021 ===
{{See also|2011–2015  political reforms}}
The military-backed Government had promulgated a [[Roadmap to democracy|"Roadmap to Discipline-flourishing Democracy"]] in 1993, but the process appeared to stall several times, until 2008 when the Government published a new draft national constitution, and organised a (flawed) national referendum which adopted it. The new constitution provided for election of a national assembly with powers to appoint a president, while practically ensuring army control at all levels.
[[File:Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton at home of Aung San Suu Kyi.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] and Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] with [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] and her staff at her home in Yangon, 2012]]

A [[2010  general election|general election in 2010]] – the first for twenty years – was boycotted by the [[National League for Democracy|NLD]]. The military-backed [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]] declared victory, stating that it had been favoured by 80 per cent of the votes; fraud, however, was alleged. A nominally civilian government was then formed, with retired general [[Thein Sein]] as president.

A series of liberalising political and economic actions – or reforms – then took place. By the end of 2011 these included the release of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest, the establishment of the [[ National Human Rights Commission|National Human Rights Commission]], the granting of general amnesties for more than 200 political prisoners, new labour laws that permitted labour unions and strikes, a relaxation of press censorship, and the regulation of currency practices. In response, [[ Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] visited  in December 2011 – the first visit by a US Secretary of State in more than fifty years – meeting both President Thein Sein and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

[[Aung San Suu Kyi]]'s [[National League for Democracy|NLD]] party participated in the 2012 by-elections, facilitated by the government's abolition of the laws that previously barred it. In the April 2012 [[2012  by-elections|by-elections]], the NLD won 43 of the 45 available seats. The 2012 by-elections were also the first time that international representatives were allowed to monitor the voting process in .

's improved international reputation was indicated by [[ASEAN]]'s approval of 's bid for the position of ASEAN chair in 2014.

[[File:Burma en.png|thumb|upright=0.8|Map of  and its divisions]]

==== 2015 general elections ====
General elections [[2015  general election|were held on 8 November 2015]]. These were the first openly contested elections held in  since the 1990 general election (which was annulled). The results gave the NLD an [[Supermajority|absolute majority]] of seats in both chambers of the [[national parliament]], enough to ensure that its candidate would become president, while NLD leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] is constitutionally barred from the presidency.

The new parliament convened on 1 February 2016, and on 15 March 2016, [[Htin Kyaw]] was elected as the first non-military president since the military coup of 1962. On 6 April 2016, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] assumed the newly created role of [[State Counsellor of |state counsellor]], a role akin to a [[Prime Minister of |prime minister]].

=== Coup d'état and civil war ===
{{main|2021  coup d'état| civil war (2021–present)}}
{{See also| protests (2021–present)}}

In 's 2020 parliamentary election, the ostensibly ruling [[National League for Democracy|National League for Democracy (NLD)]], the party of State Counsellor [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], competed with various other smaller parties &ndash; particularly the military-affiliated [[Union Solidarity and Development Party|Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP)]]. Suu Kyi's NLD won the [[2020  general election]] on 8 November in a landslide. The USDP, regarded as a proxy for the military, suffered a "humiliating" defeat &ndash; even worse than in 2015 &ndash; capturing only 33 of the 476 elected seats.

As the election results began emerging, the USDP rejected them, urging a new election with the military as observers. More than 90 other smaller parties contested the vote, including more than 15 who complained of irregularities. However, election observers declared there were no major irregularities. However, despite the election commission validating the NLD's overwhelming victory, the USDP and 's military persistently alleged fraud.{{excessive citations inline|date=July 2024}}
In January 2021, just before the new parliament was to be sworn in, the NLD announced that Suu Kyi would retain her State Counsellor role in the upcoming government.


[[File:We want our leader free Daw Aung San Su Kyi.jpg|thumb|left|Protesters against the military coup in ]]

In the early morning of 1 February 2021, the day parliament was set to convene, the [[Tatmadaw]], 's military, detained Suu Kyi and other members of the ruling party. The military handed power to military chief [[Min Aung Hlaing]] and declared a state of emergency for one year and began closing the borders, restricting travel and electronic communications nationwide. The military announced it would replace the existing election commission with a new one, and a military media outlet indicated new elections would be held in about one year &ndash; though the military avoided making an official commitment to that. The military expelled NLD party Members of Parliament from the capital city, [[Naypyidaw]]. By 15 March 2021 the military leadership continued to extend martial law into more parts of Yangon, while security forces killed 38 people in a single day of violence.

By the second day of the coup, thousands of protesters were marching in the streets of Yangon, and other protests erupted nationwide, largely halting commerce and transportation. Despite the military's arrests and killings of protesters, the first weeks of the coup found growing public participation, including groups of civil servants, teachers, students, workers, monks and religious leaders &ndash; even normally disaffected ethnic minorities.

[[File:Myanmar_civil_war.svg|thumb|Military situation in  {{As of|2025|4|4|lc=yes}}. Areas controlled by the [[Tatmadaw]] are highlighted in {{highlight|pink|#EBC0B3}}.]]
The coup was immediately condemned by the [[United Nations Secretary General]], and leaders of democratic nations. The U.S. threatened sanctions on the military and its leaders, including a "freeze" of US$1 billion of their assets in the U.S. [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], the [[]] and [[]] refrained from criticizing the military coup. A [[United Nations Security Council]] resolution called for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and the other detained leaders &ndash; a position shared by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]].

International development and aid partners &ndash; business, non-governmental, and governmental &ndash; hinted at suspension of partnerships with . Banks were closed and [[social media]] communications platforms, including [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], removed Tatmadaw postings. Protesters appeared at  embassies in foreign countries. The National Unity Government then declared the formation of an armed wing on 5 May 2021, a date that is often cited as the start of a [[ civil war (2021–present)|full-scale civil war]]. This armed wing was named the [[People's Defence Force ()|People's Defence Force]] (PDF) to protect its supporters from military junta attacks and as a first step towards a Federal Union Army. The civil war is ongoing as of 2025.
