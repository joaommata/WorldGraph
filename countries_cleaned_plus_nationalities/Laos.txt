=== Prehistory ===
In 2009, an [[anatomically modern human]] [[skull]] was recovered from the [[Tam Pa Ling Cave]] in the [[Annamite Range|Annamite Mountains]] in northern ; the skull is at least 46,000 years old, making it the oldest modern human fossil found to date in [[Southeast Asia]]. Stone artifacts including [[Hoabinhian]] types have been found at sites dating to the [[Pleistocene]] in northern .

Archaeological evidence suggests an agriculturist society developed during the 4th millennium BCE, a society in which bronze objects appeared around 1500 BCE, and iron tools were known from 700 BCE. The proto-historic period is characterised by contact with  and  civilisations. According to linguistic and other historical evidence, [[Tai languages|Tai-speaking]] tribes migrated southwestward to the territories of  and [[]] from [[Guangxi]] sometime between the 8th and 10th centuries.

=== Lan Xang ===
{{Main|Lan Xang}}
 traces its history to the kingdom of Lan Xang ('million elephants'), which was founded in the 13th century by a  prince, [[Fa Ngum]],{{rp|223}} whose father had his family exiled from the [[Khmer Empire]]. Fa Ngum, with 10,000 [[Khmer people|Khmer]] troops, conquered some  principalities in the [[Mekong]] river basin, culminating in the capture of [[Vientiane]]. Ngum was descended from a line of  kings that traced back to Khoun Boulom. He made [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] the state religion. His ministers, unable to tolerate his ruthlessness, forced him into exile to what is later the  province of [[Nan Province|Nan]] in 1373, where he died. Fa Ngum's eldest son, Oun Heuan, ascended to the throne under the name [[Samsenethai]] and reigned for 43&nbsp;years. Lan Xang became a trade centre during Samsenthai's reign, and after his death in 1421 it collapsed into warring factions for nearly a century.

In 1520, [[Photisarath]] came to the throne and moved the capital from [[Luang Prabang]] to Vientiane to avoid a  invasion. [[Setthathirath]] became king in 1548, after his father was killed, and ordered the construction of [[Pha That Luang|That Luang]]. Settathirath disappeared in the mountains on his way back from a military expedition into [[]], and [[Lan Xang]] fell into more than 70 years of "instability", involving  invasion and civil war.

In 1637, when [[Sourigna Vongsa]] ascended the throne, Lan Xang further expanded its frontiers. When he died without an heir, the kingdom split into three principalities. Between 1763 and 1769,  armies overran northern  and annexed [[Luang Prabang]], while [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]] eventually came under Siamese [[suzerainty]].

[[Anouvong|Chao Anouvong]] was installed as a vassal king of Vientiane by the Siamese. He encouraged a renaissance of  fine arts and literature and improved relations with [[Luang Prabang|Luang Phrabang]]. Under  pressure, [[ rebellion (1826–1828)|he rebelled against the Siamese in 1826]]. The rebellion failed, and Vientiane was ransacked. Anouvong was taken to [[Bangkok]] as a prisoner, where he died.

In a time period where the acquisition of humans was a priority over the ownership of land, the warfare of pre-modern Southeast Asia revolved around the seizing of people and resources from its enemies. A Siamese military campaign in  in 1876 was described by a  observer as having been "transformed into [[Slavery in Asia|slave-hunting raids]] on a large scale".

In the 19th century, Luang Prabang was ransacked by the  [[Black Flag Army]].  rescued King [[Oun Kham]] and added Luang Phrabang to the protectorate of [[ Indochina]]. The [[Kingdom of Champasak]] and the territory of Vientiane were added to the protectorate. King [[Sisavangvong]] of Luang Phrabang became ruler of a unified , and Vientiane once again became the capital.

 produced [[tin]], rubber, and coffee; the country never accounted for more than 1% of  Indochina's exports. By 1940, around 600  citizens lived in . Under  rule, the  were encouraged to migrate to ; this was seen by the  colonists as a rational solution to a labour shortage within the confines of an Indochina-wide colonial space. By 1943, the  population stood at nearly 40,000, forming the majority in some cities of  and having the right to elect its own leaders. As a result, 53% of the population of Vientiane, 85% of [[Thakhek]], and 62% of [[Pakse]] were ; the exception was [[Luang Prabang]], where the population was predominantly . As late as 1945, the  drew up a plan to move a number of  to three areas (i.e., the Vientiane Plain, [[Savannakhet Province|Savannakhet region]], and the [[Bolaven Plateau]]), which was derailed by the  invasion of Indochina. Otherwise, according to [[Martin Stuart-Fox]], the  might well have lost control over their own country.

During [[ Protectorate of # during World War II|World War II in ]], [[Vichy ]], [[]], [[Empire of |Imperial ]] and [[Free ]] occupied . On 9 March 1945, a nationalist group declared  once more independent, with [[Luang Prabang]] as its capital; on 7 April 1945, two battalions of  troops occupied the city. The  attempted to force [[Sisavang Vong]] (the king of Luang Phrabang) to declare Laotian independence, and on 8 April he instead declared an end to 's status as a  protectorate. The king then secretly sent Prince [[Kindavong]] to represent  to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] and [[Sisavang Vatthana|Prince Sisavang]] as representative to the . When  surrendered, some  nationalists (including Prince [[Phetsarath Ratanavongsa|Phetsarath]]) declared Laotian independence, and by 1946,  troops had reoccupied the country and conferred autonomy on .

During the [[First Indochina War]], the [[Indochinese Communist Party]] formed the [[Pathet ]] independence organisation. The Pathet  began a war against the  colonial forces with the aid of the  independence organisation, the [[Viet Minh]]. In 1950, the  were forced to give  semi-autonomy as an "associated state" within the [[ Union]].  remained in de facto control until 22 October 1953, when  gained full independence as a [[constitutional monarchy]].

The First Indochina War took place across  Indochina and eventually led to  defeat and the signing of a peace accord for  at the [[1954 Geneva Conference|Geneva Conference of 1954]]. In 1960, amidst a series of rebellions in the [[Kingdom of ]], fighting broke out between the [[Royal  Army]] (RLA) and the communist [[North ]]ese and [[Soviet Union]]-backed Pathet  guerillas. A second [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] formed by Prince [[Souvanna Phouma]] in 1962 was unsuccessful, and the situation turned into [[Laotian Civil War|civil war]] between the Royal Laotian government and the Pathet . The Pathet  were backed militarily by the [[People's Army of ]] (PAVN) and the [[Viet Cong]].

 was a part of the [[ War]] since parts of  were [[North  invasion of |invaded and occupied]] by [[North ]] since 1958 for use as a supply route for its war against [[South ]]. In response, the [[]] initiated a bombing campaign against the PAVN positions, supported regular and irregular anti-communist forces in , and supported [[CIA activities in |incursions into ]] by the [[Army of the Republic of ]].

Aerial bombardments against the PAVN/[[Pathet ]] forces were carried out by the [[]] to prevent the collapse of the [[Kingdom of ]] central government, and to deny the use of the [[Ho Chi Minh trail|Ho Chi Minh Trail]] to attack US forces in [[South ]]. Between 1964 and 1973, the US dropped 2 million tons of bombs on , nearly equal to the 2.1&nbsp;million tons of bombs the US dropped on Europe and Asia during all of World War II. This made  the most heavily bombed country in history relative to the size of its population; ''[[The New York Times]]'' notes this was "nearly a ton for every person in ".

Some 80 million bombs failed to explode and remain scattered throughout the country. [[Unexploded ordnance]] (UXO), including [[cluster munitions]] and mines, kill or maim approximately 50 Laotians every year. Due to the impact of cluster bombs during this war,  was an advocate of the [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]] to ban the weapons and was host to the First Meeting of States Parties to the convention in November 2010.

In 1975, the [[Pathet ]] overthrew the royalist government, forcing King [[Sisavang Vatthana|Savang Vatthana]] to abdicate on 2 December 1975. He later died in a [[Re-education camp ()|re-education camp]]. Between 20,000 and 62,000 Laotians died during the civil war.

On 2 December 1975, after taking control of the country, the Pathet  government under [[Kaysone Phomvihane]] renamed the country as the '' People's Democratic Republic''; the government also signed agreements giving [[]] the right to station armed forces and to appoint advisers to assist in overseeing the country. The ties between  and [[]] were formalised via a treaty signed in 1977, which has since provided direction for  foreign policy, and provides the basis for  involvement at levels of  political and economic life. In 1979,  was requested by [[]] to end relations with the [[|People's Republic of ]]; this led to isolation in trade by [[]], the [[]], and other countries. In 1979, there were 50,000 PAVN troops stationed in  and as many as 6,000 civilian  officials including 1,000 directly attached to the ministries in [[Vientiane]].

==== Relations with the Hmong ====
The [[Insurgency in |conflict]] between [[Hmong people|Hmong]] rebels and  [[Insurgency in |continued in areas]] of , including in Saysaboune Closed Military Zone, Xaisamboune Closed Military Zone near Vientiane Province and [[Xiangkhouang Province]]. In 1977, a communist newspaper promised the party would hunt down the " collaborators" and their families "to the last root". As many as 200,000 Hmong went into exile in [[]], with some ending up in the [[|US]]. Other Hmong fighters hid out in mountains in Xiangkhouang Province for years, with a remnant emerging from the jungle in 2003.

In 1989, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR), with the support of the [[Federal government of the |US government]], instituted the [[Comprehensive Plan of Action]], a programme to stem the tide of Indochinese refugees from , [[]], and [[]]. Under the plan, refugee status was evaluated through a screening process. Recognised asylum seekers were given resettlement opportunities, while the remaining refugees were to be repatriated under guarantee of safety. After talks with the UNHCR and the  government,  agreed to repatriate the 60,000  refugees living in , including several thousand [[Hmong people]]. Some of the  refugees were willing to return voluntarily. Pressure to resettle the refugees grew as the  government worked to close its remaining refugee camps. While some Hmong people returned to  voluntarily, with development assistance from [[UNHCR]], allegations of forced repatriation surfaced. Of those Hmong who did return to , some escaped back to [[]], describing discrimination and brutal treatment at the hands of  authorities. In 1993, Vue Mai, a former Hmong soldier and leader of the largest Hmong refugee camp in , who had been recruited by the US&nbsp;Embassy in [[Bangkok]] to return to  as proof of the repatriation programme's success, disappeared in [[Vientiane]]. According to the US&nbsp;Committee for Refugees, he was arrested by  security forces and was never seen again.

Following the Vue Mai incident, debate over the Hmong's planned repatriation to  intensified, including in the , where it drew opposition from  conservatives and some human rights advocates. While some accusations of forced repatriation were denied, thousands of Hmong people refused to return to . In 1996 as the deadline for the closure of  refugee camps approached, and under mounting political pressure, the  agreed to resettle Hmong refugees who passed a screening process. Around 5,000 Hmong people who were not resettled at the time of the camp closures sought asylum at [[Wat Tham Krabok]], a Buddhist monastery in central  where more than 10,000 Hmong refugees had already been living. The  government attempted to repatriate these refugees, and the Wat Tham Krabok Hmong refused to leave and the  government refused to accept them, claiming they were involved in the [[illegal drug trade]] and were of non- origin. Following threats of forcible removal by the  government, the , in a victory for the Hmong, agreed to accept 15,000 of the refugees in 2003. Several thousand Hmong people, fearing forced repatriation to  if they were not accepted for resettlement in the , fled the camp to live elsewhere within  where a sizeable Hmong population has been present since the 19th century.

In 2004 and 2005, thousands of Hmong fled from the jungles of  to a temporary refugee camp in the  province of [[Phetchabun Province|Phetchabun]]. Lending further support to earlier claims that the government of  was persecuting the Hmong, filmmaker Rebecca Sommer documented first-hand accounts in her documentary, ''Hunted Like Animals'', and in a comprehensive report that includes summaries of refugee claims, which was submitted to the UN in May 2006.
