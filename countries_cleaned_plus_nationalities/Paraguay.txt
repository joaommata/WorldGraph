{{main|History of }}

===Pre-colonial era===
The indigenous [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] had been living in eastern  for at least a millennium before the arrival of the [[ Empire|]]. Western , the [[Gran Chaco]], was inhabited by nomads of whom the [[Guaycuru peoples|Guaycuru]] peoples were the most prominent. The  River was roughly the dividing line between the agricultural Guarani people to the east and the nomadic and seminomadic people to the west in the Gran Chaco. The [[Mbayá]] nomads were known for their warrior traditions and were not fully pacified until the late 19th century. These indigenous tribes belonged to five distinct language families, which were the bases of their major divisions. Differing language speaking groups were generally competitive over resources and territories. They were further divided into tribes by speaking languages in branches of these families. Today 17 separate [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups remain.

===Colonial era===
The first Europeans in the area were  explorers in 1516. The  explorer [[Juan de Salazar de Espinosa]] founded the settlement of [[Asunción]] on 15 August 1537. The city eventually became the center of a [[ colonization of the Americas| colonial province of ]].

An attempt to create an autonomous Christian  nation was undertaken by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missions and settlements in this part of South America in the eighteenth century. They developed Jesuit [[reductions]] to bring Guarani populations together at  missions and protect them from virtual slavery by  settlers and  slave raiders, the ''[[bandeirantes]]'', in addition to seeking their conversion to Christianity. Catholicism in  was influenced by the indigenous peoples: The [[syncretic]] religion has absorbed native elements. The ''reducciones'' flourished in eastern  for about 150 years, until the expulsion of the Jesuits by the  Crown in 1767. The ruins of two 18th century [[Jesuit Missions of La Santísima Trinidad de Paraná and Jesús de Tavarangue]] have been designated as [[World Heritage Sites]] by [[UNESCO]].

In western ,  settlement and Christianity were strongly resisted by the nomadic [[Guaycuru peoples|Guaycuru]] and other nomads from the 16th century onward. Most of these peoples were absorbed into the [[mestizo]] population in the 18th and 19th centuries.

===Independence and rule of Francia===
{{main|Independence of }}
[[File:José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia]], 's first dictator]]
 overthrew the local  administration on 14 May 1811. 's first dictator was [[José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia]], who ruled  from 1814 until his death in 1840 with very little outside contact or influence. He intended to create a [[utopia]]n society based on the [[Geneva]]n theorist [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s [[The Social Contract|''Social Contract'']]. Rodríguez de Francia was nicknamed ''El Supremo''.

Rodríguez de Francia established new laws that greatly reduced the powers of the Catholic church (Catholicism was then an established state religion) and the cabinet, forbade colonial citizens from marrying one another and allowed them to marry only blacks, [[mulattoes]] or natives, in order to break the power of colonial-era elites and to create a [[mixed-race]] or mestizo society. He cut off relations between  and the rest of South America. Because of Francia's restrictions of freedom, [[Fulgencio Yegros]] and several other Independence-era leaders in 1820 planned a ''coup d'état'' against Francia, who discovered the plot and had its leaders either executed or imprisoned for life.

===Rule of the López family===
[[File:1864 Mitchell Map of ,  and Chili - Geographicus - SouthAmericaSouth-mitchell-1864.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.25|Political map of the region, 1864]]

After Francia's death in 1840,  was ruled by various military officers under a new ''[[military junta|junta militar]]'', until [[Carlos Antonio López]] (allegedly Rodríguez de Francia's nephew) came to power in 1841. López modernized  and opened it to foreign commerce. He signed a [[nonaggression pact]] with  and officially declared independence of  in 1842. After López's death in 1862, power was transferred to his eldest son, [[Francisco Solano López]].

The regime of the López family was characterized by pervasive and rigid centralism in production and distribution. There was no distinction between the public and the private spheres, and the López family ruled the country as it would a large estate.

The government exerted control on all exports. The export of [[yerba mate]] and valuable wood products maintained the balance of trade between  and the outside world. The  government was extremely protectionist, never accepted loans from abroad and levied high [[tariff]]s against imported foreign products. This [[protectionism]] made the society self-sufficient, and it also avoided the debt suffered by  and . Slavery existed in , although not in great numbers, until 1844, when it was legally abolished in the new constitution.{{rp|39–40}}

[[Francisco Solano López]], the son of Carlos Antonio López, replaced his father as the President-Dictator in 1862, and generally continued the political policies of his father. Both wanted to give an international image of  as "democratic and republican", but in fact, the ruling family had almost total control of all public life in the country, including church and colleges.{{rp|41–42}}

Militarily, Carlos Antonio López modernized and expanded industry and the [[ Army]] and greatly strengthened the strategic defenses of  by developing the [[Fortress of Humaitá]]. The government hired more than 200 foreign technicians, who installed [[telegraph line]]s and railroads to aid the expanding steel, textile, paper and ink, naval construction, weapons and gunpowder industries. The [[Ybycuí]] foundry, completed in 1850, manufactured cannons, mortars and bullets of all calibers. River warships were built in the shipyards of Asunción. Fortifications were built, especially along the [[Apa River]] and in [[Gran Chaco]].{{rp|22}} Following the death of Carlos Antonio López, these projects continued under his son Francisco Solano.

In terms of socio-economic development, the country was dubbed "the most advanced Republic in South America", notably by the British judge and politician [[Robert Phillimore|Sir Robert Phillimore]].

According to George Thompson, Lieutenant Colonel of Engineers in the  Army prior to and during the war, López's government was comparatively a good one for :
{{blockquote|Probably in no other country in the world has life and property been so secure as all over  during his (Antonio Lopez's) reign. Crime was almost unknown, and when committed, immediately detected and punished. The mass of the people was, perhaps, the happiest in existence. They had hardly to do any work to gain a livelihood. Each family had its house or hut in its own ground. They planted, in a few days, enough tobacco, maize and mandioca for their own consumption [...]. Having at every hut a grove of oranges [...] and also a few cows, they were almost throughout the year under little necessity [...]. The higher classes, of course, lived more in the European way...|George Thompson, C.E.}}

=== War (1864–1870)===

On 12 October 1864, despite  ultimatums, [[Empire of |]] (allied with the  Government under General [[Bartolomé Mitre]] and the rebellious [[Colorado Party ()| colorados]] led by Gen. [[Venancio Flores]]) invaded the Republic of  in order to overthrow the government of that time (which was under the rule of the [[National Party ()|Blanco Party]], an ally of López),{{efn|The Blanco Party of , hardline right wing and reactionary at those days, was in the  Government during the outbreak of the war and were allies of the  Government.}} thus starting the [[ War]].{{efn| [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton]], a witness of the conflict, marks this date (12–16 October 1864) as the real beginning of the war. He writes (and it is the most logic account, considering the facts): ''The  Army invades the [[Banda Oriental]], despite the protestations of President López, who declared that such invasion would be held a "casus belli"''.}}

The Paraguayans, led by the [[Grand marshal|Marshal of the Republic]] [[Francisco Solano López]], retaliated by [[Mato Grosso Campaign|attacking Mato Grosso]] on 15 December 1864 and later declared war against  on 23 March 1865. The Blanco Government was toppled and replaced by a Colorado government under General Venancio Flores on 22 February 1865. Afterward, the [[ Republic]], the [[Empire of ]] and the Republic of  signed the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Secret Treaty of the Triple Alliance]] against the  Government on 1 May 1865.

On 24 May 1866, the [[Battle of Tuyutí]] led to the loss of 6,000 men when a  attack was repelled by the Allies. It was marked as the bloodiest battle in South America during the war.

The Paraguayans put up a ferocious resistance but ultimately lost in 1870 in the [[Battle of Cerro Corá]], where Marshal Solano López refused to surrender and died in action. The real causes of this war, which remains the bloodiest international conflict in the history of [[The Americas]], are still highly debatable.{{efn|The classical view asserts that Francisco Solano López's expansionist and hegemonic views are the main reason for the outbreak of the conflict. The traditional  view, held by the "''lopistas''" (supporters of Solano López in  and elsewhere), holds that  acted in self-defense and for the protection of the equilibrium of the Plate Basin. This view is usually contested by the "''anti-lopistas''" (known in  as "''legionarios''"), who favored the "Triple Alliance". Revisionist views from right and left national populists put a great emphasis on the influence of the British Empire, a view that a majority of historians reject.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}}}

 lost 25–33% of its territory to  and , paid an enormous war debt, and sold large amounts of national properties to stabilize its internal budget. The worst consequence of the war was the catastrophic loss of population. At least 50% of Paraguayans died during the conflict, numbers to which it took many decades for the country to return. Of the disaster suffered by the Paraguayans at the outcome of the war, [[William D. Rubinstein]] wrote:

"The normal estimate is that of a  population of somewhere between 450,000 and 900,000, only 220,000 survived the war, of whom only 28,000 were adult males."

During the pillaging of Asunción in 1869, the [[Imperial  Army]] packed up and transported the  National Archives to [[Rio de Janeiro]].{{efn|Some of the documents taken by Brasil during the war, were returned to  in the collection known as "Colección de Río Branco", nowadays in the National Archives of Asunción, .}} 's records from the war have remained classified. This has made  history in the colonial and early national periods difficult to research and study.

===20th century===
[[File:Chacokrieg.jpg|thumb|[[Gran Chaco]] was the site of the [[Chaco War]] (1932–35), in which  lost most of the disputed territory to ]] 
In 1904, the Liberal revolution against the rule of Colorados broke out. The Liberal rule started a period of great political instability. Between 1904 and 1954,  had thirty-one [[President of |presidents]], most of whom were removed from office by force. Conflicts between the factions of the ruling Liberal party led to the [[ Civil War (1922)| Civil War of 1922]].

The unresolved border conflict with  over the Chaco region finally erupted in the early 1930s in the [[Chaco War]]. After both sides suffered great losses,  defeated  and established its sovereignty over most of the disputed Chaco region. After the war, military officers used popular dissatisfaction with the Liberal politicians to seize the power for themselves. On 17 February 1936, the [[February Revolution ()|February Revolution]] brought colonel [[Rafael Franco]] to power. Between 1940 and 1948, the country was ruled by general [[Higinio Morínigo]]. Dissatisfaction with his rule resulted in the [[ Civil War (1947)| civil war of 1947]]. In its aftermath [[Alfredo Stroessner]] began involvement in a string of plots, which resulted in his military [[1954  coup d'état|coup d'état of 4 May 1954]]. In the aftermath of [[World War II]],  became a hideout for [[Ratlines (World War II aftermath)|Nazi fugitives]] accused of war crimes.

===Stroessner era, 1954–1989===
{{see also|El Stronato|Operation Condor}}
A series of unstable governments ensued until the establishment in 1954 of the regime of dictator [[Alfredo Stroessner]], who remained in office for more than three decades until 1989.  was modernized to some extent under Stroessner's regime, although his rule was marked by extensive human rights abuses.

Stroessner and the ''Colorado'' party ruled the country from 1954 to 1989. The dictator oversaw an era of economic expansion, but also had a poor human rights and environmental record (see "Political History").  actively participated in [[Operation Condor]]. Torture and death for political opponents was routine. After his overthrow, the ''Colorado'' continued to dominate national politics until 2008.

The splits in the ''Colorado'' Party in the 1980s, and the prevailing conditions – Stroessner's advanced age, the character of the regime, the economic downturn, and [[international isolation]] – were catalysts for anti-regime demonstrations and statements by the opposition prior to the 1988 general elections.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

''[[Authentic Radical Liberal Party|PLRA]]'' leader [[Domingo Laíno]] served as the focal point of the opposition in the second half of the 1980s. The government's effort to isolate Laíno by exiling him in 1982 had backfired. On his sixth attempt to reenter the country in 1986, Laíno returned with three television crews from the U.S., a former  ambassador to , and a group of  and  congressmen. Despite the international contingent, the police violently barred Laíno's return.

The Stroessner regime relented in April 1987, and permitted Laíno to return to Asunción. Laíno took the lead in organizing demonstrations and reducing infighting among the opposition party. The opposition was unable to reach agreement on a common strategy regarding the elections, with some parties advocating abstention, and others calling for blank voting. The parties held numerous 'lightning demonstrations' (''mítines relámpagos''), especially in rural areas. Such demonstrations were gathered and quickly disbanded before the arrival of the [[police]].

In response to the upsurge in opposition activities, Stroessner condemned the Accord for advocating "sabotage of the general elections and disrespect of the law". He used national police and civilian [[vigilantes]] of the ''Colorado'' Party to break up demonstrations. A number of opposition leaders were imprisoned or otherwise harassed. {{ill|Hermes Rafael Saguier|es}}, another key leader of the ''PLRA'', was imprisoned for four months in 1987 on charges of sedition. In early February 1988, police arrested 200 people attending a National Coordinating Committee meeting in [[Coronel Oviedo]]. Laíno and several other opposition figures were arrested before dawn on the day of the election, 14 February, and held for twelve hours. The government declared Stroessner's reelection with 89% of the vote.

The opposition attributed the results in part to the virtual Colorado monopoly on the mass media. They noted that 53% of those polled indicated that there was an "uneasiness" in  society. 74% believed that the political situation needed changes, including 45% who wanted a substantial or total change. Finally, 31% stated that they planned to abstain from voting in the February elections.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

===Stroessner's overthrow, post-1989===
On 3 February 1989, Stroessner was overthrown in a military coup headed by General [[Andrés Rodríguez (President)|Andrés Rodríguez]]. As president, Rodríguez instituted political, legal, and economic reforms and initiated a ''rapprochement'' with the international community. Reflecting the deep hunger of the rural poor for land, hundreds immediately occupied thousands of acres of unused territories belonging to Stroessner and his associates; by mid-1990, 19,000 families occupied {{convert|340000|acres|-3|abbr=on}}. At the time, 2.06 million people lived in rural areas, more than half of the 4.1 million total population, and most were landless.

The June 1992 constitution established a democratic system of government and dramatically improved protection of fundamental human rights. In May 1993, Colorado Party candidate [[Juan Carlos Wasmosy]] was elected as 's first civilian president in almost forty years, in what international observers deemed free and fair elections.

With support from the , the Organization of  States, and other countries in the region, the  people rejected an April 1996 attempt by then Army Chief General [[Lino Oviedo]] to oust President Wasmosy.

Oviedo was nominated as the Colorado candidate for president in the 1998 election. However, when the Supreme Court upheld in April his conviction on charges related to the 1996 coup attempt, he was not allowed to run and was detained in jail. His former running mate, [[Raúl Cubas]], became the Colorado Party's candidate, and was elected in May in elections deemed by international observers to be free and fair. One of Cubas' first acts after taking office in August was to commute Oviedo's sentence and release him. In December 1998, 's Supreme Court declared these actions unconstitutional. In this tense atmosphere, the murder of Vice President and long-time Oviedo rival [[Luis María Argaña]] on 23 March 1999, led the Chamber of Deputies to impeach Cubas the next day.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} On 26 March, eight student anti-government demonstrators were murdered, widely believed to have been carried out by Oviedo supporters. This increased opposition to Cubas, who resigned on 28 March. Senate President [[Luis González Macchi]], a Cubas opponent, was peacefully sworn in as president the same day.

In 2003, [[Nicanor Duarte]] was elected as president.

===Election of Fernando Lugo===
For the 2008 general elections, the Colorado Party was favored in polls. Their candidate was Minister of Education [[Blanca Ovelar]], the first woman to be nominated as a candidate for a major party in  history. After sixty years of Colorado rule, voters chose [[Fernando Lugo]], a former Roman Catholic Bishop and not a professional politician in civil government, and a member of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, 's largest opposition party. Lugo was an adherent of [[liberation theology]]. Lugo achieved a historic victory in 's presidential election, defeating the ruling party candidate, and ending 61 years of conservative rule. Lugo won with nearly 41% of the vote, compared to almost 31% for Blanca Ovelar of the Colorado party. Outgoing President [[Nicanor Duarte|Nicanor Duarte Frutos]] hailed the moment as the first time in the history of the nation that a government had transferred power to opposition forces in a constitutional and peaceful fashion.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

Lugo was sworn in on 15 August 2008. The Lugo administration set its two major priorities as the reduction of corruption and economic inequality.

[[File:Saludo de Piñera a Cartes (cropped).jpg|thumb|Inauguration of former President [[Horacio Cartes]], 15 August 2013]] 
Political instability following Lugo's election and disputes within his cabinet encouraged some renewal of popular support for the Colorado Party. Reports suggested that the businessman [[Horacio Cartes]] became the new political figure amid disputes. Despite the US [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]'s strong accusations against Cartes related to [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]], he continued to amass followers in the political arena.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

On 14 January 2011, the Colorado Party convention nominated Horacio Cartes as the presidential candidate for the party. However, the party's constitution did not allow it.{{clarify|date=April 2012}}
On 21 June 2012, [[Impeachment of Fernando Lugo|impeachment proceedings against President Lugo]] began in the country's lower house, which was controlled by his opponents. Lugo was given less than twenty-four hours to prepare for the proceedings and only two hours in which to mount a defense. Impeachment was quickly approved and the resulting trial in 's Senate, also controlled by the opposition, ended with the removal of Lugo from office and Vice President Federico Franco assuming the duties of president. Lugo's rivals blamed him for the deaths of 17 people – eight police officers and nine farmers – in armed clashes after police were ambushed by armed peasants when enforcing an eviction order against rural trespassers.

On 14 May 2011,  celebrated its [[ Bicentennial|bicentenary]] on the 200th anniversary of independence from the  Empire as a sovereign state.

Lugo's supporters gathered outside Congress to protest the decision as a "politically motivated coup d'état". Lugo's removal from office on 22 June 2012 is considered by [[UNASUR]] and other neighboring countries, especially those currently governed by leftist leaders, as a coup d'état. However, the Organization of  States, which sent a mission to  to gather information, concluded that the impeachment process was not a coup d'état, as it had been carried out in accordance with the [[Constitution of ]].

===Present day===
From August 2013 to 15 August 2018, the [[President of ]] was [[Horacio Cartes]]. Since 15 August 2018, the [[President of ]] has been [[Mario Abdo Benítez]]. They are both from the conservative [[Colorado Party ()|Colorado Party]]. President Mario Abdo enjoyed a close relationship with the  far-right president (in power 2019–2022), [[Jair Bolsonaro]]. In February 2019, President Mario Abdo Benitez was at Bolsonaro's side when Bolsonaro praised  military dictator Alfredo Stroessner, calling him "a man of vision". In 2021,  became the first country in South America to produce electric energy in its [[100% renewable energy]] supply. In May 2023, [[Santiago Peña]] of the long-ruling Colorado Party, won the presidential [[2023  general election|election]] to succeed Mario Abdo as the next [[President of ]]. On 15 August 2023, Santiago Peña was sworn in as 's new president.
