=== Independence ===
The  Republic was proclaimed on 27 April 1960. In the [[ general election, 1961]], [[Sylvanus Olympio]] became the first president, gaining 100 per cent of the vote in elections boycotted by the opposition. On 9 April 1961, the Constitution of the  Republic was adopted, according to which the supreme legislative body was the [[National Assembly of ]]. In December 1961, leaders of opposition parties were arrested because they were accused of the preparation of an anti-government conspiracy. A decree was issued on the dissolution of the opposition parties. Olympio tried to reduce dependence on  by establishing cooperation with the , , and [[West ]]. He rejected the efforts of  soldiers who were demobilized after the [[ War]] and tried to get a position in the  army. These factors eventually led to a military coup on 13 January 1963 during which he was [[assassinate]]d by a group of soldiers under the direction of Sergeant [[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]]. A state of emergency was declared in . The military handed over power to an interim government led by [[Nicolas Grunitzky]]. In May 1963, Grunitzky was elected President of the Republic. The new leadership pursued a policy of developing relations with . His main aim was to dampen the divisions between north and south, promulgate a new constitution, and introduce a multiparty system.

On 13 January 1967, Eyadéma overthrew Grunitzky in a bloodless coup and assumed the presidency. He created the [[Rally of the  People|Rally of the  People Party]], banned activities of other political parties and introduced a [[one-party system]] in November 1969. He was reelected in 1979 and 1986. In 1983, the [[privatization]] program launched and in 1991 other political parties were allowed. In 1993, the [[European Union]] froze the partnership, describing Eyadéma's re-election in 1993, 1998 and 2003, as a seizure of power. In April 2004, in [[Brussels]], talks were held between the EU and  on the resumption of cooperation.

Eyadéma Gnassingbé died on Saturday, 5 February 2005. The military's installation of his son, [[Faure Gnassingbé]], as president provoked international condemnation, except from . Some "democratically elected" African leaders such as [[Abdoulaye Wade]] of [[]] and [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] of [[]] supported the move, creating a rift within the [[African Union]]. Gnassingbé left power and held elections, which he won two months later. The opposition declared that the election results were fraudulent. The events of 2005 led to questions regarding the government's commitment to [[democracy]] that had been made in an attempt to normalize relations with the EU which cut off [[aid]] in 1993 due to questions about 's human rights situation. Up to 400 people were killed in the violence surrounding the presidential elections, according to the UN. Around 40,000  fled to neighbouring countries. Gnassingbé was reelected in 2010 and 2015.
