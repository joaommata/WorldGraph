[[File:20100923 amman37.JPG|thumb|The [['Ain Ghazal Statues]], c. 7250 BC, uncovered in Amman, are some of the oldest human statues ever found.]]

The oldest known evidence of [[hominid]] habitation in  dates back at least 200,000 years.  is a rich source of [[Paleolithic]] human remains (up to 20,000 years old) due to its location within the [[Levant]], where [[Recent African origin of modern humans|migrations out of Africa]] converged, and its more humid climate during the [[Late Pleistocene]], which resulted in the formation of numerous remains-preserving wetlands in the region. Past lakeshore environments attracted different groups of hominids, and several remains of tools dating from the Late Pleistocene have been found there. Scientists have found the world's oldest known evidence of bread-making at a 14,500-year-old [[Natufian culture|Natufian]] site in 's northeastern desert.

During the [[Neolithic]] period (10,000–4,500 BC), there was a transition there from a [[hunter-gatherer]] culture to a culture with established populous agricultural villages. [[Ayn Ghazal (archaeological site)|'Ain Ghazal]], one such village located at a site in the eastern part of present-day [[Amman]], is one of the largest known prehistoric settlements in the [[Near East]]. [['Ain Ghazal Statues|Dozens of plaster statues]] of the human form, dating to 7250 BC or earlier, have been uncovered there. They are one of the oldest large-scale representations of humans ever found. During the [[Chalcolithic|Chalcolithic period]] (4500–3600 BC), several villages emerged in Transjordan including [[Teleilat el Ghassul|Tulaylet Ghassul]] in the [[ Valley]]; a series of circular stone enclosures in the eastern basalt desert from the same period have long baffled archaeologists.

Fortified towns and urban centres first emerged in the southern Levant early in the [[Bronze Age]] (3600–1200 BC). [[Wadi Feynan]] became a regional centre for copper extraction: the metal was exploited on a large scale to produce bronze. Trade and movement of people in the Middle East peaked, causing cultural innovations and whole civilisations to spread. Villages in Transjordan expanded rapidly in areas with reliable water-resources and arable land. [[Ancient ]]ian populations expanded towards the Levant and came to control both banks of the  River.

During the [[Iron Age]] (1200–332 BC), after the withdrawal of the Egyptians, Transjordan was home to the kingdoms of [[Ammon]], [[Edom]] and [[Moab]]. These peoples spoke [[Semitic languages]] of the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite group]]. Archaeologists have concluded that their polities were tribal kingdoms rather than states. Ammon was located in the Amman plateau; Moab in the highlands east of the Dead Sea; and Edom in the area around [[Arabah|Wadi Araba]] in the south. The northwestern region of the Transjordan, known then as [[Gilead]], was settled by the [[Israelites]]. 

The three kingdoms continually clashed with the neighbouring Hebrew kingdoms of [[Kingdom of  (Samaria)|]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], centred west of the  River. One record of this is the [[Mesha Stele]], erected by the Moabite king [[Mesha]] in 840 BC. In an inscription on it, he lauds himself for the building projects that he initiated in Moab and commemorates his glory and his victory against the Israelites. The stele constitutes one of the most important archeological parallels to [[Historicity of the Bible|accounts recorded in the Bible]]. At the same time,  and the Kingdom of [[Aram-Damascus]] competed for control of the Gilead.

Around 740–720 BC,  and Aram-Damascus were conquered by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]. The kingdoms of Ammon, Edom and Moab were subjugated but were allowed to maintain some degree of independence. Then in 627 BC, following after the disintegration of the Assyrians' empire, [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonians]] took control of the area. Although the kingdoms supported the Babylonians against Judah in the 597 BC [[Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)|sack of Jerusalem]], they rebelled against Babylon a decade later. The kingdoms were reduced to [[vassal]]s, a status they retained under the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Hellenic]] empires. By the beginning of [[Roman Empire|Roman rule]] around 63 BC, the kingdoms of Ammon, Edom and Moab had lost their distinct identities and were assimilated into the Roman culture. Some Edomites survived longer – driven by the Nabataeans, they had migrated to southern [[Judea]], which became known as [[Idumaea]]. They were later converted to [[Judaism]] by the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmoneans]].

=== Classical period ===

[[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Wars of Alexander the Great|conquest]] of the Persian Empire in 332 BC introduced [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic culture]] to the Middle East.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=10}} After Alexander's death in 323 BC, the [[Partition of Babylon|empire split]] among his generals, and in the end much of Transjordan was disputed between the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemies]] based in  and the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] based in .{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=10}} The [[Nabataeans]], nomadic Arabs based south of Edom, managed to establish an independent kingdom in 169 BC by exploiting the struggle between the two  powers.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=10}} The [[Nabataean Kingdom]] controlled much of the trade routes of the region, and it stretched south along the [[Red Sea]] coast into the [[Hejaz]] desert, up to as far north as [[Damascus]], which it controlled for a short period (85–71 BC).{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=51}} The Nabataeans massed a fortune from their control of the trade routes, often drawing the envy of their neighbours.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=30}} Petra, Nabataea's capital, flourished in the 1st century AD, driven by its extensive water irrigation systems and agriculture.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=70}} The Nabataeans were talented [[stone carving|stone carvers]], building their most elaborate structure, [[Al-Khazneh]], in the first century AD. It is believed to be the [[mausoleum]] of the Arab Nabataean King [[Aretas IV Philopatris|Aretas IV]].

Roman legions under [[Pompey]] conquered much of the Levant in 63 BC, inaugurating a period of Roman rule that lasted four centuries. In 106 AD, Emperor [[Trajan]] annexed Nabataea unopposed and rebuilt the [[King's Highway (ancient)|King's Highway]] which became known as the [[Via Traiana Nova]] road. The Romans gave the  cities of Transjordan—[[Philadelphia (Amman)|Philadelphia]] (Amman), [[Jerash|Gerasa]] (Jerash), [[Umm Qays|Gedara]] (Umm Quays), [[Pella, |Pella]] (Tabaqat Fahl) and [[Irbid|Arbila]] (Irbid)—and other Hellenistic cities in Palestine and southern , a level of autonomy by forming the ''[[Decapolis]]'', a ten-city league. Jerash is one of the best preserved Roman cities in the East; it was even visited by Emperor [[Hadrian]] during his journey to Palestine.

[[File:Jerash 01 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|The Oval Forum of [[Jerash]] (c. 1st century AD), then member of the ten-city Greco-Roman league, the ''[[Decapolis]]'', seven of which are present in modern-day ]]

In 324 AD, the Roman Empire split and the Eastern Roman Empire, later known as the [[Byzantine Empire]], continued to control or influence the region until 636. Christianity had [[Edict of Milan|become legal within the empire in 313]] after co-emperors [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] and [[Licinius]] signed an&nbsp;edict of toleration. In 380, the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] made Christianity the official state religion. Transjordan prospered during the Byzantine era, and Christian churches were built throughout the region.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=14}} 

The [[Aqaba Church]] in [[Aqaba|Ayla]] was built during this era. It is considered to be the [[List of oldest church buildings|world's first purpose built Christian church]]. [[Umm ar-Rasas]] in southern Amman contains at least 16 Byzantine churches. Meanwhile, Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after a [[Galilee earthquake of 363|363 earthquake]] destroyed many structures it declined further, eventually being abandoned. The [[Sasanian Empire]] in the east became the Byzantines' rivals, and [[Byzantine–Sasanian wars|frequent confrontations]] sometimes led to the Sasanids controlling some parts of the region, including Transjordan.

=== Islamic era ===
In 629, during the [[Battle of Mu'tah]] in what is today [[Karak Governorate]], the Byzantines and their [[Patronage in ancient Rome|Arab Christian clients]], the [[Ghassanids]], staved off an attack by a Muslim [[Rashidun]] force that marched northwards towards the Levant from the Hejaz. The Byzantines however were defeated by the Muslims in 636 at the decisive [[Battle of the Yarmuk]] just north of Transjordan. Transjordan was an essential territory for the conquest of Damascus. The Rashidun caliphate was followed by that of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] (661–750).

Dating to the 6th century AD, it is the oldest surviving depiction of the [[Holy Land]].]]

Under the Umayyad Caliphate, several [[desert castles]] were constructed in Transjordan, including [[Qasr Al-Mshatta]] and [[Qasr Al-Hallabat]]. The [[Abbasid Caliphate]]'s campaign to take over the Umayyad's began in a village in Transjordan known as [[Humayma]]. The powerful [[749 Galilee earthquake|749 earthquake]] is thought to have contributed to the Umayyads' [[Abbasid revolution|defeat by the Abbasids]], who moved the caliphate's capital from Damascus to [[Baghdad]]. During Abbasid rule (750–969), several Arab tribes moved northwards and settled in the Levant. As had happened during the Roman era, growth of maritime trade diminished Transjordan's central position, and the area became increasingly impoverished.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=21}} After the decline of the Abbasids, Transjordan was ruled by the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] (969–1070), then by the [[Crusades|Crusader]] [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] (1115–1187).{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=22}}

The Crusaders constructed several castles as part of the Lordship of Oultrejordain, including [[Montreal (castle)|Montreal]] and Al-Karak. During the [[Battle of Hattin]] (1187) near [[Sea of Galilee|Lake Tiberias]] just north of Transjordan, the Crusaders lost to [[Saladin]], the founder of the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] (1187–1260).{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=23}} The Ayyubids built the [[Ajloun Castle]] and rebuilt older castles to be used as military outposts against the Crusaders.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=23}} Villages in Transjordan under the Ayyubids became important stops for Muslim pilgrims going to [[Mecca]] who travelled along the route that connected  to the Hejaz. Several of the Ayyubid castles were used and expanded by the [[Mamluk Sultanate|Mamluks]] (1260–1516), who divided Transjordan between the provinces of Karak and Damascus.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=25}} During the next century Transjordan experienced [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] attacks, but the Mongols were ultimately repelled by the Mamluks at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] (1260).

In 1516 the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Caliphate]]'s forces [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–1517)|conquered Mamluk territory]].{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=26}} Agricultural villages in Transjordan witnessed a period of relative prosperity in the 16th century but were later abandoned. Transjordan was of marginal importance to the Ottoman authorities. As a result, Ottoman presence was virtually absent and reduced to annual tax collection visits.

More Arab [[Bedouin]] tribes moved into Transjordan from  and the Hejaz during the first three centuries of Ottoman rule, including the [[Banu 'Adwan|Adwan]], the [[Bani Sakhr]] and the [[Howeitat]].{{sfn|Salibi|1998|pp=26, 27}} These tribes laid claims to different parts of the region, and with the absence of a meaningful Ottoman authority, Transjordan slid into a state of anarchy that continued until the 19th century.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=27}} This led to a short-lived occupation by the [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] forces (1803–1812), an ultra-orthodox Islamic movement that emerged in [[Emirate of Diriyah|Najd]] (in modern-day ).{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=30}} [[Ibrahim Pasha of |Ibrahim Pasha]], son of the [[Muhammad Ali of |governor]] of the [[ Eyalet]], [[Wahhabi War|rooted out the Wahhabis]] under the request of the Ottoman sultan by 1818.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=31}}

In 1833 Pasha turned on the Ottomans and established his rule over the Levant. His policies led to the unsuccessful [[peasants' revolt in Palestine]] in 1834. Transjordanian cities of [[As-Salt]] and Al-Karak [[Siege of Al-Karak (1834)|were destroyed]] by Pasha's forces for harboring a [[Qasim al-Ahmad|peasants' revolt leader]].  rule was [[–Ottoman War (1839–41)|forcibly ended]] in 1841, with Ottoman rule restored. Only after Pasha's campaign did the Ottoman Empire try to solidify its presence in the [[ Vilayet]], which Transjordan was part of.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=37}}

A series of tax and land reforms (''[[Tanzimat]]'') in 1864 brought some prosperity back to agriculture and to abandoned villages; the end of virtual autonomy led a backlash in other areas of Transjordan.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=37}} Muslim [[Circassians]] and [[Chechens]], fleeing [[Circassian genocide| persecution]], sought refuge in the Levant. In Transjordan and with Ottoman support, Circassians first settled in the long-abandoned vicinity of Amman in 1867 and later in the surrounding villages. The Ottoman authorities' establishment of its administration, conscription and heavy taxation policies led to revolts in the areas it controlled.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=38}} Transjordan's tribes in particular revolted during the [[Shoubak revolts|Shoubak]] (1905) and the [[Karak revolt]]s (1910), which were brutally suppressed. The construction of the [[Hejaz Railway]] in 1908—stretching across the length of Transjordan and linking [[Damascus]] with [[Medina]]—helped the population economically, as Transjordan became a stopover for pilgrims.

Increasing policies of [[Turkification]] and centralisation adopted by the Ottoman Empire in the wake of the 1908 [[Young Turk Revolution]] disenchanted the Arabs of the Levant, which contributed to the development of an [[Arab nationalist]] movement. These changes led to the outbreak of the 1916 [[Arab Revolt]] during [[World War I]], which ended four centuries of stagnation under Ottoman rule. The revolt was led by [[Hussein bin Ali, King of Hejaz|Sharif Hussein]] of Mecca, scion of the [[Hashemites|Hashemite family]] of the Hejaz, and his sons [[Abdullah I of |Abdullah]], [[Faisal I of |Faisal]] and [[Ali bin Hussein, King of Hejaz|Ali]]. Locally, the revolt garnered the support of the Transjordanian tribes, including Bedouins, Circassians and [[ Christians|Christians]].{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=41}} The [[Allies of World War&nbsp;I]], including Britain and  whose imperial interests converged with the Arabist cause, offered support.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=40}} The revolt started on 5 June 1916 from Medina and pushed northwards until the fighting reached Transjordan in the [[Battle of Aqaba]] on 6 July 1917. The revolt reached its climax when Faisal entered Damascus in October 1918 and established an Arab-led military administration in [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration|OETA East]], later declared as the [[Arab Kingdom of ]], both of which Transjordan was part of.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=41}} During this period, the southernmost region of the country, including [[Ma'an]] and [[Aqaba]], was also [[Occupation of Ma'an|claimed by]] the neighbouring [[Kingdom of Hejaz]].

Arab aspirations failed to gain international recognition, due mainly to the secret 1916 [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]], which divided the region into  and British spheres of influence, and the 1917 [[Balfour Declaration]], in which Britain announced its support for the establishment of a "national home" for Jews in Palestine.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=34}} This was seen by the Hashemites and the Arabs as a betrayal of their previous agreements with the British,{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=71}} including the 1915 [[McMahon–Hussein Correspondence]], in which the British stated their willingness to recognise the independence of a unified Arab state stretching from [[Aleppo]] to [[Aden]] under the rule of the Hashemites.

British [[List of high commissioners for Palestine and Transjordan|High Commissioner]] [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] travelled to Transjordan on 21 August 1920 to meet with As-Salt's residents. He there declared to a crowd of 600 Transjordanian notables that the British government would aid the establishment of local governments in Transjordan, which was to be kept separate from that of Palestine. The second meeting took place in [[Umm Qais]] on 2 September, where the British representative Major [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Fitzroy Somerset]] received a petition that demanded: an independent Arab government in Transjordan to be led by an Arab prince (emir); land sale in Transjordan to [[Jews]] be stopped as well as the prevention of Jewish immigration there; that Britain establish and fund a national army; and that free trade be maintained between Transjordan and the rest of the region.

On 11 April 1921 the [[Emirate of Transjordan]] was established with Abdullah as emir.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=93}}

In September 1922, the Council of the [[League of Nations]] recognised Transjordan as a state under the terms of the [[Transjordan memorandum]]. Transjordan remained a British mandate until 1946, but it had been granted a greater level of autonomy than the region west of the  River.

The [[Treaty of London (1946)|Treaty of London]], signed by the British government and the Emir of Transjordan on 22 March 1946, recognised the independence of the state. On 25 May 1946, the day that the treaty was ratified by the Transjordan parliament, Transjordan was raised to the status of a kingdom under the name of the ''Hashemite Kingdom of '' in Arabic, with Abdullah as its first king; although it continued to be referred to as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan in  until 1949. 25 May is now celebrated as the nation's [[Independence Day ()|Independence Day]], a [[Public holidays in |public holiday]].  became a member of the United Nations on 14 December 1955.

Following the war,  controlled the [[West Bank]], and on 24 April 1950  formally [[ annexation of the West Bank|annexed these territories]] after the [[Jericho Conference]]. In response, some Arab countries demanded 's expulsion from the [[Arab League]]. On 12 June 1950, the Arab League declared that the annexation was a temporary, practical measure and that  was holding the territory as a "trustee" pending a future settlement.

King Abdullah was assassinated at the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in 1951 by a Palestinian militant, amid rumors he intended to sign a peace treaty with . Abdullah was succeeded by his son [[Talal of |Talal]], who established the [[Constitution of |country's modern constitution]] in 1952. Illness caused Talal to abdicate to his eldest son [[Hussein of |Hussein]], who ascended to the throne in 1953 at age 17.  witnessed great political uncertainty in the following period. The 1950s was a period of political upheaval, as [[Nasserism]] and [[Pan-Arabism]] swept the Arab World. On 1 March 1956, King Hussein [[Arabization of the  Army command|Arabised the command of the Army]] by dismissing a number of senior British officers, an act made to remove remaining foreign influence in the country.

Despite the fact that the Palestinians had limited involvement against the  forces, the events at Karameh gained wide recognition and acclaim in the Arab world. As a result, there was an upsurge of support for Palestinian paramilitary elements (the [[Palestinian fedayeen|fedayeen]]) within  from other Arab countries. The fedayeen activities soon became a threat to 's rule of law. In September 1970, the  army targeted the fedayeen and the resultant fighting led to the expulsion of Palestinian fighters from various PLO groups into , in a conflict that became known as [[Black September]].

On 7 February 1999, [[Abdullah II of |Abdullah II]] ascended the throne upon the death of his father Hussein, who had ruled for nearly 50 years. Abdullah embarked on economic liberalisation when he assumed the throne, and his reforms led to an economic boom which continued until 2008. Abdullah II has been credited with increasing foreign investment, improving public-private partnerships and providing the foundation for [[Aqaba]]'s free-trade zone and 's flourishing information and communication technology sector. He also set up five other special economic zones. However, during the following years 's economy experienced hardship as it dealt with the effects of the [[Great Recession]] and spillover from the [[Arab Spring]].

[[Al-Qaeda]] under [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]]'s leadership launched [[2005 Amman bombings|coordinated explosions]] in three hotel lobbies in Amman on 9 November 2005, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians. The attack is considered to be a rare event in the country, and 's [[General Intelligence Directorate ()|internal security]] was dramatically improved afterwards. No major terrorist attacks have occurred since then. Abdullah and  are viewed with contempt by Islamic extremists for the country's peace treaty with , its relationship with the West, and its mostly non-religious laws.

The Arab Spring were large-scale protests that erupted in the [[Arab world]] in 2011, demanding economic and political reforms. Many of these protests tore down regimes in some Arab nations, leading to instability that ended with violent civil wars. In response to [[2011–2012  protests|domestic unrest]], Abdullah replaced his prime minister and introduced reforms including reforming the constitution and laws governing public freedoms and elections. Proportional representation was re-introduced to the  parliament in the [[2016  general election|2016 general election]], a move which he said would eventually lead to establishing parliamentary governments.  was left largely unscathed from the violence that swept the region despite an influx of 1.4&nbsp;million  refugees into the natural resources-lacking country and the emergence of the [[Islamic State of  and the Levant]] (ISIL).

On 4 April 2021, [[2021 arrests in |19 people were arrested]], including [[Prince Hamzah bin Hussein|Prince Hamzeh]], the former crown prince of , who was placed under house arrest, after having been accused of working to "destabilize" the kingdom.
