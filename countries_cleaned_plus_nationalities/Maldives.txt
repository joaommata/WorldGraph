===Ancient history and settlement===
{{main|History of the #Early Age}}

In the 6th–5th century BCE,  already had their kingdoms. The country has an established history of over 2,500 years according to historical evidence and legends.

The ''[[Mahāvaṃsa]]'' (300 BCE) has records of people from  emigrating to . Assuming that cowrie shells come from , historians believe that there may have been people living in  during the [[Indus Valley civilisation]] (3300{{ndash}}1300 BCE). Several artefacts show the presence of [[Hinduism]] in the country before the Islamic period.

According to the book {{transliteration|ar|Kitāb fi āthār Mīdhu al-qādimah}} ({{lang|ar|كتاب في آثار ميذو القديمة}}) (''On the Ancient Ruins of [[Meedhoo (Addu)|Meedhoo]]''), written in the 17th century in Arabic by Allama Ahmed Shihabuddine (Allama Shihab al-Din) of [[Meedhoo (Addu)|Meedhoo]] in Addu Atoll, the first settlers of  were people known as Dheyvis. They came from the [[Kalibangan|Kalibanga]] in . The time of their arrival is unknown but it was before Emperor [[Ashoka|Asoka]]'s kingdom in 269–232 BCE. Shihabuddin's story tallies remarkably well with the recorded history of South Asia and that of the copperplate document of  known as [[Lōmāfānu|Loamaafaanu]].

The ancient history of  is told in copperplates, ancient scripts carved on coral artefacts, traditions, language, and different ethnicities of . The ''Maapanansa'', the copper plates on which were recorded the history of the first [[List of sultans of the |Kings of ]] from the Solar Dynasty, were lost quite early on.

A 4th-century notice written by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (362 CE) speaks of gifts sent to the Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] by a deputation from the nation of Divi. The name Divi is very similar to Dheyvi who were the first settlers of .

The first  did not leave any archaeological artefacts. Their buildings were probably built of wood, palm fronds, and other perishable materials, which would have quickly decayed in the salt and wind of the tropical climate. Moreover, chiefs or headmen did not reside in elaborate stone palaces, nor did their religion require the construction of large temples or compounds.

Comparative studies of  oral, linguistic, and cultural traditions confirm that the first settlers were people from the southern shores of the neighbouring [[ subcontinent]], including the [[Giraavaru people]], mentioned in ancient legends and local folklore about the establishment of the capital and kingly rule in Malé.

A strong underlying layer of [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] and [[North  culture|North ]] cultures survives in  society, with a clear [[Elu]] substratum in the language, which also appears in place names, kinship terms, poetry, dance, and religious beliefs. The North  system was brought by the original [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] from [[]]. [[Malabar region|Malabar]] and [[Pandyan|Pandya]] seafaring culture led to the settlement of the Islands by [[Tamils|Tamil]] and [[Malabars|Malabar]] seafarers.

===Buddhist period===
{{main|History of the #Buddhist period|Buddhism in the }}{{More citations needed|date=April 2025}}[[File:Loamaafaanu.jpg|thumb|[[Isdhoo (Laamu Atoll)|Isdhoo]] Lōmāfānu is the oldest [[Lōmāfānu|copper-plate]] book to have been discovered in  to date. The book was written in 1194&nbsp;CE (590&nbsp;AH) in the Evēla form of the [[Dhivehi Writing Systems|Divehi akuru]], during the reign of [[Dhinei of the |Siri Fennaadheettha Mahaa Radun (Dhinei Kalaminja)]].]]

Despite being just mentioned briefly in most history books, the 1,400&nbsp;year-long Buddhist period has a foundational importance in the history of . It was during this period that the culture of  both developed and flourished, a culture that survives today. The  [[Dhivehi language|language]], early Maldive scripts, architecture, ruling institutions, customs, and manners of the  originated at the time when  were a Buddhist kingdom.

Buddhism probably spread to  in the 3rd&nbsp;century&nbsp;BCE at the time of Emperor [[Ashoka]]'s expansion and became the dominant religion of the people of  until the 12th&nbsp;century. Archeological evidence from an ancient Buddhist monastery in [[Kaashidhoo (Kaafu Atoll)|Kaashidhoo]] has been dated between 205 and 560 AD, based on the radiocarbon dating of shell deposits unearthed from the foundations of [[stupa]]s and other structures in the monastery. The ancient  Kings promoted [[Buddhism]], and the first Maldive writings and artistic achievements, in the form of highly developed sculpture and architecture, originate from that period. Nearly all archaeological remains in  are from Buddhist [[stupa]]s and monasteries, and all artefacts found to date display characteristic Buddhist iconography.{{citation needed|date=December 2024}}

===Islamic period===
{{See also|History of the #Islamic Period|Islam in |List of  monarchs|Sultanate of }}
The importance of the Arabs as traders in the  Ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why the last Buddhist king of , [[Dhovemi of the |Dhovemi]], converted to Islam in 1153 (or 1193). Adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad al-Adil, he initiated a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the [[Sultanate of |sultanate]] became elective. The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was, ''Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of '' which came with the style ''[[Highness]]''.

A  traveller named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari is traditionally cited for this conversion. According to the story told to [[Ibn Battutah]], a mosque was built with the inscription: 'The Sultan Ahmad Shanurazah accepted Islam at the hand of Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari.' The folk tale regarding the spread of Islam by al-Barbari involved a local belief to an oceanic deity named [[Rannamaari]]. According to the legend, Rannamaari demanded sacrifice of a female virgin each month from the locals. This tradition practiced for long time, until al-Barbari visit  and managed to convert the local ruler and convinced him along with his subjects to abandon the Rannamari worship. According to modern [[Norwegia]]n archaeologist {{ill|Egil Mikkelsen|no|MikkelsenRannaanari}}, it is likely the myth of Rannamari was heavily influenced by [[Vajrayana|Buddhist tantric]] rituals and beliefs that were practiced in the islands at the time.

Some scholars have suggested the possibility of Ibn Battuta misreading Maldive texts, and having a bias towards the North African, Maghrebi narrative of this Shaykh, instead of the Persian origins account that was known as well at the time. Others have it that he may have been from the Persian town of [[Tabriz]]. This interpretation, held by the more reliable local historical chronicles, Raadavalhi and Taarikh, is that Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari was Abdul Barakat Yusuf Shams ud-Dīn at-Tabrīzī, also locally known as Tabrīzugefānu. In the Arabic script the words al-Barbari and al-Tabrizi are very much alike, since at the time, Arabic had several consonants that looked identical and could only be differentiated by overall context (this has since changed by the addition of dots above or below letters to clarify pronunciation. For example, the letter "B" in modern Arabic has a dot below, whereas the letter "T" looks identical except there are two dots above it). "{{script|Arabic|ٮوسڡ الٮٮرٮرى}}" could be read as "Yusuf at-Tabrizi" or "Yusuf al-Barbari".

The venerated tomb of the scholar now stands on the grounds of [[Muliaage#Medhu Ziyaaraiy|Medhu Ziyaaraiy]], across the street from the Friday Mosque, or [[Malé Friday Mosque|Hukuru Miskiy]], in Malé. Originally built in 1153 and re-built in 1658, this is one of the oldest surviving mosques in . Following the Islamic concept that before Islam there was the time of [[Jahiliyyah|Jahiliya]] (ignorance), in the history books used by  the [[#Introduction of Islam|introduction of Islam]] at the end of the 12th century is considered the cornerstone of the country's history. Nonetheless, the cultural influence of Buddhism remains, a reality directly experienced by Ibn Battuta during his nine months there sometime between 1341 and 1345, serving as a chief judge and marrying into the royal family of [[Omar I of the |Omar I]]. For he became embroiled in local politics and left when his strict judgements in the laissez-faire island kingdom began to chafe with its rulers. In particular, he was angered at the local women going about with no clothing above the waist— a cultural epithet of the region at the time- was seen as a violation of Middle Eastern Islamic rules of modesty—and the locals taking no notice when he complained.

Compared to the other areas of South Asia, the conversion of  to Islam happened relatively late.  remained a Buddhist kingdom for another 500 years. Arabic became the prime language of administration (instead of Persian and Urdu), and the [[Maliki]] school of jurisprudence was introduced, both hinting at direct contact with the core of the Arab world.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

Middle Eastern seafarers had just begun to take over the  Ocean trade routes in the 10th century and found  to be an important link in those routes as the first landfall for traders from [[Basra]] sailing to Southeast Asia. Trade involved mainly [[cowrie shells]]—widely used as a form of currency throughout Asia and parts of the East African coast—and coir fibre. The [[Bengal Sultanate]], where cowrie shells were used as legal tender, was one of the principal trading partners of . The Bengal– cowry shell trade was the largest shell currency trade network in history.

The other essential product of  was [[coir]], the fibre of the dried [[coconut]] [[husk]], resistant to saltwater. It stitched together and rigged the [[dhow]]s that plied the  Ocean.  coir was exported to [[Sindh]], [[]], [[]], and the [[Persian Gulf]].

===Protectorate period===
[[File:ConstantinoBraganca.jpg|thumb|[[ Empire| presence]] in  was established in 1558, by order of [[Constantino of Braganza]], Viceroy of [[ ]].]]

In 1558, the  established a small garrison with a {{lang|pt|Viador}} ({{transliteration|dv|Viyazoaru}}), or overseer of a [[factory (trading post)]] in , which they administered from their main colony in [[Goa]]. Their attempts to forcefully impose Christianity with the threat of death provoked a local revolt led by [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu al-Auzam|Muhammad Thakurufaanu al-A'uẓam]], his two brothers, and [[Dhuvaafaru]] Dhandahele, who fifteen years later drove the  out of . This event is now commemorated as [[Qaumee Dhuvas]] ({{Literal translation|National Day}}). It is celebrated on the 1st of [[Rabi' al-Awwal]], the third month of [[Islamic Calendar|Hijri]] (Islamic) calendar.

In the mid-17th century, the , who had replaced the  as the dominant power in [[Ceylon]], established hegemony over  affairs without involving themselves directly in local matters, which were governed according to centuries-old Islamic customs.

The  expelled the  from Ceylon in 1796 and included  as a [[ protectorate]]. The status of  as a  protectorate was officially recorded in an 1887 agreement in which the sultan [[Muhammad Mueenuddeen II]] accepted  influence over  external relations and defence while retaining home rule, which continued to be regulated by [[Muslim]] traditional institutions in exchange for an [[ annual tribute|annual tribute]]. The status of the islands was akin to other  protectorates in the  Ocean region, including [[Zanzibar]] and the [[Trucial States]].

In the  period, the Sultan's powers were taken over by the Chief Minister, much to the chagrin of the  Governor-General who continued to deal with the ineffectual Sultan. Consequently, Britain encouraged the development of a [[constitutional monarchy]], and the first Constitution was proclaimed in 1932. However, the new arrangements favoured neither the Sultan nor the Chief Minister, but rather a young crop of -educated reformists. As a result, angry mobs were instigated against the Constitution which was publicly torn up.

 remained a  crown protectorate until 1953 when the sultanate was suspended and the First Republic was declared under the short-lived presidency of [[Mohamed Amin Didi]]. While serving as prime minister during the 1940s, Didi nationalised the fish export industry. As president, he is remembered as a reformer of the education system and an advocate of [[women's rights]]. Conservatives in Malé ousted his government, and during a riot over food shortages, Didi was beaten by a mob and died on a nearby island.

Beginning in the 1950s, the political history in  was largely influenced by the  military presence on the islands. In 1954, the restoration of the sultanate perpetuated the rule of the past. Two years later, the  obtained permission to reestablish its wartime [[RAF Gan]] airfield in the southernmost Addu Atoll, employing hundreds of locals. In 1957, however, the new prime minister, [[Ibrahim Nasir]], called for a review of the agreement. Nasir was challenged in 1959 by a local secessionist movement in the three southernmost atolls that benefited economically from the  presence on [[Gan (Addu Atoll)|Gan]]. This group cut ties with  government and formed an independent state, the [[United Suvadive Republic]] with [[Abdullah Afeef]] as president and [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]] as its capital. One year later the Suvadive Republic was scrapped after Nasir sent gunboats from Malé with government police, and Abdullah Afeef went into exile. Meanwhile, in 1960  allowed the  to continue to use both the [[RAF Gan|Gan]] and the Hithadhoo facilities for thirty years, with the payment of £750,000 from 1960 to 1965 for ' economic development. The base was closed in 1976 as part of the larger  withdrawal of permanently stationed forces '[[East of Suez]]'.

===Independence and republic===
{{Main|Independence of the }}When the  became increasingly unable to continue their colonial hold on Asia and were losing their colonies to the indigenous populations who wanted freedom, on 26 July 1965 an agreement was signed on behalf of the Sultan by Ibrahim Nasir Rannabandeyri Kilegefan, Prime Minister, and on behalf of the  government by [[Michael Walker (diplomat)|Sir Michael Walker]],  Ambassador-designate to the Maldive Islands, which formally ended the  authority on the defence and external affairs of . The islands thus achieved independence, with the ceremony taking place at the  High Commissioner's Residence in [[Colombo]]. After this, the sultanate continued for another three years under [[Muhammad Fareed Didi|Sir Muhammad Fareed Didi]], who declared himself King upon independence.[[File:Flag of the Sultan of The .svg|thumb|Flag of the [[List of  monarchs|Sultan of ]]]]
[[File:Prime Minister Ibrahim Nasir signs independence papers.jpg|thumb|Prime Minister Ibrahim Nasir signs independence agreement with the  on July 26, 1965.]]

On 15 November 1967, a vote was taken in parliament to decide whether  should continue as a constitutional monarchy or become a republic. Of the 44 members of parliament, 40 voted in favour of a republic. On 15 March 1968, a [[1968  constitutional referendum|national referendum]] was held on the question, and 93.34% of those taking part voted in favour of establishing a republic. The republic was declared on 11 November 1968, thus ending the 853-year-old monarchy, which was replaced by a republic under the presidency of Ibrahim Nasir. As the King had held little real power, this was seen as a cosmetic change and required few alterations in the structures of government.

[[Tourism in the |Tourism]] began to be developed on the [[archipelago]] by the beginning of the 1970s. The first resort in  was [[Kurumba ]] which welcomed the first guests on 3 October 1972. The first accurate census was held in December 1977 and showed 142,832 people living in .

Political infighting during the 1970s between Nasir's faction and other political figures led to the 1975 arrest and exile of elected prime minister [[Ahmed Zaki (politician)|Ahmed Zaki]] to a remote [[atoll]]. Economic decline followed the closure of the [[Gan International Airport| airfield at Gan]] and the collapse of the market for dried fish, an important export. With support for his administration faltering, Nasir fled to  in 1978, with millions of dollars from the treasury.

[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] began his 30-year role as president in 1978, winning six consecutive elections without opposition. His election was seen as ushering in a period of political stability and economic development given Maumoon's priority to develop the poorer islands. Tourism flourished and increased foreign contact spurred development. However, Maumoon's rule was controversial, with some critics saying Maumoon was an autocrat who quelled dissent by limiting freedoms and practising political favouritism.

A series of coup attempts (in 1980, 1983, and 1988) by Nasir supporters and business interests tried to topple the government without success. While the first two attempts met with little success, the [[1988  coup attempt|1988 coup attempt]] involved a roughly 80-strong mercenary force of the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam|PLOTE]] who seized the airport and caused Maumoon to flee from house to house until the intervention of 1,600 [[ Armed Forces| troops]] airlifted into Malé restored order.

The November 1988 coup d'état was headed by Ibrahim Lutfee, a businessman, and Sikka Ahmed Ismail Manik, the father of the former first lady of  [[Fazna Ahmed]]. The attackers were defeated by then [[ National Defence Force|National Security Services of ]]. On the night of 3 November 1988, the [[ Air Force]] airlifted a [[Parachute Regiment ()#Operation Cactus|parachute battalion group]] from [[Agra]] and flew them over {{convert|2000|km|mi}} to . By the time  armed forces reached , the mercenary forces has already left Malé on the hijacked ship MV Progress Light. The  [[paratroopers]] landed at [[Hulhulé Island|Hulhulé]] and secured the airfield and restored the government rule at Malé within hours. The brief operation labelled ''Operation Cactus'', also involved the [[ Navy]] that assisted in capturing the freighter MV Progress Light and rescued the hostages and crew.

Only nine islands were reported to have escaped any flooding, while fifty-seven islands faced serious damage to critical infrastructure, fourteen islands had to be totally evacuated, and six islands were destroyed. A further twenty-one resort islands were forced to close because of tsunami damage. The total damage was estimated at more than US$400&nbsp;million, or some 62% of the GDP. 102  and 6 foreigners reportedly died in the tsunami. The destructive impact of the waves on the low-lying islands was mitigated by the fact there was no continental shelf or land mass upon which the waves could gain height. The tallest waves were reported to be {{convert|14|ft|m}} high.[[File:The Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh along with other Head of State and Government of SAARC Countries, at the inaugural session of the 17th SAARC Summit, at Adu Atoll in  on November 10, 2011.jpg|thumb|250px|[[17th SAARC summit]] in [[Addu City]], ]]

During the later part of Maumoon's rule, independent political movements emerged in , which challenged the then-ruling [[Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party]] ( People's Party, MPP) and demanded democratic reform. The dissident journalist and activist [[Mohamed Nasheed]] founded the [[ Democratic Party]] (MDP) in 2003 and pressured Maumoon into allowing gradual political reforms. In 2008, a new constitution was approved and the [[2008  presidential election|first direct presidential elections]] occurred, which were won by Nasheed in the second round. His administration faced many challenges, including the huge debt left by the previous government, the economic downturn following the 2004 tsunami, overspending using overprinting of local currency (the [[rufiyaa]]), unemployment, corruption, and increasing drug use.{{unreliable source?|date=April 2013}} Taxation on goods was imposed for the first time in the country, and import duties were reduced on many goods and services. Universal health insurance ([[Aasandha]]) and social welfare benefits were given to those aged 65 years or older, single parents, and those with special needs.

Social and [[2011–2013  political crisis|political unrest grew in late 2011]], following opposition campaigns in the name of protecting Islam. Nasheed controversially resigned from office after a large number of police and army mutinied in February 2012. Nasheed's vice-president, [[Mohamed Waheed Hassan|Mohamed Waheed Hassan Manik]], was sworn in as president.
Nasheed was later arrested, convicted of terrorism, and sentenced to 13 years. The trial was widely seen as flawed and political. The [[Working Group on Arbitrary Detention|UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention]] called for Nasheed's immediate release.

The [[2013  presidential election]] results were highly contested. Former president Nasheed won the most votes in the first round, but the [[Supreme Court of the |Supreme Court]] annulled it despite the positive assessment of international election observers. In the re-run vote [[Abdulla Yameen]], the half-brother of the former president Maumoon, assumed the presidency. Yameen survived an assassination attempt in late 2015. Vice-president [[Mohamed Jameel Ahmed]] was removed from office after a [[no confidence motion]] from the People's Majlis, it was alleged that he was conspiring with opposition political parties and planning riots. Vice-president [[Ahmed Adeeb]] was later arrested together with 17 supporters for "public order offences" and the government instituted a broader crackdown against his accomplices. A [[state of emergency]] was later declared ahead of a planned anti-government rally, and the People's Majlis (parliament) accelerated the removal of Adeeb.

[[2018  presidential election|In the 2018 election]], [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]] won the most votes, and was sworn in as ' new president in November 2018. Adeeb was freed by courts in Male in July 2019 after his conviction on charges of terrorism and corruption was overruled but was placed under a [[travel ban]] after the state prosecutor appealed the order in a corruption and money laundering case. Adeeb escaped in a [[tugboat]] to [[Asylum seeker|seek asylum]] in . It is understood that the [[ Coast Guard]] escorted the tugboat to the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) and he was then "transferred" to a [[ Coast Guard]] ship, where officials took him into custody.
Former president Abdulla Yameen was sentenced to five years in prison in November 2019 for money laundering. The [[High Court of the |High Court]] upheld the jail sentence in January 2021. However, Supreme Court overturned Yameen's conviction in November 2021.

In the [[2023  presidential election|2023 election]], [[People's National Congress ()|People's National Congress]] (PNC) candidate [[Mohamed Muizzu]] won the second-round runoff of  presidential election, beating incumbent president, Ibrahim Solih, with 54% of the vote. On 17 October 2023, Mohamed Muizzu was sworn in as the eighth President of the Republic of . Mohamed Muizzu is widely seen to be pro-, souring relations with . In 2024, ex-President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom was freed from his 11-year conviction and the High Court ordered a new trial.
