The earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of  dates back to the late [[Stone Age]] and is related to the [[Guruchay culture]] of [[Azykh Cave]]. Early settlements included the [[Scythia]]ns during the 9th century BC. Following the Scythians,  [[Medes]] came to dominate the area to the south of the [[Aras (river)|Aras river]]. The Medes forged a vast empire between 900 and 700&nbsp;BC, which was integrated into the [[Achaemenid Empire]] around 550&nbsp;BC. The area was conquered by the Achaemenids leading to the spread of [[Zoroastrianism]].

The [[Sasanian Empire]] turned [[Caucasian ]] into a [[vassal state]] in 252, while King [[Urnayr]] officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century. Despite Sassanid rule, Caucasian  remained an entity in the region until the 9th century, while fully subordinate to Sassanid , and retained its monarchy. Despite being one of the chief vassals of the Sasanian emperor, the  king had only a semblance of authority, and the Sasanian [[marzban]] (military governor) held most civil, religious, and military authority.

In the first half of the 7th century, Caucasian , as a vassal of the Sasanians, came under nominal Muslim rule with the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] repulsed both the Sasanians and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] from the [[South Caucasus]] and turned Caucasian  into a vassal state after Christian resistance led by King [[Juansher]] was suppressed in 667. The power vacuum left by the decline of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the [[Sallarid dynasty|Sallarids]], [[Sajid dynasty|Sajids]], and [[Shaddadids]]. At the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by the waves of migrating [[Oghuz Turks]] from Central Asia, who adopted a [[Turkoman (ethnonym)|Turkoman]] [[ethnonym]] at the time. The first of these Turkic dynasties established was the [[Seljuk Empire]], which entered the area by 1067.

The pre-Turkic population spoke several [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and Caucasian languages, among them [[ language|]] and an [[ languages| language]], [[Old Azeri]], which was gradually replaced by a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]], the early precursor of the [[ language]] of today. Some linguists have also stated that the [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tati dialects]] of [[ ()| ]] and the Republic of , like those spoken by the [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tats]], are descended from Old Azeri.
Locally, the possessions of the subsequent Seljuk Empire were ruled by [[Eldiguzids]], technically vassals of the Seljuk sultans, but sometimes ''de facto'' rulers themselves. Under the Seljuks, local poets such as [[Nizami Ganjavi]] and [[Khaqani]] gave rise to a blossoming of [[Persian literature]] in the region.

[[Shirvanshahs]], the local dynasty of Arabic origin that was later Persianized, became a vassal state of [[Timurid Empire]] of [[Timur]] and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the [[Golden Horde]] [[Tokhtamysh]]. Following Timur's death, two independent and rival Turkoman states emerged: [[Qara Qoyunlu]] and [[Aq Qoyunlu]]. The Shirvanshahs returned, maintaining for numerous centuries to come a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals as they had done since 861. In 1501, the [[Safavid dynasty]] of  subdued the Shirvanshahs and gained its possessions. In the course of the next century, the Safavids [[Safavid conversion of  to Shia Islam|converted the formerly Sunni population to Shia Islam]], as they did with the population in what is modern-day . The Safavids allowed the Shirvanshahs to remain in power under Safavid suzerainty until 1538, when Safavid King [[Tahmasp I]] completely deposed them and made the area into the Safavid [[Safavid Shirvan|province of Shirvan]]. The Sunni Ottomans briefly managed to occupy present-day  as a result of the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–1590)|Ottoman–Safavid War of 1578–1590]]; by the early 17th century, they were ousted by Safavid  ruler [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]]. In the wake of the demise of the Safavid dynasty, [[Baku]] and its environs were briefly occupied by the  as a consequence of the [[Russo-Persian War (1722–1723)|Russo-Persian War of 1722–1723]]. Remainder of present  was [[Nader Shah#First Ottoman campaign and the reconquest of the Caucasus|occupied by the Ottomans]] from 1722 to 1736. Despite brief intermissions such as these by Safavid 's neighboring rivals, the land remained under  rule from the earliest advent of the Safavids up to the course of the 19th century.

===Modern history===

After the Safavids, the area was ruled by the  [[Afsharid dynasty]]. After the death of [[Nader Shah]] in 1747, many of his former subjects capitalized on the eruption of instability. [[Khanates of the Caucasus|Numerous khanate]]s with various forms of autonomy emerged. The rulers of these khanates were directly related to the ruling dynasties of  and were vassals and [[Commoners|subjects]] of the  shah. The khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between Central Asia and the West.

Thereafter, the area was under the successive rule of the  [[Zand dynasty|Zand]]s and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]]. From the late 18th century, [[ Empire|Imperial ]] switched to a more aggressive geo-political stance towards  and the [[Ottoman Empire]].  actively tried to gain possession of the Caucasus region which was, for the most part, in the hands of . In 1804, the  [[Siege of Ganja (1804)|invaded and sacked the  town of Ganja]], sparking the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)|Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813]]. The militarily superior  ended the war with a victory. Following Qajar 's loss, it was forced to concede suzerainty over most of the khanates, along with  and Dagestan to the  Empire, per the [[Treaty of Gulistan]].

About a decade later, in violation of the Gulistan treaty, the  invaded 's [[Erivan Khanate]]. This sparked the final bout of hostilities between the two, the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)|Russo-Persian War of 1826–1828]]. The resulting [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] forced Qajar  to cede sovereignty over the Erivan Khanate, the [[Nakhchivan Khanate]] and the remainder of the [[Talysh Khanate]]. After the incorporation of all Caucasian territories from  into , the border between the two was set at the Aras River.

Despite the  conquest, throughout the entire 19th century, preoccupation with [[Culture of | culture]], [[Literature of |literature]], and language remained widespread among Shia and Sunni intellectuals in the -held cities of Baku, Ganja and Tiflis ([[Tbilisi]], now ). Within the same century, in post- -held East Caucasia, an  national identity emerged at the end of the 19th century. As a result of the  conquest, the [[]] are nowadays parted between two nations:  and .

After the collapse of the  Empire during [[World War I]], the short-lived [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]] was declared, constituting the present-day republics of , , and . It was followed by the [[March Days]] massacres that took place between 30 March and 2 April 1918 in Baku and adjacent areas of the [[Baku Governorate]]. When the republic dissolved in May 1918, the leading [[Musavat]] party declared independence as the [[ Democratic Republic]] (ADR), adopting the name of "", a name that prior to the proclamation of the ADR was solely used to refer to the adjacent [[ |northwestern region of contemporary ]]. The ADR was the first modern [[parliamentary republic]] in the Muslim world. Among the important accomplishments of the Parliament was the extension of suffrage to women, making ADR the first Muslim nation to grant women equal political rights with men. [[Baku State University]], first modern university founded in the Muslim East, was established during this period.

Independent  lasted only 23 months until the [[Bolshevik]] [[11th Army (RSFSR)|11th Soviet Red Army]] invaded it, establishing the [[ Soviet Socialist Republic]] on 28 April 1920. Although the bulk of the newly formed  army was engaged in putting down an  revolt that had  broken out in [[Karabakh]],  did not surrender their brief independence of 1918–20 quickly or easily. As many as 20,000  soldiers died resisting what was effectively a  reconquest. Within the ensuing early Soviet period, the  national identity was forged.

On 13 October 1921, the Soviet republics of , , , and  signed an agreement with  known as the [[Treaty of Kars]]. The previously independent [[Republic of Aras]] would also become the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] within the  SSR by the treaty of Kars. On the other hand,  was awarded the region of [[Syunik Province|Zangezur]] and  agreed to return [[Gyumri]] (then known as Alexandropol).

During [[World War II]],  played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of the [[Soviet Union]], with 80 percent of the Soviet Union's oil on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] being supplied by Baku. By decree of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] in February 1942, the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the oil industry of  were awarded orders and medals. [[Operation Edelweiss]] carried out by the  [[Wehrmacht]] targeted Baku because of its importance as the energy (petroleum) dynamo of the USSR. A fifth of all  fought in the Second World War from 1941 to 1945. Approximately 681,000 people (with over 100,000 women) went to the front, while the total population of  was 3.4&nbsp;million at the time. Some 250,000 people from  were killed on the front. More than 130  were named [[Hero of the Soviet Union|heroes of the Soviet Union]].  Major-General [[Azi Aslanov]] was twice awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union.

===Independence===

Following the politics of ''[[glasnost]]'' initiated by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the Soviet Union, including [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast|Nagorno-Karabakh]], an autonomous region of the  SSR. The disturbances in , in response to Moscow's indifference to an already heated conflict, resulted in calls for independence and secession, which culminated in the [[Black January]] events in Baku. Later in 1990, the [[Supreme Soviet of  SSR|Supreme Council of the  SSR]] dropped the words "Soviet Socialist" from the title, adopted the "Declaration of Sovereignty of the  Republic" and restored the flag of the  Democratic Republic as the state flag. As a consequence of the failed [[1991 Soviet coup attempt]] in Moscow, the Supreme Council of  adopted a Declaration of Independence on 18 October 1991 which was affirmed by a nationwide referendum in December, while the Soviet Union officially ceased to exist on 26 December. The country celebrates its [[Day of Restoration of Independence ()|Day of Restoration of Independence]] on 18 October.

The early years of independence were overshadowed by the [[First Nagorno-Karabakh war]] with the ethnic  majority of Nagorno-Karabakh backed by . By the end of the hostilities in 1994,  controlled 14–16 percent of  territory, including Nagorno-Karabakh. During the war many atrocities and pogroms by both sides were committed including the massacres at [[Capture of Gushchular and Malibeyli|Malibeyli, Gushchular]] and [[Capture of Garadaghly|Garadaghly]] and the [[Khojaly massacre]], along with the [[Baku pogrom]], the [[Maraga massacre]] and the [[Kirovabad pogrom]]. Furthermore, an estimated 30,000 people were killed and more than a million people were displaced (more than 800,000  and 300,000 ). Four [[United Nations Security Council]] resolutions ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 822|822]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 853|853]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 874|874]], and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 884|884]]) demand for "the immediate withdrawal of all  forces from all occupied territories of ." Many  and  fled  as refugees during the 1990s. According to the 1970 census, there were 510,000 ethnic [[ diaspora|]] and 484,000  in .

===Aliyev family rule, 1993–present===
[[File:Nagorno-Karabakh conflict map (pre-2020).png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Military situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh region prior to the [[Second Nagorno-Karabakh War]]]]
In 1993, democratically elected President [[Abulfaz Elchibey]] was overthrown by a military insurrection led by Colonel [[Surat Huseynov]], which resulted in the rise to power of the former leader of Soviet , [[Heydar Aliyev]]. In 1994, Huseynov, by that time the prime minister, attempted another military coup against Heydar Aliyev, but he was arrested and charged with treason. In 1995 [[1995  coup d'état attempt|another coup]] was attempted against Aliyev, this time by the commander of the  [[OMON]] special police unit, [[Rovshan Javadov]]. The coup was averted, resulting in the death of Javadov and disbanding of 's OMON units. At the same time, the country was tainted by rampant corruption in the governing bureaucracy. In October 1998, Aliyev was re-elected for a second term.

[[Ilham Aliyev]], Heydar Aliyev's son, became chairman of the [[New  Party]] as well as [[President of ]] when his father died in 2003. He was [[ presidential election, 2013|re-elected to a third term]] as president in October 2013. In April 2018, Aliyev secured his fourth consecutive term in the [[2018  presidential election|election]] that was boycotted by the main opposition parties as fraudulent. On 27 September 2020, clashes in the unresolved [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]] resumed along the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Line of Contact]]. Both the armed forces of  and  reported military and civilian casualties. The [[2020 Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement|Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement]] and the end of the six-week [[Second Nagorno-Karabakh War|war between  and ]] was widely celebrated in , as they made significant territorial gains. Despite the much improved economy, particularly with the exploitation of the [[Azeri–Chirag–Gunashli|Azeri–Chirag–Guneshli]] oil field and [[Shah Deniz gas field]], the Aliyev family rule has been criticized with election fraud, high levels of economic inequality and [[Corruption in |domestic corruption]]. In September 2023,  [[2023  offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh|launched an offensive]] against the breakaway [[Republic of Artsakh]] in Nagorno-Karabakh that resulted in the dissolution and reintegration of Artsakh on 1 January 2024 and the [[Flight of Nagorno-Karabakh |flight of nearly all ethnic  from the region]]. 

On 8 August 2025,  President [[Ilham Aliyev]] and  Prime Minister [[Nikol Pashinyan]] signed a joint declaration at the [[White House]], committing to a [[– peace agreement|peace deal]] facilitated by the [[Second presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] that would end nearly four decades of conflict between the two countries.
