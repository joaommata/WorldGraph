===Pre-Columbian era===
Humans first settled  around 6,000 years ago, descending from migrations from northern South America or Central America. The arrival of humans on  is associated with extinctions of the islands native fauna, particularly its [[Megalocnidae|endemic sloths]]. The [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]]-speaking ancestors of the [[Taíno]] people arrived in the Caribbean in a separate migration from South America around 1,700 years ago. Unlike the previous settlers of , the Taíno extensively produced pottery and engaged in intensive agriculture. The earliest evidence of the Taíno people on  dates to the 9th century. Descendants of the first settlers of  persisted on the western part of the island until Columbian contact, where they were recorded as the [[Guanahatabey]] people, who lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

After first landing on an island then called [[Guanahani]] on 12 October 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on  on 27 October 1492 and on the island's northeastern coast on 28 October. Columbus claimed the island for the new [[Habsburg |Kingdom of ]] and named it ''Isla Juana'' ("John's Island") after [[John, Prince of Asturias]].

In 1511, the first [[ colonization of the Americas| settlement]] was founded by [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] at [[Baracoa]]. Other settlements soon followed, including [[Havana|San Cristobal de la Habana]], founded in 1514 (southern coast of the island) and then in 1519 (current place), which later became the capital (1607). The indigenous Taíno individuals were forced to work under the ''[[encomienda]]'' system, which resembled the [[Feudalism|feudal system]] in medieval Europe. Within a century, the [[indigenous people]] faced high incidence of mortality due to multiple factors—primarily [[Eurasia]]n [[infectious diseases]] to which they had no [[acquired immunity]], aggravated by the harsh conditions of the repressive colonial subjugation. In 1529, a [[measles]] outbreak killed two-thirds of those few indigenous individuals who had previously survived [[smallpox]].

On 18 May 1539, [[conquistador]] [[Hernando de Soto]] departed from Havana with some 600 followers on an extensive expedition through the [[Southeastern ]] in search of gold, treasure, fame, and power. On 1 September 1548, Gonzalo Perez de Angulo was appointed governor of . He arrived in [[Santiago, ]], on 4 November 1549, and immediately declared the liberty of the indigenous population.{{sfn|Wright|1916|p=183}} He became 's first permanent governor—residing in Havana instead of Santiago—and built the first church made of masonry in .{{sfn|Wright|1916|p=229}}{{efn|After the  captured Havana in 1555, the governor's son, Francisco de Angulo, went to the [[New |Viceroyalty of New ]].{{sfn|Wright|1916|p=246}}}}

By 1570, most residents of  had a mixture of , African, and Taíno heritages.  developed slowly and, unlike the plantation islands of the Caribbean, had a diversified agriculture. Most importantly, the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported the  colonial empire. By the mid-18th century, there were 50,000 slaves on the island. Estimates suggest that between 1790 and 1820, some 325,000 Africans were imported to  as slaves, which was four times the amount that had arrived between 1760 and 1790.

In 1812, the [[Aponte conspiracy|Aponte slave rebellion]] took place, but it was ultimately suppressed. The population of  in 1817 was 630,980 (of which 291,021 were white, 115,691 were [[free people of color]] (mixed-race), and 224,268 black slaves).{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=352}} The population in 1841 was 1,007,624, of whom 425,521 were black slaves, 418,291 were white.

In part due to  slaves working primarily in urbanized settings, by the 19th century, the practice of {{Lang|es|coartacion}} had developed (or "buying oneself out of slavery", a "uniquely  development"), according to historian [[Herbert S. Klein]]. Due to a shortage of white labor, blacks dominated urban industries "to such an extent that when whites in large numbers came to  in the middle of the nineteenth century, they were unable to displace Negro workers." A system of diversified agriculture, with small farms and fewer slaves, served to supply the cities with produce and other goods.

In the 1820s, when the rest of 's empire in Latin America [[Decolonization of the Americas|rebelled and formed independent states]],  remained loyal to . Its economy was based on serving the empire. By 1860,  had 213,167 free people of color (39% of its non-white population of 550,000).

===Independence movements===

In 1879–80,  patriot [[Calixto García]] attempted to start another war known as the [[Little War ()|Little War]] but failed to receive enough support.

His death immortalized him as 's national hero.

Around 200,000  troops outnumbered the much smaller rebel army, which relied mostly on [[Guerilla warfare|guerrilla]] and [[sabotage]] tactics. The Spaniards began a campaign of suppression. General [[Valeriano Weyler]], the military governor of , herded the rural population into what he called {{Lang|es|reconcentrados}}, described by international observers as "fortified towns". These are often considered the prototype for 20th-century [[Internment|concentration camps]]. Between 200,000 and 400,000  civilians died from starvation and disease in the  concentration camps, numbers verified by the [[Red Cross]] and  senator [[Redfield Proctor]], a former [[ Secretary of War|Secretary of War]].  and European protests against  conduct on the island followed.

The U.S. battleship [[USS Maine (1889)|USS ''Maine'']] was sent to protect  interests, but soon after its arrival, it exploded in the Havana harbor and sank quickly, killing nearly three-quarters of the crew. The cause and responsibility for the ship's sinking remained unclear after a board of inquiry. Popular opinion in the U.S., fueled by active [[yellow press]], concluded that the  were to blame and demanded action.  and the  declared war on each other in late April 1898.

===Republic (1902–1959)===
{{Main|Republican period ()}}

====First years (1902–1925)====
[[File:Raising the  flag on the Governor General's Palace at noon on May 20, 1902.gif|thumb|Raising the  flag on the Governor General's palace at noon on 20 May 1902.]]
After the [[– War]],  and the  signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)]], by which  relinquished sovereignty over  and ceded [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], and the [[]] to the  for the sum of {{Nowrap|US$20 million}} With the end of U.S. military government jurisdiction,  gained formal independence on 20 May 1902 as the Republic of . Under 's new constitution, the  retained the right to intervene in  affairs and to supervise its finances and foreign relations. Under the [[Platt Amendment]], the U.S. leased the [[Guantánamo Bay Naval Base]] from .

Following disputed elections in 1906, the first president, [[Tomás Estrada Palma]], faced an armed revolt by independence war veterans who defeated the meager government forces. The U.S. intervened by occupying  and named [[Charles Edward Magoon]] as governor for three years.  historians have characterized Magoon's governorship as introducing political and social corruption. In 1908, self-government was restored when [[José Miguel Gómez]] was elected president, but the U.S. continued intervening in  affairs. In 1912, the [[Partido Independiente de Color]] attempted to establish a separate [[Black separatism|black republic]] in [[Oriente Province]], but was suppressed by General Monteagudo with considerable bloodshed.

In 1924, [[Gerardo Machado]] was elected president. During his administration, tourism increased markedly, and -owned hotels and restaurants were built to accommodate the influx of tourists. The tourist boom led to increases in gambling and [[prostitution in ]]. The [[Wall Street crash of 1929]] led to a collapse in the price of sugar, political unrest, and repression. Protesting students, known as the Generation of 1930, turned to violence in opposition to the increasingly unpopular Machado. A general strike (in which the Communist Party sided with Machado), uprisings among sugar workers, and an army revolt forced Machado into exile in August 1933. He was replaced by [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada]].

====Revolution of 1933–1940====
{{Main| Revolution of 1933}}
[[File:1933-Pentarchy w Batista.jpg|thumb|The [[Pentarchy of 1933]]. [[Fulgencio Batista]], who controlled the armed forces, appears at far right]]
In September 1933, the [[Sergeants' Revolt]], led by Sergeant [[Fulgencio Batista]], overthrew Céspedes. A five-member executive committee (the [[Pentarchy of 1933]]) was chosen to head a provisional government. [[Ramón Grau San Martín]] was then appointed as provisional president. Grau resigned in 1934, leaving the way clear for Batista, who dominated  politics for the next 25 years, at first through a series of puppet-presidents. The period from 1933 to 1937 was a time of "virtually unremitting social and political warfare". On balance, during the period 1933–1940,  suffered from fragile political structures, reflected in the fact that it saw three different presidents in two years (1935–1936), and in the militaristic and repressive policies of Batista as head of the army.

==== Constitution of 1940 ====
{{Main|1940 Constitution of }}
A [[1940 Constitution of |new constitution]] was adopted in 1940 that engineered radically progressive ideas, including the right to labor and health care.{{sfn|Domínguez|1978|p={{page needed|date=December 2023}}}} Batista was elected president in the same year, holding the post until 1944. He is, as of 2004, the only non-white  to win the nation's highest political office. His government carried out major social reforms. Several members of the [[Communist Party of |Communist Party]] held office under his administration.{{sfn|Sweig|2004|p={{page needed|date=December 2023}}}}  armed forces were not greatly involved in combat during World War&nbsp;II—though president Batista did suggest a joint U.S.-Latin  assault on [[ State|Francoist ]] to overthrow its authoritarian regime.  lost six merchant ships during the war, and the  Navy was credited with sinking the {{GS|U-176}}.

Batista adhered to the 1940 constitution's strictures preventing his re-election. Ramon Grau San Martin was the winner of the next election, in 1944. Grau further corroded the base of the already teetering legitimacy of the  political system, particularly by undermining the deeply flawed—though not entirely ineffectual—Congress and Supreme Court. [[Carlos Prío Socarrás]], a protégé of Grau, became president in 1948. The two terms of the [[Auténtico Party]] brought an influx of investment, which fueled an economic boom, raised living standards for all segments of society, and created a middle class in most urban areas.

==== Batista regime ====
{{Main|1952  coup d'état| Revolution}}
[[File:HavanaSlums1954.jpg|thumb|right|[[Slum]] (''bohío'') dwellings in Havana,  in 1954, just outside [[Estadio Latinoamericano|Havana baseball stadium]]. In the background is advertising for a nearby [[casino]].]]
After finishing his term in 1944, Batista lived in Florida, returning to  to run for president in 1952. Facing inevitable electoral defeat, he led a [[1952  coup d'état|military coup]] that preempted the election. Back in power, and receiving financial, military, and logistical support from the  government, Batista suspended the 1940 constitution and revoked most political liberties, including the [[Strike action|right to strike]]. He then aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantations]], and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor Cubans. Batista outlawed the  Communist Party in 1952. After the coup,  had Latin America's highest per capita consumption rates of meat, vegetables, cereals, automobiles, telephones and radios, though about one-third of the population was considered poor and enjoyed relatively little of this consumption. However, in his "[[History Will Absolve Me]]" speech, Fidel Castro mentioned that national issues relating to land, industrialization, housing, unemployment, education, and health were contemporary problems.

In 1958,  was a well-advanced country compared to other Latin  regions.  was also affected by perhaps Latin America's largest labor union privileges, including bans on dismissals and mechanization. They were obtained in large measure "at the cost of the unemployed and the peasants", leading to disparities. Between 1933 and 1958,  extended economic regulations enormously, causing economic problems. Unemployment became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs. The middle class, which was comparable to that of the {{How|date=February 2022}}, became increasingly dissatisfied with unemployment and political persecution. The labor unions, manipulated by the previous government since 1948 through union "yellowness", supported Batista until the very end. Batista stayed in power until he resigned in December 1958 under the pressure of the US Embassy and as the revolutionary forces headed by Fidel Castro were winning militarily (Santa Clara city, a strategic point in the middle of the country, fell into the rebels hands on 31 December, in a conflict known as the [[Battle of Santa Clara]]).

In the 1950s, various organizations, including some advocating armed uprising, competed for public support in bringing about political change. In 1956, [[Fidel Castro]] and about 80 supporters landed from the yacht [[Granma (yacht)|''Granma'']] in an attempt to start a rebellion against the Batista government. In 1958, Castro's [[July 26th Movement]] emerged as the leading revolutionary group. The U.S. supported Castro by imposing a 1958 [[ embargo against |arms embargo]] against Batista's government. Batista evaded the  embargo and acquired weapons from the .

By late 1958, the rebels had broken out of the [[Sierra Maestra]] and launched a general [[ Revolution|popular insurrection]]. After Castro's fighters captured [[Santa Clara, |Santa Clara]], Batista fled to the  on 1 January 1959 with his family. Later, he went into exile on the  island of Madeira and finally settled in Estoril, near Lisbon. Fidel Castro's forces entered the capital on 8 January 1959. The liberal [[Manuel Urrutia Lleó]] became the provisional president.{{sfn|Falk|1988|p=67}}

Before the revolution, U.S. and other foreign investors dominated the  economy, controlling 75% of arable land, 90% of essential services, and 40% of sugar production. One of the goals of Castro's revolution was to achieve economic independence, but  instead became heavily dependent on Soviet subsidies, with additional economic aid provided by Eastern European countries through [[COMECON]].

Militant anti-Castro groups, funded by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and [[Rafael Trujillo]], carried out armed attacks and set up guerrilla bases in 's mountainous regions. This led to the unsuccessful [[Escambray rebellion]] (1959–65), which lasted longer and involved more soldiers than the  Revolution.

===Revolutionary government (1959–present)===
====Consolidation and nationalization (1959–1970)====
{{Main|Consolidation of the  Revolution|Revolutionary Offensive}}
[[File:CheyFidel.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Che Guevara]] and [[Fidel Castro]], photographed by [[Alberto Korda]] in 1961]]
The  government initially reacted favorably to the  Revolution, seeing it as part of a movement to bring democracy to Latin America. Castro's legalization of the Communist Party and the hundreds of executions of Batista agents, policemen, and soldiers that followed caused a deterioration in the relationship between the two countries. The promulgation of the [[Agrarian reforms in |Agrarian Reform Law]], expropriating thousands of acres of farmland (including from large U.S. landholders), further worsened relations. In response, between 1960 and 1964 the U.S. imposed a range of sanctions, eventually including a total ban on trade between the countries and a freeze on all -owned assets in the U.S. In February 1960, Castro signed a commercial agreement with Soviet Vice-Premier [[Anastas Mikoyan]].
[[File:Brigadistas capturados na Baía dos Porcos 1961.jpg|thumb|Brigade 2506 prisoners, 1961]]
In March 1960, U.S. president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] gave his approval to a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] plan to arm and train a group of  refugees to overthrow the Castro government. The CIA provided B-26 light bombers and ships to the rebels for the invasion. On 15 April 1961 at dawn, [[Brigade 2506]] flew from Puerto Cabezas, , and carried out preemptive airstrikes on  military airfields at San Antonio de Los Baños, Ciudad Libertad, Pinar del Río, and Santiago de , destroying five aircraft and damaging an indeterminable number.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=247}} The invasion (known as the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]]) took place on 17 April 1961, during the term of President [[John F. Kennedy]]. About 1,400  exiles disembarked at the [[Bay of Pigs]].  troops and local militias defeated the invasion by 19 April, killing over 100 invaders and taking the remainder prisoner. Five rebel B-26s were shot down by the  air force, and one was downed by anti-aircraft fire.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=250}} In January 1962,  was suspended from the [[Organization of  States]] (OAS), and later the same year the OAS started to impose sanctions against  of similar nature to the U.S. sanctions. The failed amphibious assault on  contributed to the Soviet decision to deploy [[R-12 Dvina|R-12]] missiles there,{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=253}} and the ensuing [[ Missile Crisis]] of October 1962 almost sparked [[World War III# Missile Crisis: 15–29 October 1962|World War III]]. In 1962,  generals proposed [[Operation Northwoods]] which would entail committing terrorist attacks in  cities and against refugees and falsely blaming the attacks on the  government, manufacturing a reason for the  to invade . This plan was rejected by President Kennedy. By 1963,  was moving towards a full-fledged [[communist state]] system modeled on the USSR.
[[File:Guantanamo Naval Base aerial photo 1962.jpg|thumb|Since 1959,  has regarded the U.S. presence in [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantánamo Bay]] as illegal.]]
[[Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo]] founded the anti-Castro group [[Alpha 66]] in the early 1960s, which used small craft to attack  and Soviet merchant ships, killing or wounding crew members. In 1964, Menoyo set up a guerrilla training camp in the , and after entering  in 1965, he was captured; however, Alpha 66 continued its raids under new leadership.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=251}} By the mid-1960s, Soviet aid had strengthened the  air force and navy, making raids against the island by  dissidents costly without significant U.S. support.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=254}}

In 1963,  sent 686 troops together with 22 tanks and other military equipment to support  in the [[Sand War]] against . The  forces remained in  for over a year, providing training to the  army. [[Che Guevara]], authorized by Fidel Castro, engaged in [[Simba rebellion|guerrilla activities in Africa]] and was killed in 1967 while attempting to start a [[Ñancahuazú Guerrilla|revolution in ]]. By the middle of 1965,  had begun supplying arms to the [[People's Movement for the Liberation of ]] (MPLA). In 1966,  aid also reached the [[African Party for the Independence of  and ]]. Furthermore, by the late 1960s,  instructors were providing military training to members of the [[ Liberation Front]].  troops prevented the [[1966  coup attempt]]. The coup collapsed when the  army refused to engage in combat against the Cubans. In February 1967,  advisors began operating with guerrillas in the [[-Bissau War of Independence]], and in November 1969, the  captured  Captain Pedro Rodriguez Peralta.

Starting in 1968, a campaign titled the "revolutionary offensive" was initiated to nationalize all remaining private small businesses, totaling about 58,000 small enterprises. The campaign would spur industrialization in  and focus the economy on sugar production, specifically to a deadline for an annual sugar harvest of 10 million tons by 1970. The economic focus on sugar production involved international volunteers and the mobilization of workers from all sectors of the  economy. Economic mobilization also coincided with greater militarization of  political structures and society in general. The ten million ton harvest goal was not reached.{{Rp|pages=37–38}} The  economy fell into decline after large sectors of the economy were neglected when large amounts of urban labor mobilized to the countryside.{{Rp|page=38}}

The standard of living in the 1970s was "extremely spartan," and discontent was rife. Fidel Castro admitted the failures of economic policies in a 1970 speech. In 1975, the OAS lifted its sanctions against , with the approval of 16 member states, including the . The U.S., however, maintained its own sanctions.

According to [[Amnesty International]], official death sentences from 1959 to 1987 numbered 237, of which all but 21 were carried out. The vast majority of those executed directly following the 1959 Revolution were policemen, politicians, and informers of the Batista regime accused of crimes such as torture and murder, and their public trials and executions had widespread popular support among the  population.

====Foreign interventions (1971–1991)====
{{Main|Foreign interventions by }}
[[File:Cubans in Ogaden1.JPG|thumb| artillery crew in [[]] during the [[Ogaden War]].]]
During the Cold War,  received $33 billion in Soviet aid, and  forces were deployed to all corners of Africa, either as military advisors or as combatants. Soviet pilots and technicians assumed defense duties in , freeing up  personnel to be deployed in Africa. In 1979, the U.S. objected to the presence of [[Soviet Army|Soviet combat troops]] on the island.

In November 1975,  deployed more than 65,000 troops and 400 Soviet-made tanks in  in one of the fastest military mobilizations in history.  developed nuclear weapons due to the threat to its security posed by the presence of large numbers of [[ intervention in | troops in ]]. In 1975–76 and again in 1988 at the [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]], the Cubans alongside their MPLA allies fought [[UNITA]] rebels and [[apartheid]]  forces. In December 1977,  sent its combat troops from , the People's , and the Caribbean to , assisted by mechanized Soviet battalions, to help defeat a  invasion. On 24 January 1978,  and  troops counterattacked, inflicting 3,000 casualties on the  forces. In February,  troops launched a major offensive and forced the  army back into its own territory.  forces remained in  until September 1989.

Despite 's small size and the long distance separating it from the Middle East, Castro's  played an active role in the region during the Cold War. In 1972, a major  military mission consisting of tank, air, and artillery specialists was dispatched to [[South ]].  military advisors were sent to [[]] in the mid-1970s, but their mission was canceled after  invaded  in 1980. The Cubans were also involved in the - conflict (November 1973–May 1974) that followed the [[Yom Kippur War]] (October 1973).  sources reported the presence of a  tank brigade in the [[Golan Heights]], which was supported by two brigades. The Israelis and the - tank forces engaged in battle on the Golan front.{{rp|37–38}}

After the U.S. was defeated in the [[ War]], Castro began supporting Marxist insurgencies in [[ Civil War|]], [[ Civil War|]], [[ Revolution|]], and [[ conflict|]] by supplying weapons, munitions, and training.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=339}} Following the 1983 coup that resulted in the execution of  Prime Minister [[Maurice Bishop]] and establishment of the military government led by [[Hudson Austin]], [[ invasion of |U.S. forces invaded]]  in 1983, overthrowing the pro-Castro government. In a few days of fighting, 6,000  combat troops defeated 784 Cubans (636 construction workers with military training, 43 military advisors, and 18 diplomats).{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=358}}

 gradually withdrew its troops from  in 1989–91. An important psychological and political aspect of the  military involvement in Africa was the significant presence of black or mixed-race soldiers among the  forces. According to one source, more than 300,000  military personnel and civilian experts were deployed in Africa. The source also states that out of the 50,000 Cubans sent to , half contracted AIDS, and that 10,000 Cubans died as a consequence of their military actions in Africa.

====Political readjustments (1991–present)====
{{Main|Special Period|2006–2008  transfer of presidential duties}}
Soviet troops began to withdraw from  in September 1991, and Castro's rule was severely tested in the aftermath of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet collapse in December 1991]] (known in  as the [[Special Period]]). The country faced a severe economic downturn following the withdrawal of Soviet subsidies worth {{Nowrap|$4 billion}} to {{Nowrap|$6 billion}} annually, resulting in effects such as food and fuel shortages. The government did not accept  donations of food, medicines and cash until 1993. On 5 August 1994, state security dispersed protesters in a [[Maleconazo|spontaneous protest]] in Havana. From the start of the crisis until 1995,  saw its gross domestic product (GDP) shrink by 35%. It took another five years for its GDP to reach pre-crisis levels.{{sfn|Gershman|Gutierrez|2009|p={{page needed|date=December 2023}}}} In 1996, after  fighter jets [[1996 shootdown of Brothers to the Rescue aircraft|shot down]] two small aircraft piloted by a Florida-based anti-Castro group, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Helms–Burton Act]].
