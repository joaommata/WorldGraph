===Early history===
[[File:Shumom-text.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bamum script]] is a writing system developed by King Njoya in the late 19th century.]]
Evidence from [[archaeological excavation]]s at [[Shum Laka]] in the [[Northwest Region ()|Northwest Region]] shows human occupation in  dating back 30,000 years. The longest continuous inhabitants are groups such as the [[Baka people ( and )|Baka]] ([[Pygmy peoples|Pygmies]]). From there, [[Bantu expansion|Bantu migrations]] into eastern, southern and central Africa are believed to have occurred about 2,000 years ago. The [[Sao civilisation|Sao]] culture arose around Lake , {{circa|500 CE}}, and gave way to the Kanem and its successor state, the [[Kanem–Bornu Empire|Bornu Empire]]. Kingdoms, [[Fon (title)|fondoms]], and [[chiefdom]]s arose in the west.

[[ discoveries| sailors]] reached the coast in 1472. They noted an abundance of the ghost shrimp ''[[Lepidophthalmus turneranus]]'' in the [[Wouri River]] and named it {{lang|pt|Rio dos Camarões}} (''Shrimp River''), which became '''' in . Over the following few centuries, European interests regularised trade with the coastal peoples, and Christian [[missionaries]] pushed inland.

In 1896, Sultan [[Ibrahim Njoya]] created the [[Bamum script]], or Shu Mom, for the [[Bamum language]]. It is taught in  by the [[Bamum Scripts and Archives Project]].

 began to establish roots in  in 1868 when the Woermann Company of Hamburg built a warehouse. It was built on the estuary of the Wouri River. Later, [[Gustav Nachtigal]] made a treaty with one of the local kings to annex the region for the  emperor. The [[ Empire]] claimed the territory as the colony of [[Kamerun]] in 1884 and began a steady push inland; the natives resisted in the [[Bafut Wars]] and [[Adamawa Wars]]. Under the aegis of , commercial companies were local administrations. These [[Concession (contract)|concession]]s used [[Unfree labour|forced labour]] to run profitable banana, rubber, palm oil, and cocoa plantations. Even infrastructure projects relied on a regimen of forced labour. This economic policy was much criticised by the other colonial powers.

[[File:UPC-LEADERS.jpg|thumb|right|Leaders of the pro-independence [[Union of the Peoples of |UPC]]]]
With the defeat of  in [[World War I]], Kamerun became a [[League of Nations mandate]] territory and was split into [[ ]] ({{langx|fr|Cameroun}}) and [[British ]] in 1919.  integrated the economy of  with that of  and improved the infrastructure with capital investments and skilled workers, modifying the colonial system of [[forced labour]]. Britain offered  owned plantations to the highest bidder with the intent of paying the proceeds into a [[World War I reparations]] account. But few investors were willing to buy at the London auctions. Eventually Britain sold the majority of  plantations in British  back to their original  owners and opened up African maritime ports for  trade. The British also encouraged  investment in the [[Tanganyika Territory]].  companies built warehouses in [[Douala]] but were not allowed to purchase land.

The British administered their territory from neighbouring . Natives complained that this made them a neglected "colony of a colony".  migrant workers flocked to Southern Cameroons, ending forced labour altogether but angering the local natives, who felt swamped. The League of Nations mandates were converted into [[United Nations Trusteeship Council|United Nations Trusteeships]] in 1946, and the question of independence became a pressing issue in  .

 outlawed the pro-independence political party, the [[Union of the Peoples of ]] ({{langx|fr|Union des Populations du Cameroun}}, UPC), on 13 July 1955. This prompted a [[Bamileke War|long guerrilla war]] waged by the UPC and the assassination of several of the party's leaders, including [[Ruben Um Nyobè]], [[Félix-Roland Moumié]] and [[Ernest Ouandie]]. In the British Cameroons, the question was whether to reunify with   or join ; the British ruled out the option of independence.

===Independence===
On 1 January 1960,  Cameroun gained independence from  under President [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]] as the Republic of .{{Citation needed|date=August 2025}}

On 1 October 1961, the formerly British [[Southern Cameroons]] gained independence from the  by vote of the UN General Assembly and merged into the Republic of  to form the Federal Republic of . The federal republic was composed of two federated states, [[East ]] and [[West ]], each with its own legislature, government, and prime minister. 1 October is now observed as [[Unification Day ()|Unification Day]], a [[Public holidays in |public holiday]]. Ahidjo used the ongoing war with the UPC to concentrate power in the presidency, continuing with this even after the suppression of the UPC in 1971.

====United Republic of  and Republic of ====
[[File:Ahmadou Ahidjo.jpg|thumb|Former president [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]] ruled from 1960 until 1982.]]
Ahidjo's political party, the [[ National Union| National Union]] (CNU), became the sole legal political party on 1 September 1966, and on 20 May 1972, a [[1972  constitutional referendum|referendum]] was passed to abolish the [[Federation|federal system of government]] in favour of a United Republic of , headed from [[Yaoundé]]. This day is now the country's [[National Day ()|National Day]], a public holiday. Ahidjo pursued an economic policy of [[planned liberalism]], prioritising [[cash crops]] and petroleum development. The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects; however, many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them. The [[Flag of |national flag]] was changed on 20 May 1975 with the two stars removed and replaced with a large central star as a symbol of national unity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2025}}

Ahidjo stepped down on 4 November 1982 and left power to his constitutional successor, [[Paul Biya]]. However, Ahidjo remained in control of the CNU and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning. Biya began his administration by moving toward a more democratic government, but a failed [[ Palace Guard Revolt|coup d'état]] nudged him toward the leadership style of his predecessor.

In 1987, [[Dja Faunal Reserve]], 's first [[World Heritage Site]], was inscribed on the list by [[UNESCO]]. An [[ economic crisis|economic crisis]] took effect in the mid-1980s to late 1990s as a result of international economic conditions, drought, falling petroleum prices, and years of corruption, mismanagement, and [[cronyism]].  turned to foreign aid, cut government spending, and [[Privatization|privatised]] industries. With the reintroduction of multi-party politics in December 1990, the former British Southern Cameroons pressure groups called for greater autonomy, and the [[Southern Cameroons National Council]] advocated complete secession as the Republic of [[Ambazonia]]. The 1992 Labour Code of  gives workers the freedom to belong to a trade union or not to belong to any trade union at all. It is the choice of a worker to join any trade union in their occupation since there is more than one trade union in each occupation.

In June 2006, talks concerning a territorial dispute over the [[Bakassi]] peninsula were resolved. The talks involved President Paul Biya of , then President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] of , and then UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], and resulted in  control of the oil-rich peninsula. The northern portion of the territory was formally handed over to the  government in August 2006, and the remainder of the peninsula was left to  two years later, in 2008. The boundary change triggered a [[Bakassi conflict|local separatist insurgency]], as many Bakassians refused to accept  rule. While most militants laid down their arms in November 2009, some carried on fighting for years.

In February 2008,  experienced its worst violence in 15 years when a transport union strike in Douala escalated into [[2008  anti-government protests|violent protests]] in 31 municipal areas.

In May 2014, in the wake of the [[Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping]], presidents Paul Biya of  and [[Idriss Déby]] of  announced they were waging war on [[Boko Haram]], and deployed troops to the  border. Boko Haram launched several attacks into , killing 84 civilians in a [[December 2014  clashes|December 2014 raid]], but suffering a heavy defeat in a [[January 2015 raid on Kolofata|raid in January 2015]].  declared victory over Boko Haram on  territory in September 2018.

Since November 2016, [[2016–17  protests|protesters]] from the predominantly -speaking [[Northwest Region ()|Northwest]] and [[Southwest Region ()|Southwest]] regions of the country have been campaigning for continued use of the  language in schools and courts. People were killed and hundreds were jailed as a result of these protests. In 2017, Biya's government blocked the regions' access to the Internet for three months. In September, separatists started [[Anglophone Crisis|a guerilla war]] for the independence of the Anglophone region as the Federal Republic of [[Ambazonia]]. The government responded with a military offensive, and the insurgency spread across the Northwest and Southwest regions. {{As of|2019}}, fighting between separatist guerillas and government forces continues. During 2020, numerous terrorist attacks—many of them carried out without claims of credit—and government reprisals have led to bloodshed throughout the country. Since 2016, more than 450,000 people have fled their homes. The conflict indirectly led to an [[ Basin campaign (2018–2019)|upsurge]] in Boko Haram attacks, as the  military largely withdrew from the north to focus on fighting the Ambazonian separatists.

More than 30,000 people in northern  fled to  after ethnic clashes over [[Water conflict|access to water]] between [[Musgum people|Musgum]] fishermen and ethnic [[ Arabic|Arab Choa]] herders in December 2021. In the aftermath of the [[2025  presidential election]], a [[2025  protests|series of protests]] broke out after allegations of electoral fraud were made by the opposition.
