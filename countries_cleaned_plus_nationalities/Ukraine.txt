Evidence for the earliest securely dated hominin presence in Europe comes from 1.4 million-year-old stone tools from [[Korolevo]], in western . Settlement by [[modern humans]] in  and its vicinity dates back to 32,000 BC, with evidence of the [[Gravettian culture]] in the [[Crimean Mountains]]. By 4,500 BC, the [[Neolithic]] [[Cucuteni–Trypillia culture]] was flourishing in wide areas of modern , including [[Trypillia]] and the entire [[Dnieper]]-[[Dniester]] region.  is a probable location for the first [[domestication of the horse]]. The [[Kurgan hypothesis]] places the Volga-Dnieper region of  and southern  as the [[linguistic homeland]] of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. Early [[Indo-European migrations]] from the Pontic steppes in the 3rd millennium BC spread [[Yamnaya culture|Yamnaya]] [[Western Steppe Herders|Steppe pastoralist]] ancestry and [[Indo-European languages]] across large parts of Europe. During the [[Iron Age]], the land was inhabited by [[Eastern  languages|]]-speaking [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], and [[Sarmatians]]. Between 700&nbsp;BC and 200&nbsp;BC it was part of the [[Scythia]]n kingdom.

From the 6th&nbsp;century BC, [[Ancient |]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] colonies were established on the north-eastern shore of the [[Black Sea]], such as at [[Tyras]], [[Olbia, |Olbia]], and [[Chersonesus]]. These thrived into the 6th&nbsp;century AD. The [[Goths]] stayed in the area, but came under the sway of the [[Huns]] from the 370s. In the 7th&nbsp;century, the territory that is now eastern  was the centre of [[Old Great ]]. At the end of the century, the majority of Bulgar tribes migrated in different directions, and the [[Khazars]] took over much of the land.

In the 5th and 6th centuries, the [[Antes (people)|Antes]], which some relate as an [[early Slavs|early Slavic]] people, lived in . Migrations from the territories of present-day  throughout the [[Balkans]] established many [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] nations. Northern migrations, reaching almost to [[Lake Ilmen]], led to the emergence of the [[Ilmen Slavs]] and [[Krivichs]]. Following an [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] raid in 602 and the collapse of the Antes Union, most of these peoples survived as separate tribes until the beginning of the second millennium.

[[File:Principalities of Kievan Rus' (1054-1132).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The furthest extent of [[Kievan Rus']], 1054–1132]]

The establishment of the state of [[Kievan Rus']] remains obscure and uncertain. The state included much of present-day ,  and the western part of [[European ]]. According to the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', the [[Rus' people]] initially consisted of [[Varangian]]s from [[Scandinavia]]. In 882, the pagan [[Oleg of Novgorod|Prince Oleg]] (Oleh) conquered [[Kyiv]]<!--See [[Talk:Kiev/naming]] re Kiev/Kyiv. --> from [[Askold and Dir]] and proclaimed it as the new capital of the Rus'. [[Anti-Normanism|Anti-Normanist]] historians however argue that the East Slavic tribes along the southern parts of the [[Dnieper River]] were already in the process of forming a state independently. The Varangian elite, including the ruling [[Rurik dynasty]], later assimilated into the Slavic population. Kievan Rus' was composed of several [[principality|principalities]] ruled by the interrelated Rurikid ''[[knyaz|kniazes]]'' ("princes"), who often fought each other for possession of Kyiv.

During the 10th and 11th&nbsp;centuries, Kievan Rus' became the largest and most powerful state in Europe, a period known as its Golden Age. It began with the reign of [[Vladimir the Great]] (980–1015), who [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|introduced Christianity]]. During the reign of his son, [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–1054), Kievan Rus' reached the zenith of its cultural development and military power. The state soon fragmented as the relative importance of regional powers rose again. After a final resurgence under the rule of [[Vladimir II Monomakh]] (1113–1125) and his son [[Mstislav I of Kiev|Mstislav]] (1125–1132), Kievan Rus' finally disintegrated into separate principalities following Mstislav's death, though ownership of Kyiv would still carry great prestige for decades. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the nomadic confederacy of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking [[Cumans]] and [[Kipchaks]] was the dominant force in the [[Pontic steppe]] north of the Black Sea.

The [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasions]] in the mid-13th century devastated Kievan Rus'; following the [[Siege of Kyiv (1240)|Siege of Kyiv in 1240]], the city was destroyed by the Mongols. In the western territories, the principalities of [[Principality of Halych|Halych]] and [[Principality of Volhynia|Volhynia]] had arisen earlier, and were merged to form the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia|Principality of Galicia–Volhynia]]. [[Daniel of Galicia]], son of [[Roman the Great]], re-united much of south-western Rus', including [[Volhynia]], [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], as well as Kyiv. He was subsequently crowned by a [[Pope|papal]] envoy as the first [[King of Ruthenia|king of Galicia–Volhynia]] (also known as the Kingdom of [[Ruthenia]]) in 1253.

In 1349, in the aftermath of the [[Galicia–Volhynia Wars]], the region was partitioned between the [[Kingdom of ]] and the [[Grand Duchy of ]]. From the mid-13th century to the late 1400s, the [[Republic of Genoa]] founded numerous [[colonies]] on the northern coast of the Black Sea and transformed these into large commercial centres headed by the consul, a representative of the Republic. In 1430, the region of [[Podolia]] was incorporated into , and the lands of modern-day  became increasingly settled by [[ people|Poles]]. In 1441, [[Genghisid]] prince [[Haci I Giray]] founded the [[Crimean Khanate]] on the [[Crimean Peninsula]] and the surrounding steppes; the Khanate orchestrated [[Tatars|Tatar]] [[Crimean–Nogai slave raids in Eastern Europe|slave raids]]. Over the next three centuries, the [[Crimean slave trade]] would enslave an estimated two million in the region.

In 1569, the [[Union of Lublin]] established the [[– Commonwealth]], and most of the  lands were transferred from  to the [[Crown of the Kingdom of ]], becoming ''[[de jure]]''  territory. Under the pressures of [[Polonisation]], many landed gentry of Ruthenia converted to [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]] and joined the circles of the [[ nobility]]; others joined the newly created [[Ruthenian Uniate Church]].

=== Cossack Hetmanate ===
{{main|Cossack Hetmanate|Zaporozhian Sich}}

Deprived of native protectors among the Ruthenian nobility, the peasants and townspeople began turning for protection to the emerging [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]]. In the mid-17th&nbsp;century, a Cossack military quasi-state, the [[Zaporozhian Host]], was formed by [[Dnieper Cossacks]] and Ruthenian peasants.  exercised little real control over this population, but found the Cossacks to be useful against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] and Tatars, and at times the two were allies in [[Ottoman wars in Europe|military campaigns]]. However, the continued harsh [[serf|enserfment]] of Ruthenian peasantry by  [[szlachta]] (many of whom were Polonised [[Ruthenian nobility|Ruthenian nobles]]) and the suppression of the Orthodox Church alienated the Cossacks. The latter did not shy from taking up arms against those they perceived as enemies and occupiers, including the Catholic Church with its local representatives.

[[File:Hondius Bohdan Khmelnytsky.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Hetmans of  Cossacks|Hetman]] [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] established an independent [[Cossack Hetmanate|Cossack state]] after the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|1648 uprising]] against ]]
In 1648, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] led the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|largest of the Cossack uprisings]] against the Commonwealth and the [[List of  monarchs| king]], which enjoyed wide support from the local population. Khmelnytsky founded the [[Cossack Hetmanate]], which existed until 1764 (some sources claim until 1782). After Khmelnytsky suffered a crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Berestechko]] in 1651, he turned to the [[List of  monarchs| tsar]] for help. In 1654, Khmelnytsky was subject to the [[Pereiaslav Agreement]], forming a military and political alliance with  that acknowledged loyalty to the  monarch.

After his death, the Hetmanate went through a devastating 30-year war amongst , , the Crimean Khanate, the Ottoman Empire, and [[Cossacks]], known as "[[The Ruin ( history)|The Ruin]]" (1657–1686), for control of the Cossack Hetmanate. The [[Treaty of Perpetual Peace (1686)|Treaty of Perpetual Peace]] between  and  in 1686 divided the lands of the Cossack Hetmanate between them, reducing the portion over which  had claimed sovereignty to  west of the Dnieper river. In 1686, the [[Metropolitanate of Kyiv]] was [[Annexation of the Metropolitanate of Kyiv by the Moscow Patriarchate|annexed by the Moscow Patriarchate]] through a synodal letter of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Dionysius IV of Constantinople|Dionysius IV]], thus placing the [[Metropolitanate of Kyiv#Orthodox Church of |Metropolitanate of Kyiv]] under the authority of [[Moscow]]. An attempt to reverse the decline was undertaken by Cossack Hetman [[Ivan Mazepa]] (1639–1709), who ultimately defected to the [[|Swedes]] in the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721) in a bid to get rid of  dependence, but Hetmanate's capital city [[Baturyn]] was [[Sack of Baturyn|sacked]] (1708) and they were crushed in the [[Battle of Poltava]] (1709).

The Hetmanate's autonomy was severely restricted since Poltava. In the years 1764–1781, [[Catherine the Great]] incorporated much of [[Central ]] into the [[ Empire]], abolishing the Cossack Hetmanate and the [[Zaporozhian Sich]], and was one of the people responsible for the suppression of the last major Cossack uprising, the [[Koliivshchyna]]. After the [[annexation of Crimea by the  Empire|annexation of Crimea by ]] in 1783, the newly acquired lands, now called [[Novorossiya]], were opened up to settlement by Russians. The [[tsarist autocracy]] established a policy of [[Russification]], suppressing the use of the [[ language]] and curtailing the  national identity. The western part of present-day  was subsequently split between  and [[Habsburg]]-ruled [[ Empire|]] after the [[Partitions of |fall]] of the – Commonwealth in 1795.

The 19th century saw the rise of  nationalism. With growing urbanisation and modernisation and a cultural trend toward [[romantic nationalism]], a  [[intelligentsia]] committed to national rebirth and social justice emerged. The serf-turned-national-poet [[Taras Shevchenko]] (1814–1861) and political theorist [[Mykhailo Drahomanov]] (1841–1895) led the growing nationalist movement. While conditions for its development in  [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]] under the [[Habsburgs]] were relatively lenient, the  part (historically known as "[[Little ]]" or "South ") faced severe restrictions, going as far as [[Ems Ukaz|banning virtually all books from being published in ]] in 1876.

, like the rest of the  Empire, joined the [[Industrial Revolution]] [[Industrialization in the  Empire|later]] than most of Western Europe{{failed verification|date=December 2022}} due to the maintenance of [[Serfdom in |serfdom]] until 1861.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} Other than near the newly discovered coal fields of the [[Donbas]], and in some larger cities such as [[Odesa]] and Kyiv,  largely remained an agricultural and resource extraction economy. The  part of  [[Poverty in  Galicia|was particularly destitute]], which forced hundreds of thousands of peasants into emigration, who created the backbone of an extensive [[ diaspora]] in countries such as [[ Canadians|]], the [[ Americans|]] and [[ Brazilians|]]. Some of the Ukrainians settled in the Far East, too. According to the [[1897 census]], there were 223,000 ethnic Ukrainians in [[Siberia]] and 102,000 in [[Central Asia]]. An additional 1.6 million emigrated to the east in the ten years after the opening of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] in 1906. [[ Far East|Far Eastern]] areas with an ethnic  population became known as [[Green ]].

 plunged into turmoil with the beginning of [[World War I]], and fighting on  soil persisted until late 1921. Initially, the Ukrainians were split between -, fighting for the [[Central Powers]], though the vast majority served in the [[Military history of Imperial |Imperial  Army]], which was part of the [[Triple Entente]], under . As the  Empire collapsed, the conflict evolved into the [[ War of Independence]], with Ukrainians fighting alongside, or against, the [[Red Army|Red]], [[White Army|White]], [[Makhnovshchina|Black]] and [[Green armies]], with the Poles, Hungarians (in [[Transcarpathian Rus'|Transcarpathia]]), and Germans also intervening at various times.

An attempt to create an independent state, the left-leaning [[ People's Republic]] (UNR), was first announced by [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], but the period was plagued by an extremely unstable political and military environment. It was first deposed in a [[coup d'état]] led by [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]], which yielded the [[ State]] under the  protectorate, and the attempt to restore the UNR under the [[Directorate of |Directorate]] ultimately failed as the  army was regularly overrun by other forces. The short-lived [[West  People's Republic]] and [[Hutsul Republic]] also failed to join the rest of .

The result of the conflict was a partial victory for the [[Second  Republic]], which annexed the Western  provinces, as well as a larger-scale victory for the pro-Soviet forces, which succeeded in dislodging the remaining factions and eventually established the [[ Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Soviet ). Meanwhile, modern-day [[Bukovina]] was occupied by [[Kingdom of |]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] was admitted to [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] as an autonomous region.

The conflict over , a part of the broader [[ Civil War]], devastated the whole of the former  Empire, including eastern and central . The fighting left over 1.5 million people dead and hundreds of thousands homeless in the former  Empire's territory. [[ famine of 1921–1922|Famine in 1921]] further hit the eastern provinces.

=== Inter-war period ===
{{See also|Holodomor}}
[[File:GolodomorKharkiv.jpg|thumb|right|Starved peasants on a street in [[Kharkiv]], 1933. [[Collectivisation]] of crops and their confiscation by Soviet authorities led to a major famine in Soviet  known as the [[Holodomor]]]]
[[File:Les Kurbas Portrait.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Les Kurbas]], one of the lead figures of the [[Executed Renaissance]], was executed by the Soviet authorities, as many other  intellectuals]]

<!-- 1922–1939 -->During the inter-war period, in , Marshal [[Józef Piłsudski]] sought  support by offering local autonomy as a way to minimise Soviet influence in 's eastern [[Kresy]] region. However, this approach was abandoned after Piłsudski's death in 1935, due to continued unrest among the  population, including assassinations of  government officials by the [[Organisation of  Nationalists]] (OUN); with the  government responding by restricting rights of people who declared  nationality. In consequence, the underground [[ nationalism| nationalist]] and militant movement, which arose in the 1920s gained wider support.

Meanwhile, the recently constituted Soviet  became one of the founding republics of the [[Soviet Union]]. During the 1920s, under the Ukrainisation policy pursued by the national Communist leadership of [[Mykola Skrypnyk]], Soviet leadership at first encouraged a national renaissance in [[Culture of | culture]] and language. [[Ukrainisation]] was part of the Soviet-wide policy of [[Korenisation]] (literally ''indigenisation''), which was intended to promote the advancement of native peoples, their language and culture into the governance of their respective republics.

Around the same time, Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] instituted the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), which introduced a form of [[market socialism]], allowing some private ownership of small and medium-sized productive enterprises, hoping to reconstruct the post-war Soviet Union that had been devastated by both WWI and later the civil war. The NEP was successful at restoring the formerly war-torn nation to pre-WWI levels of production and agricultural output by the mid-1920s, much of the latter based in . These policies attracted many prominent former UNR figures, including former UNR leader Hrushevsky, to return to Soviet , where they were accepted, and participated in the advancement of  science and culture. In July 1922, arrests and [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportations]] of  intellectuals (e.g. university professors) began in Soviet  and continued throughout the 1920s.

This period was cut short when [[Joseph Stalin]] became the leader of the USSR following Lenin's death. Stalin did away with the NEP in what became known as the [[Great Break (USSR)|Great Break]]. Starting from the late 1920s and now with a [[planned economy|centrally planned economy]], Soviet  took part in an [[Industrialization in the USSR|industrialisation scheme]] which quadrupled its industrial output during the 1930s.

Nevertheless, Stalin sought to prevent the Ukrainians aspirations for the independence of  and took severe measures to eliminate  peasantry and elite  intellectuals and culturists. As a consequence of Stalin's new policy, the  peasantry suffered from the [[Collectivization in the USSR|programme of collectivisation]] of agricultural crops. Collectivisation was part of the [[First five-year plan (Soviet Union)|first five-year plan]] and was enforced by regular troops and the secret police known as [[Cheka]]. Those who resisted were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|arrested and deported]] to [[gulag]]s and work camps. As members of the collective farms were sometimes not allowed to receive any grain until unrealistic quotas were met, millions starved to death in a [[Droughts and famines in  and the Soviet Union|famine]] known as the [[Holodomor]] or the "Great Famine", which was recognised by some countries as an act of [[genocide]] perpetrated by Joseph Stalin and other Soviet notables.

Following on the  Civil War and collectivisation, the [[Great Purge]], while killing Stalin's perceived political enemies, resulted in a profound loss of a new generation of  intelligentsia, known today as the [[Executed Renaissance]].

=== World War II ===
<!-- 1939–1945 -->
{{See also|Eastern Front (World War II)|Reichskommissariat |The Holocaust in }}

Following the [[invasion of ]] in September 1939, [[Nazi |]] and [[Soviet Army|Soviet]] troops divided the territory of . Thus, Eastern Galicia and Volhynia with their  population became part of . For the first time in history, the nation was united. Further territorial gains were secured in 1940, when the  SSR incorporated the northern and southern districts of [[Bessarabia]], [[Northern Bukovina]], and the [[Hertsa region]] from the territories the USSR [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|forced  to cede]], though it handed over the western part of the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] to the newly created [[Moldavian SSR]]. These territorial gains of the USSR were internationally recognised by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaties of 1947]].

[[File:Маршал Советского Союза Герой Советского Союза Семён Константинович Тимошенко.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Marshal [[Semyon Timoshenko]] (born in the [[Budjak]] region) commanded numerous fronts throughout the war, including the [[Southwestern Front (Soviet Union)|Southwestern Front]] east of Kyiv in 1941.]]
[[Wehrmacht| armies]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941, initiating nearly four years of [[total war]]. The [[Axis Powers|Axis]] initially advanced against desperate but unsuccessful efforts of the Red Army. In the [[Battle of Kyiv (1941)|battle of Kyiv]], the city was acclaimed as a "[[Hero City (Soviet Union)|Hero City]]", because of its fierce resistance. More than 600,000 Soviet soldiers (or one-quarter of the [[Soviet Western Front]]) were killed or taken captive there, with many suffering [[ mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|severe mistreatment]]. After its conquest, most of the  SSR was organised within the [[Reichskommissariat ]], with the intention of exploiting its resources and eventual  settlement. Some western Ukrainians, who had only joined the Soviet Union in 1939, hailed the Germans as liberators, but that did not last long as the Nazis made little attempt to exploit dissatisfaction with Stalinist policies. Instead, the Nazis preserved the collective-farm system, carried out [[Mass graves in the Soviet Union|genocidal policies]] against [[History of the Jews in |Jews]], [[OST-Arbeiter|deported millions of people to work in ]], and began a depopulation programme to prepare for  colonisation. They blockaded the transport of food on the Dnieper River.

Although the majority of Ukrainians fought in or alongside the Red Army and [[Soviet partisans|Soviet resistance]], in Western  an independent [[ Insurgent Army]] movement arose (UPA, 1942). It was created as the armed forces of the underground [[Organization of  Nationalists|Organisation of  Nationalists]] (OUN). Both organisations, the OUN and the UPA, supported the goal of an [[Declaration of  Independence, 1941|independent  state]] on the territory with a  ethnic majority. Although this brought conflict with Nazi , at times the [[Melnykites|Melnyk wing of the OUN]] allied with the Nazi forces. From mid-1943 until the end of the war, the UPA carried out [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia|massacres of ethnic Poles]] in the Volhynia and [[Eastern Galicia]] regions, killing around 100,000  civilians, which brought reprisals. These organised massacres were an attempt by the OUN to create a homogeneous  state without a  minority living within its borders, and to prevent the post-war  state from asserting its sovereignty over areas that had been part of pre-war . After the war, the UPA continued to fight the USSR until the 1950s. At the same time, the [[ Liberation Army]], another nationalist movement, fought alongside the Nazis.

[[File:Ruined Kiev in WWII.jpg|thumb|[[Kyiv]] suffered significant damage during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], and was occupied by the [[Wehrmacht|Germans]] from 19 September 1941 until 6 November 1943]]

In total, the number of ethnic Ukrainians who fought in the ranks of the Soviet Army is estimated from 4.5&nbsp;million to 7&nbsp;million;{{Efn|name=fn1|These figures are likely to be much higher, as they do not include Ukrainians of other nationalities or  Jews, but only [[ethnic]] Ukrainians, from the  SSR.}} half of the [[Soviet Partisans|Pro-Soviet partisan]] guerrilla resistance units, which counted up to 500,000 troops in 1944, were also . Generally, the  Insurgent Army's figures are unreliable, with figures ranging anywhere from 15,000 to as many as 100,000 fighters.

The vast majority of the fighting in World War II took place on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. The [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|total losses]] inflicted upon the  population during the war are estimated at 6 million, including an estimated one and a half million Jews killed by the [[Einsatzgruppen]], sometimes with the help of local collaborators.

The republic was heavily damaged by the war, and it required significant efforts to recover. More than 700 cities and towns and 28,000 villages were destroyed. The situation was worsened by a [[famine]] in 1946–1947, which was caused by a drought and the wartime destruction of infrastructure, killing at least tens of thousands of people. In 1945, the  SSR became one of the founding members of the [[United Nations]] (UN), part of a special agreement at the [[Yalta Conference]], and, alongside , had voting rights in the UN even though they were not independent. Moreover,  once more expanded its borders as it annexed [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]], and the population became much more homogenised due to post-war population transfers, most of which, as in the case of [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950)|Germans]] and [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatars]], were forced. As of 1 January 1953, Ukrainians were second only to Russians among adult "[[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special deportees]]", comprising 20% of the total.

Following the death of Stalin in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became the new leader of the USSR, who began the policies of [[De-Stalinization|de-stalinisation]] and the [[Khrushchev Thaw]]. During his term as head of the Soviet Union, [[Crimean Oblast|Crimea]] was [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] from the [[ SFSR]] to the [[ SSR]], formally as a friendship gift to  and for economic reasons. This represented the final extension of  territory and formed the basis for the internationally recognised borders of  to this day. Many top positions in the Soviet Union were occupied by Ukrainians, including notably [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] from 1964 to 1982. However, it was he and his [[Communist Party of  (Soviet Union)|appointee in ]], [[Volodymyr Shcherbytsky]], who presided over the extensive [[Russification of |Russification]] of  and who were instrumental in repressing a new generation of  intellectuals known as the [[Sixtiers]].

By 1950, the republic had fully surpassed pre-war levels of industry and production. Soviet  soon became a European leader in industrial production and an important centre of the Soviet [[arms industry]] and high-tech research, though heavy industry still had an outsided influence. The Soviet government invested in hydroelectric and nuclear power projects to cater to the energy demand that the development carried. On 26 April 1986, however, a reactor in the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] exploded, resulting in the [[Chernobyl disaster]], the worst [[nuclear reactor]] accident in history.

After a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|failed coup]] by some Communist leaders in Moscow at deposing Gorbachov, outright independence was proclaimed on 24 August 1991. It was approved by 92% of the  electorate in a [[1991  independence referendum|referendum]] on 1 December.

These documents sealed the fate of the Soviet Union, which formally voted itself out of existence on 26 December.

 was initially viewed as having favourable economic conditions in comparison to the other regions of the Soviet Union, though it was one of the poorer Soviet republics by the time of the dissolution. However, during its transition to the market economy, the country experienced deeper economic slowdown than almost all of the other [[former Soviet Republics]]. During the recession, between 1991 and 1999,  lost 60% of its GDP and suffered from [[hyperinflation]] that peaked at 10,000% in 1993.
