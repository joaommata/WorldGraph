Stone tools, weapons, elephants, and remnants of large stone structures provide evidence that  was inhabited as early as 2000 BCE, although there are no existing records from that time. Historians have theorised that the state of ''Lhomon'' ({{lit|southern darkness}}), or ''Monyul'' ("Dark Land", a reference to the [[Monpa people|Monpa]], an ethnic group in  and [[Arunachal Pradesh]], ), may have existed between 500 BCE and 600 CE. The names ''Lhomon Tsendenjong'' ([[Sandalwood]] Country) and ''Lhomon Khashi'' or Southern Mon (country of four approaches), have been found in ancient  and Tibetan chronicles.

[[Buddhism]] was first introduced to  in the mid of [[7th century]] CE. The Tibetan king [[Songtsen Gampo]] (reigned 627–649), a Buddhist convert, extended the Tibetan Empire into Sikkim and . He ordered the construction of two Buddhist temples, [[Jambay Lhakhang]] in [[Bumthang (town)|Bumthang]] in central  and [[Kyichu Lhakhang]] in [[Paro Valley]]. Buddhism was propagated in earnest in 746 under King Sindhu Rāja (''also'' Künjom; Sendha Gyab; Chakhar Gyalpo), an exiled [[ people|]] king who had established a government in Bumthang at Chakhar Gutho Palace.{{rp|35}}{{rp|13}}

By the 10th century, 's religious history had had a significant impact on its political development. Various subsects of Buddhism emerged that were patronised by the various [[Mongols|Mongol]] warlords.

 may have been influenced by the [[Yuan dynasty]], with which it shares various cultural and religious similarities.

After the decline of the [[Yuan dynasty]] in the 14th century, these subsects vied with each other for supremacy in the political and religious landscape, eventually leading to the ascendancy of the [[Drukpa Lineage]] by the 16th century.

Locally,  has been known by many names. The earliest Western record of , the 1627 ''Relação'' of the [[Kingdom of |]] [[Jesuit]]s [[Estêvão Cacella]] and [[João Cabral]], records its name variously as ''Cambirasi'' (among the [[Cooch Behar State|Koch Bihar]]is), ''Potente'', and ''Mon'' (an endonym for southern Tibet). Until the early 17th century,  existed as a patchwork of minor warring [[fiefdom]]s, when the area was unified by the Tibetan lama and military leader [[Ngawang Namgyal]], who had fled religious persecution in Tibet. To defend the country against intermittent Tibetan forays, Namgyal built a network of impregnable ''[[dzong architecture|dzongs]]'' or fortresses, and [[promulgation|promulgated]] the [[Tsa Yig]], a code of law that helped to bring local lords under centralised control. Many such ''dzong'' still exist and are active centres of religion and district administration. [[ people|]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] [[Estêvão Cacella]] and [[João Cabral]] were the first recorded Europeans to visit  in 1627, on their way to Tibet. They met Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, presented him with firearms, gunpowder and a telescope, and offered him their services in the war against Tibet, but the Zhabdrung declined the offer. After a stay of nearly eight months Cacella wrote a long letter from the [[Chagri Monastery]] reporting on his travels. This is a rare extant report of the Zhabdrung.

When Ngawang Namgyal died in 1651, his death was kept secret for 54 years. After a period of consolidation,  lapsed into internal conflict. In 1711,  went to war against the [[Raja]] of the kingdom of [[Cooch Behar State|Koch Bihar]] in the south. During the chaos that followed, the Tibetans unsuccessfully attacked  in 1714. This period was marked by an increase in 's influence in Koch Bihar.

In the 18th century, the  invaded and occupied the kingdom of Koch Bihar. In 1772, the [[Maharaja]] of Koch Bihar appealed to the British [[East  Company]] which assisted by ousting the  and later attacking  itself in 1774. A peace treaty was signed in which  agreed to retreat to its pre-1730 borders. However, the peace was tenuous, and border skirmishes with the [[British |British]] were to continue for the next hundred years. The skirmishes eventually led to the [[Duar War]] (1864–65), a confrontation to control of the [[Bengal]] [[Duars]]. After  lost the war, the [[Treaty of Sinchula]] was signed between [[British ]] and . As part of the [[war reparations]], the Duars were ceded to the [[ of Great Britain and |]] in exchange for a rent of {{ Rupee|50,000}}. The treaty ended all hostilities between British  and .

During the 1870s, power struggles between the rival valleys of [[Paro, |Paro]] and [[Tongsa]] led to civil war in , eventually leading to the ascendancy of [[Ugyen Wangchuck]], the ''[[Penlop of Trongsa|penlop]]'' (governor) of [[Trongsa District|Trongsa]]. From his power base in central , Ugyen Wangchuck defeated his political enemies and united the country following several civil wars and rebellions during 1882–85.

In 1907, an epochal year for the country, Ugyen Wangchuck was unanimously chosen as the hereditary king of the country by the Lhengye Tshog of leading Buddhist monks, government officials, and heads of important families, with the firm petition made by ''Gongzim'' [[Ugyen Dorji]]. [[John Claude White]], British Political Agent in , took photographs of the ceremony. The British government promptly recognised the new monarchy. In 1910,  signed the [[Treaty of Punakha]], a [[subsidiary alliance]] that gave the British control of 's foreign affairs and meant that  was treated as an  [[princely state]]. This had little real effect, given 's historical reticence, and also did not appear to affect 's traditional relations with Tibet. After the new [[Dominion of |Union of ]] gained [[Independence of |independence]] from the  on 15 August 1947,  became one of the first countries to recognise 's independence. On 8 August 1949, a treaty similar to that of 1910, in which Britain had gained power over 's foreign relations, was signed with the newly independent .

In 1953, King [[Jigme Dorji Wangchuck]] established the country's legislature—a 130-member [[National Assembly ()|National Assembly]]—to promote a more democratic form of governance. In 1965, he set up a Royal Advisory Council, and in 1968 he formed a Cabinet. In 1971,  was admitted to the [[United Nations]], having held observer status for three years. In July 1972, [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]] ascended to the throne at the age of sixteen after the death of his father, Dorji Wangchuck.

's sixth Five-Year Plan (1987–92) included a policy of 'one nation, one people' and introduced a code of traditional Drukpa dress and etiquette called ''[[Driglam namzha|Driglam Namzhag]]''. The dress element of this code required all citizens to wear the ''gho'' (a knee-length robe for men) and the ''kira'' (an ankle-length dress for women). A central plank of the  government's policy since the late 1960s has been to modernise the use of [[Dzongkha]] language. This began with abandoning the use of [[Hindi]], a language that was adopted to help start formal secular education in the country, in 1964. As a result, at the beginning of the school year in March 1990, the teaching of the Nepali language (which shares similarities with Hindi) spoken by ethnic [[Lhotshampas]] in southern  was discontinued and all Nepali curricular materials were discontinued from  schools.

In 1988,  conducted a census in southern  to guard against illegal immigration, a constant issue in the south where borders with  are porous. Each family was required to present census workers with a tax receipt from the year 1958—no earlier, no later—or with a certificate of origin, which had to be obtained from one's place of birth, to prove that they were indeed  citizens. Previously issued citizenship cards were no longer accepted as proof of citizenship. Alarmed by these measures, many began to protest for civil and cultural rights and demanded a total change to be brought to the political system that existed since 1907. As protests and related violence swept across southern , the government in turn increased its resistance. People present at protests were labeled "anti-national terrorists". After the demonstrations, the  army and police began identifying participants and supporters engaged in the violence against the state and government. They were arrested and held for months without trial. Soon the  government arbitrarily reported that its census operations had detected the presence in southern  of over 100,000 "illegal immigrants" although this number is often debated. The census operations, thus, were used as a tool for the identification, eviction and banishment of dissidents who were involved in the uprising against the state. Military and other security forces were deployed for forceful deportations of between 80,000 and 100,000 [[Lhotshampa]]s and were accused of using widespread violence, torture, rape and killing. The evicted [[Lhotshampas]] became refugees in camps in southern . Since 2008, many Western countries, including , , the , , and the , have allowed resettlement of the majority of this group of Lhotshampa refugees.

===Political reform and modernisation===
{{further|Law of | democracy}}
's political system has recently changed from an [[absolute monarchy]] to a [[constitutional monarchy]]. King [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]] transferred most of his administrative powers to the Council of Cabinet Ministers and allowed for [[impeachment]] of the King by a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly.

In 1999, the government lifted a ban on television and internet, making  one of the last countries to introduce television. In his speech, the King said that television was a critical step to the modernisation of  as well as a major contributor to the country's [[gross national happiness]], but warned that the "misuse" of this new technology could erode traditional  values.

A new constitution was presented in early 2005. In December 2005, Wangchuck announced that he would abdicate the throne in his son's favour in 2008. On 9 December 2006, he announced that he would abdicate immediately. This was followed by the first national [[Elections in |parliamentary elections]] in [[ National Council election, 2007–2008|December 2007]] and [[2008  general election|March 2008]].

On 6 November 2008, 28-year-old [[Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck]] was crowned king.

In July 2021 during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]],  became the first world-leading nation in its role of vaccinating 470,000 out of 770,000 people with a two-dose shot of [[AstraZeneca]] vaccines.

On 13 December 2023,  was officially delisted as a [[least developed country]].
