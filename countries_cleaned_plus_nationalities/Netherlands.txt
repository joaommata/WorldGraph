The oldest human ([[Neanderthal]]) traces in the , believed to be about 250,000 years old, were found near [[Maastricht]]. At the end of the [[Weichselian glaciation|Ice Age]], the [[nomadic]] late [[Upper Paleolithic|Upper Palaeolithic]] [[Hamburg culture]] (13,000–10,000 BC) hunted [[reindeer]] in the area, using spears. The later [[Ahrensburg culture]] (11,200–9,500 BC) used [[bow and arrow]]. From [[Mesolithic Europe|Mesolithic]] [[Maglemosian culture|Maglemosian-like tribes]] (c. 8000 BC), the world's [[Pesse canoe|oldest canoe]] was found in [[Drenthe]].

Indigenous late Mesolithic [[hunter-gatherer]]s from the [[Swifterbant culture]] (c. 5600 BC), related to the southern Scandinavian [[Ertebølle culture]], were strongly linked to rivers and open water. Between 4800 and 4500 BC, the Swifterbant people started to adopt from the neighbouring [[Linear Pottery culture]] the practice of [[animal husbandry]], and between 4300 and 4000 BC agriculture. The [[Funnelbeaker culture]] (4300–2800 BC) erected the [[dolmens]], large stone grave monuments found in [[Drenthe]]. There was a quick transition from the Funnelbeaker [[Early European Farmers|farming culture]] to the pan-European [[Corded Ware]] [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]] culture (c. 2950 BC). In the southwest, the [[Seine-Oise-Marne culture]]—related to the [[Vlaardingen culture]] (c. 2600 BC)—survived well into the [[Neolithic]] period, until it too was succeeded by the Corded Ware culture.

The subsequent [[Beaker culture|Bell Beaker culture]] (2700–2100 BC) introduced metalwork in copper, gold and later bronze and opened new international trade routes, reflected in [[Copper Age Europe|copper artefacts]]. Finds of rare bronze objects suggest that Drenthe was a trading centre in the Bronze Age (2000–800 BC). The Bell Beaker culture developed locally into the Barbed-Wire Beaker culture (2100–1800 BC) and later the [[Elp culture]] (1800–800 BC), a Middle Bronze Age culture marked by [[earthenware]] pottery. The southern region became dominated by the related [[Hilversum culture]] (1800–800 BC).

===Celts, Germanic tribes and Romans (800 BC–410 AD)===
{{Main|Iron Age Europe|Celts|Germanic peoples| in the Roman era}}

From 800 BC onwards, the [[Iron Age Europe|Iron Age]] Celtic [[Hallstatt culture]] became influential, replacing the [[Hilversum culture]]. Iron ore brought a measure of prosperity and was available throughout the country. [[Blacksmith|Smiths]] travelled from settlement to settlement with bronze and iron, fabricating tools on demand. The [[Vorstengraf (Oss)|King's grave of Oss]] (700 BC) was found in a burial mound, the largest of its kind in Western Europe.

The deteriorating climate in Scandinavia from 850 BC and 650 BC might have triggered the migration of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes from the North. By the time this migration was complete, around 250 BC, a few general cultural and linguistic groups had emerged. The [[North Sea Germanic]] [[Ingaevones]] inhabited the northern part of the [[Low Countries]]. They would later develop into the [[Frisii]] and the early [[Saxons]]. The [[Weser–Rhine Germanic]] (or [[Istvaeones]]) extended along the middle Rhine and [[Weser]] and inhabited the Low Countries south of the great rivers. These tribes would eventually develop into the [[Salian Franks]]. The [[Celts|Celtic]] [[La Tène culture]] (c. 450 BC to the Roman conquest) expanded over a wide range, including the southern area of the [[Low Countries]]. Some scholars have speculated that even a third ethnic identity and language, neither Germanic nor Celtic, survived in the  until the Roman period, the [[Nordwestblock]] culture.

[[File:Germania 70.svg|thumb|The Rhine frontier around 70 AD]]
The first author to describe the coast of [[Holland]] and [[Flanders]] was the geographer [[Pytheas]], who noted in c. 325 BC that in these regions, "more people died in the struggle against water than in the struggle against men." During the [[Gallic Wars]], the area south and west of the [[Rhine]] was conquered by [[Roman Empire|Roman forces]] under [[Julius Caesar]] from 57 BC to 53 BC. Caesar describes two main Celtic tribes living in what is now the southern : the [[Menapii]] and the [[Eburones]]. Under [[Augustus]], the [[Roman Empire]] conquered the entirety of the modern day , incorporating it into the province of [[Germania Antiqua]] in 7 BC, and was repelled back across the Rhine after the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|Battle of Teutoburg Forest]] in AD 9; the Rhine became fixed as Rome's permanent northern frontier about AD 12. Notable towns would arise along the [[Limes Germanicus]]: [[Nijmegen]] and [[Voorburg]]. In the first part of [[Gallia Belgica]], the area south of the Limes became part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Germania Inferior]]. The area to the north of the Rhine, inhabited by the Frisii, remained outside Roman rule, while the Germanic border tribes of the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]] and [[Cananefates]] served in the [[Ala (Roman allied military unit)|Roman cavalry]]. The Batavi rose against the Romans in the [[Revolt of the Batavi|Batavian rebellion]] of AD 69 and were defeated. The Batavi later merged with other tribes into the confederation of the Salian Franks, whose identity emerged in the first half of the third century. Salian Franks appear in Roman texts as both allies and enemies. They were forced by the confederation of the Saxons from the east to move over the Rhine into Roman territory in the fourth century. From their new base in [[West Flanders]] and the Southwest , they were raiding the [[ Channel]]. Roman forces pacified the region but did not expel the Franks, who continued to be feared at least until the time of [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]] (358) when Salian Franks were allowed to settle as ''[[foederati]]'' in [[Texandria]].

===Early Middle Ages (411–1000)===
{{Main|Frankish Kingdom|Frisian Kingdom}}
[[File:Frisia 716-la.svg|thumb|upright|[[Franks]], [[Frisians]] and [[Saxons]], c. 716 AD]]
After the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] government in the area collapsed in roughly the year 406, the Franks expanded their territories into numerous kingdoms. By the 490s, [[Clovis I]] had conquered and united all these territories in the southern  in one [[Frankish kingdom]], and from there continued his conquests into [[Gaul]]. During this expansion, Franks migrating to the south (modern territory of  and Walloon part of ) eventually adopted the [[Vulgar Latin]] of the local population. A widening cultural divide grew with the Franks remaining in their original homeland in the north (i.e. the southern  and Flanders), who kept on speaking [[Old Frankish]], which by the ninth century had evolved into Old Low Franconian or Old . A - language boundary hence came into existence.
[[File:Franks expansion.gif|thumb|left|Frankish expansion (481 to 870 AD)]]
To the north of the Franks, climatic conditions improved, and during the [[Migration Period]] [[Saxons]], the closely related [[Angles (tribe)|Angles]], [[Jutes]], and [[Frisii]] settled the coast. Many moved on to England and came to be known as [[Anglo-Saxons]], but those who stayed would be referred to as [[Frisians]] and their language as [[Frisian languages|Frisian]]. Frisian was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast. By the seventh century, a [[Frisian Kingdom]] (650–734) under King [[Aldegisel]] and King [[Redbad, King of the Frisians|Redbad]] emerged with [[Traiectum (Utrecht)|Traiectum]] ([[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]) as its centre of power, while [[Dorestad]] was a flourishing trading place. Between 600 and around 719 the cities were often fought over between the Frisians and the Franks. In 734, at the [[Battle of the Boarn]], the Frisians were defeated after a [[Frisian–Frankish wars|series of wars]]. With the approval of the Franks, the [[Anglo-Saxon mission|Anglo-Saxon]] missionary [[Willibrord]] converted the Frisian people to Christianity and established the [[Archdiocese of Utrecht (695–1580)|Archdiocese of Utrecht]]. However, his successor [[Boniface]] was murdered by the Frisians in 754.

[[File:Rorik by H. W. Koekkoek.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rorik of Dorestad]], [[Viking]] ruler of [[Friesland]] (romantic 1912 depiction)]]
The Frankish [[Carolingian empire]] controlled much of Western Europe. In 843, it was divided into three parts—[[East Francia|East]], [[Middle Francia|Middle]], and [[West Francia]]. Most of present-day  became part of Middle Francia, which was a weak kingdom and subject to numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours. It comprised territories from [[Frisia]] in the north to the [[Kingdom of  (medieval)|Kingdom of ]] in the south. Around 850, [[Lothair I]] of Middle Francia acknowledged the Viking [[Rorik of Dorestad]] as ruler of most of Frisia. When the kingdom of Middle Francia was partitioned in 855, the lands north of the [[Alps]] passed to [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] and subsequently were named [[Lotharingia]]. After he died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned, into [[Upper Lotharingia|Upper]] and [[Lower Lotharingia]], the latter comprising the Low Countries that became part of [[East Francia]] in 870. Around 879, another Viking expedition led by [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]], raided the Frisian lands. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result, and that laid the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into semi-independent states. One of these local nobles was [[Gerolf of Holland]], who assumed lordship in Frisia, and Viking rule came to an end.

===High Middle Ages (1000–1384)===
{{Main|History of urban centres in the Low Countries}}
[[File:Graftombe Ridder Arnold van der Sluijs.jpg|thumb|A medieval tomb of the Brabantian knight Arnold van der Sluijs]]

The [[Holy Roman Empire]] ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century but was not able to maintain political unity. Powerful local nobles turned their cities, counties and duchies into private kingdoms that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor. [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Duchy of Gelre|Gelre]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], and [[Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] were in a state of almost continual war or paradoxically formed personal unions. As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant, the area quickly became Old Low Franconian (or Old ).

Around 1000 AD, agrarian conditions started to improve, which led to increase in population, reclamation of wasteland by farmers, and steady growth of trade and industry. Towns grew around [[monasteries]] and [[castles]], and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas, especially in Flanders, and later Brabant. Wealthy cities started to buy certain [[City rights in the Low Countries|privileges]] for themselves from the sovereign.

Around 1100 AD, farmers from [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western , making the emergence of the County of Holland as the centre of power possible. The title of [[Count of Holland]] was fought over in the [[Hook and Cod Wars]] between 1350 and 1490. The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities, while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen. These noblemen invited Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy to conquer Holland.

Most of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] and [[ in the Middle Ages|]] fiefs in what is now the  and  were united in a [[personal union]] by Philip the Good in 1433. The [[House of Valois-Burgundy]] and their [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heirs would rule the Low Countries from 1384 to 1581. The new rulers defended  trading interests. The fleets of the [[County of Holland]] defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. [[Amsterdam]] grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the [[Baltic region]]. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of , Northern  and England. This trade was vital because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the [[peat]] of the former [[wetland]]s to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.

Under Habsburg [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], all fiefs in the current  region were united into the [[Seventeen Provinces]], which included most of present-day , , and parts of  and . In 1568, under [[Philip II of |Phillip II]], the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the Provinces and their [[ Empire|]] ruler began. The level of ferocity exhibited by both sides can be gleaned from a  chronicler's report:
<blockquote>On more than one occasion men were seen hanging their own brothers, who had been taken prisoners in the enemy's ranks... A Spaniard had ceased to be human in their eyes. On one occasion, a surgeon at Veer cut the heart from a  prisoner, nailed it on a vessel's prow, and invited the townsmen to come and fasten their teeth in it, which many did with savage satisfaction.</blockquote>

The [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] attempted to suppress the Protestant movement in the . Netherlanders were "burned, strangled, beheaded, or buried alive" by his "[[Council of Troubles|Blood Council]]" and  soldiers. Bodies were displayed along roads to terrorise the population into submission. Alba boasted of having executed 18,600; this figure does not include those who perished by war and famine.

The first great siege was Alba's effort to capture [[Haarlem]] and thereby cut Holland in half. It dragged on from December 1572 to the next summer, when Haarlemers finally surrendered on 13 July upon the promise that the city would be spared from being sacked. It was a stipulation [[Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo, 4th Duke of Alba|Don Fadrique]] was unable to honour, when his soldiers mutinied, angered over pay owed and the miserable conditions of the campaign. On 4 November 1576,  [[tercio]]s seized [[Antwerp]] and subjected it to the worst pillage in the ' history. The citizens resisted but were overcome; seven thousand were killed and a thousand buildings were torched.

After the [[sack of Antwerp]], delegates from Catholic Brabant, Protestant Holland and Zeeland agreed to join Utrecht and [[William the Silent]] in driving out  troops and forming a new government for the . [[Don Juan of ]], the new  governor, was forced to concede initially, but within months returned to active hostilities. The  looked for help from the Protestant [[Elizabeth I]] of England, but she initially stood by her commitments to the  in the [[Treaty of Bristol]] of 1574. When the next large-scale battle occurred at [[Gembloux]] in 1578, the  forces won easily. In light of the [[Battle of Gembloux (1578)|defeat at Gembloux]], the southern states of the Seventeen Provinces distanced themselves from the rebels in the north with the 1579 [[Union of Arras]]. Opposing them, the northern half of the Seventeen Provinces forged the [[Union of Utrecht]] in which they committed to support each other against the . The Union of Utrecht is seen as the foundation of the modern .

 troops sacked [[Maastricht]] in 1579, killing over 10,000 civilians. In 1581, the northern provinces adopted the [[Act of Abjuration]], the declaration of independence in which the provinces officially deposed Philip II. Against the rebels Philip could draw on the resources of the [[ Empire]]. Elizabeth I sympathised with the  struggle and sent an army of 7,600 soldiers to aid them.  forces faced the  in the  under the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]] in a series of largely indecisive actions that tied down significant numbers of  troops and bought time for the  to reorganise their defences. The war continued until 1648, when  under King [[Philip IV of |Philip IV]] recognised the independence of the seven north-western provinces in the [[Peace of Münster]]. Parts of the southern provinces became ''de facto'' colonies of the new republican-mercantile empire.

[[File:Hendrick Avercamp - Winterlandschap met schaatsers bij de stad Kampen.jpg|thumb|left|''Winter landscape with skaters near the city of [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]]'' by [[Hendrick Avercamp]] (1620s)]]
After the declaration of independence, the provinces of [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Zeeland|Zeeland]], [[Lordship of Groningen|Groningen]], [[Lordship of Friesland|Friesland]], [[Lordship of Utrecht|Utrecht]], [[Lordship of Overijssel|Overijssel]], and [[Duchy of Gelderland|Gelderland]] entered into a [[confederation]]. All these duchies, lordships and counties enjoyed a significant degree of autonomy and were governed by their own administrative bodies known as the [[States-Provincial]]. The confederal government, known as the [[States General of the |States General]], was headquartered in [[The Hague]] and comprised representatives from each of the seven provinces. The sparsely populated region of [[Lordship of Drenthe|Drenthe]] was part of the republic, albeit not considered a province in its own right. Moreover, during the [[Eighty Years' War]], the Republic came to occupy a number of [[Generality Lands]] in [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]]. These areas were primarily inhabited by Roman Catholics and lacked a distinct governmental structure of their own. They were utilized as a buffer zone between the Republic and the -controlled [[Southern ]].

In the [[ Golden Age]], spanning much of the 17th century, the [[ Empire]] grew to become one of the major seafaring and economic powers. Science, military and art (especially [[ Golden Age painting|painting]]) were among the most acclaimed in the world. By 1650, the  owned 16,000 merchant ships. The [[ East  Company]] and the [[ West  Company]] established [[ colonial empire|colonies]] and [[trading post]]s all over the world. The [[New Netherland| settlement in North America]] began with the founding of [[New Amsterdam]] in 1614. In , the  settled the [[Cape Colony]] in 1652. [[ colonisation of the Guianas| colonies in South America]] were established along the many rivers in the fertile [[]] plains, among them [[Surinam ( colony)|Colony of Surinam]] (now [[]]). In Asia, the  established a presence in [[ |]], the [[ East Indies]] (now [[]]), [[ Formosa|Formosa]] (now [[Taiwan]]), and the only western trading post in , [[Dejima]]. During the period of [[Proto-industrialisation]], the empire received 50% of textiles and 80% of silks import from the 's [[Mughal Empire]].

Many economic historians regard the  as the first thoroughly capitalist country. In early modern Europe, it had the wealthiest trading city in [[Amsterdam]], and the first full-time [[Euronext Amsterdam|stock exchange]]. The inventiveness of the traders led to insurance and retirement funds as well as phenomena such as the [[Boom and bust|boom-bust cycle]], the world's first [[Asset price inflation|asset-inflation bubble]], the [[tulip mania]] of 1636–1637, and the world's first [[bear raid]]er, [[Isaac le Maire]]. In 1672 – known in  history as the [[Rampjaar]] (Disaster Year) – the  Republic was attacked by , England and two  bishoprics simultaneously, in what would become known as the [[Franco- War]]. [[Third Anglo- War|At sea]], it could successfully prevent the  and  navies from blockading the western shores. On land the Republic was almost overrun by the advancing  and  armies from the east, but the  managed to turn the tide by [[Hollandic Water Line|inundating parts of Holland]].

From 1672 to 1712, the Republic, led by [[William III of England|William III of Orange]] and [[Anthonie Heinsius]] would regularly clash with  in what some historians have come to call the ''Forty Years' War''. In the [[Nine Years' War]] and the [[War of the  Succession]], the Republic was at the centre of anti- coalitions. The  ultimately successfully defended the [[ ]], established a [[Barrier Treaty|barrier]] there, and their troops proved central to the alliance which halted  territorial expansion in Europe until a new cycle began in 1792 with the [[ Revolutionary Wars]].{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2020|p=354}} However, the wars left them effectively bankrupt, and inflicted permanent damage on the  merchant navy; while they remained the dominant economic power in the Far East, Britain took over as the pre-eminent global commercial and maritime power.{{sfn|Elliott|2014|p=8}} Between 1590 and 1713, the [[ States Army| army]] had been one of Europe's largest and most capable armies. However, after the [[Peace of Utrecht|conclusion of the War of the  Succession]], other major powers, such as Prussia, , Britain, and , significantly expanded their military forces. The Republic struggled to match these developments, and gradually assumed the status of a mid-tier power. However, historians have sometimes overstated the extent of this decline, especially when considering the period up to the 1750s.{{sfn||1995|pp=985–986}}

===Batavian Republic and Kingdom (1795–1890)===
{{Main|Batavian Republic|Kingdom of Holland|Sovereign Principality of the United | of the |Kingdom of the }}

In the 18th century the  Republic had seen a state of a general decline, with economic competition from England and long-standing rivalries between the two main factions in  society, the republican [[ States Party|''Staatsgezinden'']] and the supporters of the [[stadtholder]] the [[Orangism ()|''Prinsgezinden'']] as main political factions. With the armed support of [[ Revolution|revolutionary ]], [[Patriots ( Republic)| republicans]] proclaimed the [[Batavian Republic]], modelled after the [[ First Republic| Republic]] and rendering the  a [[unitary state]] on 19 January 1795. The stadtholder [[William V of Orange]] had fled to England. From 1806 to 1810, the [[Kingdom of Holland]] was set up by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] as a puppet kingdom governed by his brother [[Louis Bonaparte]]. However, King Louis Bonaparte tried to serve  interests instead of his brother's, and he was forced to abdicate on 1 July 1810. The Emperor sent in an army and the  [[Incorporation ()|became part of the  Empire]] until November 1813, when Napoleon was defeated in the [[Battle of Leipzig]].

[[William I of the |William Frederick]], son of the last stadtholder, returned to the  in 1813 and proclaimed himself [[Sovereign Principality of the United |Sovereign Prince]]. Two years later, the [[Congress of Vienna]] added the southern  to the north to create a strong country on the northern border of . William Frederick raised this [[ of the |United ]] to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself as [[William I of the |King William I]] in 1815. William became hereditary [[Grand Ducal Family of |Grand Duke of ]] in exchange for his  possessions. However, the Southern  had been culturally separate from the north since 1581, and [[ Revolution|rebelled]]. The south gained independence in 1830 as  (recognised by the Northern  in 1839 as the Kingdom of the  was created by decree), while the [[personal union]] between  and the  was severed in 1890, when [[William III of the |William III]] died with no surviving male heirs. [[Salic Law|Ascendancy laws]] prevented his daughter [[Wilhelmina of the |Queen Wilhelmina]] from becoming the next Grand Duchess.

The  Revolution and the [[Java War]] in the  East Indies brought the  to the brink of bankruptcy. However, the [[Cultivation System]] was introduced in 1830; in the  East Indies, 20% of village land had to be devoted to government crops for export. The policy brought the  enormous wealth and made the colony self-sufficient. The  abolished slavery in its colonies in 1863. Enslaved people in [[]] would be fully free only in 1873.

====Decolonisation====
In 1954, the [[Charter for the Kingdom of the ]] reformed the political structure as a result of international pressure to carry out [[decolonisation]]. The  colonies of [[Surinam ( colony)|Surinam]] and [[Curaçao and Dependencies]] became constituent countries within the Kingdom, on the basis of an equal partnership with the European territories.  had declared its independence in August 1945.

In the 1950s, the  became one of the six founding countries of the [[European Communities]], after the 1952 establishment of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], and subsequent 1958 creations of the [[European Economic Community]] and [[European Atomic Energy Community]]. In 1993, the former two were incorporated into the [[European Union]].

Government-encouraged emigration efforts to reduce population density prompted some 500,000 [[ people|]] to leave the country after the war. The 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change, such as rapid de-[[pillarisation]]. Students and other youth rejected traditional mores and pushed for change in matters such as [[women's rights]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[disarmament]] and [[environmental issues]]. In 2002 the [[euro]] was introduced as [[fiat money]], and in 2010 the [[ Antilles]] was [[Dissolution of the  Antilles|dissolved]]. Referenda were held on each island. As a result, [[Bonaire]], [[Sint Eustatius]] and [[Saba (island)|Saba]] (the BES islands) were incorporated as ''[[Special municipality ()|special municipalities]]'' upon the dissolution of the  Antilles. The special municipalities are collectively known as the [[Caribbean ]].
