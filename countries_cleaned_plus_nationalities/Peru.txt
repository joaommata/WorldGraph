The earliest evidences of human presence in  territory have been dated to approximately 12,500 [[Common Era|BCE]] in the [[Huaca Prieta]] settlement.  Andean societies were based on agriculture, using techniques such as [[irrigation]] and [[Terrace (earthworks)|terracing]]; [[camelid]] husbandry and fishing were also important. Organization relied on [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] and [[Redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]] because these societies had no notion of market or money. The oldest known complex society in , the [[Caral–Supe civilization|Caral-Supe civilization]], flourished along the coast of the Pacific Ocean between 3,000 and 1,800 BCE. These early developments were followed by archaeological cultures that developed mostly around the coastal and Andean regions throughout . The [[Cupisnique]] culture which flourished from around 1000 to 200 BCE along what is now 's [[Pacific coast]] was an example of early pre-[[Inca Empire|Inca culture]].

The [[Chavín culture]] that developed from 1500 to 300 BCE was probably more of a religious than a political phenomenon, with their religious center in [[Chavín de Huantar]]. After the decline of the Chavin culture around the beginning of the 1st century CE, a series of localized and specialized cultures rose and fell, both on the coast and in the highlands, during the next thousand years. On the coast, these included the civilizations of the [[Paracas culture|Paracas]], [[Nazca culture|Nazca]], [[Wari culture|Wari]], and the more outstanding [[Chimú culture|Chimu]] and [[Moche culture|Moche]].

The Moche, who reached their apogee in the first millennium CE, were renowned for their irrigation system which fertilized their arid terrain, their sophisticated ceramic pottery, their lofty buildings, and clever metalwork. The Chimu were the great city builders of pre-Inca civilization; as a loose confederation of walled cities scattered along the coast of northern , the Chimu flourished from about 1140 to 1450. Their capital was at [[Chan Chan]] outside of modern-day [[Trujillo, |Trujillo]]. In the highlands, both the [[Tiwanaku Empire|Tiahuanaco]] culture, near [[Lake Titicaca]] in both  and , and the Wari culture, near the present-day city of [[Ayacucho]], developed large urban settlements and wide-ranging state systems between 500 and 1000 CE.

In the 15th century, the [[Inca Empire|Incas]] emerged as a powerful state which, in the span of a century, formed the [[Inca Empire|largest empire]] in the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian Americas]] with their capital in [[Cusco]]. The Incas of Cusco originally represented one of the small and relatively minor ethnic groups, the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]]. Gradually, as early as the thirteenth century, they began to expand and incorporate their neighbors. Inca expansion was slow until about the middle of the fifteenth century, when the pace of conquest began to accelerate, particularly under the rule of the emperor [[Pachacuti]]. Under his rule and that of his son, [[Topa Inca Yupanqui]], the Incas came to control most of the Andean region, with a population of 9 to 16 million inhabitants under their rule. Pachacuti also promulgated a comprehensive code of laws to govern his far-flung empire, while consolidating his absolute temporal and spiritual authority as the God of the Sun who ruled from a magnificently rebuilt Cusco. 

From 1438 to 1533, the Incas used a variety of methods, from conquest to peaceful assimilation, to incorporate a large portion of western South America, centered on the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain ranges, from southern  to northern , between the Pacific Ocean in the west and the Amazon rainforest in the east. The official language of the empire was [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], although hundreds of local languages and dialects were spoken. The Inca referred to their empire as {{lang|qu|Tawantinsuyu}} which can be translated as "The Four Regions" or "The Four United Provinces." Many local forms of worship persisted in the empire, most of them concerning local sacred {{lang|qu|[[Huaca|Huacas]]}}, but the Inca leadership encouraged the worship of [[Inti]], the sun god and imposed its sovereignty above other cults such as that of [[Pachamama]]. The Incas considered their King, the [[Sapa Inca]], to be the "[[Solar deity|child of the sun]]."

===Conquest and colonial period===
{{main| conquest of |Viceroyalty of }}
[[File:Luis Montero - The Funerals of Inca Atahualpa - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.21|''Los funerales de Atahualpa'' (1867) by Luis Montero. [[Atahualpa]] was the last [[Sapa Inca]], executed by the Spaniards on 29 August 1533.]]
[[Atahualpa]] (or Atahuallpa), the last [[Sapa Inca]], became emperor when he defeated and executed his older half-brother [[Huáscar]] in a civil war sparked by the death of their father, Inca Huayna Capac. In December 1532, a party of conquistadors (supported by the [[Chanka|Chankas]], [[Huanca people|Huancas]], [[Cañari|Cañaris]] and [[Chachapoya culture|Chachapoyas]] as [[ auxiliaries]]) led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] defeated and captured the Inca Emperor Atahualpa in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]]. After years of preliminary exploration and military conflicts, it was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting but ended in  victory and colonization of the region known as the [[Viceroyalty of ]] with its capital at [[Lima]], which was then known as {{lang|es|La Ciudad de los Reyes}} (The City of Kings). The conquest of  led to spin-off campaigns throughout the viceroyalty as well as expeditions towards the Amazon Basin as in the case of  efforts to quell Amerindian resistance. The last Inca resistance was suppressed when the Spaniards annihilated the [[Neo-Inca State]] in [[Vilcabamba, |Vilcabamba]] in 1572.

The Indigenous population dramatically collapsed overwhelmingly due to epidemic diseases introduced by the  as well as exploitation and socio-economic change. Viceroy [[Francisco de Toledo]] reorganized the country in the 1570s with gold and silver mining as its main economic activity and Amerindian [[Mit'a|forced labor]] as its primary workforce. With the discovery of the great silver and gold lodes at [[Potosí]] (present-day ) and [[Huancavelica]], the viceroyalty flourished as an important provider of mineral resources.  [[bullion]] provided revenue for the  Crown and fueled a complex trade network that extended as far as Europe and the . The commercial and population exchanges between Latin America and Asia undergone via the [[Manila Galleon|Manila Galleons]] transiting through Acapulco, had [[Callao]] at  as the furthest endpoint of the trade route in the Americas. In relation to this, Don [[Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera]], governor of  was also responsible for settling [[Zamboanga City]] in the  by employing  soldiers and colonists. [[History of slavery#Americas|African slaves]] were added to the labor population to expand the workforce. The expansion of a colonial administrative apparatus and bureaucracy paralleled the economic reorganization.

With the conquest started the spread of Christianity in South America; most people were forcefully converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], with  clerics believing like Puritan divines of  colonies later that the Native Peoples "had been corrupted by the Devil", who was working "through them to frustrate" their foundations. It only took a generation to convert the population. They built churches in every city and replaced some of the Inca temples with churches, such as the [[Coricancha]] in the city of Cusco. The church employed the [[Inquisition]], making use of torture to ensure that newly converted Catholics did not stray to other religions or beliefs, and monastery schools, educating girls, especially of the Inca nobility and upper class, "until they were old enough either to profess [to become a nun] or to leave the monastery and assume the role ('estado') in the Christian society that their fathers planned to erect" in .  Catholicism follows the [[syncretism]] found in many Latin  countries, in which religious native rituals have been integrated with Christian celebrations. In this endeavor, the church came to play an important role in the [[acculturation]] of the Natives, drawing them into the cultural orbit of the  settlers.

[[File:TupacAmaruII.jpg|thumb|210x210px|[[Túpac Amaru II]]]]
By the 18th century, declining silver production and economic diversification greatly diminished royal income. In response, the Crown enacted the [[Bourbon Reforms]], a series of [[Edict|edicts]] that increased taxes and partitioned the [[Viceroyalty]]. The new laws provoked [[Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II|Túpac Amaru II's rebellion]] and other revolts, all of which were suppressed. As a result of these and other changes, the Spaniards and their [[Creole peoples|creole]] successors came to monopolize control over the land, seizing many of the best lands abandoned by the massive native depopulation. However, the  did not resist the [[ colonization of the Americas| expansion of ]] across the meridian. The [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] was rendered meaningless between 1580 and 1640 while [[Iberian Union| controlled ]]. The need to ease communication and trade with  led to the split of the viceroyalty and the creation of new viceroyalties of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] and [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Rio de la Plata]] at the expense of the territories that formed the [[Viceroyalty of ]]; this reduced the power, prominence and importance of Lima as the viceroyal capital and shifted the lucrative [[Andes|Andean]] trade to [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Bogotá]], while the fall of the mining and textile production accelerated the progressive decay of the Viceroyalty of .

Eventually, the viceroyalty would dissolve, as with much of the  empire, when challenged by national independence movements at the beginning of the nineteenth century. These movements led to the formation of the majority of modern-day countries of South America in the territories that at one point or another had constituted the Viceroyalty of . The conquest and colony brought a mix of cultures and ethnicities that did not exist before the  conquered the  territory. Even though many of the Inca traditions were lost or diluted, new customs, traditions and knowledge were added, creating a rich mixed  culture. Two of the most important Indigenous rebellions against the  were that of [[Juan Santos Atahualpa]] in 1742, and Rebellion of [[Túpac Amaru II]] in 1780 around the highlands near Cuzco.

===Independence===

[[File:Batalla_de_Ayacucho_by_Martín_Tovar_y_Tovar_(1827_-_1902).jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Battle of Ayacucho]] was decisive in ensuring  independence.|left]]
In the early 19th century, while most South  nations were swept by [[Decolonization of the Americas|wars of independence]],  remained a [[Royalist (  Revolution)|royalist]] stronghold. As the elite vacillated between emancipation and loyalty to the  monarchy, [[Independence of |independence]] was achieved only after the occupation by military campaigns of [[José de San Martín]] and [[Simón Bolívar]].

The economic crises, the loss of power of  in Europe, the [[ Revolutionary War|war of independence in North America]], and Native uprisings all contributed to a favorable climate to the development of emancipation ideas among the [[Criollo people|C''riollo'']] population in South America. However, the Criollo oligarchy in  enjoyed privileges and remained loyal to the  Crown. The liberation movement started in  where autonomous juntas were created as a result of the loss of authority of the  government over its colonies.

After fighting for the independence of the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata, [[José de San Martín]] created the [[Army of the Andes]] and [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes]] in 21 days. Once in , he joined forces with  army General [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] and liberated the country in the battles of [[Battle of Chacabuco|Chacabuco]] and [[Battle of Maipú|Maipú]] in 1818. On 7 September 1820, a fleet of eight warships arrived in the port of [[Paracas (municipality)|Paracas]] under the command of General José de San Martín and [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane]], who was serving in the  Navy. Immediately on 26 October, they took control of the town of [[Pisco, |Pisco]]. San Martín settled in [[Huacho]] on 12 November, where he established his headquarters while Cochrane sailed north and blockaded the port of [[Callao]] in Lima. At the same time in the north, [[Guayaquil]] was occupied by rebel forces under the command of Gregorio Escobedo. Because  was the stronghold of the  government in South America, San Martín's strategy to liberate  was to use diplomacy. He sent representatives to Lima urging the [[Viceroy]] that  be granted independence, however, all negotiations proved unsuccessful.

[[File:Proclamación de la Independencia del Perú - Juan Lepiani.jpg|thumb|San Martín proclaiming the independence of . Painting by [[Juan Lepiani]].]]
The Viceroy of , [[Joaquín de la Pezuela, 1st Marquess of Viluma|Joaquín de la Pazuela]] named [[José de la Serna, 1st Count of the Andes|José de la Serna]] commander-in-chief of the loyalist army to protect Lima from the threatened invasion by San Martín. On 29 January, de la Serna organized a [[Coup d'état|coup]] against de la Pazuela, which was recognized by  and he was named Viceroy of . This internal power struggle contributed to the success of the liberating army. To avoid a military confrontation, San Martín met the newly appointed viceroy, José de la Serna, and proposed to create a [[constitutional monarchy]], a proposal that was turned down. De la Serna abandoned the city, and on 12 July 1821, San Martín occupied Lima and declared  independence on 28 July 1821. He created the first  flag. [[Upper ]] (present-day ) remained as a  stronghold until the army of [[Simón Bolívar]] liberated it three years later. José de San Martín was declared Protector of .  national identity was forged during this period, as Bolivarian projects for a [[Congress of |Latin  Confederation]] floundered and a [[– Confederation|union with ]] proved ephemeral.

Simón Bolívar launched his campaign from the north, liberating the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] in the Battles of [[Battle of Carabobo|Carabobo]] in 1821 and [[Battle of Pichincha|Pichincha]] a year later. In July 1822, Bolívar and San Martín gathered in the [[Guayaquil Conference]]. Bolívar was left in charge of fully liberating  while San Martín retired from politics after the first parliament was assembled. The newly founded [[Congress of the Republic of | Congress]] named Bolívar dictator of , giving him the power to organize the military.

With the help of [[Antonio José de Sucre]], they defeated the larger  army in the [[Battle of Junín]] on 6 August 1824 and the decisive [[Battle of Ayacucho]] on 9 December of the same year, consolidating the independence of  and Upper . Upper  was later established as . During the early years of the Republic, endemic struggles for power between military leaders caused political instability.

===19th century===
Once independence was proclaimed, San Martín assumed military-political command of the free departments of , under the title of Protector, according to a decree given on 3 August 1821. The works of the Protectorate contributed to the creation of the National Library (in favor of knowledge), the approval of the National Anthem, and the abolition of the mita (in favor of the indigenous people). On 27 December 1821, San Martín created three ministries: Ministry of State and Foreign Affairs, committing Juan García del Río; [[ Armed Forces|Ministry of War and Navy]], to Bernardo de Monteagudo; and Ministry of Finance, to Hipólito Unanue.

From the 1840s to the 1860s  enjoyed [[Guano Era|a period of stability]] under the presidency of [[Ramón Castilla]], through increased state revenues from [[guano]] exports. In 1864, a  expedition occupied the Chincha Islands (guano producers) and unleashed an international incident with great consequences in  internal politics, which led to a coup d'état against President [[Juan Antonio Pezet]], Mariano's government. , with the help of [[]], [[]] and [[]], sent a declaration of war on . After the battle of Callao on 2 May 1866, the  Navy withdrew from . The government of José Balta was lavish in infrastructure works (construction of the Central Railway) although the first signs of excess government spending were already perceived. By the 1870s the guano resources had been depleted, the country was heavily indebted, and political in-fighting was again on the rise.
[[File:Angamos2.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Battle of Angamos]], during the [[War of the Pacific]]]]
By 1859, some 41,000 Peruvians had died in the constant civil wars that shook the country since 1829. Thanks to the money from the sale of guano,  began to modernize with different public works such as railways; the civil and military bureaucracy grew; The indigenous people stopped paying tribute and the slaves achieved their freedom; The migration policy of Germans, Austrians,  and Italians began.

On 5 April 1879,  declared war on , unleashing the [[War of the Pacific]], which lasted until 1884. The casus belli was the confrontation between [[]] and  over a tax problem in which  was compromised by the Treaty of Defensive Alliance signed with  in 1873. However,  historiography is unanimous in maintaining that the deep cause of ''this'' war was 's ambition to take over the nitrate and guano territories of southern . In the first stage of the war, the naval campaign, the  navy repelled the  attack until 8 October 1879, the day in which the naval combat of Angamos was fought, where the  navy with its ships Cochrane, Blanco Encalada, Loa and Covadonga cornered the monitor [[Huáscar (ironclad)|Huáscar]], the main ship of the  navy commanded by Admiral AP Miguel Grau, who died in the fray and since then became 's greatest hero.

[[File:Batalla de Arica.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Arica]], painted by [[Juan Lepiani]]]]

Almost five years of war ended with the loss of the [[Tarapacá Department ()|department of Tarapacá]] and the provinces of [[Tacna Province|Tacna]] and [[Arica Province ()|Arica]], in the Atacama region. [[Francisco Bolognesi]] and [[Miguel Grau Seminario|Miguel Grau]] are both renowned heros of the war. Originally  committed to a referendum for the cities of Arica and Tacna to be held years later, to self determine their national affiliation. However,  refused to apply the Treaty, and neither of the countries could determine the statutory framework. The War of the Pacific was the bloodiest war  has fought in. After the War of the Pacific, an extraordinary effort of rebuilding began. The government started to initiate a number of social and economic reforms to recover from the damage of the war. Political stability was achieved only in the early 1900s.

=== 20th century ===
[[File:Protocolo de Río.jpg|thumb|upright|The signing of the [[Rio Protocol]] in January 1942]]
Internal struggles after the war were followed by a period of stability under the [[Civilista Party]], which lasted until the onset of the authoritarian regime of [[Augusto B. Leguía]]. The [[Great Depression]] caused the downfall of Leguía, renewed political turmoil, and the emergence of the [[ Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] (APRA). The rivalry between this organization and a coalition of the elite and the military defined  politics for the following three decades. A final peace treaty in 1929, signed between  and  called the [[Treaty of Lima (1929)|Treaty of Lima]], returned [[Tacna]] to . Between 1932 and 1933,  was engulfed in a [[Leticia Incident|year-long war with ]] over a territorial dispute involving the [[Amazonas ( department)|Amazonas Department]] and its capital [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]].

In 1941  and  fought the [[Ecuadorian– War]], after which the [[Rio Protocol]] sought to formalize the boundary between those two countries. In a military coup on 29 October 1948, General [[Manuel A. Odría]] became president. Odría's presidency was known as the {{lang|es|Ochenio}}. He came down hard on APRA, momentarily pleasing the oligarchy and all others on the right, but followed a [[Populism|populist]] course that won him great favor with the poor and lower classes. A thriving economy allowed him to indulge in expensive but crowd-pleasing social policies. At the same time, however, [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] were severely restricted and corruption was rampant throughout his regime. Odría was succeeded by [[Manuel Prado Ugarteche]]. However, widespread allegations of fraud prompted the  military to depose Prado and install a military junta, via a [[1962  coup d'état|coup d'état]] led by [[Ricardo Pérez Godoy]]. Godoy ran a short transitional government and held new elections in 1963, which were won by [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry]] who assumed presidency until 1968. Belaúnde was recognized for his commitment to the democratic process.

[[File:Junta Militar de 1968.jpg|thumb|left|Military Junta of 1968]]
On 3 October 1968 another [[1968  coup d'état|coup d'état]] led by a group of officers led by General [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] brought the army to power with the aim of applying a doctrine of "social progress and integral development", nationalist and reformist, influenced by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]] (UNECLAC) theses on dependence and underdevelopment. Six days after the golpe, Velasco proceeded to nationalize the ''International Petroleum Corporation'' (IPC), the North  company that exploited  oil, and then launched a reform of the state apparatus, an agrarian reform. It was the biggest agrarian reform ever undertaken in Latin America: it abolished the [[Latifundium|latifunda]] system and modernized agriculture through a more equitable redistribution of land (90% of the peasants formed cooperatives or agricultural societies of social interest). Land was to be owned by those who cultivated it, and large landowners were expropriated. The only large properties allowed were cooperatives. 

Between 1969 and 1976, 325,000 families received land from the state with an average size of {{convert|73.6|acre|hectare}}. The "revolutionary government" also planned massive investments in education, elevated the [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] language – spoken by nearly half the population but hitherto despised by the authorities – to a status equivalent to that of  and established equal rights for natural children.  wished to free itself from any dependence and carried out a third-world foreign policy. The [[]] responded with commercial, economic and diplomatic pressure. In 1973  seemed to triumph over the financial blockade imposed by Washington by negotiating a loan from the International Development Bank to finance its agricultural and mining development policy. The relations with  became very tense after the coup d'état of the [[general Pinochet]]. General [[Edgardo Mercado Jarrín|Edgardo Mercado Jarrin]] (Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Army) and Admiral Guillermo Faura Gaig (Minister of the Navy) both escaped assassination attempts within weeks of each other. In 1975 General [[Francisco Morales Bermúdez Cerruti]] seized power and broke with the policies of his predecessor. His regime occasionally participated in [[Operation Condor]] in collaboration with other  military dictatorships.

President [[Alan García]]'s economic policies distanced  from international markets further, resulting in lower foreign investment in the country. After the country experienced [[chronic inflation]], in mid-1985, the  [[ sol (1863–1985)|sol]] was replaced by the [[ inti|inti]], which itself was replaced by the [[ sol|nuevo sol]] in July 1991 (the new sol had a cumulative value of one billion old soles). At the end of the 1980s, the per capita annual income of Peruvians fell to $720 (below the level of 1960) and 's GDP dropped 20%, with national reserves running a $900 million deficit. The economic turbulence of the time acerbated social tensions in  and partly contributed to the rise of violent rebel rural insurgent movements, like [[Shining Path|Sendero Luminoso]] (Shining Path) and [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]], which caused [[Internal conflict in |great havoc]] throughout the country.

[[File:Alberto Fujimori en 1991.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|President [[Alberto Fujimori]] during his first term]]
The  armed forces, frustrated with the inability of the García administration to handle the nation's crises, drafted the {{lang|es|Plan Verde}}, which involved the genocide of impoverished and indigenous Peruvians, the control or censorship of the [[media in ]], and the establishment of a [[neoliberal]] economy controlled by a [[military junta]]. [[Alberto Fujimori]] assumed the presidency in 1990 and, according to the head of the [[National Intelligence Service ()|National Intelligence Service (SIN)]] Rospigliosi, an understanding was established between Fujimori, [[Vladimiro Montesinos]], and some of the military officers involved in {{lang|es|Plan Verde}} to abide by the military's demands prior to Fujimori's inauguration. Fujimori would go on to adopt many of the policies outlined in {{lang|es|Plan Verde}}, which led to a precitious drop in inflation from 7,650% at the start of 1990 to 139% in 1991 and 57% in 1992. When Fujimori faced opposition to his reform efforts, he dissolved Congress, suspending the judiciary, arresting several opposition leaders and assuming full powers in the ''[[Self-coup|auto-golpe]]'' ("self-coup") of 5 April 1992. He then revised the constitution, called new congressional elections, and implemented substantial economic reform, including privatization of numerous state-owned companies, creation of an investment-friendly climate, and sound management of the economy. Nonetheless, these policies did not benefit the poorest much, and inequality persisted despite Fujimori's economic achievements.

Fujimori's administration was dogged by [[Insurgency|insurgent]] groups, most notably Shining Path, which carried out attacks across the country throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Fujimori cracked down on the insurgents and was successful in largely quelling them by the late 1990s, but the fight was marred by atrocities committed by both the  security forces and the insurgents: the [[Barrios Altos massacre]] and [[La Cantuta massacre]] by Government paramilitary groups, and the bombings of [[Tarata bombing|Tarata]] and [[Frecuencia Latina bombing|Frecuencia Latina]] by Sendero Luminoso. Fujimori would also broaden the definition of terrorism in an effort to criminalize as many actions possible to persecute left-wing political opponents. Using the {{lang|es|[[terruqueo]]}}, a [[fearmongering]] tactic that was used to accuse opponents of terrorism, Fujimori established a [[cult of personality]] by portraying himself as a hero and made left-wing ideologies an eternal enemy in . Those incidents subsequently came to symbolize the [[Human rights in |human rights]] violations committed in the last years of violence. His ''[[Programa Nacional de Población]]'', 'National Population Program' also resulted with the [[forced sterilization]] of at least 300,000 poor and indigenous women.

In early 1995, once again  and  clashed in the [[Cenepa War]], but in 1998 the governments of both nations signed a peace treaty that clearly demarcated the international boundary between them. In November 2000, Fujimori resigned from office and went into a self-imposed exile, initially avoiding prosecution for human rights violations and corruption charges by the new  authorities.

 tried to fight corruption while sustaining economic growth at the start of the 21st century, though [[Fujimorism]] held power over much of  society through maintaining control of institutions and legislation created in the 1993 constitution, which was written by Fujimori and his supporters without opposition participation. In spite of human rights progress since the time of insurgency, many problems are still visible and show the continued marginalization of those who suffered through the violence of the  conflict. A caretaker government presided over by [[Valentín Paniagua]] took on the responsibility of conducting new presidential and congressional elections. Afterwards [[Alejandro Toledo]] became president in 2001 to 2006. On 28 July 2006, former president [[Alan García]] became President of  after winning the [[2006  general election|2006 elections]]. In 2006, Alberto Fujimori's daughter, [[Keiko Fujimori]], entered 's political arena to continue her father's legacy and espouse Fujimorism. In May 2008,  became a member of the [[Union of South  Nations]]. In April 2009, former president [[Alberto Fujimori]] was convicted of human rights violations and [[Alberto Fujimori's arrest and trial|sentenced]] to 25 years in prison for his role in killings and kidnappings by the [[Grupo Colina]] [[death squad]] during his government's battle against leftist guerrillas in the 1990s.

During the presidencies of [[Ollanta Humala]], [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]] and [[Martín Vizcarra]], the right-wing Congress led by Keiko Fujimori obstructed much of the actions performed by the presidents. On 5 June 2011, [[Ollanta Humala]] was elected president, with his cabinet being [[Motion of no confidence|successfully censured]] by the Fujimorist Congress. Beginning with [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]], Congress used [[Vacancy due to moral incapacity ()|broadly interpreted]] [[impeachment]] wording in the 1993 Constitution of  that allowed impeachment of the president without cause to place pressure on the president, forcing him to [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski#Resignation|resign]] in 2018 amid various controversies surrounding his administration. Vice president [[Martín Vizcarra]] then assumed office in March 2018 with generally favorable approval ratings as he led the anti-corruption [[2018  constitutional referendum|constitutional referendum]] movement. 

The [[COVID-19 pandemic in |COVID-19 pandemic]] resulted with  experiencing the highest death rate from COVID-19 in the world, exposing much of the inequality that persisted since the Fujimori administration and triggering an economic crisis that led to [[Removal of Martín Vizcarra|Vizcara's removal from the presidency by Congress]]. Widely seen as a coup by Congress, its head, the newly seated President [[Manuel Merino]], faced [[2020  protests|protests]] across the country, and after five days, Merino resigned from the presidency. Merino was replaced by President [[Francisco Sagasti]], who led a provisional, centrist government, and enforced many of Vizcarra's former policies. [[2021  general election|Elections]] were held on 11 April 2021, and [[Pedro Castillo]] of the [[Free ]] party won the first round, followed closely by Keiko Fujimori, with right-wing parties allied with Fujimori maintaining positions in Congress.

[[File:Protestas Lima Diciembre 2022 (3).jpg|thumb|Demonstrations in Lima during the [[2022–2023  political protests]]]]
On 28 July 2021, Pedro Castillo was sworn in as the new [[president of ]] after a narrow win in a tightly contested run-off election. That same year,  celebrated the [[Bicentennial of the Independence of |bicentenary of independence]]. Castillo [[Pedro Castillo#Removal attempts|faced multiple impeachment votes]] during his presidency from the right-wing controlled Congress and on 7 December 2022, just hours before Congress was set to begin a [[Third impeachment and removal of Pedro Castillo|third impeachment effort]], Castillo tried to prevent this by attempting to [[2022  self-coup d'état attempt|dissolve]] the opposition-controlled legislature and create an "exceptional emergency government." In response, Congress quickly held an emergency session on the same day, during which it voted 101–6 (with 10 abstentions) to remove Castillo from office and replace him with Vice President [[Dina Boluarte]].
