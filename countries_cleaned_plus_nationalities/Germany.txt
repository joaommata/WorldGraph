Ancient humans were present in  at least 600,000 years ago. The first non-modern human fossil (the [[Neanderthal]]) was discovered in the [[Neandertal (valley)|Neander Valley]]. Similarly dated evidence of modern humans has been found in the [[Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura|Swabian Jura]], including 42,000-year-old [[Paleolithic flute|flutes]] which are the oldest musical instruments ever found, the 40,000-year-old [[Lion-man|Lion Man]], and the 41,000-year-old [[Venus of Hohle Fels]].

=== Germanic tribes, Roman frontier and the Frankish Empire ===

[[File:Trier 012.JPG|thumb|[[Aula Palatina|Basilica of Constantine]] in [[Trier]] (''[[Augusta Treverorum]]''), built in the 4th century]]
The [[Germanic peoples]] are thought to have [[Ethnogenesis|emerged]] from the [[Jastorf culture]] during the [[ Bronze Age]] or early [[Pre-Roman Iron Age|Iron Age]]. From southern [[Scandinavia]] and [[northern ]], they expanded south, east, and west, coming into contact with the [[Celts|Celtic]], [[ peoples|]], [[Balts|Baltic]], and [[Early Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. Southern  was inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, who belonged to the wider [[La Tène culture]]. They were later assimilated by the Germanic conquerors.

Under [[Augustus]], the [[Roman Empire]] began to invade lands inhabited by the Germanic tribes, creating a short-lived Roman province of [[Germania Antiqua|Germania]] between the Rhine and [[Elbe]] rivers. In 9 AD, three [[Roman legion]]s were [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|defeated]] by [[Arminius]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. The outcome of this battle dissuaded the Romans from their ambition of conquering [[Germania]] and is thus considered one of the most important events in [[European history]].{{sfn|Murdoch|2004|p=57}} By 100 AD, when [[Tacitus]] wrote ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the [[Limes Germanicus]]), occupying most of modern . However, [[Baden Württemberg|Baden-Württemberg]], southern [[Bavaria]], southern [[Hesse]] and the western [[Rhineland]] had [[Germanic Wars|been incorporated]] into [[Roman province]]s.{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp=9–13}}

Around 260, Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands. After the invasion of the [[Huns]] in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest: the Franks established the [[Frankish Kingdom]] and pushed east to subjugate [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. Areas of modern eastern  were inhabited by [[West Slavs|Western Slavic]] tribes.{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp=9–13}}

[[Charlemagne]] founded the [[Carolingian Empire]] in 800; it was [[Treaty of Verdun|divided in 843]].{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|p= 11}} The eastern successor kingdom of [[East Francia]] stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe river in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps.{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|p= 11}} Subsequently, the Holy Roman Empire emerged from it. The [[Ottonian]] rulers (919–1024) consolidated several major [[Stem duchy|duchies]]. In 996, [[Pope Gregory V|Gregory V]] became the first  Pope, appointed by his cousin [[Otto III]], whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern  and [[Burgundy (historical region)|Burgundy]] under the [[Salian]] emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the [[Investiture Controversy]].

Under the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors (1138–1254),  princes encouraged  settlement to the south and east ({{lang|de|[[Ostsiedlung]]}}).{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp= 19–20}} Members of the [[Hanseatic League]], mostly north  towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp= 13–24}} The population declined starting with the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|Great Famine]] in 1315, followed by the [[Black Death]] of 1348–1350. The [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]] issued in 1356 provided the constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven [[prince-elector]]s.{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|p= 27}}

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, laying the basis for the [[democratization of knowledge|democratisation of knowledge]]. In 1517, [[Martin Luther]] incited the Protestant Reformation and [[Luther Bible|his translation of the Bible]] began the standardisation of the language; the 1555 [[Peace of Augsburg]] tolerated the "Evangelical" faith ([[Lutheranism]]), but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects ({{lang|la|[[cuius regio, eius religio]]}}). From the [[Cologne War]] through the [[Thirty Years' War]]s (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated  lands and significantly reduced the population.

The [[Peace of Westphalia]] ended religious warfare among the [[Imperial Estate]]s. The legal system initiated by a series of [[Imperial Reform]]s (approximately 1495–1555) provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]. The [[House of Habsburg]] held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] in 1740. Following the [[War of the  Succession]] and the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], Charles VI's daughter [[Maria Theresa]] ruled as [[Queen consort|empress consort]] when her husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], became emperor.

From 1740, [[ dualism|dualism]] between the  [[Habsburg monarchy]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] dominated  history. In 1772, 1793, and 1795, Prussia and , along with the [[ Empire]], agreed to the [[Partitions of ]]. During the period of the [[ Revolutionary Wars]], the [[Napoleonic era]] and the subsequent [[Final Recess of the Reichsdeputation|final meeting of the Imperial Diet]], most of the [[Free Imperial Cities]] were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the {{lang|de|Imperium}} was dissolved; , , Prussia, and the Habsburgs () competed for hegemony in the  states during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|p= 97}}

===  Confederation and Empire ===
{{Main| question| Confederation|Unification of | Empire| colonial empire}}

[[File: Confederation (1815).svg|thumb|The  Confederation in 1815]]
Following the fall of [[Napoleon]], the [[Congress of Vienna]] founded the  Confederation, a loose league of [[States of the  Confederation|39 sovereign states]]. The appointment of the [[emperor of ]] as the permanent president reflected the Congress's rejection of [[Prussia]]'s rising influence. Disagreement within [[Concert of Europe|restoration]] politics partly led to the rise of [[Liberalism in |liberal]] movements, followed by new measures of repression by  statesman [[Klemens von Metternich]]. The {{lang|de|[[Zollverein]]}}, a tariff union, furthered economic unity. In light of [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movements in Europe]], intellectuals and commoners started the [[ revolutions of 1848–1849|revolutions of 1848 in the  states]], raising the  question. King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] was offered the title of emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, a temporary setback for the movement.

[[File:Berlin Nationaldenkmal Kaiser Wilhelm mit Schloss 1900.jpg|thumb|right|[[Berlin Palace]], the main residence of the Kings of Prussia and  Emperors]]
King [[William I,  Emperor|William I]] appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]] as the [[Minister President of Prussia]] in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded the [[Second Schleswig War|war with  in 1864]]; the subsequent decisive Prussian victory in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866 enabled him to create the [[North  Confederation]] which excluded [[ Empire|]]. After the defeat of  in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the  princes proclaimed the founding of the  Empire in 1871. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the King of Prussia ruled as its [[ Emperor|Emperor]] ({{lang|de|Kaiser}}), and Berlin became its capital.

In the {{lang|de|[[Gründerzeit]]}} period following the unification of , Bismarck's foreign policy as [[chancellor of ]] secured 's position as a great nation by forging alliances and avoiding war. However, under [[Wilhelm II]],  took an [[New Imperialism|imperialistic]] course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries. [[Dual Alliance (1879)|A dual alliance]] was created with the [[multinational state|multinational realm]] of [[-]]; the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance of 1882]] included . Britain,  and  also concluded alliances to protect against Habsburg interference with  interests in the Balkans or  interference against .{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp= 135, 149}} At the [[Berlin Conference]] in 1884,  claimed several [[List of former  colonies|colonies]] including [[ East Africa]], [[ South West Africa]], [[Togoland]], and [[Kamerun]]. Later,  further expanded its colonial empire to include holdings in the Pacific and [[]]. The colonial government in South West Africa (present-day [[]]), from 1904 to 1908, carried out the [[Herero and Nama genocide|annihilation of the local Herero and Nama peoples]] as punishment for an uprising; this was the 20th century's first [[genocide]].

[[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of |The assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of |'s crown prince]] on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for - to attack  and trigger [[World War I]]. After four years of warfare, in which approximately two million  soldiers were killed, [[Armistice with |a general armistice]] ended the fighting. In the [[ Revolution of 1918–1919| Revolution]] (November 1918), Wilhelm II and the ruling princes [[abdication|abdicated]] their positions, and  was declared a [[federal republic]]. 's new leadership signed the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919, accepting defeat by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating, which was seen by historians as influential in the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]].  lost around 13% of its European territory and ceded all of its colonial possessions.

A [[Dawes Plan|plan to restructure 's war reparations]] and the creation of [[ Rentenmark|a new currency]] in 1924 helped stabilise the government and ushered in the [[Golden Twenties]], an era of artistic innovation and liberal cultural life.

The worldwide [[Great Depression]] hit  in 1929, and by 1932 the unemployment rate had risen to 24%. The [[Nazi Party]] led by Adolf Hitler became the largest party in the Reichstag after the [[July 1932  federal election|election of July 1932]], and [[President Hindenburg]] appointed Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933.{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp=155–158, 172–177}} After the [[Reichstag fire]], [[Reichstag Fire Decree|a decree]] abrogated basic [[civil rights]], and the first [[Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]] opened. On 23 March 1933, the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power, overriding the constitution, and marked the beginning of Nazi . His government established a centralised [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian state]], [[1933  referendum|withdrew from the League of Nations]], and dramatically increased the [[ re-armament|country's rearmament]]. A government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works, the most famous of which was the {{lang|de|[[Reichsautobahn|Autobahn]]}}.

In 1935, the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the [[Nuremberg Laws]] which targeted [[Jews]] and other [[Minority group|minorities]].  also reacquired control of the [[Territory of the Saar Basin|Saarland]] in 1935,{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp=188–189}} [[remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarised the Rhineland]] in 1936, [[Anschluss|annexed]]  in 1938, [[Sudetenland#Sudetenland as part of Nazi |annexed]] the Sudetenland in 1938 with the [[Munich Agreement]], and, in violation of the agreement, [[ occupation of Czechoslovakia|occupied Czechoslovakia]] in March 1939. {{lang|de|[[Kristallnacht]]}} (Night of Broken Glass) saw the burning of synagogues, the destruction of Jewish businesses, and mass arrests of Jewish people.

Following the end of the war, surviving Nazi officials were tried for [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht|war crimes]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]].

In what later became known as [[the Holocaust]], the  government persecuted [[Holocaust victims|minorities]], including interning them in concentration and [[Extermination camp|death camps]] across Europe.

=== East and West  ===
{{Main|History of  (1945–1990)|Allied-occupied |West |East }}

[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|The [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989 was one of the first developments in the end of the [[Cold War]], leading ultimately to the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]].]]

After the surrender of Nazi , the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] ''[[de jure]]'' [[Berlin Declaration (1945)|abolished the  state]] and partitioned Berlin and 's remaining territory into four occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by , the [[]], and the [[]], were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of  (FRG) ({{langx|de|Bundesrepublik Deutschland}}); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the  Democratic Republic (GDR) ({{lang|de|Deutsche Demokratische Republik}}; DDR). They were informally known as West  and East . East  selected [[East Berlin]] as its capital, while West  chose [[Bonn]] as a provisional capital to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was temporary.

West  was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a [[social market economy]]. In 1948, West  became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the  [[Marshall Plan]]. [[Konrad Adenauer]] was elected the first [[Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of |federal chancellor of ]] in 1949. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth ({{lang|de|[[Wirtschaftswunder]]}}) beginning in the early 1950s. West  joined [[NATO]] in 1955 and was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]]. On 1 January 1957, the [[Saar Protectorate|Saarland]] joined West .

East  was an [[Eastern Bloc]] state under political and military control by the [[Soviet Union]] via occupation forces and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Although East  claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members ({{lang|de|[[Politburo|Politbüro]]}}) of the communist-controlled [[Socialist Unity Party of ]], supported by the {{lang|de|[[Stasi]]|italic=no}}, an immense secret service. While [[Communist propaganda|East  propaganda]] was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged threat of a West  invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity. The [[Berlin Wall]], built in 1961, prevented East  citizens from escaping to West , becoming a symbol of the [[Cold War]].

Tensions between East and West  were reduced in the late 1960s by Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]'s {{lang|de|[[Ostpolitik]]}}. In 1989,  decided to dismantle the [[Iron Curtain]] and [[Removal of 's border fence with |open its border with ]], causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West  via  and . This had devastating effects on the GDR, where [[Monday demonstrations in East |regular mass demonstrations]] received increasing support. In an effort to help retain East  as a state, the East  authorities eased border restrictions, but this actually led to an acceleration of the {{lang|de|Wende}} reform process, culminating in the ''[[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to |Two Plus Four Treaty]]'' under which  regained full sovereignty. This permitted [[ reunification]] on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the [[New states of |five re-established states]] of the former GDR. The [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989 became a symbol of the [[fall of Communism]], the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]],  reunification and {{lang|de|[[Die Wende]]}} ("the turning point").
