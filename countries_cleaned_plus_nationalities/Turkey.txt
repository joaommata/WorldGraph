Present-day  has been inhabited by [[Human|modern humans]] since the [[Upper Paleolithic|late Paleolithic]] period and contains some of the world's oldest [[Neolithic]] sites. [[Göbekli Tepe]] is close to 12,000 years old. Parts of [[]] include the [[Fertile Crescent]], an [[Neolithic Revolution|origin of agriculture]]. Other important Anatolian Neolithic sites include [[Çatalhöyük]] and [[Alaca Höyük]]. Neolithic Anatolian farmers differed genetically from farmers in [[]] and [[ Valley]]. These early Anatolian farmers also [[Early European Farmers|migrated into Europe]], starting around 9,000 years ago. [[Troy]]'s earliest layers go back to around 4500 BC.

's historical records start with [[clay tablets]] from approximately around 2000 BC that were found in modern-day [[Kültepe]]. These tablets belonged to an [[Karum (trade post)|Assyrian trade colony]]. The languages in  at that time included Hattian, Hurrian, [[Hittite language|Hittite]], [[Luwian language|Luwian]], and [[Palaic language|Palaic]]. [[Hattic language|Hattian]] was a language indigenous to , with no known modern-day connections. [[Hurrian language]] was used in northern [[]]. Hittite, Palaic, and Luwian languages were "the oldest written [[Indo-European languages]]", forming the [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian sub-group]].{{efn|The origin of Indo-European languages is unknown. [[Anatolian hypothesis|They may be native to ]] or non-native.}}

[[Hattians|Hattian]] rulers were gradually replaced by [[Hittites|Hittite]] rulers. The Hittite kingdom was a large kingdom in Central , with its capital of [[Hattusa]]. It co-existed in  with [[Pala ()|Palaians]] and [[Luwians]], approximately between 1700 and 1200 BC. As the Hittite kingdom was disintegrating, further waves of Indo-European peoples migrated from southeastern Europe, which was followed by warfare. The [[Thracians]] were also present in modern-day [[ Thrace]]. It is not known if the [[Trojan War]] is based on historical events.

Around 750 BC, [[Phrygia]] had been established, with its two centers in [[Gordium]] and modern-day [[Kayseri]]. [[Phrygians]] spoke an Indo-European language, which was closer to [[ language|]] than Anatolian languages. Phrygians shared  with [[Neo-Hittite states|Neo-Hittites]] and [[Urartu]]. Luwian-speakers were probably the majority in various Anatolian Neo-Hittite states. Urartians spoke a non-Indo-European language and their capital was around [[Lake Van]]. Urartu and Phrygia fell in seventh century BC. They were replaced by [[Carians]], [[Lycians]] and [[Lydians]]. These three cultures "can be considered a reassertion of the ancient, indigenous culture of the Hattian cities of ".

Before 1200 BC, there were four -speaking settlements in , including [[Miletus]]. Around 1000 BC, [[Iron Age  migrations| started migrating]] to the west coast of . These eastern  settlements played a vital role in shaping the Archaic  civilization; important [[polis|cities]] included [[Miletus]], [[Ephesus]], [[Halicarnassus]], [[Smyrna]] (now [[İzmir]]) and [[Byzantium]] (now [[Istanbul]]), the latter founded by colonists from [[Megara]] in the seventh century BCE. These settlements were grouped as [[Aeolis]], [[Ionia]], and [[Doric hexapolis|Doris]], after the specific  groups that settled them. Further  colonization in  was led by Miletus and [[Megara]] in 750–480 BC. The  cities along the Aegean prospered with trade, and saw remarkable scientific and scholarly accomplishments. [[Thales of Miletus|Thales]] and [[Anaximander]] from Miletus founded the [[Ionian school (philosophy)|Ionian School of philosophy]], thereby laying the foundations of [[rationalism]] and [[Western philosophy]].

[[File:Ephesus_Celsus_Library_Façade.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Library of Celsus]] in [[Ephesus]] was built by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 114–117.]]

[[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] attacked eastern  in 547 BC, and [[Achaemenid Empire]] eventually [[Siege of Sardis (547 BC)|expanded into western ]]. In the east, the [[Satrapy of | province]] was part of the Achaemenid Empire. Following the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], the  city-states of the Anatolian Aegean coast regained independence, but most of the interior stayed part of the Achaemenid Empire. Two of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], the [[Temple of Artemis]] in Ephesus, and the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], were located in .

Following the victories of Alexander in [[Battle of the Granicus|334 BC]] and [[Battle of Issus|333 BC]], the Achaemenid Empire collapsed and  became part of the [[Macedon| Empire]]. This led to increasing cultural homogeneity and [[Hellenization]] of the Anatolian interior, which met resistance in some places. Following Alexander's death, the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] ruled large parts of , while native Anatolian states emerged in the Marmara and Black Sea areas. In eastern , [[Kingdom of  (antiquity)|the kingdom of ]] appeared. In third century BC, [[Celts]] invaded central  and continued as a major ethnic group in the area for around 200 years. They were known as the [[Galatians (people)|Galatians]].

[[File:Justinian555AD.png|thumb|The [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]] in 555 under [[Justinian the Great]], at its greatest extent]]
When [[Kingdom of Pergamon|Pergamon]] requested assistance in its conflict with the Seleucids, [[Roman Republic|Rome]] intervened in  in the second century BC. Without an heir, Pergamum's king left the kingdom to Rome, which was annexed as [[Asia (Roman province)|province of Asia]]. Roman influence grew in  afterwards. Following [[Asiatic Vespers]] massacre, and [[Mithridatic Wars]] with [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]], Rome emerged victorious. Around the 1st century BC, [[Roman province|Rome expanded into parts of Pontus and Bithynia]], while turning rest of Anatolian states into Roman satellites. Several [[Roman–Parthian Wars|conflicts with Parthians ensued]], with peace and wars alternating.

According to [[Acts of the Apostles]], early Christian Church had significant growth in  because of [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]]'s efforts. Letters from St. Paul in  comprise the [[Early Christianity|oldest Christian literature]]. Under Roman authority, [[ecumenical councils]] such as [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea (Iznik)]] in 325 served as a guide for developing "orthodox expressions of basic Christian teachings".

[[File:Aya_Sophia_(7144824757).jpg|thumb|The [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]) was built by the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] emperor [[Justinian the Great]] in 532–537.]]
The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the [[Roman Empire]] centered in [[Constantinople]] during [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]]. The eastern half of the Empire survived the conditions that caused the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of the West]] in the 5th century AD, and continued to exist until the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire remained the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in the [[Mediterranean world]]. The term ''Byzantine Empire'' was only coined following the empire's demise; its citizens referred to the polity as the "Roman Empire" and to themselves as ''Romans''. Due to the imperial seat's move from Rome to [[Byzantium]], the [[Christianity as the Roman state religion|adoption of Christianity as the state religion]], and the predominance of [[Medieval |]] instead of [[Latin]], modern historians continue to make a distinction between the earlier ''Roman Empire'' and the later ''Byzantine Empire''.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

In the early Byzantine Empire period, the Anatolian coastal areas were  speaking. In addition to natives, interior  had diverse groups such as [[Goths]], [[Celts]], [[Persians]] and [[History of the Jews in the Byzantine Empire|Jews]]. Interior  had been "heavily Hellenized". [[Anatolian languages]] eventually became extinct after [[Hellenization]] of .

According to historians and linguists, the [[Proto-Turkic language]] originated in Central-East Asia. Initially, Proto-[[Turkic languages|Turkic speakers]] were potentially both hunter-gatherers and farmers; they later became [[nomadic]] [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]]. Early and medieval [[Turkic peoples|Turkic groups]] exhibited a wide range of both East Asian and West-Eurasian physical appearances and genetic origins, in part through long-term contact with neighboring peoples such as [[ peoples|Iranic]], [[Mongolic peoples|Mongolic]], [[Tocharians|Tocharian]], [[Uralic people|Uralic]], and [[Yeniseian people|Yeniseian]] peoples. During the 9th and 10th centuries CE, [[Oghuz Turks|the Oghuz]] were a Turkic group that lived in the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe|Caspian]] and [[Aral Sea|Aral]] steppes. Partly due to pressure from the [[Kipchaks]], the Oghuz migrated into [[ Plateau|]] and [[Transoxiana]]. They mixed with Iranic-speaking groups in the area and converted to [[Islam]]. Oghuz Turks were also known as  or [[Turkoman (ethnonym)|Turkoman]].

The ruling family of [[Seljuq dynasty|the Seljuks]] originated from the ''[[Kınık (tribe)|Kınık]]'' branch of the Oghuz Turks. In 1040, the Seljuks defeated the [[Ghaznavids]] at the [[Battle of Dandanaqan]] and established the [[Seljuk Empire]] in [[Greater Khorasan]]. [[Baghdad]], the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]'s capital and center of [[Islamic Golden Age|the Islamic world]], was taken by Seljuks in 1055. Given the role [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasani]] traditions played in art, culture, and political traditions in the empire, the Seljuk period is described as a mixture of "[[Turko-Persian tradition|, Persian and Islamic influences]]". In the latter half of the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks began penetrating into [[medieval ]] and . At the time,  was a diverse and largely -speaking region after previously being [[Hellenization|Hellenized]].

The Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantines at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, and later established [[Sultanate of Rum|the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]]. During this period, there were also [[Anatolian beyliks| principalities]] such as [[Danishmendids]]. Seljuk arrival started the [[Turkification]] process in ; there were Turkic/ migrations, intermarriages, and conversions into Islam. The shift took several centuries and happened gradually. Members of [[Mysticism#Islamic mysticism|Islamic mysticism]] orders, such as [[Mevlevi Order]], played a role in the [[Islamization]] of the diverse people of . Seljuk expansion was one of the reasons for the [[Crusades]]. In 13th century, there was a second significant wave of Turkic migration, as people fled [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] expansion. Seljuk sultanate was defeated by the Mongols at the [[Battle of Köse Dağ]] in 1243 and disappeared by the beginning of the 14th century. It was replaced by various  principalities.

Based around [[Söğüt]], [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Beylik]] was founded by [[Osman I]] in the early 14th century. According to Ottoman chroniclers, Osman descended from the ''[[Kayı (tribe)|Kayı]]'' tribe of the [[Oghuz Turks]]. Ottomans started annexing the nearby  beyliks (principalities) in  and expanded into the [[Balkans]]. [[Mehmed II]] completed Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire by [[Fall of Constantinople|capturing its capital, Constantinople]], on 29 May 1453. [[Selim I]] united  under Ottoman rule. Turkification continued as Ottomans mixed with various indigenous people in  and the Balkans.

The Ottoman Empire was a global power during the reigns of [[Selim I]] and [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. In the 16th and 17th centuries, [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire|Sephardic Jews]] moved into Ottoman Empire following their [[Reconquista#Conversions and expulsions|expulsion]] from . From the second half of the 18th century onwards, the [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire began to decline]]. The [[Tanzimat]] reforms, initiated by [[Mahmud II]] in 1839, aimed to modernize the Ottoman state in line with the progress that had been made in Western Europe. The [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]] was the first among Muslim states, but was [[First Constitutional Era|short-lived]].

As the empire gradually shrank in size, military power and wealth; especially after the [[Great Eastern Crisis|Ottoman economic crisis and default]] in 1875 which led to uprisings in the Balkan provinces that culminated in the [[Russo- War (1877–1878)]]. The decline of the Ottoman Empire led to a [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|rise in nationalist sentiment among its various subject peoples]], leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence, such as the [[Hamidian massacres]] of [[ in the Ottoman Empire|]], which claimed up to 300,000 lives.{{Better source needed|reason=some of this information is not in the source|date=November 2024}} Ottoman territories in Europe ([[Rumelia]]) were lost in the [[First Balkan War]] (1912–1913). Ottomans managed to recover some territory in Europe, such as [[Edirne]], in the [[Second Balkan War]] (1913).

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, [[persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction]] and [[Persecution of Muslims# Empire|in the  Empire]] resulted in estimated 5 million deaths, with the casualties including Turks. Five to seven or seven to nine million [[Muhacir|refugees]] migrated into modern-day  from the [[Balkans]], [[Caucasus]], [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea]], and [[Mediterranean]] islands, shifting the center of the Ottoman Empire to . In addition to a small number of Jews, the refugees were overwhelmingly Muslim; they were both  and non- people, such as [[Circassians]] and [[Crimean Tatars]]. [[Paul Mojzes]] has called the Balkan Wars an "unrecognized genocide", where multiple sides were both victims and perpetrators. Circassian refugees included the survivors of the [[Circassian genocide]].

Following the [[1913 Ottoman coup d'état|1913 coup d'état]], the [[Three Pashas]] took control of the Ottoman government. The Ottoman Empire entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and was ultimately defeated. During the war, the empire's  subjects were [[Temporary Law of Deportation|deported to ]] as part of the [[ genocide]]. As a result, an estimated 600,000 to more than 1 million, or up to 1.5 million [[ in the Ottoman Empire|]] were killed. The  government has [[ genocide denial|refused to acknowledge]] the events as genocide and states that  were only [[Population transfer|"relocated]]" from the eastern war zone. [[Late Ottoman genocides|Genocidal campaigns]] were also committed against the empire's other minority groups such as the [[Assyrian genocide|Assyrians]] and [[ genocide|]]. Following the [[Armistice of Mudros]] in 1918, the victorious [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] sought the [[partition of the Ottoman Empire]] through the 1920 [[Treaty of Sèvres]].

[[File:Atatürk şapkasıyla selam verirken.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], the [[List of national founders|founder]] and the [[List of presidents of |first President]] of the  Republic]]
The [[occupation of Istanbul]] (1918) and [[Occupation of Smyrna|İzmir]] (1919) by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in the aftermath of World War I initiated the [[ National Movement]]. Under the leadership of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal Pasha]], a military commander who had distinguished himself during the [[Gallipoli campaign|Battle of Gallipoli]], the [[ War of Independence]] (1919–1923) was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] (1920).

The [[Government of the Grand National Assembly| Provisional Government]] in [[Ankara]], which had declared itself the legitimate government of the country on [[Grand National Assembly of |23 April 1920]], started to formalize the legal transition from the old Ottoman into the new Republican political system. The Ankara Government engaged in armed and diplomatic struggle. In 1921–1923, the , , , and  armies had been expelled. The military advance and diplomatic success of the Ankara Government resulted in the signing of the [[Armistice of Mudanya]] on 11 October 1922. On 1 November 1922, the  Parliament in Ankara formally abolished the Sultanate, thus ending 623 years of [[monarchy|monarchical]] Ottoman rule.

The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] of 24 July 1923, which superseded the Treaty of Sèvres, led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the new  state as the successor state of the Ottoman Empire. On 4 October 1923, the Allied occupation of  ended with the withdrawal of the last Allied troops from [[Occupation of Istanbul|Istanbul]]. The  Republic [[Proclamation of the Republic of |was officially proclaimed]] on 29 October 1923 in Ankara, the country's new capital.

Mustafa Kemal became the republic's first [[President of |president]] and introduced [[Atatürk's reforms|many reforms]]. The reforms aimed to transform the old [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|religion-based and multi-communal]] Ottoman monarchy into a  [[nation state]] that would be governed as a [[parliamentary republic]] under a [[ Constitution of 1924|secular constitution]]. Women gained the right to vote nationally in 1934. With the [[Surname Law ()|Surname Law]], the [[Grand National Assembly of | Parliament]] bestowed upon Kemal the honorific surname "Atatürk" (''Father Turk''). Atatürk's reforms caused discontent in some [[Kurds|Kurdish]] and [[Zazas|Zaza]] tribes leading to the [[Sheikh Said rebellion]] in 1925 and the [[Dersim rebellion]] in 1937.

[[İsmet İnönü]] became the country's second president following Atatürk's death in 1938. In 1939, the [[Hatay State|Republic of Hatay]] voted in favor of joining  with a referendum.
