===Etymology===
The name of the country is derived from the [[Namib]] desert, the oldest desert in the world. The word ''Namib'' itself is of [[Khoikhoi language|Khoi]] origin and means "vast place". The name was chosen by [[Mburumba Kerina]], who originally proposed "Republic of Namib". Before  became independent in 1990, its territory was known first as [[ South-West Africa]] (''Deutsch-Südwestafrika''), and then as [[South West Africa]], reflecting its colonial occupation by  and , respectively.

===Pre-colonial period===
The dry lands of  have been inhabited since prehistoric times by the [[San people|San]], [[Damara people|Damara]], and [[Nama people|Nama]]. For thousands of years, the [[Khoisan]] peoples of Southern Africa maintained a [[nomad]]ic life, the [[Khoikhoi]] as pastoralists and the San people as [[hunter-gatherer]]s. Around the 14th century, immigrating [[Bantu people]] began to arrive during the [[Bantu expansion]] from central Africa.

From the late 18th century onward, [[Oorlam people]] from Cape Colony crossed the [[Orange River]] and moved into the area that today is southern . Their encounters with the nomadic Nama tribes were largely peaceful. They received the missionaries accompanying the Oorlam very well, granting them the right to use waterholes and grazing against an annual payment.{{sfn|Vedder|1997|p=177}} On their way further north, however, the Oorlam encountered clans of the [[OvaHerero people|OvaHerero]] at Windhoek, [[Gobabis]], and [[Okahandja]], who resisted their encroachment. The Nama-Herero War broke out in 1880, with hostilities ebbing only after the [[ Empire]] deployed troops to the contested places and cemented the status quo among the Nama, Oorlam, and Herero.{{sfn|Vedder|1997|p=659}}

In 1878, the [[Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]], then a  colony, annexed the port of Walvis Bay and the offshore [[Penguin Islands]]; these became an integral part of the new [[Union of ]] at its creation in 1910.

The first Europeans to disembark and explore the region were the  navigators [[Diogo Cão]] in 1485 and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in 1486, but the  did not try to claim the area. Like most of the interior of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]],  was not extensively explored by Europeans until the 19th century. At that time traders and settlers came principally from  and . In 1870, [[|]] missionaries came to the northern part of  to spread the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran religion]] among the [[Owambo people|Owambo]] and [[Kavango people]]. In the late 19th century, [[Dorsland Trek]]kers crossed the area on their way from the [[ Republic|Transvaal]] to . Some of them settled in  instead of continuing their journey.

=== rule===
{{see also| South West Africa|Herero and Nama genocide}}
 became a  colony in 1884 under [[Otto von Bismarck]] to forestall perceived  encroachment and was known as [[ South West Africa]] (''Deutsch-Südwestafrika''). The [[Palgrave Commission]] by the  governor in [[Cape Town]] determined that only the natural deep-water harbour of Walvis Bay was worth occupying and thus annexed it to the Cape province of  .

In 1897, a [[1890s African rinderpest epizootic|rinderpest epidemic]] caused massive cattle die-offs of an estimated 95% of cattle in southern and central . In response the  colonisers set up a veterinary [[Cordon sanitaire (medicine)|cordon]] fence known as the [[Red Line ()|Red Line]]. In 1907 this fence then broadly defined the boundaries for the first Police Zone.

From 1904 to 1907, the [[Herero people|Herero]] and the [[Nama people|Nama]] [[Herero Wars|took up arms]] against ruthless  settlers. In a calculated punitive action by the  settlers, [[Government of |government]] officials ordered the extinction of the natives in the OvaHerero and Nama genocide. In what has been called the "first genocide of the 20th century", the  systematically killed 10,000 Nama (half the population) and approximately 65,000 Herero (about 80% of the population). The survivors, when finally released from detention, were subjected to a policy of dispossession, deportation, forced labour, racial segregation, and discrimination in a system that in many ways foreshadowed the [[apartheid]] established by  in 1948. Most Africans were confined to so-called native territories, which under  rule after 1949 were turned into "homelands" ([[Bantustans]]).

Some historians have speculated that the downfall of the Herero in  was a model for the [[Nazism|Nazi]]s in [[the Holocaust]]. The memory of what happened under  rule has contributed to shape the ethnic identity in independent  and has kept its significance in today's relations with .

The  minister for development aid apologised for the  genocide in 2004. However, the  government distanced itself from this apology. Only in 2021 did the [[Government of | government]] acknowledge the genocide and agree to pay €1.1 billion over 30 years in community aid.

=== mandate===
{{see also|South West Africa}}
During World War I,  troops under General [[Louis Botha]] [[South West Africa campaign|occupied the territory]] and deposed the  colonial administration. The end of the war and the [[Treaty of Versailles]] resulted in South West Africa remaining a possession of , at first as a [[League of Nations mandate]], until 1990. The mandate system was formed as a compromise between those who advocated for an Allied annexation of former  and Ottoman territories and a proposition put forward by those who wished to grant them to an international trusteeship until they could govern themselves. It permitted the  government to administer South West Africa until that territory's inhabitants were prepared for political self-determination.  interpreted the mandate as a veiled annexation and made no attempt to prepare South West Africa for future autonomy.{{multiple image

As a result of the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|Conference on International Organization]] in 1945, the League of Nations was formally superseded by the [[United Nations]] (UN) and former League mandates by a trusteeship system. Article 77 of the [[United Nations Charter]] stated that UN trusteeship "shall apply...to territories now held under mandate"; furthermore, it would "be a matter of subsequent agreement as to which territories in the foregoing territories will be brought under the trusteeship system and under what terms". The UN requested all former League of Nations mandates be surrendered to its [[United Nations Trusteeship Council|Trusteeship Council]] in anticipation of their independence.  declined to do so and instead requested permission from the UN to formally annex South West Africa, for which it received considerable criticism. When the UN General Assembly rejected this proposal,  dismissed its opinion and began solidifying control of the territory. The UN General Assembly and Security Council responded by referring the issue to the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), which held a number of discussions on the legality of  rule between 1949 and 1966.

 began imposing ''[[apartheid]],'' its codified system of racial segregation and discrimination, on South West Africa during the late 1940s. Black South West Africans were subject to [[pass laws]], curfews, and a host of residential regulations that restricted their movement. Development was concentrated in the southern region of the territory adjacent to , known as the "[[Police Zone (South West Africa)|Police Zone]]", where most of the major settlements and commercial economic activity were located. Outside the Police Zone, indigenous peoples were restricted to theoretically self-governing [[Bantustan#Bantustans in South West Africa|tribal homelands]].

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, the accelerated [[decolonisation of Africa]] and mounting pressure on the remaining colonial powers to grant their colonies self-determination resulted in the formation of nascent nationalist parties in South West Africa. Movements such as the [[South West African National Union]] (SWANU) and the [[South West African People's Organisation]] (SWAPO) advocated for the formal termination of 's mandate and independence for the territory. In 1966, following the ICJ's controversial ruling that it had no legal standing to consider the question of  rule, SWAPO launched an armed insurgency that escalated into part of a wider regional conflict known as the [[ Border War]].[[File:Foreign Observer identification badge in the 1989  election.jpg|thumb|Foreign Observer identification badge issued during the 1989  election]]In 1971  contract workers led a [[1971–72  contract workers strike|general strike against the contract system]] and in support of independence. Some of the striking workers would later join SWAPO's [[People's Liberation Army of |PLAN]] as part of the  Border War.

===Independence===

As SWAPO's insurgency intensified, 's case for annexation in the international community continued to decline. The UN declared that  had failed in its obligations to ensure the moral and material well-being of South West Africa's indigenous inhabitants, and had thus disavowed its own mandate. On 12 June 1968, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution proclaiming that, in accordance with the desires of its people, South West Africa be renamed ''''. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 269]], adopted in August 1969, declared 's continued occupation of  illegal. In recognition of this landmark decision, SWAPO's armed wing was renamed the [[People's Liberation Army of ]] (PLAN).

 became one of several flashpoints for [[Cold War]] proxy conflicts in southern Africa during the latter years of the PLAN insurgency. The insurgents sought out weapons and sent recruits to the Soviet Union for military training. As the PLAN war effort gained momentum, the Soviet Union and other sympathetic states such as  continued to increase their support, deploying advisers to train the insurgents directly as well as supplying more weapons and ammunition. SWAPO's leadership, dependent on Soviet, , and  military aid, positioned the movement firmly within the socialist bloc by 1975. This practical alliance reinforced the external perception of SWAPO as a Soviet proxy, which dominated Cold War rhetoric in  and the . For its part, the Soviet Union supported SWAPO partly because it viewed  as a regional Western ally. 
[[File:SADF-Operations 4.jpg|thumb|left| troops patrol the border region for PLAN insurgents, 1980s.]]
Growing war weariness and the reduction of tensions between the superpowers compelled , , and  to accede to the [[Tripartite Accord ()|Tripartite Accord]], under pressure from both the Soviet Union and the .  accepted  independence in exchange for  military withdrawal from the region and an  commitment to cease all aid to PLAN. PLAN and  adopted an informal ceasefire in August 1988, and a [[United Nations Transition Assistance Group]] (UNTAG) was formed to monitor the  peace process and supervise the return of refugees. The ceasefire was broken after PLAN made a final incursion into the territory, possibly as a result of misunderstanding UNTAG's directives, in March 1989. A new ceasefire was later imposed with the condition that the insurgents were to be confined to their external bases in  until they could be disarmed and demobilised by UNTAG.

By the end of the 11-month transition period, the last  troops had been withdrawn from , all political prisoners granted amnesty, racially discriminatory legislation repealed, and 42,000  refugees returned to their homes. Just over 97% of eligible voters participated in the country's first [[ parliamentary election, 1989|parliamentary elections]] held under a [[universal franchise]]. The United Nations plan included oversight by [[Election monitoring|foreign election observers]] in an effort to ensure a [[Election#Non-democratic elections|free and fair election]]. SWAPO won a plurality of seats in the [[Members of the Constituent Assembly of |Constituent Assembly]] with 57% of the popular vote. This gave the party 41 seats, but not a two-thirds majority, which would have enabled it to draft the constitution on its own.

The  Constitution was adopted in February 1990. It incorporated protection for human rights and compensation for state expropriations of private property and established an independent judiciary, legislature, and an executive presidency (the constituent assembly became the national assembly). The country officially became independent on 21 March 1990. [[Sam Nujoma]] was sworn in as the first [[President of ]] at a ceremony attended by [[Nelson Mandela]] of  (who had been released from prison the previous month) and representatives from 147 countries, including 20 heads of state. In 1994, shortly before the first multiracial elections in , that country ceded Walvis Bay to .

===After independence===
Since independence  has completed the transition from white minority apartheid rule to parliamentary democracy. [[Multiparty democracy]] was introduced and has been maintained, with local, regional and [[Elections in |national elections]] held regularly. Several registered political parties are active and represented in the National Assembly, although the [[SWAPO]] has won every election since independence. The transition from the 15-year rule of President [[Sam Nujoma|Nujoma]] to his successor [[Hifikepunye Pohamba]] in 2005 went smoothly.

Since independence, the  government has promoted a policy of national reconciliation. It issued an amnesty for those who fought on either side during the liberation war. The civil war in  spilled over and adversely affected  living in the north of the country. In 1998, [[ Defence Force]] (NDF) troops were sent to the [[]] as part of a [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) contingent. In 1999, the national government quashed a secessionist attempt in the northeastern [[Caprivi Strip]]. The [[Caprivi conflict]] was initiated by the [[Caprivi Liberation Army]] (CLA), a [[Rebellion|rebel]] group led by [[Mishake Muyongo]]. It wanted the Caprivi Strip to secede and form its own society.

In 2007, [[Twyfelfontein]] was inscribed as a cultural [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], a prehistoric site with one of the largest concentrations of rock engravings on the African continent. In December 2014, Prime Minister [[Hage Geingob]], the candidate of ruling SWAPO, won the [[2014  general election|presidential elections]], taking 87% of the vote. His predecessor, President [[Hifikepunye Pohamba]], also of SWAPO, had served the maximum two terms allowed by the constitution. In December 2019, President Hage Geingob was [[2019  general election|re-elected]] for a second term, taking 56.3% of the vote. On 4 February 2024, President Hage Geingob died and he was immediately succeeded by vice-president [[Nangolo Mbumba]] as new President of  who finished the late President's term as it came to an end in March 2025. SWAPO's first female presidential candidate, [[Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah]], was declared the winner of the [[2024  general election|2024 elections]] with 57% of the vote. On 21 March 2025, she  was sworn in as 's new president.
