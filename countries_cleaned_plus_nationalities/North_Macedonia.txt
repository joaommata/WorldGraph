 geographically roughly corresponds to the ancient [[Paeonia (kingdom)|kingdom of Paeonia]], which was located immediately north of the ancient [[ (ancient kingdom)|kingdom of ]]. Paeonia was inhabited by the [[Paeonians]], whilst the northwest was inhabited by the Illyrian [[Dardani]] and southwest by the [[Enchelei|Enchelae]] (also an [[Illyrian tribes|Illyrian]] tribe), as well as [[Pelagones]] and [[Lynkestis|Lyncestae]] (generally regarded as [[Molossians|Molossian]] tribes of the northwestern [[Ancient |]] group).

In the late 6th century BC, the [[Achaemenid Persia]]ns under [[Darius the Great]] conquered Paeonia, incorporating the area within their vast territories.{{sfn|Howe|Reames|2008|p=239}}{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|pp=135–138, 342–345}} Following their defeat in the [[Second Persian invasion of ]] in 479 BC, the Persians eventually withdrew from their European territories.

[[Philip II of Macedon]] absorbed the regions of [[Upper ]] (Lynkestis and Pelagonia) and the southern part of Paeonia ([[Deuriopus]]) into the kingdom of Macedon in 356 BC. Philip's son [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the remainder of the region and incorporated it in his empire, reaching as far north as [[Scupi]], but the city and the surrounding area remained part of [[Kingdom of Dardania|Dardania]]. After the death of Alexander, [[Celtic settlement of Southeast Europe|Celtic]] armies began to bear down on the southern regions, threatening the kingdom of Macedon. In 310 BC, they attacked the area, but were defeated.

The Romans established the [[ (Roman province)|province of ]] in 146 BC. By the time of [[Diocletian]], the province had been subdivided between '' Prima'' ("first ") in the south, encompassing most of the kingdom of Macedon, and '' Salutaris'' (meaning "wholesome ", known also as '' Secunda'', "second ") in the north, encompassing parts of Dardania and the whole of Paeonia, with the city of [[Stobi]] as its capital. This comprised most of the territory of the modern country. Roman expansion brought the Scupi area under Roman rule in the time of [[Domitian]] (81–96 AD), and it fell within the Province of [[Moesia]]. Whilst  remained the dominant language in the eastern part of the Roman empire, especially south of the [[Jireček Line]], Latin spread to  to some extent.

[[Early Slavs|Slavic tribes]] settled in the Balkan region including  by the late 6th century AD. They were led by [[Pannonian Avars]]. The Slavs settled on places of earlier settlements and probably merged later with the local populations to form mixed Byzantine-Slavic communities. Historical records document that in {{Circa|680}} a [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] ruler called [[Kuber]] led a group of largely Christians called [[Sermesianoi]], who were his subjects, and they settled in the region of [[Pelagonia]]. They may have consisted of Bulgars, Byzantines, Slavs and even Germanic tribes. There is no more information of Kuber's life. [[Presian I of |Presian]]'s reign apparently coincides with the extension of  control over the Slavic tribes in and around . The Slavic tribes that settled in the region of  converted to Christianity around the 9th century during the reign of Tsar [[Boris I of ]]. The [[Ohrid Literary School]] became one of the two major cultural centres of the First  Empire, along with the [[Preslav Literary School]]. Established in Ohrid in 886 by  [[Clement of Ohrid]] on the order of Boris I, the Ohrid Literary School was involved in the spreading of the [[Cyrillic script]].

After [[Sviatoslav's invasion of ]], the Byzantines took control of East . [[Samuel of |Samuil]] was proclaimed [[First  Empire|Tsar of ]]. He moved the capital to Skopje and then to Ohrid, which had been the cultural and military centre of southwestern  since Boris I's rule. Samuil re-established  power, but after several decades of conflicts, in 1014, the Byzantine Emperor [[Basil II]] defeated his armies, and within four years the Byzantines restored control over the Balkans (modern-day  was included into a new province, called [[ (theme)|]]). The rank of the autocephalous [[ Patriarchate]] was lowered due to its subjugation to [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]] and it was transformed into the [[Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. By the late 12th century, Byzantine decline saw the region contested by various political entities, including a brief [[Normans|Norman]] occupation in the 1080s.

In the early 13th century, a revived [[Second  Empire| Empire]] gained control of the region. Plagued by political difficulties, the empire did not last, and the region came once again under Byzantine control in the early 14th century. In the 14th century, it became part of the [[ Empire]]. Skopje became the capital of Tsar [[Stefan Dušan]]'s empire. Following Dušan's death, a weak successor appeared, and power struggles between nobles divided the Balkans once again. These events coincided with the entry of the [[Ottoman Turks]] into Europe.

===Ottoman period===
{{Further|Ottoman Vardar }}

The [[Kingdom of Prilep]] was one of the short-lived states that emerged from the collapse of the  Empire in the 14th century and was seized by the Ottomans at the end of the same century. Gradually, all of the central Balkans were conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and remained under its domination for five centuries as part of the province or [[Eyalet]] of [[Rumelia Eyalet|Rumelia]]. The name ''[[Rumelia]]'' ([[ language|]]: ''Rumeli'') means "Land of the Romans" in , referring to the lands conquered by the Ottoman Turks from the Byzantine Empire. Over the centuries, Rumelia Eyalet was reduced in size through administrative reforms, until by the 19th century it consisted of a region of central  and western  with its capital at Manastir or present-day [[Bitola]]. Rumelia Eyalet was abolished in 1867 and that territory of  subsequently became part of vilayets of [[Manastir Vilayet|Manastir]], [[Kosovo Vilayet|Kosova]] and [[Salonica Vilayet|Selanik]] until the end of Ottoman rule in 1912. With the beginning of the [[ National Revival]] in the 19th century, many of the reformers were from this region, including the [[Miladinov brothers]], [[Rayko Zhinzifov|Rajko Žinzifov]], [[Yoakim Karchovski|Joakim Krčovski]], [[Kiril Peychinovich|Kiril Pejčinoviḱ]] and others. The bishoprics of Skopje, [[Debar]], [[Bitola]], [[Ohrid]], [[Veles (city)|Veles]], and [[Strumica]] voted to join the [[ Exarchate]] after it was established in 1870.

Several movements whose goals were the establishment of an autonomous , which would encompass the entire region of , began to arise in the late 19th century; the earliest of these was the [[ -Adrianople Revolutionary Committees]], later becoming Secret -Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (SMARO). In 1905 it was renamed the Internal -Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO), and after [[World War I]] the organisation separated into the [[Internal  Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) and the [[Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation]] (ITRO).

In the early years of the organisation, membership eligibility was exclusive to , but later it was extended to all inhabitants of European  regardless of ethnicity or religion. The majority of its members were [[ ]]. In 1903, IMRO organised the [[Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], which after some initial successes, including the forming of the [[Kruševo Republic]], was crushed with much loss of life. The uprising and the forming of the Kruševo Republic are considered the cornerstone and precursors to the eventual establishment of the  state. The leaders of the Ilinden uprising are celebrated as national heroes in . The names of IMRO revolutionaries like [[Gotse Delchev]], [[Pitu Guli]], [[Dame Gruev]] and [[Yane Sandanski]] were included into the lyrics of the national anthem of the state of  "[[Denes nad Makedonija]]" ("Today over "). The major national holiday of , the [[Republic Day ()|Republic Day]], is celebrated on 2 August, Ilinden (St. Elijah day), the day of the Ilinden uprising.

Following the two [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912 and 1913 and the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]], most of its European-held territories were divided between ,  and .{{sfn|Nicolle|2008|p=162}} Most of the territory that was to become  was annexed by  conforming to the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|treaty of peace]] concluded at Bucharest. However, [[Strumica]] region was passed to . Following the partition, an anti- campaign was carried out in the areas under  and  control. As many as 641  schools and 761 churches were closed by the Serbs, while Exarchist clergy and teachers were expelled. The use of all [[ dialects]] and standard  were proscribed. IMRO, together with local , organised the [[Ohrid–Debar uprising]] against the  rule. Within a few days the rebels captured the towns of Gostivar, Struga and Ohrid, expelling the  troops. According to the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] report, a  army of 100,000 regulars suppressed the uprising. Many were killed and tens of thousands of refugees fled to  and .

During the [[First World War]], most of today's  was part of the [[ occupation of  (World War I)| occupied zone of ]] after the country was [[ campaign|invaded]] by the [[Central Powers]] in the fall of 1915. The region was known as the "Military Inspection Area of " and was administered by a  military commander. A policy of [[Bulgarisation]] of the region and its population was immediately initiated, during the period the IMRO arose from a clandestine organisation to serve as gendarmerie, taking control of the whole police structure, enforcing the Bulgarisation of the region. According to [[Robert Gerwarth]], the  denationalisation policy, including its paramilitary aspect, was almost identical in its intent and execution to the  policy that preceded it.

 language was to be exclusively used, [[ Cyrillic alphabet| Cyrillic]] was forbidden,  priests were arrested and deported, -sounding names had to be changed to  ones, school teachers were brought from  while  books were taken from schools and libraries and publicly destroyed. Adult males were sent to labour camps or forced to join the  Army, representatives of the  [[intelligentsia]] were deported or executed. According to [[Paul Mojzes]] the aim of the  government was to create pure  territories by denationalising the non- Slavic population of .

After the capitulation of  and the end of the First World War, the area returned under Belgrade control as part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and ]] and saw a reintroduction of anti- measures.  teachers and clergy were expelled,  language signs and books removed, and all  organisations dissolved. Also after the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]], the Strumica region was annexed to   in 1919.

The  government pursued a policy of forced [[Serbianisation]] in the region, which included systematic suppression of  activists, altering family surnames, internal colonisation, exploiting workers, and intense propaganda. To aid the implementation of this policy, some 50,000  army and [[ Gendarmerie|gendarmerie]] were stationed in present-day . By 1940 about 280  colonies (comprising 4,200 families) were established as part of the government's internal colonisation program (initial plans envisaged 50,000 families settling in present-day ).

In 1929, the Kingdom was officially renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], and divided into provinces called [[Banovinas of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|''banovinas'']]. South , including all of present-day , became the [[Vardar Banovina]] of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

The [[Internal  Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) promoted the concept of an [[Independent  (IMRO)|Independent ]] in the [[interwar period]]. Its leaders—including [[Todor Alexandrov]], [[Aleksandar Protogerov]], and [[Ivan Mihailov]]—promoted independence of the  territory split between  and  for the whole population, regardless of religion and ethnicity. The  government of [[Alexander Malinov]] in 1918 offered to give [[Pirin ]] for that purpose after [[World War I]], but the Great Powers did not adopt this idea because  and  opposed it. In 1924, the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) suggested that all Balkan communist parties adopt a platform of a "[[United ]]" but the suggestion was rejected by the  and  communists.

IMRO followed by starting an insurgent war in Vardar , together with [[ Youth Secret Revolutionary Organization]], which also conducted guerrilla attacks against the  administrative and army officials there. In 1923 in Stip, a paramilitary organisation called [[Association against  Bandits]] was formed by  [[chetniks]], IMRO renegades and [[ Federative Organization]] (MFO) members to oppose IMRO and MMTRO. On 9 October 1934, IMRO member [[Vlado Chernozemski]] assassinated [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]].

The [[Macedonism|Macedonist]] ideas increased in Yugoslav Vardar  and among the left diaspora in  during the interwar period. They were supported by the Comintern. In 1934, the Comintern issued a [[Resolution of the Comintern on the  question|special resolution]] in which for the first time directions were provided for recognising the existence of a separate  nation and  language.

During World War II, Yugoslavia was occupied by the [[Axis powers]] from 1941 to 1945. The Vardar Banovina was divided between  and -occupied . [[ Action Committees]] were established to prepare the region for the new  administration and army. The committees were mostly formed by former members of IMRO and  Youth Secret Revolutionary Organization (MYSRO, but some [[IMRO (United)]] former members also participated.{{sfn|Georgieva|Konechni|1998|p=223}}

As leader of the Vardar  communists, [[Metodi Shatorov]] ("Sharlo") switched from the [[Yugoslav Communist Party]] to the [[ Communist Party]]{{sfn|Georgieva|Konechni|1998|p=223}} and refused to start military action against the [[ Army]]. The  authorities, under  pressure, were responsible for the round-up and deportation of over 7,000 Jews in Skopje and [[Bitola]]. Harsh rule by the occupying forces encouraged many Vardar  to support the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Communist Partisan]] resistance movement of [[Josip Broz Tito]] after 1943, and the [[National Liberation War of |National Liberation War]] ensued.

In Vardar , after the [[ coup d'état of 1944]], the  troops, surrounded by  forces, fought their way back to the old borders of . Under the leadership of the new  pro-Soviet government, four armies, 455,000 strong in total, were mobilised and reorganised. Most of them re-entered occupied Yugoslavia in early October 1944 and moved from [[Sofia]] to [[Niš]], Skopje and [[Pristina]] with the strategic task of blocking the  forces withdrawing from . The  army would [[Nagykanizsa–Körmend Offensive|reach the Alps]] in , participating in the expulsion of the  to the west, through Yugoslavia and .

Compelled by the [[Soviet Union]] with a view towards the creation of a large [[Yugoslavism|South Slav Federation]], in 1946 the new Communist government, led by [[Georgi Dimitrov]], agreed to give   to a [[United ]]. With the [[Bled agreement (1947)|Bled agreement]], in 1947  formally confirmed the envisioned unification of the  region, but postponed this act until after the formation of the future Federation. It was the first time it accepted the existence of a separate  ethnicity and language. After the [[Tito–Stalin split]] the region of Pirin  remained part of  and later the  Communist Party revised its view of the existence of a separate  nation and language.

==== Socialist Yugoslavia ====
{{Main|Socialist Republic of }}

[[File:Lazar Kolishevski left.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Lazar Koliševski]] was the political leader of SR  and briefly of SFR Yugoslavia.]]

In December 1944, the [[Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of ]] (ASNOM) proclaimed the People's Republic of  as part of the People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. ASNOM remained an acting government until the end of the war. The  alphabet was codified by linguists of ASNOM, who based their alphabet on the phonetic alphabet of [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] and the principles of [[Krste Misirkov|Krste Petkov Misirkov]]. During the [[ Civil War|civil war in ]] (1946–1949),  communist insurgents supported the  communists. Many refugees fled to the Socialist Republic of  from there. The state removed "Socialist" from its name in 1991 when it peacefully seceded from Yugoslavia.

The new republic became one of the six republics of the Yugoslav federation. Following the federation's renaming as the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1963, the People's Republic of  was likewise renamed the Socialist Republic of .

==== Declaration of independence ====

The anniversary of the start of the [[Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising|Ilinden Uprising]] ([[Elijah|St. Elijah]]'s Day) on 2 August is also widely celebrated on an official level as the [[Republic Day ()|Day of the Republic]].

[[Robert Badinter]], as the head of the [[Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia]], recommended EC recognition in January 1992. On 15 January 1992,  was the first country to recognise the independence of the republic.

 remained at peace through the [[Yugoslav Wars]] of the early 1990s. A few very minor changes to its border with Yugoslavia were agreed upon to resolve problems with the demarcation line between the two countries. It was seriously destabilised by the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, when an estimated 360,000 ethnic  refugees from Kosovo took refuge in the country. They departed shortly after the war, and [[ nationalism| nationalists]] on both sides of the border took up arms soon after in pursuit of autonomy or independence for the -populated areas of .

A [[2001 insurgency in |conflict]] took place between the government and ethnic  insurgents, mostly in the north and west of the country, between February and August 2001. The war ended with the intervention of a [[NATO]] ceasefire monitoring force. Under the terms of the [[Ohrid Agreement]], the government agreed to devolve greater political power and cultural recognition to the  minority. The  side agreed to abandon separatist demands and to recognise all  institutions fully. In addition, according to this accord, the [[National Liberation Army ()|NLA]] were to disarm and hand over their weapons to a NATO force. However the  security forces had two more armed confrontations with  militant groups, in [[Operation Mountain Storm|2007]] and [[2015 Kumanovo clashes|2015]] respectively.

[[2012 Republic of  inter-ethnic violence|Inter-ethnic tensions]] flared in  in 2012, with incidents of violence between ethnic  and . In April 2017, about 200 protesters - reportedly mostly from the conservative VMRO-DPMNE party, [[2017 storming of  Parliament|stormed]] the  Parliament in response to the election of Talat Xhaferi, an ethnic  and former [[National Liberation Army ()|National Liberation Army]] commander during the 2001 conflict, as the Speaker of the Assembly.

==== Antiquisation ====
{{Main|Antiquisation|Macedonism}}

Upon its coming to power in 2006, but especially since the country's non-invitation to NATO in 2008, the VMRO-DPMNE government pursued a policy of "[[ nationalism#Post-independence period and Antiquisation|Antiquisation]]" ("Antikvizatzija") as a way of putting pressure on  as well as for the purposes of domestic identity-building. Statues of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]] have been erected in several cities across the country. Additionally, many pieces of public infrastructure, such as airports, highways, and stadiums were renamed after Alexander and Philip. These actions were seen as deliberate provocations in neighbouring , exacerbating the dispute and further stalling the country's EU and NATO applications. The policy has also attracted criticism domestically, as well as from EU diplomats, and, following the Prespa agreement, it has been partly reversed after 2016 by the new [[SDSM]] government of . Moreover, per Prespa agreement both countries have acknowledged that their respective understanding of the terms "" and "" refers to a different historical context and cultural heritage.

[[File:Потпишување на договорот за македонско-грчкиот спор (17.06.2018, Преспа) (42853677381).jpg|thumb|Symbolic signing of the Prespa agreement]]

In August 2017, what was then the Republic of  signed a [[– relations#Friendship treaty and beyond|friendship agreement]] with , aiming to end the "anti- ideology" in the country and to solve the historical issues between the two.

Under the [[Prespa agreement]], signed with  on 17 June 2018, the country agreed to change its name to the Republic of  and stop public use of the [[Vergina Sun]]. It retained the demonym "", but clarified this as distinct from the Hellenistic  identity in northern . The agreement included removal of irredentist material from textbooks and maps in both countries, and official UN recognition of the Slavic [[ language]]. It replaced the bilateral Interim Accord of 1995.

The withdrawal of the  veto, along with the signing the friendship agreement with , resulted in the European Union on 27 June approving the start of [[Accession of  to the European Union|accession talks]], which were expected to take place in 2019, under the condition that the Prespa deal was implemented. On 5 July, the Prespa agreement was ratified by the  parliament with 69 MPs voting in favour of it. On 12 July, [[NATO]] invited  to start accession talks in a bid to become the alliance's 30th member. On 30 July, the parliament of  approved plans to hold a non-binding [[2018  referendum|referendum on changing the country's name]], which took place on 30 September. Ninety-one percent of voters voted in favour with a 37% turnout, but the referendum was not carried because of a constitutional requirement for a 50% turnout.

[[File: Joins NATO.jpg|thumb|left| commemorates its accession to NATO at the US Department of State.]]

On 6 February 2019, the permanent representatives of NATO member states and  Foreign Affairs Minister Nikola Dimitrov, signed in [[Brussels]] the [[Accession of  to NATO|accession protocol]] of  into NATO. The protocol was then ratified on 8 February by the  parliament, thus completing all the preconditions for putting into force the Prespa agreement. Subsequently, on 12 February the  government announced the formal activation of the constitutional amendments which effectively renamed the country as  and informed accordingly the United Nations and its member states.

In March 2020, after the ratification process by all NATO members was completed,  [[–NATO relations|acceded to NATO]], becoming the 30th member state. The same month, the leaders of the [[European Union]] formally gave approval to  to begin talks to join the EU. On 17 November 2020,  refused to approve the European Union's negotiation framework for , effectively blocking the official start of accession talks with this country. The explanation from the  side was: no implementation of the friendship treaty from 2017, state-supported hate speech, minority claims, and an "ongoing nation-building process" based on historical negationism of the  identity, culture and legacy in the broader [[ (region)|region of ]]. The veto received condemnation by intellectuals from both states and criticism from international observers.

Protests broke out in [[2022  protests|July 2022]], organised by the opposition parties, over the  proposal for the [[Accession of  to the European Union|accession of  to the EU]]. The accession talks for the accession of  to the EU officially began in the same month, after the  proposal was passed by the Assembly of .

The 2023 European Commission Progress Report has cited the unfulfilled constitutional changes, as the primary reasons for the blocking of the further country's accession path. The EU's intention regarding the country's accession seems unclear, excluding desire to maintain its geopolitical influence here, countering the  and  impact in the Western Balkans. On 25 September 2024, the EU announced the separation of  from  on the EU accession path, due to the disputes between  and . Following the decision, the EU opened negotiations on the first chapters with  separately on October 15, 2024.
