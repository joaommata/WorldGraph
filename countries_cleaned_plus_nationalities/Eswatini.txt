Artifacts have been found indicating human activity dating back to the early [[Stone Age]], around 200,000 years ago. Prehistoric [[rock art]] paintings dating from as far back as {{Circa|27,000 years ago}} to as recently as the 19th century can be found around the country.

The earliest known inhabitants of the region were [[Khoisan]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s. They were largely replaced by the [[Nguni people|Nguni]] during the great [[Bantu expansion|Bantu migrations]]. These peoples originated from the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes region]] of eastern and central Africa. Evidence of agriculture and iron use dates from about the 4th century. People speaking languages ancestral to the current [[Sotho–Tswana languages|Sotho]] and [[Nguni languages]] began settling no later than the 11th century.

=== settlers (18th and 19th centuries)===
The  settlers, then known as ''the Ngwane'' (or ''bakaNgwane'') before entering Swaziland, had been settled on the banks of the [[Pongola River]]. Before that, they were settled in the area of the [[Tembe River]] near present-day [[Maputo]], . Continuing conflict with the [[Ndwandwe]] people pushed them further north, with [[Ngwane III]] establishing his capital at [[Shiselweni Region|Shiselweni]] at the foot of the Mhlosheni hills. Under [[Sobhuza I]], the Ngwane people established their capital at [[Zombodze]] in the heartland of present-day . In this process, they conquered and incorporated the long established clans of the country known to the  as ''Emakhandzambili'' (those found ahead).

The names "Swaziland" and "" both derive from a later king named [[Mswati II]]. ''KaNgwane'', named for Ngwane III, is an alternative name for , the surname of whose [[dynasty|royal house]] remains ''Nkhosi [[House of Dlamini|Dlamini]]''. Mswati II was the greatest of the fighting kings of Swaziland, and he greatly extended the area of the country to twice its current size. The ''Emakhandzambili'' clans were initially incorporated into the kingdom with wide autonomy, often including grants of special ritual and political status. The extent of their autonomy, however, was drastically curtailed by Mswati, who attacked and subdued some of them in the 1850s. With his power, Mswati greatly reduced the influence of the ''Emakhandzambili'' while incorporating more people into his kingdom either through conquest or by giving them refuge. These later arrivals became known to the  as ''Emafikamuva''.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

The autonomy of the  nation was influenced by  and  rule of southern Africa in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1881, the  government signed a convention recognising  independence, despite the [[Scramble for Africa]] that was taking place at the time. This independence was also recognised in the [[London Convention (1884)|London Convention of 1884]].

King [[Mbandzeni]] created a complex pattern of land ownership by granting many concessions to Europeans. During the concessions some of the King's senior chiefs like Chief Ntengu Mbokane got permission to relocate to farms towards the Lubombo region, in the modern-day city of Nsoko. Others like Mshiza Maseko relocated to farms towards the Komati River in the place called eLuvalweni. The concessions included grants and leases for agriculture and grazing. In 1890, following the death of Mbandzeni, a Swaziland Convention created a Chief Court to determine disputes about controversial land and mineral rights and other concessions.

Swaziland was given a [[Triumvirate|triumviral]] administration in 1890, representing the , the  republics, and the  people. In 1894, a convention placed Swaziland under the [[ Republic]] as a [[protectorate]]. This continued under the rule of [[Ngwane V]] until the outbreak of the [[Second Boer War]] in October 1899.

King Ngwane V died in December 1899, during [[incwala]], after the outbreak of the Second Boer War. His successor, [[Sobhuza II]], was four months old. Swaziland was indirectly involved in the war with various skirmishes between the  and the Boers occurring in the country until 1902.

=== indirect rule over Swaziland (1906–1968)===

In 1903, after the  victory in the [[Second Boer War]], Swaziland became one of the  "[[High Commissioner for Southern Africa|High Commission Territories]]", the others being [[Basutoland]] (now [[]]) and [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]] (now [[]]), although a protectorate was not established because terms had not been agreed with the  Queen Regent [[Labotsibeni Mdluli]].

The Swaziland Administration Proclamation of 1904 established a commission with the task of examining all the concessions and defining their boundaries. This work was finished by 1907, and the Swaziland Concessions Partition Proclamation provided for a concessions partition commissioner to be appointed to set aside areas for the sole use and occupation of the . The commissioner had the power to expropriate up to one third of each concession without compensation, but payment would need to be made if more than a third was taken. In the event, in 1910 he completed his work and set aside 1,639,687 acres, some 38% of Swaziland's area, for the . The queen regent then encouraged the  to go to work in the Transvaal to earn money to buy more land from the Europeans.

Much of the early administration of the territory (for example, postal services) was carried out from  until 1906, when the [[Transvaal Colony]] was granted self-government. A  [[high commissioner]] had some of the functions of a governor, but the  were self-governing on their reserves, and the territory was not deemed to be a  possession. Sobhuza's official coronation as king was in December 1921 after the regency of Labotsibeni, after which he led an unsuccessful deputation to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] of the  in London in 1922 regarding the issue of the land.

In the period between 1923 and 1963, Sobhuza II established the  Commercial Amadoda which was to grant licences to small businesses on the  reserves and also established the  National School to counter the dominance of the missions in education. His stature grew with time, and the  royal leadership was successful in resisting the weakening power of the  administration and the possibility of the incorporation of Swaziland into the [[Union of ]].

The constitution for independent Swaziland was promulgated by Britain in November 1963 under the terms of which a [[Legislative Council of Swaziland|Legislative Council]] and an Executive Council were established. This development was opposed by the king's  National Council (''Liqoqo''). Despite such opposition, elections took place, and the first [[Legislative Council of Swaziland|Legislative Council]] was constituted on 9 September 1964. By 1964, the area of the country reserved for occupation by the  had increased to 56%. Changes to the original constitution proposed by the Legislative Council were accepted by Britain and a new constitution providing for a [[House of Assembly of Swaziland|House of Assembly]] and [[Senate of Swaziland|Senate]] was drawn up. Elections under this constitution were held in 1967. Following the 1967 elections, Swaziland was a protected state until independence was regained in 1968.

===Independence (since 1968)===
Following the elections of 1972, the constitution of Swaziland was suspended by King [[Sobhuza II]] who thereafter ruled the country by [[decree]] until his death in 1982. At that point, Sobhuza II had been king of Swaziland for almost 83 years, making him the [[List of longest-reigning monarchs|longest-reigning monarch in history]]. A regency followed his death, with Queen Regent [[Dzeliwe of |Dzeliwe Shongwe]] as head of state until 1984 when she was removed by the Liqoqo and replaced by Queen Mother [[Ntfombi of |Ntfombi Tfwala]]. [[Mswati III]], the son of Ntfombi, was crowned in 1986 as king and ''[[ngwenyama]]'' of Swaziland.

An attempt to transfer neighbouring parts of [[]], more precisely parts of the Zulu [[bantustan|homeland]] of [[KwaZulu]] and parts of the  homeland of [[KaNgwane]], to Swaziland in 1982 was never realised. This would have given land-locked Swaziland access to the sea. The deal was negotiated by the governments of  and Swaziland, but was met by popular opposition in the territory meant to be transferred. The territory had been claimed by Sobhuza II as part of the  monarchs' traditional realm, and the  government hoped to use the area as a buffer zone against guerrilla infiltration from [[]]. (The  government responded to the failure of the transfer by temporarily suspending the autonomy of KaNgwane.)

The 1990s saw a rise in student and labour protests calling on the king to introduce reforms. Thus, progress towards constitutional reforms began, culminating with the introduction of the current  constitution in 2005. This happened despite objections by political activists. The current constitution does not clearly deal with the status of political parties. The first election under the constitution took place in 2008. Members of Parliament (MPs) were elected from 55 constituencies (also known as ''tinkhundla''). These MPs served five-year terms which ended in 2013. In 2011, Swaziland suffered an economic crisis which was caused by reduced [[Southern African Customs Union]] (SACU) receipts. This caused the government to request a loan from neighbouring . However, they did not agree with the conditions of the loan, which included political reforms.

During this period, there was increased pressure on the [[Government of | government]] to carry out more reforms. Public protests by civic organisations and [[trade union]]s became more common. Starting in 2012, improvements in SACU receipts eased the fiscal pressure on the  government. A new parliament, the second since the promulgation of the constitution, was elected in 2013. The king then reappointed [[Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini|Sibusiso Dlamini]] as prime minister for the third time.

On 19 April 2018, Mswati III announced that the Kingdom of Swaziland had been renamed as the Kingdom of , reflecting the extant  name for the state '''', to mark the 50th anniversary of  independence. The name  means "land of the " in the  language and was partially intended to prevent confusion with the similarly named [[]].

 workers began anti-government protests against low salaries in September 2018. They went on a three-day strike organised by the [[Trade Union Congress of ]] that resulted in widespread disruption. In June 2021, [[2021  protests|pro-democracy protests]] broke out across the country, sparking riots, looting, and street skirmishes with police and soldiers. This civil unrest began as a result of years of anger towards the lack of meaningful reforms that would nudge  in the direction of democracy, as well as the government's reported banning of the submission of petitions.  Numerous buildings said to be connected to King Mswati III were torched by protesters, and police reportedly assaulted and arrested political opponents. ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the turmoil in the landlocked nation "the most explosive civil unrest in its 53&nbsp;years of independence". At least 20 people were killed by state security forces and dozens more injured and detained.  The government shut down the Internet (with the compliance of mobile providers MTN and  Mobile) making it difficult to access reliable news from the country.  The king was also said to have fled the country, though government officials disputed those claims, also calling for an end to the protests.
