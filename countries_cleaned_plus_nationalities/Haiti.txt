[[File:Copia de Cacicazgos de la Hispaniola.png|thumb|upright=1.6|The five [[cacique]]doms of Hispaniola at the time of the arrival of Christopher Columbus]]
The island of Hispaniola, of which  occupies the western three-eighths, has been inhabited since around 6,000 years ago by Native  who are thought to have arrived from Central or northern South America. These Archaic Age people are thought to have been largely hunter gatherers. During the [[1st millennium BC]], the Arawakan-speaking ancestors of the Taino people began to migrate into the Caribbean. Unlike the Archaic peoples, they practiced the intensive production of [[pottery]] and agriculture. The earliest evidence of the ancestors of the Taino people on Hispaniola is the Ostionoid culture, which dates to around 600 AD. {{Main|Chiefdoms of Hispaniola}}In Taíno society the largest unit of political organization was led by a ''[[cacique]]'', or chief, as the Europeans understood them. At the time of European contact, the island of Hispaniola was divided among five 'caciquedoms': the Magua in the northeast, the Marien in the northwest, the Jaragua in the southwest, the Maguana in the central regions of Cibao, and the Higüey in the southeast.

Taíno cultural artifacts include [[cave paintings]] in several locations in the country. These have become national symbols of  and tourist attractions. Modern-day [[Léogâne]], started as a  colonial town in the southwest, is beside the former capital of the caciquedom of ''Xaragua.''

[[File:Columbus landing on Hispaniola adj.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|[[Artist's impression]] of [[Christopher Columbus]] landing on [[Hispaniola]], engraving by [[Theodor de Bry]]]]
Navigator [[Christopher Columbus]] landed in  on 6 December 1492, in an area that he named ''[[Môle--Nicolas]]'', and claimed the island for the [[Crown of Castile]]. Nineteen days later, his ship the ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'' ran aground near the present site of [[Cap-Haïtien]]. Columbus left 39 men on the island, who founded the settlement of [[La Navidad]] on 25 December 1492. Relations with the native peoples, initially good, broke down and the settlers were later killed by the Taíno.

The sailors carried endemic Eurasian [[infectious disease]]s, causing [[epidemic]]s that killed a large number of native people. The first recorded [[smallpox]] epidemic in the Americas erupted on Hispaniola in 1507. Their numbers were further reduced by the harshness of the ''{{lang|es|[[encomienda]]}}'' system, in which the  forced natives to work in gold mines and plantations.

The  passed the [[Laws of Burgos]] (1512–1513), which forbade the maltreatment of natives, endorsed their [[Proselytism|conversion]] to Catholicism, and gave legal framework to ''{{lang|es|encomiendas}}.'' The natives were brought to these sites to work in specific plantations or industries.

As the  re-focused their colonization efforts on the greater riches of mainland Central and South America, Hispaniola became reduced largely to a trading and refueling post. As a result [[Piracy in the Caribbean|piracy]] became widespread, encouraged by European powers hostile to  such as  (based on [[Tortuga ()|Île de la Tortue]]) and England. The  largely abandoned the western third of the island, focusing their colonization effort on the eastern two-thirds. The western part of the island was thus gradually settled by  [[buccaneer]]s; among them was [[Bertrand d'Ogeron]], who succeeded in growing [[tobacco]] and recruited many  colonial families from [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. In 1697 [[Kingdom of |]] and [[Imperial |]] settled their hostilities on the island by way of the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] of 1697, which divided Hispaniola between them.

 received the western third and subsequently named it -Domingue, the  equivalent of ''[[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]]'', the  colony on [[Hispaniola]]. The  set about creating sugar and coffee plantations, worked by vast numbers of those enslaved imported from [[Africa]], and -Domingue grew to become their richest colonial possession, generating 40% of ’s foreign trade and doubling the wealth generation of all of England’s colonies, combined.

The  settlers were outnumbered by enslaved persons by almost 10 to 1. According to the 1788 Census, 's population consisted of nearly 25,000 Europeans, 22,000 free coloreds and 700,000 Africans in slavery. In contrast, by 1763 the white population of [[New | ]], a far larger territory, had numbered only 65,000. In the north of the island, those enslaved were able to retain many ties to African cultures, religion and language; these ties were continually being renewed by newly imported Africans. Some West Africans in slavery held on to their traditional [[ Vodou|Vodou]] beliefs by secretly syncretizing it with Catholicism.

The  enacted the ''[[Code Noir]]'' ("Black Code"), prepared by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and ratified by [[Louis XIV]], which established rules on slave treatment and permissible freedoms. -Domingue has been described as one of the most brutally efficient slave colonies; at the end of the eighteenth century it was supplying two-thirds of Europe's tropical produce while one-third of newly imported Africans died within a few years. Many enslaved persons died from diseases such as [[smallpox]] and [[typhoid fever]]. They had low [[birth rate]]s, and there is evidence that some women [[abortion|aborted]] fetuses rather than give birth to children within the bonds of [[slavery]]. The colony's environment also suffered, as forests were cleared to make way for plantations and the land was overworked so as to extract maximum profit for  plantation owners.

[[File:Fire in -Domingo 1791,  copper engraving.jpg|thumb|-Domingue [[Slave rebellion|slave revolt]] in 1791]]
As in its [[Louisiana (New )|Louisiana colony]], the [[New | colonial]] government allowed some rights to [[free people of color]] ({{Lang|fr|gens de couleur}}), the [[mixed-race]] descendants of European male colonists and African enslaved females (and later, mixed-race women). Over time, many were released from slavery and they established a separate [[social class]]. White  [[Creole peoples|Creole]] fathers frequently sent their mixed-race sons to [[]] for their education. Some men of color were admitted into the military. More of the free people of color lived in the south of the island, near [[Port-au-Prince]], and many intermarried within their community. They frequently worked as artisans and tradesmen, and began to own some property, including enslaved persons of their own. The free people of color petitioned the [[New |colonial]] government to expand their rights.

The brutality of slave life led many people in bondage to escape to mountainous regions, where they set up their own autonomous communities and became known as [[ Maroon|maroons]]. One maroon leader, [[François Mackandal]], led a rebellion in the 1750s; however, he was later captured and executed by the .

==== Revolution (1791–1804)====
{{Main| Revolution}}
[[File:Général Toussaint Louverture.jpg|thumb|upright|General Toussaint Louverture]]
Inspired by the [[ Revolution]] of 1789 and principles of the [[rights of man]], the  settlers and free people of color pressed for greater political freedom and more [[civil rights]]. Tensions between these two groups led to conflict, as a militia of free-coloreds was set up in 1790 by [[ Ogé]], resulting in his capture, torture and execution. Sensing an opportunity, in August 1791 the first slave armies were established in northern  under the leadership of [[Toussaint Louverture]] inspired by the Vodou ''houngan'' (priest) Boukman, and backed by the  in Santo Domingo – soon a full-blown slave rebellion had broken out across the entire colony.

In 1792, the [[ First Republic|]] government sent three commissioners with troops to re-establish control; to build an alliance with the ''[[gens de couleur]]'' and enslaved persons commissioners [[Léger-Félicité Sonthonax]] and [[Étienne Polverel]] abolished slavery in the colony. Six months later, the [[National Convention]], led by [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] and the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]], endorsed [[abolition of slavery timeline|abolition]] and extended it to all the  colonies.

The [[]], which was a new republic itself, oscillated between supporting or not supporting [[Toussaint Louverture]] and the emerging country of , depending on who was President of the US. Washington, who was a slave holder and isolationist, kept the  neutral, although private US citizens at times provided aid to  [[Planter (plantation owner)|planters]] trying to put down the revolt. [[John Adams]], a vocal opponent of slavery, fully supported the slave revolt by providing diplomatic recognition, financial support, munitions and warships (including the [[USS Constitution]]) beginning in 1798. This support ended in 1801 when Jefferson, another slave-holding president, took office and recalled the US Navy.

With slavery abolished, Toussaint Louverture pledged allegiance to , and he fought off the  and  forces who had taken advantage of the situation and invaded -Domingue. The  were later forced to cede their part of the island to  under the terms of the [[Peace of Basel]] in 1795, uniting the island under one government. However, an insurgency against  rule broke out in the east, and in the west there was fighting between Louverture's forces and the free people of color led by [[André Rigaud]] in the [[War of the Knives]] (1799–1800). The ' support for the blacks in the war contributed to their victory over the mulattoes. More than 25,000 whites and free blacks left the island as refugees.

[[File:Battle for Palm Tree Hill.jpg|thumb|Battle between [[ Legions (Napoleonic period)| troops]] in  service and the [[ Revolution| rebels]]. The majority of  soldiers eventually deserted the  army and fought alongside the .]]
After Louverture created a separatist constitution and proclaimed himself governor-general for life, [[Napoléon Bonaparte]] in 1802 sent an [[-Domingue expedition|expedition]] of 20,000 soldiers and as many sailors under the command of his brother-in-law, [[Charles Leclerc (general, born 1772)|Charles Leclerc]], to reassert  control. The  achieved some victories, but within a few months most of their [[ Army|army]] had died from [[yellow fever]]. Ultimately more than 50,000  troops died in an attempt to retake the colony, including 18 generals. The  managed to capture Louverture, transporting him to  for trial. He was imprisoned at [[Fort de Joux]], where he died in 1803 of exposure and possibly [[tuberculosis]].
[[File:Revenge taken by the Black Army for the Cruelties practised on them by the .png|thumb| hanging  soldiers]]
The enslaved persons, along with free {{Lang|fr|gens de couleur}} and allies, continued their fight for independence, led by generals [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], [[Alexandre Pétion]] and [[Henry Christophe]]. The rebels finally managed to decisively defeat the  troops at the [[Battle of Vertières]] on 18 November 1803, establishing the first state ever to successfully gain independence through a slave revolt. Under the overall command of Dessalines, the  armies avoided open battle, and instead conducted a successful guerrilla campaign against the Napoleonic forces, working with diseases such as yellow fever to reduce the numbers of  soldiers. Later that year  withdrew its remaining 7,000 troops from the island and Napoleon gave up his idea of re-establishing a North  empire, selling [[Louisiana (New )]] to the [[]], in the [[Louisiana Purchase]].

Throughout the revolution, an estimated 20,000  troops succumbed to yellow fever, while another 37,000 were [[killed in action]], exceeding the total  soldiers killed in action across various 19th-century colonial campaigns in , , Indochina, , and West Africa, which resulted in approximately 10,000  soldiers killed in action combined. The  sustained 45,000 dead. Additionally, 200,000  died. In the process, Dessalines became arguably the most successful military commander in the struggle against Napoleonic .

====First Empire (1804–1806)====
{{main|First Empire of |1804  massacre}}
[[File:Le Serment des Ancêtres, 1823.jpg|thumb|Pétion and Dessalines swearing allegiance to each other before God; painting by [[Guillaume Guillon-Lethière|Guillon-Lethière]]]]

The independence of -Domingue was proclaimed under the native name '' by [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] on 1 January 1804 in [[Gonaïves]] and he was proclaimed "Emperor for Life" as Emperor Jacques I by his troops. Dessalines at first offered protection to the white planters and others. However, once in power, he ordered the [[1804  Massacre|genocide]] of nearly all the remaining whites; between January and April 1804, 3,000 to 5,000 whites were killed, including those who had been friendly and sympathetic to the black population. Only [[1804  massacre#Aftermath|three categories of white people]] were selected out as exceptions and spared: [[ |]] soldiers, some of whom had deserted from the  army and fought alongside the  rebels; the small group of [[ |]] colonists invited to the [[Nord-Ouest (department)|north-west region]]; and a group of [[Doctor of Medicine|medical doctors]] and professionals. Reportedly, people with connections to officers in the  army were also spared, as well as the women who agreed to marry non-white men.

Fearful of the potential impact the slave rebellion could have in the [[slave states]], U.S. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] refused to recognize the new republic. The Southern politicians who were a powerful voting bloc in the  Congress prevented U.S. recognition for decades until they withdrew in 1861 to form the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].

The revolution led to a wave of emigration. In 1809, 9,000 refugees from -Domingue, both white planters and people of color, settled ''en masse'' in [[New Orleans]], doubling the city's population, having been expelled from their initial refuge in  by  authorities. In addition, the newly arrived enslaved persons added to the city's African population.

The plantation system was re-established in , albeit for wages; however, many  were marginalized and resented the heavy-handed manner in which this was enforced in the new nation's politics. The rebel movement splintered, and Dessalines was assassinated by rivals on 17 October 1806.{{Deep link needed|date=March 2023}}

====State of , Kingdom of  and the Republic (1806–1820)====
{{main|State of |Kingdom of }}
[[File:Citadelle Laferrière Aerial View.jpg|thumb|left|[[Citadelle Laferrière]], built 1805–1822, is the largest [[fortress]] in the Americas, and is considered locally to be an [[eighth wonder of the world]].]]
After Dessalines' death  became split into two, with the [[Kingdom of ]] in the north directed by Henri Christophe, later declaring himself [[Henri Christophe|Henri I]], and a republic in the south centered on [[Port-au-Prince]], directed by [[Alexandre Pétion]], an ''homme de couleur''. Pétion's republic was less absolutist, and he initiated a series of land reforms which benefited the peasant class. President Pétion also gave military and financial assistance to the revolutionary leader [[Simón Bolívar]], which were critical in enabling him to liberate the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]]. Meanwhile, the , who had managed to maintain a precarious control of eastern Hispaniola, were [[ reconquest of Santo Domingo|defeated]] by insurgents led by [[Juan Sánchez Ramírez]], with the area returning to  rule in 1809 following the [[Battle of Palo Hincado]].

====Unification of Hispaniola (1821–1844)====
{{main|Republic of  (1820–1849)| occupation of Santo Domingo}}
[[File:President Jean-Pierre Boyer of  (Hispaniola Unification Regime) Portrait.jpg|thumb|Jean-Pierre Boyer, ruler of  1818–1843]]
Beginning in 1821, President [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], also an ''homme de couleur'' and successor to Pétion, reunified the island following the suicide of Henry Christophe. After [[Republic of  |Santo Domingo]] declared its independence from  on 30 November 1821, Boyer invaded, seeking to [[Unification of Hispaniola|unite the entire island]] by force and ending slavery in Santo Domingo.

Struggling to revive the agricultural economy to produce [[commodity crops]], Boyer passed the Code Rural, which denied peasant laborers the right to leave the land, enter the towns, or start farms or shops of their own, causing much resentment as most peasants wished to have their own farms rather than work on plantations.

Starting in September 1824, more than 6,000 [[African ]] migrated to , with transportation paid by an  philanthropic group similar in function to the [[ Colonization Society]] and its efforts in [[]].{{Better source needed|reason=The current source is insufficiently reliable ([[WP:NOTRS]]).|date=August 2025}} Many found the conditions too harsh and returned to the .{{Citation needed|date=June 2024}}

In July 1825, [[Charles X of |King Charles X]] of [[]], during a period of restoration of the [[ monarchy]], sent a [[ Navy|fleet]] to reconquer . Under pressure, President Boyer agreed to a treaty by which  formally recognized the independence of the state in exchange for [[ indemnity controversy|a payment]] of 150 million [[francs]], or $560 million in today's dollars. By an order of 17 April 1826, the King of  renounced his rights of sovereignty and formally recognized the independence of . The enforced payments to  hampered 's economic growth for years, exacerbated by the fact that many [[Western world|Western]] states continued to refuse formal [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] recognition to ; Britain recognized  independence in 1833, and the  not until 1862.  borrowed heavily from Western banks at extremely high interest rates to repay the debt, an amount estimated to be between $21 billion and $115 billion in lost economic growth over time, or as much as eight times the size of 's economy in 2020. Although the amount of the reparations was reduced to 90 million in 1838, by 1900 80% of 's government spending was debt repayment and the country did not finish repaying it until 1947.

====Loss of the eastern portion of the island====
{{main| War of Independence}}
After losing the support of 's elite, Boyer was ousted in 1843, with [[Charles Rivière-Hérard]] replacing him as president. Nationalist  forces in eastern Hispaniola led by [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] seized control of Santo Domingo on 27 February 1844. The  forces, unprepared for a significant uprising, capitulated to the rebels, effectively ending  rule of eastern Hispaniola. In March, Rivière-Hérard attempted to reimpose his authority, but the [[|]] inflicted heavy losses. Rivière-Hérard was removed from office by the mulatto hierarchy and replaced with the aged general [[Philippe Guerrier]], who assumed the presidency on 3 May 1844.

Guerrier died in April 1845, and was succeeded by General [[Jean-Louis Pierrot]]. Pierrot's most pressing duty as the new president was to check the incursions of the , who were harassing the  troops.  gunboats were also making depredations on 's coasts. President Pierrot decided to open a campaign against the , whom he considered merely as insurgents; however, the  offensive of 1845 was stopped on the frontier.

On 1 January 1846, Pierrot announced a fresh campaign to reimpose  suzerainty over eastern Hispaniola, but his officers and men greeted this fresh summons with contempt. Thus, a month later – February 1846 – when Pierrot ordered his troops to march against the , the  army mutinied, and its soldiers proclaimed his overthrow as president of the republic. With the war against the  having become very unpopular in , it was beyond the power of the new president, General [[Jean-Baptiste Riché]], to stage another invasion.

====Second Empire (1849–1859)====
{{main|Second Empire of }}
[[File:Faustin I.jpg|thumb|Faustin I, from ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 16 February 1856]]
On 27 February 1847, President Riché died after only a year in power and was replaced by an obscure officer, General [[Faustin Soulouque]]. During the first two years of Soulouque's administration the conspiracies and opposition he faced in retaining power were so manifold that the  were given a further breathing space in which to consolidate their independence. But, when in 1848  finally recognized the  as a free and independent state and provisionally signed a treaty of peace, friendship, commerce and navigation,  immediately protested, claiming the treaty was an attack upon their own security. Soulouque decided to invade the new Republic before the  Government could ratify the treaty.

On 21 March 1849,  soldiers attacked the  garrison at [[Las Matas de Farfán|Las Matas]]. The demoralized defenders offered almost no resistance before abandoning their weapons. Soulouque pressed on, capturing [[San Juan Province ()|San Juan]]. This left only the town of [[Azua, |Azua]] as the remaining  stronghold between the  army and the capital. On 6 April, Azua fell to the 18,000-strong  army, with a 5,000-man  counterattack failing to oust them. The way to [[Santo Domingo]] was now clear. But the news of discontent existing at Port-au-Prince, which reached Soulouque, arrested his further progress and caused him to return with the army to his capital.

Emboldened by the sudden retreat of the  army, the  counter-attacked. Their flotilla went as far as [[Dame-Marie, Grand'Anse|Dame-Marie]] on the west coast of , which they plundered and set on fire. After another  campaign in 1855, Britain and  intervened and obtained an armistice on behalf of the , who declared independence as the .

The sufferings endured by the soldiers during the campaign of 1855, and the losses and sacrifices inflicted on the country without yielding any compensation or any practical results provoked great discontent. In 1858 a revolution began, led by General [[Fabre Geffrard]], Duke of Tabara. In December of that year, Geffrard defeated the Imperial Army and seized control of most of the country. As a result, the Emperor abdicated his throne on 15 January 1859. Faustin was taken into exile and General Geffrard succeeded him as president.

====Late 19th century–early 20th century====
[[File:Luders Affair, , .jpg|thumb| Captain Thiele of the ''Charlotte'' handing over the  Ultimatum on 6 December 1897 during the Lüders Affair]]
The period following Soulouque's overthrow down to the turn of the century was a turbulent one for , with repeated bouts of political instability. President Geffrard was overthrown in a coup in 1867, as was his successor, [[Sylvain Salnave]], in 1869. Under the Presidency of [[Michel Domingue]] (1874–76) relations with the  were dramatically improved by the signing of a treaty, in which both parties acknowledged the independence of the other. Some modernisation of the economy and infrastructure also occurred in this period, especially under the Presidencies of [[Lysius Salomon]] (1879–1888) and [[Florvil Hyppolite]] (1889–1896).

's relations with outside powers were often strained. In 1889 the  attempted to [[Môle -Nicolas affair|force ]] to permit the building of a naval base at [[Môle -Nicolas]], which was firmly resisted by President Hyppolite. In 1892 the [[ Empire| government]] supported suppression of the reform movement of [[Anténor Firmin]], and in 1897, the  used [[gunboat diplomacy]] to intimidate and then humiliate the  government of President [[Tirésias Simon Sam]] (1896–1902) during the [[Lüders Affair]].

In the first decades of the 20th century,  experienced great political instability and was heavily in debt to ,  and the . A series of short lived presidencies came and went: President [[Pierre Nord Alexis]] was forced from power in 1908, as was his successor [[François C. Antoine Simon]] in 1911; President [[Cincinnatus Leconte]] (1911–12) was killed in a (possibly deliberate) explosion at the National Palace; [[Michel Oreste]] (1913–14) was ousted in a coup, as was his successor [[Oreste Zamor]] in 1914.

==== occupation (1915–1934)====
{{main| occupation of }}

 increased its influence in  in this period, with a small community of  settlers wielding disproportionate influence in 's economy. The  influence prompted anxieties in the , who had also invested heavily in the country, and whose government defended their right to oppose foreign interference in the Americas under the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. In December 1914, the  removed $500,000 from the  National Bank, but rather than seize it to help pay the debt, it was removed for safe-keeping in New York, thus giving the  control of the bank and preventing other powers from doing so. This gave a stable financial base on which to build the economy, and to enable the debt to be repaid.

In 1915, 's new President [[Vilbrun Guillaume Sam]] sought to strengthen his tenuous rule by a mass execution of 167 political prisoners. Outrage at the killings led to riots, and Sam was captured and killed by a lynch mob. Fearing possible foreign intervention, or the emergence of a new government led by the anti-  politician [[Rosalvo Bobo]], President [[Woodrow Wilson]] sent U.S. Marines into  in July 1915. The {{USS|Washington|ACR-11|6}}, under Rear Admiral [[William Banks Caperton|Caperton]], arrived in Port-au-Prince in an attempt to restore order and protect U.S. interests. Within days, the Marines had taken control of the capital city and its banks and customs house. The Marines declared martial law and severely censored the press. Within weeks, a new pro-U.S.  president, [[Philippe Sudré Dartiguenave]], was installed and a new constitution written that was favorable to the interests of the . The constitution (written by future US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]) included a clause that allowed, for the first time, foreign ownership of land in , which was bitterly opposed by the  legislature and citizenry.

[[File:Corps de Charlemagne Péralte.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The body of caco leader Charlemagne Péralte on display after his execution by US forces; the image was counterproductive, with the resemblance to the [[Descent from the Cross|deposition of Jesus]] gaining Péralte the status of national martyr.]]
The occupation improved some of 's [[infrastructure]] and centralized power in Port-au-Prince. 1700&nbsp;km of roads were made usable, 189 bridges were built, many irrigation canals were rehabilitated, hospitals, schools, and public buildings were constructed, and drinking water was brought to the main cities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} Agricultural education was organized, with a central school of agriculture and 69 farms in the country.{{sfn|Heinl|1996|pp=454–455}}{{incomplete short citation|date=February 2023}} However, many infrastructure projects were built using the [[corvée]] system that allowed the government/occupying forces to take people from their homes and farms, at gunpoint if necessary, to build roads, bridges etc. by force, a process that was deeply resented by ordinary . [[Sisal]] was also introduced to , and sugarcane and [[cotton]] became significant exports, boosting prosperity.  traditionalists, based in rural areas, were highly resistant to U.S.-backed changes, while the urban elites, typically mixed-race, welcomed the growing economy, but wanted more political control. Together they helped secure an end to the occupation in 1934, under the Presidency of [[Sténio ]] (1930–1941). The debts were still outstanding, though less due to increased prosperity, and the U.S. financial advisor-general receiver handled the budget until 1941.

The U.S. Marines were instilled with a special brand of paternalism towards  "expressed in the metaphor of a father's relationship with his children." Armed opposition to the US presence was led by the [[Cacos (military group)|cacos]] under the command of [[Charlemagne Péralte]]; his capture and execution in 1919 earned him the status of a national martyr. During Senate hearings in 1921, the commandant of the Marine Corps reported that, in the 20 months of active unrest, 2,250  had been killed. However, in a report to the Secretary of the Navy, he reported the death toll as being 3,250.  historians have claimed the true number was much higher, but this is not supported by most historians outside .

====Post-occupation era (1934–1957)====
After U.S. forces left in 1934,  dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] used [[Antihaitianismo|anti-]] sentiment as a nationalist tool. In 1937, in an event that became known as the [[Parsley massacre|Parsley Massacre]], he ordered his army to kill  living on the  side of the border. Few bullets were used; instead, 20,000–30,000  were bludgeoned and bayoneted, then herded into the sea, where sharks finished what Trujillo had begun. The indiscriminate massacre occurred over a period of five days and involved hundreds of  troops.

 President [[Sténio |]], under U.S. pressure owing to his increasingly dictatorial actions, resigned in 1941 and was replaced by [[Élie Lescot]] (1941–46). In 1941, during the [[Second World War]], Lescot declared war on [[Empire of |]] (8 December), [[Nazi |]] (12 December), [[Kingdom of |]] (12 December), [[Kingdom of |]] (24 December), [[Kingdom of  (1920-46)|]] (24 December) and [[Kingdom of |]] (24 December). Out of these six [[Axis Powers|Axis]] countries, only  reciprocated, declaring war on  on the same day (24 December 1941). On 27 September 1945,  became a [[member states of the United Nations|founding member]] of the [[United Nations]] (the successor to the [[Member states of the League of Nations|League of Nations]], of which  was also a founding member).

In 1946, Lescot was overthrown by the military, with [[Dumarsais Estimé]] later becoming the new president (1946–50). Estimé sought to improve the economy and education, and to boost the role of black ; however, as he sought to consolidate his rule he too was overthrown in a coup led by [[Paul Magloire]], who replaced him as president (1950–56). Firmly anti-Communist, he was supported by the ; with greater political stability tourists started to visit . The waterfront area of Port-au-Prince was redeveloped to allow cruise ship passengers to walk to cultural attractions.

====Duvalier dynasty (1957–1986)====
{{main|Duvalier dynasty}}
[[File:Duvalier crop2.jpg|thumb|upright|"Papa Doc" [[François Duvalier|Duvalier]] in 1968]]
In 1956–57  underwent severe political turmoil; Magloire was forced to resign and leave the country in 1956 and he was followed by four short-lived presidencies. In the [[ presidential election, 1957|September 1957 election]] [[François Duvalier]] was elected President of . Known as 'Papa Doc' and initially popular, Duvalier remained President until his death in 1971. He advanced black interests in the public sector, where over time, people of color had predominated as the educated urban elite. Not trusting the army, despite his frequent purges of officers deemed disloyal, Duvalier created a private militia known as ''[[Tonton Macoute|Tontons Macoutes]]'' ("Bogeymen"), which maintained order by terrorizing the populace and political opponents. In 1964 Duvalier proclaimed himself 'President for Life'; [[Jérémie Vespers|an uprising]] against his rule that year in [[Jérémie]] was violently suppressed, with the ringleaders publicly executed and hundreds of mixed-raced citizens in the town killed. The bulk of the educated and professional class began leaving the country, and corruption became widespread. Duvalier sought to create a personality cult, identifying himself with [[Baron Samedi]], one of the [[loa]] (or ''lwa''), or spirits, of [[ Vodou]]. Despite the well-publicized abuses under his rule, Duvalier's firm anti-Communism earned him the support of the , who furnished the country with aid.

In 1971, Duvalier died, and he was succeeded by his son [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]], nicknamed 'Baby Doc', who ruled until 1986. He largely continued his father's policies, though curbed some of the worst excesses in order to court international respectability. Tourism, which had nosedived in Papa Doc's time, again became a growing industry. However, as the economy continued to decline, Baby Doc's grip on power began to weaken. 's pig population was slaughtered following an outbreak of swine fever in the late 1970s, causing hardship to rural communities who used them as an investment. The opposition became more vocal, bolstered by a visit to the country by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1983, who publicly lambasted the president. Demonstrations occurred in Gonaïves in 1985 which then spread across the country; under pressure from the , Duvalier left the country in February 1986.

In total, roughly 40,000 to 60,000  are estimated to have been killed during the reign of the Duvaliers. Through the use of his intimidation tactics and executions, many intellectual  had fled, leaving the country with a massive brain-drain from which it has yet to recover.

====Post-Duvalier era (1986–2004)====
[[File:DD-SD-99-03743.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] returns to  following the [[Operation Uphold Democracy|U.S.-led invasion]] in 1994 designed to remove the [[Raoul Cédras|regime]] installed by the [[1991  coup d'état]]]]
Following Duvalier's departure, army leader General [[Henri Namphy]] headed a new [[National Council of Government ()|National Governing Council]]. [[ presidential election, 1987|Elections]] scheduled for November 1987 were aborted after dozens of inhabitants were shot in the capital by soldiers and ''Tontons Macoutes''. Fraudulent [[ presidential election, 1988|elections followed]] in 1988, in which only 4% of the citizenry voted. The newly elected president, [[Leslie Manigat]], was then overthrown some months later in the [[June 1988  coup d'état]].

Another [[September 1988  coup d'état|coup followed]] in September 1988, after the [[St. Jean Bosco massacre]] in which approximately 13 to 50 people were killed while attending a mass led by prominent government critic and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priest [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]]. General [[Prosper Avril]] subsequently led a military regime until March 1990.

Avril transferred power to the army chief of staff, General [[Hérard Abraham]], on 10 March 1990. Abraham gave up power three days later, becoming the only military leader in  during the twentieth century to voluntarily give up power. Abraham later helped to secure the [[1990–91  general election]].

In December 1990, Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected president in the [[ general election, 1990–91| general election]]. However, his ambitious reformist agenda worried the elites, and in September of the following year he was overthrown by the military, led by [[Raoul Cédras]], in the [[1991  coup d'état]]. Amidst the continuing turmoil many  attempted to flee the country.

In September 1994, the  negotiated the departure of 's military leaders and the peaceful entry of 20,000 US troops under [[Operation Uphold Democracy]]. This enabled the restoration of the democratically elected Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president, who returned to  in October to complete his term. As part of the deal Aristide had to implement free market reforms in an attempt to improve the  economy, with mixed results. In November 1994, [[Hurricane Gordon (1994)|Hurricane Gordon]] brushed , dumping heavy rain and creating [[flash flood]]ing that triggered mudslides. Gordon killed an estimated 1,122 people, although some estimates go as high as 2,200.

[[1995  general election|Elections]] were held in 1995 which were won by [[René Préval]], gaining 88% of the popular vote, albeit on a low turnout. Aristide subsequently formed his own party, [[Fanmi Lavalas]], and political deadlock ensued; the [[ presidential election, 2000|November 2000 election]] returned Aristide to the presidency with 92% of the vote. The election had been boycotted by the opposition, then organized into the [[Convergence Démocratique]], over a dispute in the [[ legislative election, 2000|May legislative elections]]. In subsequent years, there was increasing violence between rival political factions and [[human rights abuse]]s. Aristide spent years negotiating with the Convergence Démocratique on new elections, but the Convergence's inability to develop a sufficient electoral base made elections unattractive.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

In 2004, [[2004  coup d'état|an anti-Aristide revolt began]] in northern . The rebellion eventually reached the capital, and Aristide was forced into exile. The precise nature of the events are disputed; some, including Aristide and his bodyguard, Franz Gabriel, stated that he was the victim of a "new [[coup d'état]] or modern kidnapping" by U.S. forces. These charges were denied by the US government. As political violence and crime continued to grow, a [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in |United Nations Stabilisation Mission (MINUSTAH)]] was brought in to maintain order. However, MINUSTAH proved controversial, since their periodically heavy-handed approach to maintaining law and order and several instances of abuses, including the alleged sexual abuse of civilians, provoked resentment and distrust among ordinary .

[[Boniface Alexandre]] assumed interim authority until 2006, when René Préval was re-elected President following [[ general election, 2006|elections]] with 55% voter turnout.

====Post-Aristide era (2004–present)====
{{See also| crisis (2018–present)}}
Amidst the continuing political chaos, a series of natural disasters hit . In 2004, [[Hurricane Jeanne#|Tropical Storm Jeanne]] skimmed the north coast, leaving 3,006 people dead in flooding and [[mudslide]]s, mostly in the city of [[Gonaïves]]. In 2008,  was again struck by tropical storms; [[Tropical Storm Fay (2008)|Tropical Storm Fay]], [[Hurricane Gustav]], [[Hurricane Hanna (2008)|Hurricane Hanna]] and [[Hurricane Ike]] all produced heavy winds and rain, resulting in 331 deaths and about 800,000 in need of humanitarian aid. The state of affairs produced by these storms was intensified by already high food and fuel prices that had caused a food crisis and political unrest in April 2008.

[[File: national palace earthquake.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The [[National Palace ()| National Palace]], located in Port-au-Prince, , heavily damaged after the [[2010  earthquake|earthquake of 2010]]. This was originally a two-story structure; the second story completely collapsed.]]

On 12 January 2010, at 4:53pm local time,  was struck by a [[moment magnitude scale|magnitude]]-7.0 [[2010  earthquake|earthquake]]. This was the country's most severe earthquake in over 200 years. The earthquake was reported to have left between 160,000 and 300,000 people dead and up to 1.6 million homeless, making it one of the [[List of natural disasters by death toll|deadliest natural disasters ever recorded]]. An estimated 80% of schools, more than half of 's hospitals were destroyed or damaged. It is also one of the deadliest earthquakes ever recorded. The situation was exacerbated by a subsequent massive [[ cholera outbreak|cholera outbreak]] that was triggered when cholera-infected waste from a [[United Nations]] peacekeeping station contaminated the country's main river, the [[Artibonite River|Artibonite]]. In 2017, it was reported that roughly 10,000  had died and nearly a million had been made ill. After years of denial, the United Nations apologized in 2016, but {{as of|2017|lc=y}}, they have refused to acknowledge fault, thus avoiding financial responsibility.

General elections had been planned for January 2010 but were postponed due to the earthquake. [[2010–11  general election|Elections were held on 28 November 2010]] for the senate, the parliament and the first round of the presidential elections. The run-off between [[Michel Martelly]] and [[Mirlande Manigat]] took place on 20 March 2011, and preliminary results, released on 4 April, named Michel Martelly the winner. In 2011, both former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier and Jean-Bertrand Aristide returned to ; attempts to try Duvalier for crimes committed under his rule were shelved following his death in 2014. In 2013, the  government called for European governments to pay [[reparations for slavery]] and establish an official commission for the settlement of past wrongdoings. Meanwhile, after continuing political wrangling with the opposition and allegations of electoral fraud, Martelly agreed to step down in 2016 without a successor in place. After numerous postponements, partly owing to the effects of devastating [[Hurricane Matthew]], [[November 2016  presidential election|elections]] were held in November 2016 with a record low voter turnout of just 17%. The victor, [[Jovenel Moïse]] of the [[ Tèt Kale Party]], was sworn in as president in 2017. [[ crisis (2018–present)|Protests began]] on 7 July 2018, in response to increased fuel prices. Over time these protests evolved into demands for the resignation of president Moïse.

On 7 July 2021, President Moïse was [[Assassination of Jovenel Moïse|assassinated]] in an attack on his private residence, and First Lady [[Martine Moïse]] was hospitalized. Amid the political crisis, the government of  installed [[Ariel Henry]] as the acting prime minister on 20 July 2021. On 14 August 2021,  suffered [[2021  earthquake|another huge earthquake]], with many casualties. The earthquake also damaged 's economic conditions and led to a rise in [[Gang|gang violence]] which, by September 2021, had escalated to a long-lasting full-blown [[Gang war in |gang war]] and other violent crimes within the country. As of March 2022,  still had no president, no parliamentary quorum, and a dysfunctional high court due to a lack of judges. In 2022, [[2022  crisis|protests]] against the government and [[Global energy crisis (2021–present)|rising fuel prices]] intensified.

By the end of 2023, gangs and armed groups controlled an estimated 80% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. During 2023, gangs killed 4,789 people, kidnapped 2,490 more and displaced an estimated 362,000 from their homes (mostly in Port-au-Prince). Doctors, lawyers, and other wealthy members of society were kidnapped and held for ransom. Many victims were killed when ransom demands were not met, leading those with the means to do so to flee the country, further hampering efforts to pull the country out of the crisis. It is estimated that amidst the crisis up to 20% of qualified medical staff had left  by the end of 2023.

In March 2024, Ariel Henry was prevented by gangs from returning to , following a visit to [[]]. Henry agreed to resign once a transitional government had been formed. As of that month, nearly half of 's population was living under [[Hunger|acute food insecurity]], according to the [[World Food Programme]]. On 25 April 2024, the [[Transitional Presidential Council]] took over the Governance of  and is scheduled to stay in power until 2026.  [[Michel Patrick Boisvert]] was named interim prime minister. On 3 June 2024, the council swore in [[Garry Conille]] as acting prime minister. On 10 November 2024, [[Alix Didier Fils-Aimé]] replaced Conille as acting prime minister.
