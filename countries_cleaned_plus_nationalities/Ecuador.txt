Various peoples had settled in the area of future  before the arrival of the [[Incas]]. The archeological evidence suggests that the [[Paleo-Indians]]' first dispersal into the Americas occurred near the end of the [[last glacial period]], around 16,500–13,000 years ago. The first people who reached  may have journeyed by land from [[North America|North]] and [[Central America]] or by boat down the Pacific Ocean coastline.

Even though their languages were unrelated, these groups developed similar groups of cultures, each based in different environments. The people of the coast combined agriculture with fishing, hunting, and gathering; the people of the highland Andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life; and peoples of the Amazon basin relied on hunting and gathering; in some cases, this is combined with agriculture and [[arboriculture]].

Many civilizations arose in , such as the [[Valdivia Culture]] and [[Machalilla Culture]] on the coast, the [[Quitu culture|Quitus]] (near present-day Quito), and the [[Cañari]] (near present-day [[Cuenca, |Cuenca]]).

In the highland Andes mountains, where life was more sedentary, groups of tribes cooperated and formed villages; thus the first nations based on agricultural resources and the domestication of animals formed. Eventually, through wars and marriage alliances of their [[leader]]s, groups of nations formed confederations.

When the [[Incas]] arrived, they found that these confederations were so developed that it took the Incas two generations of rulers—[[Topa Inca Yupanqui]] and [[Huayna Capac]]—to absorb them into the [[Inca Empire]]. People belonging to the confederations that gave them the most problems were deported to distant areas of , , and north . Similarly, a number of loyal Inca subjects from  and  were brought to  to prevent rebellion. Thus, the region of highland  became part of the [[Inca Empire]] in 1463 sharing the same language.

In contrast, when the Incas made incursions into coastal  and the eastern Amazon jungles of , they found both the environment and indigenous people more hostile. Moreover, when the Incas tried to subdue them, these indigenous people withdrew to the interior and resorted to [[guerrilla]] tactics. As a result, Inca expansion into the Amazon Basin and the Pacific coast of  was hampered. The indigenous people of the Amazon jungle and coastal  remained relatively autonomous until the  soldiers and missionaries arrived in force. The Amazonian people and the [[Chachi people|Cayapas]] of Coastal  were the only groups to resist both Inca and  domination, maintaining their languages and cultures well into the 21st century.

Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the Inca Empire was involved in a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]]. The untimely death of both the heir [[Ninan Cuyochi]] and the Emperor Huayna Capac, from a European disease that spread into , created a power vacuum between two factions and led to a civil war. The army stationed north headed by Atahualpa marched south to Cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with his brother. In 1532, a small band of Spaniards headed by [[Francisco Pizarro]] reached [[Cajamarca]] and lured Atahualpa into a trap ([[battle of Cajamarca]]). Pizarro promised to release Atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling a room full of gold. But, after a mock trial, the Spaniards executed Atahualpa by strangulation.

New infectious diseases such as [[smallpox]], endemic to the Europeans, caused high fatalities among the Amerindian population during the first decades of  rule, as they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. At the same time, the natives were forced into the ''[[encomienda]]'' labor system for the . In 1563, [[Quito]] became the seat of a [[Royal Audience of Quito|real audiencia]] (administrative district) of  and part of the [[Viceroyalty of ]] and later the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].

The [[1797 Riobamba earthquake]], which caused up to 40,000 casualties, was studied by [[Alexander von Humboldt]], when he visited the area in 1801–1802.

After nearly 300 years of  rule, Quito still remained small with a population of 10,000 people. On 10 August 1809, the city's ''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'' called for independence from  (first among the peoples of Latin America). They were led by Juan Pío Montúfar, Quiroga, Salinas, and Bishop Cuero y Caicedo. Quito's nickname, "''[[Luz de América]]''" ("Light of America"), is based on its leading role in trying to secure an independent, local government. {{Citation needed|date=June 2025}} Although the new government lasted no more than two months, it had important repercussions and was an inspiration for the independence movement of the rest of  America. Today, 10 August is celebrated as Independence Day, a [[Public holidays in |national holiday]].

===Independence===

[[File:Jose Antonio de Sucre.JPG|thumb|upright| independence hero [[Antonio José de Sucre]]]]
[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Guayaquil Conference]] between the two Hispanic South  heroes of independence, [[José de San Martín|San Martín]] and [[Simón Bolívar|Bolívar]]]]

On 9 October 1820, the Department of [[Guayaquil]] became the first territory in  to gain its independence from , and it spawned most of the Ecuadorian coastal provinces, establishing itself as an independent state. Its inhabitants celebrated what is now 's official Independence Day on 24 May 1822. The rest of  gained its independence after [[Antonio José de Sucre]] defeated the  Royalist forces at the [[Battle of Pichincha]], near [[Quito]]. Following the battle,  joined [[Simón Bolívar]]'s [[Republic of Gran ]], also including modern-day [[]], [[]], and [[]]. In 1830,  separated from Gran  and became an independent republic. Two years later, it annexed the [[Galapagos Islands]].

The 19th century was marked by instability for  with a rapid succession of rulers. The first president of  was the -born [[Juan José Flores]], who was ultimately deposed. Leaders who followed him included [[Vicente Rocafuerte]]; [[José Joaquín de Olmedo]]; [[José María Urbina]]; [[Diego Noboa]]; [[Pedro José de Arteta]]; [[Manuel de Ascásubi]]; and Flores's own son, [[Antonio Flores Jijón]], among others. The conservative [[Gabriel García Moreno]] unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the Roman Catholic Church. In the late 19th century, world demand for [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] tied the economy to commodity exports and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast.

 [[Abolition of slavery timeline|abolished]] [[Slavery in Latin America|slavery]] in 1851. The descendants of enslaved Ecuadorians are among today's [[Afro-Ecuadorian]] population. Also abolished during this time was indigenous tribute in 1857. Upon this, the indigenous were now equal under the law compared to everyone else. They were now registered as contributors to the nation, and became roles such as property holders, taxpayers, and potential military recruits just as everyone else.

===Liberal Revolution===
{{Main|Liberal Revolution of 1895}}
The Liberal Revolution of 1895 under [[Eloy Alfaro]] reduced the power of the clergy and the conservative land owners. This liberal wing retained power until the military "Julian Revolution" of 1925. The 1930s and 1940s were marked by instability and emergence of populist politicians, such as five-time President [[José María Velasco Ibarra]].

===Loss of claimed territories since 1830===
{{Main|Ecuadorian– territorial dispute}}
{{Campaignbox Ecuadorian-}}

After 's separation from  on 13 May 1830, its first President, General [[Juan José Flores]], laid claim to the territory that had belonged to the [[Real Audiencia of Quito]], also referred to as the Presidencia of Quito. He supported his claims with  Royal decrees, or ''real cedulas'', that delineated the borders of 's former overseas colonies. In the case of , Flores based 's ''[[de jure]]'' claims on the Real Cedulas of 1563, 1739, and 1740; with modifications in the Amazon Basin and Andes Mountains that were introduced through the [[Treaty of Guayaquil]] (1829) which  reluctantly signed, after the overwhelmingly outnumbered Gran  force led by [[Antonio José de Sucre]] defeated President and General La Mar's  invasion force in the [[Battle of Tarqui]]. In addition, 's eastern border with the  colony of  in the Amazon Basin was modified before the Wars of Independence by the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso]] (1777) between the [[ Empire]] and the [[ Empire]]. Moreover, to add legitimacy to his claims, on 16 February 1840, Flores signed a treaty with , whereby Flores convinced  to officially recognize Ecuadorian independence and its sole rights to colonial titles over 's former colonial territory known anciently to  as the Kingdom and Presidency of Quito.

 during its long and turbulent history has lost most of its contested territories to each of its more powerful neighbors, such as  in 1832 and 1916,  in 1904 through a series of peace treaties, and  after a short war in which the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro was signed in 1942.{{cn|date=June 2025}}

===Struggle for independence===

During the [[  wars of independence|struggle for independence]], before  or  became independent, areas of the former Vice Royalty of New Granada declared themselves independent from . A few months later, a part of the  liberation army of San Martín decided to occupy the independent cities of Tumbez and Jaén, with the intention of using them as springboards to occupy the independent city of Guayaquil and then liberate the rest of the Audiencia de Quito (). It was common knowledge among officers of the liberation army from the south that their leader [[José de San Martín|San Martín]] wished to liberate present-day  and add it to the future republic of , since it had been part of the Inca Empire before the Spaniards conquered it. However, [[Simón Bolívar|Bolívar]]'s intention was to form a new republic known as the [[Gran ]], out of the liberated  territory of New Granada which consisted of , , and . San Martín's plans were thwarted when Bolívar, descended from the Andes mountains and occupied Guayaquil; they also annexed the newly liberated Audiencia de Quito to the Republic of Gran .

In the south,  had claims to a small piece of land beside the Pacific Ocean known as [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]]. In 's southern Andes Mountain region where the Marañon cuts across,  had claims to an area it called [[Jaén, |Jaén de Bracamoros]]. These areas were included as part of the territory of Gran  by Bolivar on 17 December 1819, during the [[Congress of Angostura]] when the Republic of Gran  was created. Tumbes declared itself independent from  on 17 January 1821, and Jaén de Bracamoros on 17 June 1821, without any outside help from revolutionary armies. However, that same year,  forces participating in the Trujillo revolution occupied both Jaén and Tumbes.  generals, without any legal titles backing them up and with  still federated with the Gran , had the desire to annex  to the Republic of  at the expense of the Gran , feeling that  was once part of the Inca Empire.

On 28 July 1821,  independence was proclaimed in Lima by San Martín, and Tumbes and Jaén, which were included as part of the revolution of Trujillo by the  occupying force, had the whole region swear allegiance to the new  flag and incorporated itself into . Gran  had always protested  for the return of Jaén and Tumbes for almost a decade, then finally Bolivar after long and futile discussion over the return of Jaén, Tumbes, and part of Mainas, declared war. President and General [[José de La Mar]], who was born in , believing his opportunity had come to annex the District of  to , personally, with a  force, invaded and occupied Guayaquil and a few cities in the Loja region of southern  on 28 November 1828.

The war ended when an outnumbered southern Gran  army at [[Battle of Tarqui]] on 27 February 1829, led by [[Antonio José de Sucre]], defeated the  invasion force led by President La Mar. This defeat led to the signing of the Treaty of Guayaquil in September 1829, whereby  and its Congress recognized Gran  rights over Tumbes, Jaén, and Maynas. Through meetings between  and Gran , the border was set as Tumbes river in the west, and in the east, the Maranon and Amazon rivers were to be followed toward  as the most natural borders between them. According to the peace negotiations  agreed to return Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Jaén; despite this,  returned Guayaquil, but failed to return Tumbes and Jaén, alleging that it was not obligated to follow the agreements, since the Gran  ceased to exist when it divided itself into three different nations – , , and .

[[File:AGHRC (1890) - Carta XI - División política de , 1824.jpg|thumb|Map of the former [[Gran ]] in 1824 (named in its time as ), the Gran  covered all the colored region]]

The Central District of the Gran , known as Cundinamarca or New Granada (modern ) with its capital in Bogota, did not recognize the separation of the Southern District of the Gran , with its capital in Quito, from the Gran  federation on 13 May 1830. After 's separation, the [[Department of Cauca]] voluntarily decided to unite itself with  due to instability in the central government of Bogota. The  born President of , the general [[Juan José Flores]], with the approval of the Ecuadorian congress annexed the Department of Cauca on 20 December 1830, since the government of Cauca had called for union with the District of the South as far back as April 1830. Moreover, the Cauca region, throughout its long history, had very strong economic and cultural ties with the people of . Also, the Cauca region, which included such cities as [[Pasto, |Pasto]], [[Popayán]], and [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]], had always been dependent on the Presidencia or Audiencia of Quito.

Fruitless negotiations continued between the governments of Bogotá and Quito, where the government of Bogotá did not recognize the separation of  or that of Cauca from the Gran  until war broke out in May 1832. In five months, New Granada defeated  due to the fact that the majority of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces were composed of rebellious angry unpaid veterans from  and  that did not want to fight against their fellow countrymen. Seeing that his officers were rebelling, mutinying, and changing sides, President Flores had no option but to reluctantly make peace with New Granada. The Treaty of Pasto of 1832 was signed by which the Department of Cauca was turned over to New Granada (modern ), the government of Bogotá recognized  as an independent country and the border was to follow the Ley de División Territorial de la República de  (Law of the Division of Territory of the Gran ) passed on 25 June 1824. This law set the border at the river Carchi and the eastern border that stretched to  at the Caquetá river. Later,  contended that the Republic of , while reorganizing its government, unlawfully made its eastern border provisional and that  extended its claims south to the Napo River because it said that the Government of Popayán extended its control all the way to the Napo River.

====Struggle for possession of the Amazon Basin====
[[File:South America 1879.png|thumb|left|South America (1879): All land claims by , , , , , , and  in 1879.]]

When  seceded from the Gran ,  contested 's claims with the newly discovered ''Real Cedula'' of 1802, by which  claims the King of  had transferred these lands from the Viceroyalty of New Granada to the Viceroyalty of . During colonial times this was to halt the ever-expanding  settlements into  domains, which were left vacant and in disorder after the expulsion of Jesuit missionaries from their bases along the Amazon Basin.  countered by labeling the Cedula of 1802 an ecclesiastical instrument, which had nothing to do with political borders.  began its de facto occupation of disputed Amazonian territories, after it signed a secret 1851 peace treaty in favor of . This treaty disregarded  rights that were confirmed during colonial times by a - treaty over the Amazon regarding territories held by illegal  settlers.

 began occupying the missionary villages in the Mainas or Maynas region, which it began calling Loreto, with its capital in [[Iquitos]]. During its negotiations with ,  claimed Amazonian Basin territories up to Caqueta River in the north and toward the Andes Mountain range.  protested stating that its claims extended south toward the Napo and Amazon Rivers.  protested that it claimed the Amazon Basin between the Caqueta river and the Marañon-Amazon river.  ignored these protests and created the Department of Loreto in 1853 with its capital in Iquitos.  briefly occupied Guayaquil again in 1860, since  thought that  was selling some of the disputed land for development to British bond holders, but returned Guayaquil after a few months. The border dispute was then submitted to  for arbitration from 1880 to 1910, but to no avail.

In the early part of the 20th century,  made an effort to peacefully define its eastern Amazonian borders with its neighbors through negotiation. On 6 May 1904,  signed the Tobar-Rio Branco Treaty recognizing 's claims to the Amazon in recognition of 's claim to be an Amazonian country to counter 's earlier Treaty with  back on 23 October 1851. Then after a few meetings with the  government's representatives an agreement was reached and the Muñoz Vernaza-Suarez Treaty was signed 15 July 1916, in which  rights to the Putumayo river were recognized as well as 's rights to the Napo river and the new border was a line that ran midpoint between those two rivers. In this way,  gave up the claims it had to the Amazonian territories between the Caquetá River and Napo River to , thus cutting itself off from . Later, a brief war erupted between  and , over 's claims to the Caquetá region, which ended with  reluctantly signing the Salomon-Lozano Treaty on 24 March 1922.  protested this secret treaty, since  gave away Ecuadorian claimed land to  that  had given to  in 1916.

On 21 July 1924, the Ponce-Castro Oyanguren Protocol was signed between  and  where both agreed to hold direct negotiations and to resolve the dispute in an equitable manner and to submit the differing points of the dispute to the  for arbitration. Negotiations between the [[Ecuadorians|Ecuadorian]] and  representatives began in Washington on 30 September 1935. The negotiations turned into arguments during the next 7 months and finally on 29 September 1937, the  representatives decided to break off the negotiations.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}

In 1941, amid fast-growing tensions within disputed territories around the Zarumilla River, war broke out with .  claimed that 's military presence in -claimed territory was an invasion; , for its part, claimed that  had recently invaded  around the Zarumilla River and that  since 's independence from  has systematically occupied Tumbez, Jaén, and most of the disputed territories in the Amazonian Basin between the Putomayo and Marañon Rivers. In July 1941, troops were mobilized in both countries.  had an army of 11,681 troops who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed Ecuadorian force of 2,300, of which only 1,300 were deployed in the southern provinces. Hostilities erupted on 5 July 1941, when  forces crossed the Zarumilla river at several locations, testing the strength and resolve of the Ecuadorian border troops. Finally, on 23 July 1941, the Peruvians launched a major invasion, crossing the Zarumilla river in force and advancing into the Ecuadorian province of [[El Oro Province|El Oro]].

[[File:--land-claims-01.png|thumb|left|Map of Ecuadorian land claims after 1916]]

During the course of the [[Ecuadorian– War]],  gained control over part of the disputed territory and some parts of the province of El Oro, and some parts of the [[Loja Province|province of Loja]], demanding that the Ecuadorian government give up its territorial claims. The  Navy blocked the port of [[Guayaquil]], almost cutting all supplies to the Ecuadorian troops. After a few weeks of war and under pressure by the  and several Latin  nations, all fighting came to a stop.  and  came to an accord formalized in the [[Rio Protocol]], signed on 29 January 1942, in favor of hemispheric unity against the [[Axis powers]] in [[World War II]] favoring  with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end.

The 1944 Glorious May Revolution followed a military-civilian rebellion and a subsequent civic strike which successfully removed Carlos Arroyo del Río as a dictator from 's government. However, a post-Second World War recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s, while foreign companies developed oil resources in the Ecuadorian Amazon. In 1972, construction of the Andean pipeline was completed. The pipeline brought oil from the east side of the Andes to the coast, making  South America's second largest oil exporter.

[[File:Mirage F.1JA.JPG|thumb|The [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F.1JA]] (FAE-806) was one aircraft involved in the claimed shooting down of two  [[Sukhoi Su-22]] on 10 February 1995.]]
The [[Rio Protocol]] failed to precisely resolve the border along a little river in the remote ''Cordillera del Cóndor'' region in southern . This caused a long-simmering dispute between  and , which ultimately led to fighting between the two countries; first a border skirmish in January–February 1981 known as the [[Paquisha Incident]], and ultimately full-scale warfare in January 1995 where the Ecuadorian military shot down  aircraft and helicopters and  infantry marched into southern . Each country blamed the other for the onset of hostilities, known as the [[Cenepa War]]. [[Sixto Durán Ballén]], the Ecuadorian president, famously declared that he would not give up a single centimeter of . Popular sentiment in  became strongly [[nationalism|nationalistic]] against : graffiti could be seen on the walls of Quito referring to  as the "''Cain de Latinoamérica''", a reference to the murder of [[Abel]] by his brother [[Cain]] in the [[Book of Genesis]].

 and  signed the [[Brasilia Presidential Act]] peace agreement on 26 October 1998, which ended hostilities, and effectively put an end to the Western Hemisphere's longest running territorial dispute. The Guarantors of the [[Rio Protocol]] (, , , and the  of America) ruled that the border of the undelineated zone was to be set at the line of the ''Cordillera del Cóndor''. While  had to give up its decades-old territorial claims to the eastern slopes of the Cordillera, as well as to the entire western area of Cenepa headwaters,  was compelled to give to , in perpetual lease but without sovereignty, {{convert|1|km2|abbr=on|sp=us}} of its territory, in the area where the Ecuadorian base of Tiwinza – focal point of the war – had been located within  soil and which the Ecuadorian Army held during the conflict. The final border demarcation came into effect on 13 May 1999, and the multi-national MOMEP (Military Observer Mission for  and ) troop deployment withdrew on 17 June 1999.

===Military governments (1972–79)===
In 1972, a "revolutionary and nationalist" military [[military dictatorship|junta]] overthrew the government of Velasco Ibarra. The [[coup d'état]] was led by General [[Guillermo Rodríguez (politician)|Guillermo Rodríguez]] and executed by navy commander Jorge Queirolo G. The new president exiled José María Velasco to . He remained in power until 1976, when he was removed by another military government. That military junta was led by Admiral [[Alfredo Poveda]], who was declared chairman of the Supreme Council. The Supreme Council included two other members: General Guillermo Durán Arcentales and General Luis Pintado. The civil society more and more insistently called for democratic elections. Colonel [[Richelieu Levoyer]], Government Minister, proposed and implemented a Plan to return to the constitutional system through universal elections. This plan enabled the new democratically elected president to assume the duties of the executive office.

===Return to democracy (1979–present)===
{{See also|History of  (1990–present)}}

Elections were held on 29 April 1979, under a new constitution. [[Jaime Roldós Aguilera]] was elected president, garnering over one million votes, the most in Ecuadorian history. He took office on 10 August as the first constitutionally elected president, after nearly a decade of civilian and military dictatorships. In 1980, he founded the ''Partido Pueblo, Cambio y Democracia'' (People, Change, and Democracy Party) after withdrawing from the ''Concentración de Fuerzas Populares'' (Popular Forces Concentration). He governed until 24 May 1981, when he died, along with his wife and the minister of defense Marco Subia Martinez, when his Air Force plane crashed in heavy rain near the  border. Many people believe that he was assassinated by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], given the multiple death threats against him because of his reformist agenda, the deaths in automobile crashes of two key witnesses before they could testify during the investigation, and the sometimes contradictory accounts of the incident. Roldos was immediately succeeded by Vice President Osvaldo Hurtado.

In 1984, [[León Febres Cordero]] from the Social Christian Party was elected president. [[Rodrigo Borja Cevallos]] of the Democratic Left (Izquierda Democrática, or ID) party won the presidency in 1988, winning the runoff election against [[Abdalá Bucaram]] (brother in law of [[Jaime Roldos]] and founder of the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party). His government was committed to improving human rights protection and carried out some reforms, notably an opening of  to foreign trade. The Borja government negotiated the disbanding of the small terrorist group, "[[¡Alfaro Vive, Carajo!]]" ("Alfaro Lives, Dammit!"), named after [[Eloy Alfaro]]. However, continuing economic problems undermined the popularity of the ID party, and opposition parties gained control of Congress in 1999.[[File:CAMBIO DE GUARDIA.jpg|thumb|President [[Lenín Moreno]], first lady [[Rocío González Navas]] and his predecessor [[Rafael Correa]], 3 April 2017]]

A notable event was the [[Cenepa War]] fought between  and  in 1995.

 adopted the [[ dollar|U.S. dollar]] on 13 April 2000 as its national currency and on 11 September, the country eliminated the [[Ecuadorian sucre]], in order to stabilize the [[Economy of |country's economy]]. The U.S. Dollar has been the only official currency of  since then.

The emergence of the Amerindian population as an active constituency has added to the democratic volatility of the country in recent years. The population has been motivated by government failures to deliver on promises of land reform, lower unemployment and provision of social services, and the historical exploitation by the land-holding elite. Their movement, along with the continuing destabilizing efforts by both the elite and leftist movements, has led to a deterioration of the executive office. The populace and the other branches of government give the president very little political capital, as illustrated by the most recent removal of President [[Lucio Gutiérrez]] from office by Congress in April 2005. Vice President [[Alfredo Palacio]] took his place

In the [[Ecuadorian general election, 2006|election of 2006]], [[Rafael Correa]] gained the presidency. In January 2007, several left-wing political leaders of Latin America, his future allies, attended his swearing-in ceremony. Endorsed in a [[2008 Ecuadorian constitutional referendum|2008 referendum]], a [[2008 Constitution of |new constitution]] implemented leftist reforms. In December 2008, Correa declared 's [[national debt]] illegitimate, based on the argument that it was [[odious debt]] contracted by prior corrupt and despotic regimes. He announced that the country would default on over $3 billion worth of bonds, and he succeeded in reducing the price of outstanding bonds by more than 60% by fighting creditors in [[international court]]s. He brought  into the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]] in June 2009. Correa's administration reduced the high levels of poverty and unemployment in .

Correa's three consecutive terms (from 2007 to 2017) were followed by his former Vice President [[Lenín Moreno]]'s four years as president (2017–21). After being elected in 2017, President Moreno's government adopted [[economic liberalism|economically liberal]] policies, such as reduction of [[public spending]], [[trade liberalization]], and flexibility of the labor code.  also left the left-wing [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]] (Alba) in August 2018. The Productive Development Act introduced an austerity policy, and reduced the previous development and redistribution policies. Regarding taxes, the authorities aimed to "encourage the return of investors" by granting amnesty to fraudsters and proposing measures to reduce [[Corporate tax|tax rates for large companies]]. In addition, the government waived the right to tax increases in raw material prices and foreign exchange repatriations. In October 2018, Moreno cut diplomatic relations with the [[Nicolás Maduro|Maduro]] administration of , a close ally of Correa. The relations with the  improved significantly under Moreno. In June 2019,  agreed to allow U.S. military planes to operate from an airport on the Galapagos Islands. In February 2020, his visit to Washington was the first meeting between an Ecuadorian and U.S. president in 17 years.

A [[2019 Ecuadorian protests|series of protests]] began on 3 October 2019 against the end of fuel [[Subsidy|subsidies]] and [[Austerity|austerity measures]] adopted by Moreno. On 10 October, protesters overran Quito, the capital, causing the Government of  to relocate temporarily to [[Guayaquil]]. The government eventually returned to Quito in 2019. On 14 October 2019, the government restored fuel subsidies and withdrew an austerity package, which ended nearly two weeks of protests.
[[File:TRANSMISIÓN DE MANDO PRESIDENCIAL (23-11-2023) 05.jpg|thumb|Outgoing President [[Guillermo Lasso]] (center) with President-elect [[Daniel Noboa]] (right) at the latter's inauguration in November 2023]]

In the 11 April 2021 [[2021 Ecuadorian general election|election]], conservative former banker [[Guillermo Lasso]] took 52.4% of the vote, compared to 47.6% for left-wing economist Andrés Aráuz, who was supported by exiled former president Correa. Lasso had finished second in the 2013 and 2017 presidential elections. On 24 May 2021, Lasso was sworn in, becoming the country's first right-wing leader in 14 years. Lasso's party [[Creating Opportunities|Creating Opportunities (CREO Movement)]], and its ally the Social Christian Party (PSC) won only 31 parliamentary seats out of 137, while Aráuz's Union for Hope (UNES) won 49 seats, which meant Lasso needed support from the Izquierda Democrática and the indigenist [[Pachakutik Plurinational Unity Movement – New Country|Pachakutik]] parties to push through his legislative agenda.

In October 2021, Lasso declared a 60-day state of emergency to combat crime and drug-related violence, including the numerous bloody clashes between rival groups in the state prisons. Lasso proposed a series of constitutional changes to enhance his government's ability to respond to crime.
