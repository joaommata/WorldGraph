[[File:Kamenicë Tumulus,  2018 02.jpg|thumb|right|The remains of the [[Kamenica Tumulus]] in the [[county of Korçë]]]]

Mesolithic habitation in  has been evidenced in several open air sites which were close to the Adriatic coastline and in caves. Mesolithic objects found in a cave near Xarrë include [[flint]] and [[jasper]] objects along with fossilised animal bones, while those discoveries at Mount Dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the [[Aurignacian culture]]. The [[Neolithic]] era in  began around 7000 BC and is evidenced in finds which indicate domestication of sheep and goats and small-scale agriculture. A part of the Neolithic population may have been the same as the Mesolithic population of the southern Balkans like in the [[Konispol]] cave where the Mesolithic stratum co-exists with Pre-Pottery Neolithic finds. [[Cardium pottery]] culture appears in coastal  and across the Adriatic after 6500 BC, while the settlements of the interior took part in the processes which formed the [[Starčevo culture]]. The  [[bitumen]] mines of [[Selenicë]] provide early evidence of bitumen exploitation in Europe, dating to Late Neolithic  (from 5000 BC), when local communities used it as pigment for ceramic decoration, [[waterproofing]], and [[adhesive]] for reparing broken vessels. The bitumen of Selenicë circulated towards eastern  from the early 5th millennium BC. First evidence of its overseas trade export comes from Neolithic and Bronze Age southern [[]]. The high-quality bitumen of Selenicë has been exploited throughout all the historical ages since the Late Neolithic era until today.

The [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-Europeanisation]] of  in the context of the IE-isation of the western Balkans began after 2800 BC. The presence of the Early Bronze Age [[Tumulus|tumuli]] in the vicinity of later [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]] dates to 2679±174 calBC (2852-2505 calBC). These burial mounds belong to the southern expression of the Adriatic-Ljubljana culture (related to later [[Cetina culture]]) which moved southwards along the Adriatic from the northern Balkans. The same community built similar mounds in  (Rakića Kuće) and northern  (Shtoj). The first [[Archaeogenetics|archaeogenetic]] find related to the IE-isation of  involves a man with predominantly [[Western Steppe Herders|Yamnaya ancestry]] buried in a tumulus of northeastern  which dates to 2663–2472 calBC. During the Middle Bronze Age, Cetina culture sites and finds appear in . Cetina culture moved southwards across the Adriatic from the [[Cetina|Cetina valley]] of [[Dalmatia]]. In , Cetina finds are concentrated around southern [[Lake Shkodër]] and appear typically in tumulus cemeteries like in Shkrel and Shtoj and hillforts like Gajtan (Shkodër) as well as cave sites like Blaz, Nezir and Keputa (central ) and lake basin sites like Sovjan (southeastern ).

=== Antiquity ===
{{Main|History of #Antiquity|l1=Antiquity in }}

[[File:The City and the Prokletije from the castle.jpg|thumb|right|Founded in the 4th century BC, the city of [[Scodra]] was the capital of the [[Illyrian kingdom]] of [[Ardiaei]] and [[Labeatae]].]]

The incorporated territory of  was historically inhabited by [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European people]]s, amongst them numerous [[Illyrian tribes|Illyrian]] and [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirote]] tribes. There were also several [[ colonization| colonies]]. The territory referred to as [[Illyria]] corresponded roughly to the area east of the [[Adriatic Sea]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] extending in the south to the mouth of the [[Vjosë]]. The first account of the Illyrian groups comes from [[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]], a  text written in the 4th century BC. The [[Bryges]] were also present in central , while the south was inhabited by the Epirote [[Chaonians]], whose capital was at [[Phoenice]]. Other colonies such as [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]] and [[Epidamnos]] were established by  city-states on the coast by the 7th century BC.

[[File:Parku Arkeologjik i Apollonisë 04.jpg|thumb|left|[[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]] was an important [[Colonies in antiquity# colonies| colony]] on the [[Illyria]]n coast along the [[Adriatic Sea]] and one of the western points of the [[Via Egnatia]] route, that connected Rome and [[Constantinople]].]]

The Illyrian [[Taulantii|Taulanti]] were a powerful Illyrian tribe among the earliest recorded tribes in the area. They lived in an area that corresponds with much of present-day . Together with the Dardanian ruler [[Cleitus (son of Bardylis)|Cleitus]], [[Glaucias of Taulantii|Glaucias]], the ruler of the Taulantian kingdom, fought against [[Alexander the Great]] at the [[Siege of Pelium|Battle of Pelium]] in 335 BC. As the time passed, the ruler of Ancient Macedonia, [[Cassander|Cassander of Macedon]] captured Apollonia and crossed the river [[Shkumbin|Genusus]] ({{Langx|sq|Shkumbin}}) in 314 BC. A few years later Glaucias laid siege to Apollonia and captured the  colony of [[Epidamnos]].

The Illyrian [[Ardiaei]] tribe, centred in , ruled over most of the territory of northern . Their [[Ardiaean Kingdom]] reached its greatest extent under [[Agron of Illyria|King Agron]], the son of [[Pleuratus II]]. Agron extended his rule over other neighbouring tribes as well. Following Agron's death in 230 BC, his wife, [[Teuta]], inherited the&nbsp;Ardiaean kingdom. Teuta's forces extended their operations further southwards to the&nbsp;Ionian Sea. In 229 BC, Rome declared war on the kingdom for extensively plundering Roman ships. The war ended in Illyrian defeat in 227&nbsp;BC. Teuta was eventually succeeded by&nbsp;[[Gentius]]&nbsp;in 181&nbsp;BC. Gentius clashed with the Romans in 168&nbsp;BC, initiating the [[Third Illyrian War]]. The conflict resulted in Roman conquest of the region by 167&nbsp;BC. The Romans split the region into three administrative divisions.

[[File:Krujë-KrujaAlbania 2016.jpg|thumb|right|The town of [[Krujë]] was the capital of the [[Principality of Arbanon]] in the Middle Ages.]]

The [[Roman Empire]] was split in 395 upon the death of [[Theodosius I]] into an [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] and [[Western Roman Empire]] in part because of the increasing pressure from threats during the [[Barbarian Invasions]]. From the 6th century into the 7th century, the [[South Slavs|Slavs]] crossed the [[Danube]] and largely absorbed the indigenous Greeks, Illyrians and Thracians in the [[Balkans]]; thus, the Illyrians were mentioned for the last time in historical records in the 7th century.

In the 11th century, the [[Great Schism of 1054|Great Schism]] formalised the break of communion between the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Western Catholic Church]] that is reflected in  through the emergence of a Catholic north and Orthodox south. The  people inhabited the west of [[Lake Ochrida]] and the upper valley of [[Shkumbin|River Shkumbin]] and established the [[Principality of Arbanon]] in 1190 under the leadership of [[Progon of Kruja]]. The realm was succeeded by his sons [[Gjin Progoni|Gjin]] and [[Dhimitër Progoni|Dhimitër]].

Upon the death of Dhimiter, the territory came under the rule of the - [[Gregory Kamonas]] and subsequently under the [[Golem of Kruja]]. In the 13th century, the principality was dissolved. Arbanon is considered to be the first sketch of an  state, that retained a [[semi-autonomous]] status as the western extremity of the [[Byzantine Empire]], under the Byzantine [[Doukas|Doukai]] of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] or [[Laskaris|Laskarids]] of [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]].

It illustrates [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Mehmet II]] laying siege to the  town of Scutari, then part of [[Venetian Empire]].]]

Towards the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th centuries, [[Kingdom of  (medieval)|Serb]]s and [[Venetian Empire|Venetians]] started to take possession over the territory. The [[ethnogenesis]] of the Albanians is uncertain; however, the first undisputed mention of Albanians dates back in historical records from 1079 or 1080 in a work by [[Michael Attaliates]], who referred to the [[Albanoi]] as having taken part in a revolt against [[Constantinople]]. At this point the Albanians were fully Christianised.

After the dissolution of Arbanon, [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]] concluded an agreement with the  rulers, promising to protect them and their ancient liberties. In 1272, he established the [[Kingdom of  (medieval)|Kingdom of ]] and conquered regions back from the [[Despotate of Epirus]]. The kingdom claimed all of central  territory from [[Dyrrhachium]] along the Adriatic Sea coast down to [[Butrint]]. A Catholic political structure was a basis for the papal plans of spreading [[Catholicism]] in the Balkan Peninsula. This plan found also the support of [[Helen of Anjou, Queen of |Helen of Anjou]]. Around 30 Catholic churches and monasteries were built during her rule mainly in northern . Internal power struggles within the Byzantine Empire in the 14th century enabled Serbs' most powerful medieval ruler, [[Stefan Dusan]], to establish a [[ Empire|short-lived empire]] that included all of  except Durrës.
[[File: Principalities, ca. 1390 (modern ).png|thumb| principalities, {{Circa|1390}}, excluding the [[Despotate of Arta]]]]
In 1367,  rulers established the [[Despotate of Arta]]. During that time, several [[ principalities]] were created, notably the [[Principality of  (medieval)|Principality of ]], [[Principality of Kastrioti]], [[Lordship of Berat]] and [[Principality of Dukagjini]]. In the first half of the 15th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] invaded most of , and the [[League of Lezhë]] was held under [[Skanderbeg]] as a ruler, who became the national hero of the  medieval history.

With the [[fall of Constantinople]], the Ottoman Empire continued an extended period of conquest and expansion with its borders going deep into [[Ottoman conquest of the Balkans|Southeast Europe]]. They reached the [[ Ionian Sea Coast]] in 1385 and erected their garrisons across [[Southern ]] in 1415 and then occupied most of  in 1431. Thousands of Albanians consequently fled to Western Europe, particularly to [[Calabria]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], whereby others sought protection at the often inaccessible [[Geography of |Mountains of ]]. The Albanians, as Christians, were considered an [[Rayah|inferior class]] of people, and as such they were subjected to heavy [[Jizya|tax]]es among others by the [[Devshirme]] system that allowed the [[Sultan]] to collect a requisite percentage of Christian adolescents from their families to compose the [[Janissary]]. The Ottoman conquest was also accompanied with the gradual process of [[Islamisation]] and the rapid construction of mosques.

A prosperous and longstanding revolution erupted after the formation of the [[League of Lezhë]] until the [[Siege of Shkodra|fall of Shkodër]] under the leadership of [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg]], who consistently defeated major Ottoman armies led by [[Sultan]]s [[Murad II]] and [[Mehmed II]]. Skanderbeg managed to unite several of the  principalities, amongst them the [[Arianiti family|Arianiti]]s, [[Dukagjini family|Dukagjini]]s, [[Zaharia family|Zaharia]]s and [[Thopia family|Thopia]]s, and establish a centralised authority over most of the non-conquered territories, becoming the [[Skanderbeg|Lord of ]]. The Ottoman Empire's expansion ground to a halt during the time that Skanderbeg's forces resisted, and he has been credited with being one of the main reasons for the delay of Ottoman expansion into [[Western Europe]], giving the  principalities more time to better prepare for the [[Siege of Otranto|Ottoman arrival]].{{sfn|Hodgkinson|2005|p=240}} However, the failure of most European nations, with the exception of Naples, in giving him support, along with the failure of Pope Pius II's plans to organise a promised crusade against the Ottomans meant that none of Skanderbeg's victories permanently hindered the Ottomans from invading the Western Balkans.{{sfn|Hodgkinson|2005|p=xii}}

Despite his brilliance as a military leader, Skanderbeg's victories were only delaying the final conquests. The constant Ottoman invasions caused enormous destruction to , greatly reducing the population and destroying flocks of livestock and crops. Besides surrender, there was no possible way Skanderbeg would be able to halt the Ottoman invasions despite his successes against them. His manpower and resources were insufficient, preventing him from expanding the war efforts and driving the Turks from the  borders.  was therefore doomed to face an unending series of Ottoman attacks until it eventually fell years after his death.

When the Ottomans were gaining a firm foothold in the region,  towns were organised into four principal [[sanjaks]]. The government fostered trade by settling a sizeable Jewish colony of refugees fleeing persecution in . The city of [[Vlorë]] saw passing through its ports imported merchandise from Europe such as velvets, cotton goods, mohairs, carpets, spices and leather from [[Bursa]] and [[Constantinople]]. Some citizens of Vlorë even had business associates throughout Europe.

The phenomenon of Islamisation among the Albanians became primarily widespread from the 17th century and continued into the 18th century. Islam offered them equal opportunities and advancement within the Ottoman Empire. However, motives for conversion were, according to some scholars, diverse depending on the context though the lack of source material does not help when investigating such issues. Because of increasing suppression of Catholicism, most Catholic Albanians converted in the 17th century, while Orthodox Albanians followed suit mainly in the following century.

Since the Albanians were seen as strategically important, they made up a significant proportion of the [[Ottoman military]] and bureaucracy. Many Muslim Albanians attained important political and military positions and culturally contributed to the broader [[Muslim world]]. Enjoying this privileged position, they held various high administrative positions with over two dozen  [[Grand Viziers]]. Others included members of the prominent [[Köprülü family]], [[Zagan Pasha]], [[Muhammad Ali of ]] and [[Ali Pasha of Tepelena]]. Furthermore, two sultans, [[Bayezid II]] and [[Mehmed III]], both had mothers of  origin.

The [[ Renaissance]] was a period with its roots in the late 18th century and continuing into the 19th century, during which the  people gathered spiritual and intellectual strength for an independent cultural and political life within an [[Independent |independent nation]]. Modern [[ culture]] flourished too, especially [[ literature]] and [[ art|arts]], and was frequently linked to the influences of the [[Romanticism]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles. Prior to the [[Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire|rise of nationalism]], Ottoman authorities suppressed any expression of national unity or conscience by the  people.

The victory of  over the Ottoman Empire following the [[-Ottoman War]]s resulted the execution of the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] which assigned -populated lands to their Slavic and  neighbours. However, the [[ of Great Britain and |]] and [[Austro- Empire]] consequently blocked the arrangement and caused the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. From this point, Albanians started to organise themselves with the goal to protect and unite the -populated lands into a unitary nation, leading to the formation of the [[League of Prizren]]. The league had initially the assistance of the Ottoman authorities whose position was based on the religious solidarity of Muslim people and landlords connected with the [[Ottoman Porte|Ottoman administration]]. They favoured and protected the Muslim solidarity and called for defence of Muslim lands simultaneously constituting the reason for titling the league [[League of Prizren#Formation|Committee of the Real Muslims]].

Approximately 300 Muslims participated in the assembly composed by delegates from Bosnia, the [[sanjakbey|administrator]] of the [[Sanjak of Prizren]] as representatives of the central authorities and no delegates from [[Vilayet of Scutari]]. Signed by only 47 Muslim deputies, the league issued the [[Kararname (League of Prizren)|Kararname]] that contained a proclamation that the people from northern , [[Epirus]] and [[]] are willing to defend the [[territorial integrity]] of the Ottoman Empire by all possible means against the troops of [[Kingdom of |]], [[Kingdom of |]] and [[Kingdom of |]].

Ottomans authorities cancelled their assistance when the league, under [[Abdyl Frashëri]], became focused on working towards  autonomy and requested merging four [[Ottoman vilayet|vilayet]]s, including [[Kosovo Vilayet|Kosovo]], [[Scutari Vilayet|Shkodër]], [[Monastir Vilayet|Monastir]] and [[Janina Vilayet|Ioannina]], into a unified vilayet, the [[ Vilayet]]. The league used military force to prevent the annexing areas of [[Plav Municipality|Plav]] and [[Gusinje]] assigned to . After several successful battles with  troops, such as the [[Battle of Novšiće]], the league was forced to retreat from their contested regions. The league was later defeated by the Ottoman army sent by the sultan.

Headquartered in Vlorë, the [[International Commission of Control]] was established on 15 October 1913 to take care of the administration of  until its own political institutions were in order. The [[International Gendarmerie]] was established as the [[Principality of ]]'s first law enforcement agency. In November, the first gendarmerie members arrived in the country. Prince of  [[Wilhelm of Wied]] ''(Princ Vilhelm Vidi)'' was selected as the first prince of the principality. On 7 March, he arrived in the provisional capital of [[Durrës]] and began to organise his government, appointing [[Turhan Pasha Përmeti]] to form the first  cabinet.

In November 1913, the  pro-Ottoman forces had offered the throne of  to the Ottoman war minister of  origin, [[Ahmed Izzet Pasha]]. The pro-Ottoman peasants believed that the new regime was a tool of the six Christian [[Great Power]]s and local landowners, who owned half of the arable land.

In February 1914, the [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]] was proclaimed in [[Gjirokastër]] by the local [[Greeks in | population]] against incorporation to . This initiative was short-lived, and in 1921 the southern provinces were incorporated into the  Principality. Meanwhile, the [[Peasant Revolt in |revolt of  peasants]] against the new regime erupted under the leadership of the group of Muslim clerics gathered around [[Essad Pasha Toptani]], who proclaimed himself the savior of  and Islam. To gain the support of the [[Mirdita]] Catholic volunteers from northern , Prince [[Wilhelm of Wied|Wied]] appointed their leader, [[Prênk Bibë Doda]], foreign minister of the Principality of . In May and June 1914, the International Gendarmerie was joined by [[Isa Boletini]] and his men, mostly from [[Kosovo]], and the rebels defeated northern [[Mirdita]] Catholics, capturing most of Central  by the end of August 1914. Prince Wied's regime collapsed, and he left the country on 3 September 1914.

The [[interwar period]] in  was marked by persistent economic and social difficulties, political instability and foreign interventions. After [[World War I]],  lacked an established government and internationally recognised borders, rendering it vulnerable to neighboring entities such as , , and Yugoslavia, all of which sought to expand their influence. This led to political uncertainty, highlighted in 1918 when the [[Congress of Durrës]] sought [[Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)|Paris Peace Conference]] protection but was denied, further complicating 's position on the international stage. Territorial tensions escalated as Yugoslavia, particularly , sought control of northern , while  aimed dominance in southern . The situation deteriorated in 1919 when the Serbs launched attacks on  inhabitants, among others in [[Gusinje]] and [[Plav, |Plav]], resulting in [[Plav–Gusinje massacres (1912–1913)|massacres and large-scale displacement]]. Meanwhile,  influence continued to expand during this time, driven by economic interests and political ambitions.

[[Fan Noli]], renowned for his [[idealism]], became prime minister in 1924, with a vision to institute a Western-style constitutional government, abolish feudalism, counter  influence, and enhance critical sectors, including infrastructure, education and healthcare. He faced resistance from former allies, who had assisted in the removal of [[Zog I of |Zog]] from power, and struggled to secure foreign aid to implement his agenda. Noli's decision to establish diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, an adversary of the  elite, ignited allegations of [[bolshevism]] from Belgrade. This in turn led to increased pressure from  and culminated in Zog's restoration to authority. In 1928, Zog transitioned  from a republic to a monarchy that garnered backing from [[Fascist  (1922–1943)|Fascist ]], with Zog assuming the title of King Zog I. Key constitutional changes dissolved the Senate and established a unicameral National Assembly while preserving Zog's authoritative powers.

In 1939,  under [[Benito Mussolini]] launched a military invasion of , resulting in the exile of Zog and the creation of an [[ protectorate of  (1939–1943)| protectorate]]. As [[World War II]] progressed,  aimed to expand its territorial dominion in the Balkans, including territorial claims on regions of  ([[Chameria]]), Macedonia,  and Kosovo. These ambitions laid the foundation of [[ protectorate of  (1939–1943)|Greater ]], which aimed to unite all areas with -majority populations into a single country. In 1943, as 's control declined, [[Nazi ]] assumed control of , subjecting Albanians to forced labour, economic exploitation and repression under [[ occupation of | rule]].

[[File:Enver Hoxha (portret).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Enver Hoxha]] was the founding leader of communist  and its ruler for over four decades, implementing a regime marked by [[authoritarianism]] and [[isolationism]].]]

The establishment of the [[People's Socialist Republic of |People's Republic of ]] under the leadership of [[Enver Hoxha]] was a significant epoch in modern  history. Hoxha's regime embraced [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist ideologies]] and implemented [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] policies, including prohibition of religious practices, severe restrictions on travel, and abolition of private property rights. It was also defined by a persistent pattern of purges, extensive repression, instances of betrayal, and hostility to external influences. Any form of opposition or resistance to his rule was met with expeditious and severe consequences, such as internal exile, extended imprisonment, and execution. The regime confronted a multitude of challenges, including widespread poverty, illiteracy, health crises and gender inequality. In response, Hoxha initiated a modernisation initiative aimed at attaining economic and social liberation and transforming  into an industrial society. The regime placed a high priority on the diversification of the economy through Soviet-style industrialisation, comprehensive infrastructure development such as the introduction of a transformative [[Hekurudha Shqiptare|railway system]], expansion of education and healthcare services, elimination of adult illiteracy, and targeted advancements in areas such as women's rights.

[[File:Bunker in  Alps.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bunkers in ]] were constructed to prevent potential external invasions. By 1983, approximately 173,371 bunkers were scattered throughout its territory.]]

's diplomatic history under Hoxha was characterised by notable conflicts. Initially aligned with Yugoslavia as a satellite state, the relationship deteriorated as Yugoslavia aimed to incorporate  within its territory. Subsequently,  established relations with the Soviet Union and engaged trade agreements with other Eastern European countries, but experienced disagreements over Soviet policies, leading to strained ties with Moscow and diplomatic separation in 1961. Simultaneously, tensions with the West heightened due to 's refusal to hold free elections and allegations of Western support for [[Anti-communism|anti-communist uprisings]]. 's enduring partnership was with ; it sided with Beijing during the [[Sino-Soviet split|Sino-Soviet conflict]], resulting in severed ties with the Soviet Union and withdrawal from the [[Warsaw Pact]] in response to the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. But their relations stagnated in 1970, prompting both to reassess their commitment, and  actively reduced its dependence on .

Under Hoxha's regime,  underwent a widespread campaign targeting religious clergy of various faiths, resulting in public persecution and executions, particularly targeting Muslims, Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox adherents. In 1946, religious estates underwent nationalisation, coinciding with the closure or transformation of religious institutions into various other purposes. This culminated in 1976, when  became the world's first constitutionally atheist state. Under this regime, citizens were forced to renounce their religious beliefs, adopt a secular way of life, and embrace socialist ideology.

After four decades of communism paired with the [[revolutions of 1989]],  witnessed a notable rise in political activism, particularly among students, which led to a transformation in the prevailing order. After the first [[multi-party elections]] of [[ parliamentary election, 1991|1991]], the communist party maintained a stronghold in the parliament until its defeat in the [[ parliamentary election, 1992|parliamentary elections of 1992]] directed by the [[Democratic Party of |Democratic Party]]. Considerable economic and financial resources were devoted to [[Pyramid schemes in |pyramid schemes]] that were widely supported by the government. The schemes swept up somewhere between one sixth and one third of the population of the country. Despite the [[International Monetary Fund]]'s warnings, [[Sali Berisha]] defended the schemes as large investment firms, leading more people to redirect their remittances and sell their homes and cattle for cash to deposit in the schemes.

The schemes began to collapse in late 1996, leading many of the investors to join initially peaceful protests against the government, requesting their money back. The protests turned violent in February 1997 as government forces responded by firing on the demonstrators. In March, the Police and Republican Guard deserted, leaving their armories open. These were promptly emptied by militias and criminal gangs. The resulting [[1997  civil unrest|civil war]] caused a wave of evacuations of foreign nationals and refugees.

The crisis led both [[Aleksandër Meksi]] and [[Sali Berisha]] to resign from office in the wake of the general election. In April 1997, [[Operation Alba]], a U.N. peacekeeping force led by , entered  with two goals: to assist with the evacuation of expatriates and secure the ground for international organisations. The main international organisation involved was the [[Western European Union]]'s [[ civil war of 1997#International intervention|multinational]] [[ Police]] element, which worked with the government to restructure the [[Judicial system of |judicial system]] and simultaneously the  police.
