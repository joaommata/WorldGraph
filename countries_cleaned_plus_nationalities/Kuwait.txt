===Antiquity===
Following the post-glacial flooding of the [[Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf basin]], debris from the [[Tigris–Euphrates river system|Tigris–Euphrates river]] formed a substantial delta, creating most of the land in present-day  and establishing the present coastlines. One of the earliest evidence of human presence in  dates back to the [[Mesolithic]] era (c. 8000 BC). Historically, most of present-day  was part of ancient [[Mesopotamia]].

During the [[Ubaid period]] (c. 5500–3700 BC),  was the central site of interaction between the peoples of [[Mesopotamia]] and Neolithic [[Eastern Arabia]], including [[Bahra 1]] and [[H3 ()|site H3]] in [[Subiya, |Subiya]]. The Neolithic inhabitants of  were among the world's earliest maritime traders. One of the world's earliest [[reed boats]] was discovered at [[H3 ()|site H3]] dating back to the Ubaid period. Other Neolithic sites in  are located in Khiran and [[Sulaibikhat]].

[[Mesopotamian]]s first settled in the  island of [[Failaka Island|Failaka]] in 2000 BC. Traders from the [[Sumer]]ian city of [[Ur]] inhabited Failaka and ran a mercantile business. The island had many Mesopotamian-style buildings typical of those found in [[]] dating from around 2000 BC. In 4000 BC until 2000 BC,  was home to the [[Dilmun civilization]]. Dilmun included Al-Shadadiya, [[Akkaz Island|Akkaz]], [[Umm an Namil Island|Umm an Namil]], and [[Failaka Island|Failaka]]. At its peak in 2000 BC, Dilmun controlled the [[Persian Gulf]] trading routes.

During the Dilmun era (from ca. 3000 BC), Failaka was known as "[[Agarum (toponym)|Agarum]]", the land of [[Enzak]], a great god in the Dilmun civilization according to Sumerian cuneiform texts found on the island. As part of Dilmun, Failaka became a hub for the civilization from the end of the 3rd to the middle of the 1st millennium BC. After the Dilmun civilization, Failaka was inhabited by the [[Kassites]] of [[Mesopotamia]], and was formally under the control of the [[Kassites#Kassite Dynasty of Babylon|Kassite dynasty of Babylon]]. Studies indicate traces of human settlement can be found on Failaka dating back to as early as the end of the 3rd millennium BC, and extending until the 20th century AD. Many of the artifacts found in Falaika are linked to Mesopotamian civilizations and seem to show that Failaka was gradually drawn toward the civilization based in [[Antioch]].

Under [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], the bay of  was under [[Babylonia]]n control. Cuneiform documents found in Failaka indicate the presence of Babylonians in the island's population. [[List of Kings of Babylon|Babylonian Kings]] were present in Failaka during the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] period, [[Nabonidus]] had a governor in Failaka and Nebuchadnezzar II had a palace and temple in Falaika. Failaka also contained temples dedicated to the worship of [[Shamash]], the Mesopotamian sun god in the Babylonian pantheon.

Following the [[Fall of Babylon]], the bay of  came under the control of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (c. 550‒330 BC) as the bay was repopulated after seven centuries of abandonment. Failaka was under the control of the Achaemenid Empire as evidenced by the archaeological discovery of Achaemenid strata. There are [[Aramaic]] inscriptions that testify Achaemenid presence.

In fourth century BC, the [[ancient Greeks]] colonized the bay of  under [[Alexander the Great]]. The ancient Greeks named mainland  ''Larissa'' and Failaka was named ''[[Ikaros (Failaka Island)|Ikaros]]''. The bay of  was named ''Hieros Kolpos''. According to [[Strabo]] and [[Arrian]], Alexander the Great named Failaka ''Ikaros'' because it resembled the [[Aegean island|Aegean Island]] of that name in size and shape. Elements of [[ mythology]] were mixed with the local cults. "Ikaros" was also the name of a prominent city situated in Failaka. Large [[Hellenistic]] [[Towns of ancient #Military settlements|fort]]s and [[ temple]]s were uncovered. Archaeological remains of  colonization were also discovered in Akkaz, Umm an Namil, and Subiya.

At the time of Alexander the Great, the mouth of the [[Euphrates|Euphrates River]] was located in northern . The Euphrates river flowed directly into the Persian Gulf via Khor [[Subiya, |Subiya]] which was a river channel at the time. Failaka was located 15 kilometers from the mouth of the Euphrates river. By the first century BC, the Khor Subiya river channel dried out completely.

In 127 BC,  was part of the [[Parthian Empire]] and the kingdom of [[Characene]] was established around [[Teredon]] in present-day . Characene was centered in the region encompassing southern Mesopotamia, Characene coins were discovered in Akkaz, Umm an Namil, and Failaka. A busy Parthian commercial station was situated in .

In 224 AD,  became part of the [[Sassanid Empire]]. At the time of the Sassanid Empire,  was known as ''Meshan'', which was an alternative name of the kingdom of Characene. Akkaz was a [[Parthian Empire|Partho]]-[[Sassanian]] site; the [[Zoroastrianism|Sassanid religion]]'s [[tower of silence]] was discovered in northern Akkaz. Late Sassanian settlements were discovered in Failaka. In [[Bubiyan Island|Bubiyan]], there is archaeological evidence of Sassanian to early Islamic periods of human presence as evidenced by the recent discovery of torpedo-jar pottery shards on several prominent beach ridges.

In 636 AD, the [[Battle of Chains]] between the Sassanid Empire and [[Rashidun Caliphate]] was fought in . As a result of Rashidun victory in 636 AD, the bay of  was home to the city of [[Kazma]] (also known as "Kadhima" or "Kāzimah") in the early Islamic era.

[[File:MarinetimeMKuwaitAlshami.jpg|thumb|right|[[Al-Hashemi-II|Marine Museum]] in  City. Demonstrates the founding of  as a sea port for merchants.]]
In the early to mid 1700s, [[ City]] was a small [[fishing village]]. Administratively, it was a sheikhdom, ruled by [[sheikh]]s from the local [[Bani Khalid]] clan. Sometime in the mid 1700s, the [[Bani Utbah]] settled in  City. Sometime after the death of the Bani Khalid's leader Barak bin Abdul Mohsen and the fall of the [[Bani Khalid Emirate]], the Utub were able to wrest control of  as a result of successive [[Marriage of state|matrimonial alliances]].

In the latter half of the eighteenth century,  began establishing itself as a maritime [[port]] and gradually became a principal commercial center for the transit of goods between [[Baghdad]], , Persia, [[Muscat]], and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. By the late-1700s,  had established itself as a trading route from the Persian Gulf to [[Aleppo]]. During the [[Ottoman–Persian War (1775–1776)|Persian siege of Basra in 1775–79]],  merchants took refuge in  and were partly instrumental in the expansion of 's boat-building and trading activities. As a result, 's maritime commerce boomed, as the  trade routes with Baghdad, Aleppo, [[Smyrna]] and [[Constantinople]] were diverted to  during this time. The [[East  Company]] was diverted to  in 1792. The East  Company secured the sea routes between ,  and the east coasts of Africa. After the Persians withdrew from [[Basra]] in 1779,  continued to attract trade away from Basra. The flight of many of Basra's leading merchants to  continued to play a significant role in Basra's commercial stagnation well into the 1850s.

The instability in Basra helped foster economic prosperity in . In the late 18th century,  was a haven for Basra merchants fleeing [[Ottoman government|Ottoman]] persecution.  was the center of [[boat building]] in the Persian Gulf, its ships renowned throughout the [[ Ocean]]. Its sailors developed a positive reputation in the Persian Gulf. In the 19th century,  became significant in the [[horse trading|horse trade]], with regular shipments in sailing vessels. In the mid 19th century, it was estimated that  exported an average of 800 horses to  annually.

In 1899, ruler Sheikh [[Mubarak Al-Sabah|Mubarak Al Sabah]] signed an agreement with the [[Presidencies and provinces of British |British government in ]] (subsequently known as the [[Anglo- Agreement of 1899]]) making  a [[British protectorate]]. This gave Britain exclusive access and trade with , while denying Ottoman and  provinces to the north a port on the Persian Gulf. The [[Sheikhdom of ]] remained a British protectorate until 1961.

After the [[Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913]],  was established as an autonomous ''[[kaza]],'' or district, of the Ottoman Empire and a ''[[de facto]]'' protectorate of [[ of Great Britain and |Great Britain]].]]
After the [[Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913]],  was established as an autonomous ''[[kaza]],'' or district, of the Ottoman Empire and a ''[[de facto]]'' protectorate of Great Britain.

During [[World War I]], the [[British Empire]] imposed a trade blockade against  because its ruler at the time, [[Salim Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah]], supported the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The British economic blockade heavily damaged 's economy.

In 1919, Sheikh [[Salim Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah]] intended to build a commercial city in the south of . This caused a diplomatic crisis with Najd, but Britain intervened, discouraging Sheikh Salim. In 1920, an attempt by the [[Ikhwan]] to build a stronghold in southern  led to the [[Battle of Hamdh]]. The Battle of Hamdh involved 2,000 [[Ikhwan]] fighters against 100  [[cavalrymen]] and 200  [[infantrymen]]. The battle lasted for six days and resulted in heavy but unknown casualties on both sides resulting in the victory of the Ikhwan forces and leading to the battle of Jahra around the  Red Fort. The [[Battle of Jahra]] happened as the result of the [[Battle of Hamdh]]. A force of three to four thousand [[Ikhwan]], led by [[Faisal Al-Dawish]], attacked the [[ Red Fort|Red Fort]] at Al-Jahra, defended by fifteen hundred men. The fort was besieged and the  position precarious. The Ikhwan attack repulsed for the while, negotiations began between Salim and Al-Dawish; the latter threatened another attack if the  forces did not surrender. The local merchant class convinced Salim to call in help from British troops, who showed up with airplanes and three warships, ending the attacks. After the Battle of Jahra, Ibn Saud's warriors, the [[Ikhwan]], demanded that  follows five rules. They demanded that all the [[Shias]] be evicted, that all should adopt the [[Wahhabism|Ikhwan doctrine]], that the Turks be labelled "[[heretics]]", that smoking, [[Munkar and Nakir|munkar]], and prostitution be abolished, and that  missionary hospital be destroyed.

[[File:Jahra-castle.jpg|thumb|The [[ Red Fort]] in [[Al Jahra]]]]
The [[–Najd War]] of 1919–20 erupted in the [[aftermath of World War I]]. The war occurred because [[Ibn Saud]] of Najd wanted to annex . The sharpened conflict between  and Najd led to the death of hundreds of Kuwaitis. The war resulted in sporadic border clashes throughout 1919–1920.

When [[Percy Cox]] was informed of the border clashes in , he sent a letter to the [[Emirate of Arabistan|Ruler of Arabistan]] Sheikh [[Khazʽal Ibn Jabir]] offering the  throne to either him or one of his heirs. Khaz'al refused. He then asked: {{blockquote|...even so, do you think that you have come to me with something new? Al Mubarak's position as ruler of  means that I am the true ruler of . So there is no difference between myself and them, for they are like the dearest of my children and you are aware of this. Had someone else come to me with this offer, I would have complained about them to you. So how do you come to me with this offer when you are well aware that myself and Al Mubarak are one soul and one house, what affects them affects me, whether good or evil.}}

Following the –Najd War in 1919–20, Ibn Saud imposed a trade blockade against  from the years 1923 until 1937. The goal of the  economic and military attacks on  was to annex as much of 's territory as possible. At the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Uqair conference]] in 1922, the boundaries of  and Najd were set; as a result of British interference,  had no representative at the Uqair conference. After the Uqair conference,  was still subjected to a  economic blockade and intermittent  [[Raid (military)|raiding]].

 immensely declined in regional economic importance, due to the trade blockades and the world economic depression. Before [[Mary Bruins Allison]] visited  in 1934,  had already lost its prominence in long-distance trade.

[[File:Kuwait1944.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Celebration at [[Seif Palace]] in 1944]]
The [[Great Depression]] harmed 's economy, starting in the late 1920s. International trading was one of 's main sources of income before oil. 's merchants were mostly intermediary merchants. As a result of the decline of European demand for goods from  and Africa, 's economy suffered. The decline in international trade resulted in an increase in gold smuggling by 's ships to . Some local merchant families became rich from this smuggling. 's [[pearl]] industry also collapsed as a result of the worldwide economic depression. At its height, 's pearl industry had led the world's luxury market, regularly sending out between 750 and 800 ships to meet the European elite's desire for pearls. During the economic depression, luxuries like pearls were in little demand. The  invention of [[cultured pearl]]s also contributed to the collapse of 's pearl industry.

[[Freya Stark]] wrote about the extent of poverty in  at the time:{{blockquote|Poverty has settled in  more heavily since my last visit five years ago, both by sea, where the pearl trade continues to decline, and by land, where the blockade established by  now harms the merchants.}}

On 22 February 1938, [[Petroleum|oil]] was first discovered in the [[Burgan field]].

===1946–1980: State-building===
Between 1946 and 1980,  experienced a period of prosperity driven by oil and its liberal cultural atmosphere; this period is called the "golden era of ". In 1946, crude oil was exported for the first time. In 1950, a major public-work programme began to enable  citizens to enjoy a luxurious standard of living.

By 1952, the country became the largest oil exporter in the Persian Gulf region. This massive growth attracted many foreign workers, especially from Palestine, , , and  – with the latter being particularly political within the context of the [[Arab Cold War]]. It was also in 1952 that the first masterplan of  was designed by the British planning firm of [[Anthony Minoprio|Minoprio]], [[Hugh Spencely|Spenceley]], and Macfarlane. In 1958, ''[[Al-Arabi (magazine)|Al-Arabi]]'' magazine was first published. Many foreign writers moved to  because they enjoyed greater [[freedom of expression]] than elsewhere in the Middle East. 's press was described as one of the [[Freedom of the press|freest in the world]].  was the pioneer of the post-[[Nahda]] literary renaissance in the Middle East.

In June 1961,  became independent with the end of the [[Sheikhdom of #History as a Protected State of Britain|British protectorate]] and the Sheikh [[Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah]] became [[Emir of ]]. 's [[Public holidays in |national day]], however, is celebrated on 25 February, the anniversary of the coronation of Sheikh Abdullah (it was originally celebrated on 19 June, the date of independence, but concerns over the summer heat caused the government to move it).

At the time,  was considered the most developed country in the region.  was the pioneer in the Middle East in diversifying its earnings away from oil exports. The [[ Investment Authority]] is the world's first sovereign wealth fund.

 society embraced liberal and non-traditional attitudes throughout the 1960s and 1970s. For example, most  women did not wear the [[hijab]] in the 1960s and 70s.

Although  formally gained independence in 1961,  initially refused to recognize the country's independence by maintaining that  is part of , albeit  later briefly backed down following a show of force by Britain and [[Arab League]] support of 's independence.

The short-lived [[Operation Vantage]] crisis evolved in July 1961, as the  government threatened to invade  and the invasion was finally averted following plans by the Arab League to form an international Arab force against the potential  invasion of . As a result of Operation Vantage, the Arab League took over the border security of  and the British had withdrawn their forces by 19 October.  prime minister [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] was killed in a coup in 1963 but, although  recognised  independence and the military threat was perceived to be reduced, Britain continued to monitor the situation and kept forces available to protect  until 1971. There had been no  military action against  at the time: this was attributed to the political and military situation within  which continued to be unstable.

A treaty of friendship between  and  was signed in 1963 by which  recognised the 1932 border of . Under the terms of the newly drafted [[Constitution of |Constitution]],  held its first [[ parliamentary election, 1963|parliamentary elections in 1963]].

[[ University]] was established in 1966. 's [[#Television and theatre|theatre industry]] became well known throughout the region. After the 1967 [[Six Day War]],  along with other Arabic speaking countries voted the three no's of the [[Khartoum Resolution]]: no peace with , no recognition of , and no negotiations with . From the 1970s onward,  scored highest of all Arab countries on the [[Human Development Index]]. The  poet [[Ahmed Matar]] left  in the 1970s to take refuge in the more liberal environment of .  is the 25th most peaceful country in the world, according to the 2024 [[Global Peace Index]].

The [[- 1973 Sanita border skirmish|- 1973 Samita border skirmish]] evolved on 20 March 1973, when  army units occupied El-Samitah near the  border, which evoked an international crisis.

On 6 February 1974, [[1974 attack on the  Embassy in |Palestinian militants occupied the  embassy in ]], taking the ambassador and ten others hostage. The militants' motive was to support the [[ Red Army]] members and Palestinian militants who were holding hostages on a  ferry in what is known as the [[Laju incident|''Laju'' incident]]. Ultimately, the hostages were released, and the guerrillas allowed to fly to [[Aden]]. This was the first time Palestinian guerrillas struck in  as the Al Sabah ruling family, headed by Sheikh Sabah Al-Salim Al-Sabah, funded the Palestinian resistance movement.  had been a regular endpoint for Palestinian [[aircraft hijacking|plane hijacking]] in the past and had considered itself safe.

[[ International Airport]] was opened in 1979 by the Al Hani Construction with a joint venture of [[Ballast Nedam]].

===1981–1991: Wars and terrorism===
{{main|1983–1988  terror attacks|Gulf War}}
The Al Sabah strongly advocated [[Islamism]] throughout the 1980s. At that time, the most serious threat to the continuity of Al Sabah came from home-grown democrats, who were protesting the [[ general election, 1975|1976 suspension of the parliament]]. The Al Sabah were attracted to Islamists preaching the virtues of a [[hierarchical]] order that included loyalty to the  monarchy. In 1981, the  government [[gerrymandered]] electoral districts in favour of the Islamists. Islamists were the government's main allies, hence Islamists were able to dominate state agencies, such as the [[government ministries]].

During the [[– War]],  ardently supported . As a result, there were [[1983–1988  terror attacks|various pro- terror attacks]] across , including the 1983 bombings, the attempted assassination of [[Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah|Emir Jaber]] in May 1985, the [[1985  City bombings]], and the hijacking of several  Airways planes. 's economy and scientific research sector significantly suffered due to the pro- terror attacks.

Simultaneously,  experienced a major [[economic crisis]] after the [[Souk Al-Manakh stock market crash]] and [[1980s oil glut|decrease in oil price]].

[[File:Tankskuwait.jpg|thumb|left|[[ Armed Forces]] tanks in [[ City]] of -occupied  on 2 August 1990 during the [[ invasion of ]] that began the Gulf War.]]

After the – War ended,  declined an  request to forgive its US$65&nbsp;billion debt. An economic rivalry between the two countries ensued after  increased its oil production by 40 percent. Tensions between the two countries increased further in July 1990, after  complained to [[OPEC]] claiming that  was stealing its oil from a field near the border by [[slant drilling]] of the [[Rumaila field]].

In August 1990,  forces [[Invasion of |invaded and annexed]]  without any warning. After a series of failed diplomatic negotiations, the  led a coalition to remove the  forces from , in what became known as the [[Gulf War]]. On 26 February 1991, in phase of code-named [[Operation Desert Storm]], the coalition succeeded in driving out the  forces. As they retreated,  forces carried out a [[ oil fires|scorched earth]] policy by setting oil wells on fire.

During the  occupation, nearly 1,000 civilians were killed in . In addition, 600 people went missing during 's occupation; remains of approximately 375 were found in mass graves in .  celebrates 26 February as [[Liberation Day ()|Liberation Day]].

In the early 1990s,  [[Palestinian exodus from  (Gulf War)|deported]] nearly 400,000 Palestinians. 's policy was a form of [[collective punishment]], in response to the alignment of the [[PLO]] with Saddam Hussein.  also deported thousands of Iraqis and Yemenis after the Gulf War. Hundreds of thousands of [[Bedoon|stateless Bedoon]] were also expelled from  in the early-to-mid 1990s. At the [[House of Commons of the ]] in 1995, it was revealed that the Al Sabah ruling family deported 150,000 stateless Bedoon to refugee camps in the  desert near the  border with minimal water, insufficient food, and no basic shelter. Many of the stateless Bedoon fled to  where they remain stateless people even today.

In March 2003,  became the springboard for the US-led [[invasion of ]]. In 2005, women won the right to vote and run in elections. Upon the death of the Emir Jaber in January 2006, Sheikh [[Saad Al-Sabah]] succeeded him but was removed nine days later due to his failing health. As a result, Sheikh [[Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]] was sworn in as Emir. From that point onwards,  suffered from chronic political deadlock between the government and parliament which resulted in multiple cabinet reshuffles and dissolutions. This significantly hampered investment and economic reforms in , making the country's economy much more dependent on oil.
