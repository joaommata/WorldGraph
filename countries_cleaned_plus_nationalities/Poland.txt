[[File:Biskupin brama od zewnatrz.jpg|thumb|right|A reconstruction of a [[Bronze Age]] [[Lusatian culture]] settlement in [[Biskupin]], 8th century BC]]

The first [[Stone Age]] archaic humans and ''[[Homo erectus]]'' species settled what was to become  approximately 500,000 years ago, though the ensuing hostile climate prevented early humans from founding more permanent encampments. The arrival of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and [[Early European modern humans|anatomically modern humans]] coincided with the climatic discontinuity at the end of the [[Last Glacial Period]] ([[Weichselian glaciation|Northern  glaciation]] 10,000 BC), when  became habitable. [[Neolithic]] excavations indicated broad-ranging development in that era; the earliest evidence of European cheesemaking (5500 BC) was discovered in  [[Kuyavia]], and the [[Bronocice pot]] is incised with the earliest known depiction of what may be a wheeled vehicle (3400 BC).

The period spanning the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Early Iron Age]] (1300 BC–500 BC) was marked by an increase in population density, establishment of [[palisade]]d settlements ([[Gord (archaeology)|gords]]) and the expansion of [[Lusatian culture]]. A significant archaeological find from [[Prehistory and protohistory of |the protohistory of ]] is a fortified settlement at [[Biskupin]], attributed to the Lusatian culture of the [[Late Bronze Age]] (mid-8th century BC).

Throughout [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] (400 BC–500 AD), many distinct ancient populations inhabited the territory of present-day , notably [[Celts|Celtic]], [[Scythia]]n, [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]], [[Balts|Baltic]] and [[Early Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. Furthermore, archaeological findings confirmed the presence of [[Roman Legions]] sent to protect the [[Amber Road|amber trade]]. The [[ tribes]] emerged following the [[Migration Period#Second wave|second wave of the Migration Period]] around the 6th century AD; they were [[Slavs|Slavic]] and may have included assimilated remnants of peoples that earlier dwelled in the area. Beginning in the early 10th century, the [[Polans (western)|Polans]] would come to dominate other [[Lechites|Lechitic]] tribes in the region, initially forming a tribal federation and later a centralised monarchical state.

[[File:Poland960.png|thumb|left| under the rule of Duke [[Mieszko I]], whose acceptance of Christianity under the auspices of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Church]] and the [[Baptism of ]] marked the beginning of statehood in 966. His son, [[Bolesław I the Brave]], was crowned [[King of |king]] in 1025]]

 began to form into a recognisable unitary and territorial entity around the middle of the 10th century under the [[Piast dynasty]]. In 966, the ruler of the Polans, [[Mieszko I of |Mieszko I]], accepted Christianity under the auspices of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Church]] with the [[Baptism of ]]. In 968, a missionary [[bishopric]] was established in [[Poznań]]. An [[incipit]] titled [[Dagome iudex]] first defined 's geographical boundaries with its capital in [[Gniezno]] and affirmed that its monarchy was under the protection of the [[Apostolic See]]. The country's early origins were described by [[Gallus Anonymus]] in {{Lang|la|[[Gesta principum Polonorum]]}}, the oldest  chronicle. An important national event of the period was the [[martyrdom]] of [[Adalbert of Prague|Saint Adalbert]], who was killed by [[Old Prussians|Prussian]] pagans in 997 and whose remains were reputedly bought back for their weight in gold by Mieszko's successor, [[Bolesław I the Brave]].

In 1000, at the [[Congress of Gniezno]], Bolesław obtained the right of [[investiture]] from [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor]], who assented to the creation of additional bishoprics and an archdioceses in Gniezno. Three new dioceses were subsequently established in [[Kraków]], [[Kołobrzeg]], and [[Wrocław]]. Also, Otto bestowed upon Bolesław royal [[regalia]] and a replica of the [[Holy Lance]], which were later used at his coronation as the first [[List of  monarchs|King of ]] {{Circa|1025}}, when Bolesław received permission for his coronation from [[Pope John XIX]]. Bolesław also expanded the realm considerably by seizing parts of  [[Lusatia]],  [[Moravia]], [[Upper ]], and southwestern regions of the [[Kievan Rus']].

[[File:Casimir the Great by Leopold Löffler.PNG|thumb|upright|right|[[Casimir III the Great]] is the only  king to receive the title of ''Great''. He built extensively during his reign, and reformed the  army along with the country's legal code, 1333–1370.]]

The transition from [[Slavic paganism|paganism]] in  was not instantaneous and resulted in the [[Pagan reaction in |pagan reaction of the 1030s]]. In 1031, [[Mieszko II Lambert]] lost the title of king and fled amidst the violence. The unrest led to the transfer of the capital to Kraków in 1038 by [[Casimir I the Restorer]]. In 1076, [[Bolesław II the Generous|Bolesław II]] re-instituted the office of king, but was banished in 1079 for murdering his opponent, [[Stanislaus of Szczepanów|Bishop Stanislaus]]. In 1138, the country [[Testament of Bolesław III Wrymouth|fragmented]] into five principalities when [[Bolesław III Wrymouth]] divided his lands among his sons. These were [[Lesser ]], Greater , [[Silesia]], [[Masovia]], and [[Sandomierz]], with intermittent hold over [[Pomerania]]. In 1226, [[Konrad I of Masovia]] invited the [[Teutonic Knights]] to aid in combating the [[Balts|Baltic]] Prussians; a decision that later led to centuries of warfare with the Knights.

In the first half of the 13th century, [[Henry I the Bearded]] and [[Henry II the Pious]] aimed to unite the fragmented dukedoms, but the [[First Mongol invasion of |Mongol invasion]] and the death of Henry II in [[Battle of Legnica|battle]] hindered the unification. As a result of the devastation which followed, depopulation and the demand for craft labour spurred a migration of [[History of Germans in | and Flemish settlers]] into , which was encouraged by the  dukes. In 1264, the [[Statute of Kalisz]] introduced unprecedented autonomy for the [[History of the Jews in | Jews]], who came to  fleeing persecution elsewhere in Europe.

In 1320, [[Władysław I the Elbow-high|Władysław I the Short]] became the first king of [[Kingdom of  (1025–1385)|a reunified ]] since [[Przemysł II]] in 1296, and the first to be crowned at [[Wawel Cathedral]] in Kraków. Beginning in 1333, the reign of [[Casimir III the Great]] was marked by developments in [[Trail of the Eagle's Nests|castle infrastructure]], army, judiciary and [[Congress of Kraków|diplomacy]]. Under his authority,  transformed into a major European power; he instituted  rule over [[Kingdom of Ruthenia|Ruthenia]] in 1340 and imposed quarantine that prevented the spread of [[Black Death]]. In 1364, Casimir inaugurated the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Kraków]], one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in Europe. Upon his death in 1370, the Piast dynasty came to an end. He was succeeded by his closest male relative, [[Louis I of |Louis of Anjou]], who ruled , [[Kingdom of |]], and [[ in personal union with |]] in a [[personal union]]. Louis' younger daughter [[Jadwiga of |Jadwiga]] became 's first female monarch in 1384.

=== The Golden Age ===
{{Main|History of  during the Jagiellonian dynasty| Golden Age}}
[[File:Battle of Tannenberg.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Battle of Grunwald]] was fought against the [[Teutonic Knights| Order of Teutonic Knights]], and resulted in a decisive victory for the [[Kingdom of  (1385–1569)|Kingdom of ]], 15 July 1410.]]

In 1386, Jadwiga of  entered a marriage of convenience with [[Władysław II Jagiełło]], the [[Grand Duke of ]], thus forming the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]] and the [[– union]] which spanned the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Modern history|Modern Era]]. The partnership between Poles and Lithuanians brought the vast multi-ethnic [[Grand Duchy of |]] territories into 's sphere of influence and proved beneficial for its inhabitants, who coexisted in one of the largest European [[personal union|political entities]] of the time.

In the Baltic Sea region, the struggle of  and  with the [[Teutonic Knights]] continued and culminated at the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410, where a combined - army inflicted a decisive victory against them. In 1466, after the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]], king [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] gave royal consent to the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)|Peace of Thorn]], which created the future [[Duchy of Prussia]] under  suzerainty and forced the Prussian rulers to pay [[Homage (feudal)|tributes]]. The Jagiellonian dynasty also established dynastic control over the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] (1471 onwards) and . In the south,  confronted the [[Ottoman Empire]] (at the [[Battle of Varna|Varna Crusade]]) and the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]], and in the east helped  to combat [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|]].

 was developing as a [[feudalism|feudal]] state, with a predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly powerful [[landed nobility]] that confined the population to private manorial farmstead known as [[folwark|''folwarks'']]. In 1493, [[John I Albert]] sanctioned the creation of a [[bicameral parliament]] (the Sejm) composed of a lower house, the chamber of deputies, and an upper house, the chamber of senators. The ''[[Nihil novi]]'' act adopted by the  [[General Sejm]] in 1505, transferred most of the [[legislature|legislative power]] from the monarch to the parliament, an event which marked the beginning of the period known as [[Golden Liberty]], when the state was ruled by the seemingly free and equal [[szlachta| nobles]].

The 16th century saw [[Protestant Reformation]] movements making deep inroads into  Christianity, which resulted in the establishment of policies promoting religious tolerance, unique in Europe at that time. This tolerance allowed the country to avoid the religious turmoil and [[European wars of religion|wars of religion]] that beset Europe. In , [[Nontrinitarianism|Nontrinitarian Christianity]] became the doctrine of the so-called [[ Brethren]], who separated from their [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] denomination and became the co-founders of global [[Unitarianism]].

The European [[Renaissance]] evoked under [[Sigismund I the Old]] and [[Sigismund II Augustus]] a sense of urgency in the need to promote a [[Renaissance in |cultural awakening]]. During the [[ Golden Age]], the nation's economy and culture flourished. The -born [[Bona Sforza]], daughter of the [[Gian Galeazzo Sforza|Duke of Milan]] and queen consort to Sigismund I, made considerable contributions to [[Architecture of |architecture]], [[ cuisine|cuisine]], language and court customs at [[Wawel Castle]].

=== – Commonwealth ===
{{Main|History of  in the Early Modern era (1569–1795)|Crown of the Kingdom of |– Commonwealth}}
[[File:- Commonwealth in 1619.PNG|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[- Commonwealth]] at its greatest extent in 1619. At that time it was the largest country in Europe]]

The [[Union of Lublin]] of 1569 established the [[– Commonwealth]], a unified federal state with an [[elective monarchy]] that was largely governed by the nobility. The latter coincided with a period of prosperity. The -dominated union thereafter became a leading power and a major cultural entity, exercising political control over parts of Central, [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]], [[Southeastern Europe|Southeastern]] and Northern Europe. The – Commonwealth occupied approximately {{convert|1|e6km2|sqmi|abbr=unit}} [[Truce of Deulino|at its peak]] and was the largest state in Europe. Simultaneously,  imposed [[Polonisation]] policies in newly acquired territories which were met with resistance from ethnic and religious minorities.

In 1573, [[Henry III of |Henry de Valois of ]], the first elected king, approbated the [[Henrician Articles]] which obliged future monarchs to respect the rights of nobles. When he left  to become [[List of  monarchs|King of ]], his successor, [[Stephen Báthory]], led a successful [[Livonian campaign of Stephen Báthory|campaign]] in the [[Livonian War]], granting  more [[Livonia|lands across the eastern shores]] of the Baltic Sea. State affairs were then headed by [[Jan Zamoyski]], the [[Chancellor ()|Crown Chancellor]]. Stephen's successor, [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]], defeated a rival [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] electoral candidate, [[Maximilian III, Archduke of |Archduke Maximilian III]], in the [[War of the  Succession (1587–1588)]]. In 1592, Sigismund succeeded his father [[John III of |John Vasa]], in [[Kingdom of |]]. The [[- union]] endured until 1599, when he was [[War against Sigismund|deposed]] by the Swedes.

[[File:Daniel Schultz, Portret Jana III Sobieskiego, króla Polski.jpg|thumb|upright|left|King [[John III Sobieski]] defeated the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] at the [[Battle of Vienna]] on 12 September 1683.]]

In 1609, Sigismund [[–Muscovite War (1605–1618)|invaded]] [[Tsardom of |]] which was engulfed in a [[Time of Troubles|civil war]], and a year later the  [[ hussars|winged hussar]] units under [[Stanisław Żółkiewski]] [[– occupation of Moscow|occupied]] Moscow for two years after defeating the Russians at [[Battle of Klushino|Klushino]]. Sigismund also countered the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the southeast; at [[Battle of Khotyn (1621)|Khotyn]] in 1621 [[Jan Karol Chodkiewicz]] achieved a decisive victory against the Turks, which ushered the downfall of Sultan [[Osman II]]. Sigismund's long reign in  coincided with the [[Sigismund III Vasa#Legacy|Silver Age]]. The liberal [[Władysław IV Vasa|Władysław IV]] effectively defended 's territorial possessions but after his death the vast Commonwealth began declining from internal disorder and constant warfare.

In 1648, the  hegemony over  sparked the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], followed by the decimating [[Deluge (history)| Deluge]] during the [[Second Northern War]], and Prussia's [[Treaty of Bromberg|independence]] in 1657. In 1683, [[John III Sobieski]] re-established military prowess when he halted the advance of an [[Ottoman Army (15th-19th centuries)|Ottoman Army]] into Europe at the [[Battle of Vienna]]. The [[House of Wettin|Saxon]] era, under [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus II]] and [[Augustus III of |Augustus III]], saw neighboring powers grow in strength at the expense of . Both Saxon kings faced opposition from [[Stanisław Leszczyński]] during the [[Great Northern War]] (1700) and the [[War of the  Succession]] (1733).

=== Partitions ===

[[File:Stanisław II August Poniatowski in coronation clothes.PNG|thumb|upright|right|[[Stanisław II Augustus]], the last [[King of ]], reigned from 1764 until his abdication on 25 November 1795.]]

The [[Royal elections in |royal election]] of 1764 resulted in the elevation of [[Stanisław August Poniatowski|Stanisław II Augustus Poniatowski]] to the monarchy. His candidacy was extensively funded by his sponsor and former lover, Empress [[Catherine II of ]]. The new king maneuvered between his desire to implement necessary modernising reforms, and the necessity to remain at peace with surrounding states. His ideals led to the formation of the 1768 [[Bar Confederation]], a rebellion directed against the Poniatowski and all external influence, which ineptly aimed to preserve 's sovereignty and privileges held by the nobility. The failed attempts at government restructuring as well as the domestic turmoil provoked its neighbours to invade.

In 1772, the [[First Partition of |First Partition of the Commonwealth]] by Prussia, , and  took place, an act which the [[Partition Sejm]], under considerable duress, eventually ratified as a [[List of  words and phrases used by  speakers#F|fait accompli]]. Disregarding the territorial losses, in 1773 a plan of critical reforms was established, in which the [[Commission of National Education]], the first government education authority in Europe, was inaugurated. Corporal punishment of schoolchildren was officially prohibited in 1783. Poniatowski was the head figure of the [[ Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], encouraged the development of industries, and embraced republican [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]]. For his contributions to the arts and sciences, he was awarded a [[Fellowship of the Royal Society]].

In 1791, the [[Great Sejm|Great Sejm parliament]] adopted the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|3 May Constitution]], the first set of supreme national laws, and introduced a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The [[Targowica Confederation]], an organisation of nobles and deputies opposing the act, appealed to Catherine and caused the [[– War of 1792|1792 – War]]. Fearing the reemergence of  hegemony,  and Prussia arranged and, in 1793, executed the [[Second Partition of |Second Partition]], which left the country deprived of territory and incapable of independent existence. On 24 October 1795, the Commonwealth was [[Third Partition of |partitioned for the third time]] and ceased to exist as a territorial entity. Stanisław Augustus, the last King of , abdicated the throne on 25 November 1795.

=== Era of insurrections ===

The  people [[List of wars involving |rose several times against the partitioners]] and occupying armies. An unsuccessful attempt at defending 's sovereignty took place in the 1794 [[Kościuszko Uprising]], where a popular and distinguished general [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]], who had several years earlier served under [[George Washington]] in the [[ Revolutionary War]], led  insurgents. Despite the victory at the [[Battle of Racławice]], his ultimate defeat ended 's independent existence [[Third Partition of |for 123 years]].

In 1806, an [[Greater  uprising (1806)|insurrection]] organised by [[Jan Henryk Dąbrowski]] liberated western  ahead of [[Napoleon I of |Napoleon]]'s advance into Prussia during the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]]. In accordance with the 1807 [[Treaty of Tilsit]], Napoleon proclaimed the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a [[client state]] ruled by his ally [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony]]. The Poles actively aided  troops in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], particularly those under [[Józef Poniatowski]] who became [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshal of ]] shortly before his death at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]] in 1813. In the aftermath of Napoleon's exile, the Duchy of Warsaw was abolished at the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 and its territory was divided into  [[Congress Kingdom of ]], the Prussian [[Grand Duchy of Posen]], and [[ | Galicia]] with the [[Free City of Kraków]].

In 1830, [[non-commissioned officer]]s at Warsaw's [[Corps of Cadets (Warsaw)|Officer Cadet School]] rebelled in what was the [[November Uprising]]. After its collapse, Congress  lost its [[Constitution of Congress |constitutional autonomy]], [[Army of Congress |army]] and legislative assembly. During the [[Spring of Nations|European Spring of Nations]], Poles took up arms in the [[Greater  Uprising (1848)|Greater  Uprising of 1848]] to resist [[Germanisation]], but its failure saw duchy's status reduced to a mere [[Province of Posen|province]]; and subsequent integration into the [[ Empire]] in 1871. In , the fall of the [[January Uprising]] (1863–1864) prompted severe [[January Uprising#The decades of reprisals|political, social and cultural reprisals]], followed by deportations and [[pogroms]] of the -Jewish population. Towards the end of the 19th century, Congress  became heavily industrialised; its primary exports being coal, [[zinc]], iron and textiles.

=== Second  Republic ===
{{Main|History of  (1918–1939)|Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Second  Republic}}
[[File:Józef Piłsudski (-1930).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Naczelnik państwa|Chief of State]] Marshal [[Józef Piłsudski]] was a hero of the  independence campaign and the nation's premiere statesman from 1918 until his death on 12 May 1935.]]
In the aftermath of [[World War I]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] agreed on the reconstitution of , confirmed through the [[Treaty of Versailles]] of June 1919. A total of 2 million  troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers, and over 450,000 died. Following the [[Armistice with  (Compiègne)|armistice with ]] in November 1918,  regained its independence as the [[Second  Republic]].

The Second  Republic reaffirmed its sovereignty after [[List of wars involving |a series of military conflicts]], most notably the [[–Soviet War]], when  inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[Red Army]] at the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]].

The inter-war period heralded a new era of  politics. Whilst  political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until [[World War I]], a new political tradition was established in the country. Many exiled  activists, such as [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], who would later become prime minister, returned home. A significant number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures. Tragedy struck in 1922 when [[Gabriel Narutowicz]], inaugural holder of the presidency, was assassinated at the [[Zachęta]] Gallery in Warsaw by a painter and right-wing nationalist [[Eligiusz Niewiadomski]].

In 1926, the [[May Coup ()|May Coup]], led by the hero of the  independence campaign Marshal [[Józef Piłsudski]], turned rule of the Second  Republic over to the nonpartisan [[Sanacja]] (''Healing'') movement to prevent radical political organisations on both the left and the right from destabilising the country. By the late 1930s, due to increased threats posed by political extremism inside the country, the  government became increasingly heavy-handed, banning a number of radical organisations, including communist and ultra-nationalist political parties, which threatened the stability of the country.

=== World War II ===

World War II began with the [[Nazi ]] [[invasion of ]] on 1 September 1939, followed by the [[Soviet invasion of ]] on 17 September. On 28 September 1939, [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|Warsaw fell]]. As agreed in the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]],  was split into two zones, [[ areas annexed by Nazi |one occupied by Nazi ]], the other by [[territories of  annexed by the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]]. In 1939–1941, the Soviets deported hundreds of thousands of Poles. The Soviet [[NKVD]] executed thousands of  prisoners of war (among other incidents in the [[Katyn massacre]]) ahead of [[Operation Barbarossa]].  planners had in November 1939 called for "the complete destruction of all Poles" and their fate as outlined in the genocidal ''[[Generalplan Ost]]''.

 made the fourth-largest troop contribution in Europe, and its troops served both the [[ Government in Exile]] in the [[ Armed Forces in the West|west]] and Soviet leadership in the [[ Armed Forces in the East|east]].  troops played an important role in the [[Operation Overlord|Normandy]], [[ Campaign (World War II)|]], [[North African Campaign]]s and [[Operation Pheasant|]] and are particularly remembered for the [[Battle of Britain]] and [[Battle of Monte Cassino]].  intelligence operatives proved extremely valuable to the Allies, providing much of the intelligence from Europe and beyond, [[ Cipher Bureau| code breakers]] were responsible for [[cryptanalysis of the Enigma|cracking the Enigma cipher]] and  scientists participating in the [[Manhattan Project]] were co-creators of the  [[atomic bomb]]. In the east, the Soviet-backed [[First  Army (1944–1945)| 1st Army]] distinguished itself in the battles for [[Warsaw Uprising|Warsaw]] and [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin]].

The [[ resistance movement in World War II|wartime resistance movement]], and the [[Armia Krajowa]] (''Home Army''), fought against  occupation. It was one of the three largest resistance movements of the entire war, and encompassed a range of clandestine activities, which functioned as an [[ Underground State|underground state]] complete with [[Education in  during World War II|degree-awarding universities]] and [[Underground court|a court system]]. The resistance was loyal to the exiled government and generally resented the idea of a communist ; for this reason, in the summer of 1944 it initiated [[Operation Tempest]], of which the [[Warsaw Uprising]] that began on 1 August 1944 is the best-known operation.

Nazi  forces under orders from [[Adolf Hitler]] set up six  [[extermination camp]]s in occupied , including [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]], [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]] and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. The Germans [[Holocaust train|transported millions of Jews]] from across occupied Europe to be murdered in those camps. Altogether, 3 million  Jews – approximately 90% of 's pre-war Jewry – and between 1.8 and 2.8 million ethnic Poles were killed during the  [[Occupation of  (1939–1945)|occupation of ]], including between 50,000 and 100,000 members of the  [[intelligentsia]] – academics, doctors, lawyers, nobility and priesthood. During the Warsaw Uprising alone, over 150,000  civilians were killed, most were murdered by the Germans during the [[Wola massacre|Wola]] and [[Ochota massacre|Ochota]] massacres. Around 150,000  civilians were killed by Soviets between 1939 and 1941 during the Soviet Union's occupation of eastern  ([[Kresy]]), and another estimated 100,000 Poles were murdered by the [[ Insurgent Army]] (UPA) between 1943 and 1944 in what became known as the [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia|Wołyń Massacres]]. [[World War II casualties|Of all the countries]] in the war,  lost the highest percentage of its citizens: around 6 million perished – more than one-sixth of 's pre-war population – [[Holocaust in |half of them]]  Jews. About 90% of deaths were non-military in nature.

In 1945, 's borders [[Territorial changes of  immediately after World War II|were shifted westwards]]. Over two million  inhabitants of [[Kresy]] [[ population transfers (1944–1946)|were expelled]] along the [[Curzon Line]] by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]. The western border became the [[Oder-Neisse line]]. As a result, 's territory was reduced by 20%, or {{convert|77500|km2|sqmi}}. The shift forced the migration of [[World War II evacuation and expulsion|millions of other people]], most of whom were Poles, Germans, Ukrainians, and Jews.

=== Post-war communism ===

At the insistence of [[Joseph Stalin]], the [[Yalta Conference]] sanctioned the formation of a new provisional pro-Communist coalition government in Moscow, which ignored the [[ government-in-exile]] based in London. This action angered many Poles who considered it a [[Yalta betrayal|betrayal]] by the Allies. In 1944, Stalin had made guarantees to [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] that he would maintain 's sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place. However, upon achieving victory in 1945, the elections organised by the occupying Soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of legitimacy for Soviet hegemony over  affairs. The Soviet Union instituted a new [[communist state|communist]] government in , analogous to much of the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. [[Anti-Communism in the Communist Bloc|As elsewhere in Communist Europe]], the Soviet influence over  was met with [[Cursed soldiers|armed resistance]] from the outset which continued into the 1950s.

Despite widespread objections, the new  government accepted the Soviet annexation of the pre-war eastern regions of  (in particular the cities of [[Wilno]] and [[Lwów]]) and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of [[Red Army]] units on 's territory. Military alignment within the [[Warsaw Pact]] throughout the [[Cold War]] came about as a direct result of this change in 's political culture. In the European scene, it came to characterise the full-fledged integration of  into the brotherhood of communist nations.

The new communist government took control with the adoption of the [[Small Constitution of 1947|Small Constitution]] on 19 February 1947. The [[ People's Republic]] (''Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa'') [[Constitution of the People's Republic of |was officially proclaimed in 1952]]. In 1956, after the death of [[Bolesław Bierut]], the régime of [[Władysław Gomułka]] became temporarily more liberal, freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms. [[Collectivization in the  People's Republic|Collectivisation in the  People's Republic]] failed. A similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under [[Edward Gierek]], but most of the time persecution of [[Anti-communist resistance in  (1944–1989)|anti-communist opposition]] groups persisted.
