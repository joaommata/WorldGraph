===Indigenous peoples===
The [[Settlement of the Americas|first inhabitants of North America]] are generally hypothesized to have migrated from [[Siberia]] by way of the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] and arrived at least 14,000 years ago. The [[Paleo-]] archeological sites at [[Old Crow Flats]] and [[Bluefish Caves]] are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in . The [[Technological and industrial history of #The Stone Age: Fire (14,000 BC – AD 1600)|characteristics of Indigenous societies]] included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations. [[Indigenous peoples in |Indigenous peoples in present-day ]] include the [[First Nations in |First Nations]], [[Inuit]], and [[Métis people in |Métis]], the last being of [[mixed-blood|mixed descent]] who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and their offspring subsequently developed their own identity.[[File:Indigenous population by census division.svg|upright=1.3|thumb|A map of  showing the percent of [[Population of #Indigenous peoples|self-reported indigenous identity]] (First Nations, Inuit, Métis) by census division, according to the [[2021  census]]]]

The [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous population]] at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million, with a figure of 500,000 accepted by 's [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]]. As a consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent. The decline is attributed to several causes, including the [[Columbian exchange|transfer of European diseases]], to which they had no natural immunity, conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.

Although not without conflict, [[European Canadians]]' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of [[Former colonies and territories in |European colonies in ]], particularly for their role in assisting European [[coureur des bois|coureurs des bois]] and [[voyageurs]] in their explorations of the continent during the [[North  fur trade]]. These early European interactions with First Nations would change from [[Peace and Friendship Treaties|friendship and peace treaties]] to the [[Numbered Treaties|dispossession of Indigenous lands through treaties]]. From the late 18th century, European Canadians forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a western  society. [[Settler colonialism in |Settler colonialism]] reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A period of redress began with the formation of a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission of |reconciliation commission]] by the [[Government of ]] in 2008. This included acknowledgment of [[ genocide of Indigenous peoples|cultural genocide]], [[ Residential Schools Settlement Agreement|settlement agreements]], and betterment of racial discrimination issues, such as addressing the plight of [[missing and murdered Indigenous women]].

===European colonization===

It is believed that the first documented European to explore the east coast of  was [[Vikings|Norse]] explorer [[Leif Erikson]]. In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] on the northern tip of [[Newfoundland]]. No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when seafarer [[John Cabot]] explored and claimed 's [[Atlantic |Atlantic coast]] in the name of [[Henry VII of England]]. In 1534,  explorer Jacques Cartier explored the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] where, on July 24, he planted a {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} cross bearing the words, "long live the King of ", and took possession of the territory New  in the name of [[Francis I of |King Francis I]]. The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the [[Basques|Basque]] and [[ discoveries|]] establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast. In general, early settlements during the [[Age of Discovery]] appear to have been [[Population of #Ephemeral European settlements|short-lived]] due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia.

In 1583, Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]], by the [[royal prerogative]] of Queen [[Elizabeth I]], founded [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's, Newfoundland]], as the first North  [[ overseas possessions| seasonal camp]]. In 1600, the  established their first seasonal trading post at [[Tadoussac]] along the Saint Lawrence.  explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at [[Port-Royal (Acadia)|Port Royal]] (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608). Among the [[ colonization of the Americas|colonists]] of New , ''[[ Canadians|Canadiens]]'' extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and [[Acadians]] settled the present-day [[The Maritimes|Maritimes]], while fur traders and [[Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery|Catholic missionaries]] explored the [[Great Lakes]], [[Hudson Bay]], and the [[Mississippi watershed]] to [[Louisiana (New )|Louisiana]]. The [[Beaver Wars]] broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North  fur trade.

The  established additional settlements in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in 1610 along with settlements in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to the south. A series of [[ and  Wars|four wars]] erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North  theatre of the [[Seven Years' War]]. Mainland [[Nova Scotia]] came under British rule with the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]] and  and most of New  came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War.

===British North America===

The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] established First Nation treaty rights, created the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]] out of New , and annexed [[Cape Breton Island]] to Nova Scotia. St John's Island (now [[Prince Edward Island]]) became a separate colony in 1769. To avert conflict in [[Quebec]], the British Parliament passed the [[Quebec Act]] 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and [[Ohio River|Ohio Valley]]. More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule. It re-established the  language, Catholic faith, and [[Law of | civil law]] there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies. The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the [[ Revolution]].

After the successful  War of Independence, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]] recognized the independence of the newly formed [[]] and set the terms of peace, ceding [[British North America]]n territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country. The  war of independence also caused a large out-migration of [[Loyalists]], the settlers who had fought against  independence. Many moved to , particularly Atlantic , where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. [[New Brunswick]] was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the incorporation of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], as 's first city. To accommodate the influx of -speaking Loyalists in Central , the [[Constitutional Act 1791|Constitutional Act of 1791]] divided the province of  into -speaking Lower  (later [[Quebec]]) and -speaking Upper  (later [[Ontario# West (1841–1867)|Ontario]]), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.

The Canadas were the main front in the [[War of 1812]] between the  and the [[ of Great Britain and |]]. Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed. Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over {{formatnum:960000}} arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850. New arrivals included refugees escaping the [[Great  Famine]] as well as [[ Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking Scots displaced by the [[Highland Clearances]]. Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to  before 1891.

The desire for [[responsible government]] resulted in the abortive [[Rebellions of 1837]]. The [[Durham Report]] subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of  Canadians into  culture. The [[Act of Union 1840]] merged the Canadas into a united Province of  and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America east of Lake Superior by 1855. The signing of the [[Oregon Treaty]] by Britain and the  in 1846 ended the [[Oregon boundary dispute]], extending the border westward along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]]. This paved the way for British colonies on [[Colony of Vancouver Island|Vancouver Island (1849)]] and in [[Colony of British Columbia (1858–1866)|British Columbia (1858)]]. The Anglo- [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825)]] established the border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US [[Alaska Purchase]] of 1867, disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska–Yukon and Alaska–British Columbia border.

===Confederation and expansion===
[[File: provinces evolution 2.gif|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Refer to caption|Animated map showing [[Territorial evolution of |the growth and change of 's provinces and territories]] since Confederation in 1867]]

Following three constitutional conferences, the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]]'' officially proclaimed  Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: [[Ontario]], Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.  assumed control of [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] to form the [[Northwest Territories]], where the Métis' grievances ignited the [[Red River Rebellion]] and the creation of the province of [[Manitoba]] in July 1870. British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which [[Colony of British Columbia (1866–1871)|had been united]] in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years, while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873. In 1898, during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory. [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] became provinces in 1905. Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the  population emigrated south to the US.

To open [[Western |the West]] and encourage European immigration, the Government of  sponsored the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the [[ Pacific Railway]]), passed the ''[[Dominion Lands Act]]'' to regulate settlement and established the [[North-West Mounted Police]] to assert authority over the territory. This [[Post-Confederation  (1867–1914)#Expansion|period of westward expansion]] and [[National Policy|nation building]] resulted in the displacement of many [[Plains Indians|Indigenous peoples of the  Prairies]] to "[[ reserve]]s", clearing the way for ethnic European [[block settlement]]s. This caused the collapse of the [[History of bison conservation in #Plains bison|Plains Bison in western ]] and the introduction of European [[Agriculture in |cattle farms and wheat fields]] dominating the land. The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands. The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves. During this time,  introduced the ''[[ Act]]'' extending its control over the First Nations to education, government and legal rights.

Because Britain still maintained control of 's foreign affairs under the British North America Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought [[Military history of  during World War I| into the First World War]]. Volunteers sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] later became part of the [[ Corps]], which played a substantial role in the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] and other major engagements of the war. The [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]] erupted when the [[Unionist Party ()|Unionist]] Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with [[conscription]] was met with vehement objections from -speaking Quebecers. In 1919,  joined the [[League of Nations]] independently of Britain, and the ''[[Statute of Westminster, 1931]]'', affirmed 's independence.

The [[Great Depression in ]] during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country. In response to the downturn, the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a [[welfare state]] (as pioneered by [[Tommy Douglas]]) in the 1940s and 1950s. On the advice of Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], [[Declaration of war by #Nazi |war with  was declared]] effective September 10, 1939, by King [[George VI]], seven days after the . The delay underscored 's independence.

The first  Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during the [[Second World War]].  troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 [[Dieppe Raid]], the [[Allied invasion of ]], the [[Normandy landings]], the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]], and the [[Battle of the Scheldt]] in 1944.  provided asylum for the [[ monarchy]] while that country was [[Reichskommissariat Niederlande|occupied]] and is credited by the  for major contributions to [[Liberation Day ()|its liberation]] from [[Nazi ]]. Despite another [[Conscription Crisis of 1944|conscription crisis in Quebec in 1944]],  finished the war with a large army and strong economy.

===Contemporary era===
The financial crisis of the Great Depression led the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a [[Crown colony]] ruled by a British governor. After two [[1948 Newfoundland referendums|referendums]], Newfoundlanders voted to join  in 1949 as a province.

's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new [[ identity]], marked by the adoption of the [[Flag of |maple leaf flag]] in 1965, the implementation of [[official bilingualism]] ( and ) in 1969, and the institution of [[Multiculturalism#|official multiculturalism]] in 1971. [[Socially democratic]] programs were also instituted, such as [[Medicare ()|Medicare]], the [[ Pension Plan]], and [[Student financial aid in | Student Loans]]; though, provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.
[[File: Charter of Rights and Freedoms ().jpg|thumb|A copy of the ''[[ Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''|alt=refer to caption]]

Finally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the '' Act 1982'', the [[patriation]] of 's constitution from the , concurrent with the creation of the ''[[ Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''.  had established complete sovereignty as an independent country under [[Monarchy of |its own monarchy]]. In 1999, [[Nunavut]] became 's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government.

At the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s, giving birth to a secular [[Quebec nationalism|nationalist]] movement. The radical [[Front de libération du Québec]] (FLQ) ignited the [[October Crisis]] with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970, and the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|{{Not a typo|sovereigntist}}]] [[Parti Québécois]] was elected in 1976, organizing an [[1980 Quebec referendum|unsuccessful referendum]] on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the [[Meech Lake Accord]] failed in 1990. This led to the formation of the [[Bloc Québécois]] in Quebec and the invigoration of the [[Reform Party of ]] in the West. A [[1995 Quebec referendum|second referendum]] followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent. In 1997, the [[Supreme Court of |Supreme Court]] ruled [[Reference Re Secession of Quebec|unilateral secession]] by a province would be unconstitutional, and the [[Clarity Act]] was passed by Parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation.

In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook  society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of [[Air  Flight 182]] in 1985, the largest mass murder in  history; the [[École Polytechnique massacre]] in 1989, a [[School shooting|university shooting]] targeting female students; and the [[Oka Crisis]] of 1990, the first of a number of violent confrontations between provincial governments and Indigenous groups.  joined the [[Gulf War]] in 1990 and was active in [[List of  peacekeeping missions|several peacekeeping missions]] in the 1990s, including operations in the [[Balkans]] during and after the [[Yugoslav Wars]], and in [[]], resulting in an incident that has been described as "[[ affair|the darkest era in the history of the  military]]".  sent [[ in the War in |troops to  in 2001]], resulting in the largest amount of [[ Forces casualties in | deaths]] for any single military mission since the [[ in the  War| War]] in the early 1950s.

In 2011,  forces participated in the [[NATO]]-led intervention into the [[First  Civil War| Civil War]] and also became involved in battling the [[Islamic State]] insurgency in  in the mid-2010s. The [[COVID-19 pandemic in ]] began on January 27, 2020, causing widespread social and economic disruption.
