La Balma de la [[La Margineda|Margineda]], found by archaeologists at [[Sant Julià de Lòria]], was settled in 9,500 BCE as a passing place between the two sides of the Pyrenees. The seasonal camp was perfectly located for hunting and fishing by the groups of hunter-gatherers from [[Ariège (river)|Ariege]] and [[Segre (river)|Segre]].

During the [[Neolithic]], a group of people moved to the [[Madriu-Perafita-Claror Valley|Valley of Madriu]] (the present-day Natural Park located in [[Escaldes–Engordany|Escaldes-Engordany]] declared [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]) as a permanent camp in 6640 BCE. The population of the valley grew cereals, raised domestic livestock, and developed commercial trade with people from [[Sègre (department)|Ségre]] and [[Occitania]].{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 32, 33}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 44 a 92}}

Other archaeological deposits include the Tombs of [[Segudet]] ([[Ordino]]) and Feixa del Moro (Sant Julià de Lòria), both dated in 4900–4300 BCE as an example of the [[Urnfield culture|Urn culture]] in .{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 32, 33}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 44 a 92}} The model of small settlements began to evolve to complex urbanism during the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Metallurgy|Metallurgical]] items of iron, ancient coins, and reliquaries can be found in the [[Sanctuary|ancient sanctuaries]] scattered around the country.

The sanctuary of Roc de les Bruixes (Stone of the Witches) is perhaps the most important archeological complex of this age in , located in the parish of [[Canillo]], about the rituals of funerals, ancient scripture and engraved stone [[mural]]s.{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 34, 35, 38, 39}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 44 a 92}}

===Iberian and Roman ===

The inhabitants of the valleys were traditionally associated with the [[Iberians]] and historically located in  as the Iberian tribe Andosins or Andosini ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδοσίνους}}) during the 7th and 2nd centuries BC. Influenced by the [[Proto-Celtic language|Celtic]], [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]], [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Iberian languages]], the locals developed some current toponyms. Early writings and documents relating to this group of people goes back to the second century BC by the  writer [[Polybius]] in his ''Histories'' during the [[Punic Wars]].{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 43}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 44 a 92}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 36, 37}}

Some of the most significant remains of this era are the Castle of the Roc d'Enclar (part of the early [[Marca Hispanica]]),{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 44, 45, 46, 47}} l'Anxiu in [[Les Escaldes]] and Roc de L'Oral in [[Encamp]].{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 44 a 92}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 36, 37}}

The presence of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] influence is recorded from the 2nd century BCE to the 5th century CE. The places with the most Roman presence are in Camp Vermell (Red Field) in [[Sant Julià de Lòria]], and in some places in Encamp and in the Roc d'Enclar. People continued trading, mainly with wine and cereals, with the Roman cities of [[Urgellet]] (the present-day [[La Seu d'Urgell]]) and across Segre through the [[Roman roads|''via romana'']] Strata Ceretana (also known as Strata Confluetana).{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 44 a 92}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 52, 53}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 44, 45, 46, 47}}

===Visigoths and Carolingians: the legend of Charlemagne===
[[File:Charlemagne_et_Louis_le_Pieux.jpg|right|thumb|[[Charlemagne]] instructing his son, [[Louis the Pious]]]]

After the [[fall of the Roman Empire]],  came under the influence of the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigoths]], the [[History of Toledo, #Visigothic Toledo|Kingdom of Toledo]], and the [[Diocese of Urgell]]. The Visigoths remained in the valleys for 200 years, during which time [[Gothic Christianity|Christianity]] spread. When the [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Empire of Al-Andalus]] replaced the ruling Visigoths in most of the Iberian Peninsula,  was under the jurisdiction of the [[Francia|Franks]].{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}}

Tradition holds that Charles the Great (Charlemagne) granted a charter to the  people for a contingent of 5,000 soldiers under the command of Marc Almugaver, in return for fighting against the [[Moors]] near [[Porté-Puymorens]] ([[Cerdanya]]).

[[File:Parr%C3%B2quies_andorra.png|right|thumb|The six old parishes, each named for their [[patron ]], as depicted in the ''Acta de Consagració i Dotació de la Catedral de la Seu d'Urgell'' (839)]]

 remained part of the [[Hispanic Marches|Frankish ''Marca Hispanica'']], the buffer zone between the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] and the Muslim territories,  being part of the territory ruled by the [[Counts of Urgell|Count of Urgell]] and eventually the bishop of the Diocese of Urgell. Tradition also holds that it was guaranteed by the son of Charlemagne, [[Louis the Pious]], writing the ''Carta de Poblament'' or a local [[municipal charter]] {{Circa|805}}.

The first document that mentions  as a territory is the ''Acta de Consagració i Dotació de la Catedral de la Seu d'Urgell'' (Deed of Consecration and Endowment of the Cathedral of La Seu d'Urgell). The document, dated 839, depicts the six old [[Parishes of |parishes]] of the  valleys that made up the country's administrative division.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 96 a 146}}

In 988, Count [[Borrell II]] of Urgell gave the  valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in [[Cerdanya]]. Since then, the bishop of Urgell, based in Seu d'Urgell, has been [[Co-Princes of |co-prince]] of .

===Middle Ages: The Paréages and the founding of the Co-Principality===

Before 1095,  had no military protection, and the bishop of Urgell, who knew that the count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the  valleys, asked the [[Lord of Caboet]] for help and protection. In 1095, the lord of Caboet and the bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over . [[Arnalda de Caboet]], daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the viscount of Castellbò. Their daughter, [[Ermessenda de Castellbò]], married the [[count of Foix]], [[Roger-Bernard II, Count of Foix|Roger-Bernard II]]. Roger-Bernard II and Ermessenda shared rule over  with the bishop of Urgell.

In the 13th century, a military dispute arose between the bishop of Urgell and the count of Foix as aftermath of the [[Cathar Crusade]]. The conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of the [[king of Aragon]], [[Peter III of Aragon|Peter III]], between the bishop and the count, by the signing of the [[Paréage of  1278|first paréage]], which provided that 's sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix (whose title would ultimately transfer to the  head of state) and the bishop of Urgell, in the [[Principality of Catalonia]]. This gave the principality its territory and political form.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 96 a 146}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009}}

A second paréage was signed in 1288 after a dispute when the count of Foix ordered the construction of a castle in Roc d'Enclar.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 96 a 146}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009}} The document was ratified by the noble notary [[County of Cerdanya|Jaume Orig of Puigcerdà]], and construction of military structures in the country was prohibited.{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 60, 61}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 96 a 146}}

In 1364, the political organisation of the country named the figure of the [[syndic]] (now spokesman and president of the parliament) as representative of the  to their co-princes, making possible the creation of [[Parishes of |local departments]] (comuns, quarts and veïnats). After being ratified by Bishop Francesc Tovia and Count [[John I, Count of Foix|John I]], the Consell de la Terra or [[General Council ()|Consell General de les Valls]] (General Council of the Valleys) was founded in 1419, the second oldest parliament in Europe. The syndic Andreu d'Alàs and the General Council organised the creation of the [[Politics of #Judicial branch|Justice Courts]] (La Cort de Justicia) in 1433 with the co-princes and the collection of taxes like foc i lloc (literally "fire and site", a national tax active since then).{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 78, 79, 80, 81, 88, 89}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}}

Although there are remains of ecclesiastical works dating before the 9th century (Sant Vicenç d'Enclar or [[Església de Santa Coloma]]),  developed exquisite [[Romanesque Art and Architecture|Romanesque Art]] during the 9th through 14th centuries, particularly in the construction of churches, bridges, religious murals and statues of the [[Virgin and Child]] ([[Our Lady of Meritxell]] being the most important).{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}} Nowadays, the [[List of regional characteristics of Romanesque churches#Romanesque churches in ,  and |Romanesque]] buildings that form part of [[Cultural Heritage of |'s cultural heritage]] stand out in a remarkable way, with an emphasis on [[Església de Sant Esteve]], [[Sant Joan de Caselles]], [[Església de Sant Miquel d'Engolasters]], [[Sant Martí de la Cortinada]] and the medieval bridges of [[Pont de la Margineda|Margineda]] and [[Pont dels Escalls|Escalls]] among many others.{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 48, 49}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 150 a 194}}

The Catalan Pyrenees were embryonic of the [[Catalan language]] at the end of the 11th century.  was influenced by this language, which was adopted locally decades before it expanded to the rest of the Crown of Aragon.

The local economy during the [[Middle Ages]] was based on livestock, agriculture, furs and weavers. Later, at the end of the 11th century, the first [[Bloomery#Early to Medieval Europe|iron foundries]] began to appear in Northern Parishes like [[Ordino]], much appreciated by the master artisans who developed the art of the forges, an important economic activity in the country from the 15th century.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}}

In 1601 the [[#Law and criminal justice|Tribunal de Corts]] (High Court of Justice) was created as a result of [[Huguenot rebellions]] in [[Early modern |]], [[ Inquisition|Inquisition]] courts coming from [[Habsburg |]] and [[Catalan mythology about witches|witchcraft-related beliefs native to the area]], in the context of the [[Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]].{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|pp=44, 45, 47, 48, 50}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 108, 109}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 238, 239}}

With the passage of time, the co-title to  passed to the kings of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. After [[Henry IV of |Henry III of Navarre]] became [[king of ]], he issued an edict in 1607 that established the head of the  state and the bishop of Urgell as [[Co-Princes of ]], a political arrangement that still holds.

During 1617, communal councils form the sometent (popular militia or army) to deal with the rise of bandolerisme ([[brigandage]]) and the Consell de la Terra was defined and structured in terms of its composition, organisation and competences current today.{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|pp=44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 53, 54, 56}}

 continued with the same economic system that it had during the 12th–14th centuries with a large production of metallurgy (fargues, a system similar to Farga Catalana) and with the introduction of tobacco circa 1692 and import trade. In 1371 and 1448, the co-princes ratified the fair of  la Vella, the most important annual national festival commercially ever since.{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=14}}{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=15}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 134}}

The country had a unique and experienced guild of weavers, Confraria de Paraires i Teixidors, in [[Escaldes-Engordany]]. Founded in 1604, it took advantage of the local thermal waters. By this time, the country was characterised by the social system of prohoms (wealthy society) and casalers (rest of the population with smaller economic acquisition), deriving from the tradition of [[pubilla]] and [[Heir|hereu]].{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|pp=20, 21}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp=106, 107}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 105, 106, 107, 140, 141}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 263 a 270}}

Three centuries after its foundation, the Consell de la Terra located its headquarters and the Tribunal de Corts in [[Casa de la Vall]] in 1702. The [[manor house]] built in 1580 served as a noble fortress of the Busquets family. Inside the parliament was placed the Closet of the Six Keys (Armari de les sis claus), representative of each  parish, where the [[ constitution]] and other documents and laws were later kept.{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|p=60}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|p = 82}}

In both the [[Reapers' War]] and the [[War of the  Succession]], the  people (while professing to be a neutral country) supported the [[Catalans]] who saw their [[Catalan constitutions|rights]] reduced in [[Nueva Planta decrees|1716]]. The reaction was the promotion of Catalan writings in , with cultural works such as the ''Book of Privileges'' (''Llibre de Privilegis de 1674''), ''Manual Digest'' (1748) by Antoni Fiter i Rossell or the ''Polità andorrà'' (1763) by Antoni Puig.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|p = 229}}{{sfn|Llop Rovira|1998|pp = 49 a 52, i 57, 58}}

After the [[ Revolution]], [[Napoleon I]] reestablished the Co-Principate in 1809 and removed the  medieval title. In 1812–1813, the [[First  Empire]] annexed Catalonia during the [[Peninsular War]] ({{lang|ca|Guerra Peninsular}}) and divided the region into four [[département]]s, with  as a part of the district of [[Puigcerdà]].

During this period, 's late medieval institutions and rural culture remained largely unchanged. In 1866, the [[syndic]] [[Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit]] led the reformist group in a Council General of 24 members elected by suffrage limited to heads of families. The Council General replaced the aristocratic oligarchy that previously ruled the state.

The authorities of the Co-Princes banned casinos and betting houses throughout the country. The ban resulted in an economic conflict and the Revolution of 1881, which began when revolutionaries assaulted the house of the syndic on 8 December 1880, and established the Provisional Revolutionary Council led by Joan Pla i Calvo and Pere Baró i Mas. The Provisional Revolutionary Council allowed for the construction of casinos and spas by foreign companies.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=198–203}} From 7 to 9 June 1881, the loyalists of [[Canillo]] and [[Encamp]] reconquered the parishes of [[Ordino]] and [[La Massana]] by establishing contact with the revolutionary forces in [[Escaldes-Engordany]].{{sfn|Peruga Guerrero|1998|pp=59–63}} After a day of combat the [[Pont dels Escalls|Treaty of the Bridge of Escalls]] was signed on 10 June.{{sfn|Ministeri d'Educació, Joventut i Esports|1996|pp=58–65}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=194–195}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=348–350}} The council was replaced and new elections were held.

 participated in the cultural movement of the Catalan [[Renaixença]]. Between 1882 and 1887, the first academic schools were formed where trilingualism coexisted with the official language, Catalan. [[Romanticism|Romantic]] authors from [[ Third Republic|]] and [[Restoration ()|]] reported the awakening of the [[Romantic nationalism|national consciousness]] of the country. [[Jacint Verdaguer]] lived in Ordino during the 1880s where he wrote and shared works related to the Renaixença with writer and photographer [[Casa Rossell|Joaquim de Riba]].

In 1848, [[Fromental Halévy]] had premiered the opera ''[[Le val d'Andorre]]'' to great success in Europe, where the national consciousness of the valleys was exposed in the romantic work during the Peninsular War.{{sfn|Peruga Guerrero|1998|pp=78–81}}{{sfn|Ministeri d'Educació, Joventut i Esports|1996|p=74}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=354–357}}

[[File:Skossyreff Writing Constitution.png|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Boris Skossyreff]], briefly self-proclaimed King of  in 1934]]

In 1933  occupied  following social unrest which occurred before elections due to the [[ Revolution|Revolution of 1933]] and the FHASA strikes (Vagues de FHASA); the revolt led by [[Young |Joves ]] (a [[Trade union|labour union group]] related to the  [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]]) called for political reforms, the [[universal suffrage|universal suffrage vote]] of all  and acted in defence of the rights of local and foreign workers during the construction of FHASA's hydroelectric power station in [[Encamp]]. On 5 April 1933 Joves  seized the  Parliament. These actions were preceded by the arrival of Colonel René-Jules Baulard with 50 [[National Gendarmerie|gendarmes]] and the mobilisation of 200 local militias or sometent led by the Síndic Francesc Cairat.

On 6 July 1934, adventurer and nobleman [[Boris Skossyreff]], with his promise of freedoms and modernisation of the country and wealth through the establishment of a tax haven and foreign investments, received the support of the members of the General Council to proclaim himself the sovereign of . On 8 July 1934 Boris issued a proclamation in Urgell, declaring himself Boris I, King of , simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell and approving the King's constitution on 10 July. He was arrested by the Co-Prince and Bishop [[Justí Guitart i Vilardebó]] and their authorities on 20 July and ultimately expelled from [[Second  Republic|]]. From 1936 until 1940, a  military detachment of [[Garde Mobile]] led by well-known Colonel René-Jules Baulard was garrisoned in  to secure the principality against disruption from the [[ Civil War]] and [[Francoist ]] and also face the rise of [[Republicanism]] in the aftermath of the 1933 Revolution. During the  Civil War, the inhabitants of  welcomed refugees from both sides, and many of them settled permanently in the country thus contributing to the subsequent economic boom and the entry into the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] era of . Francoist troops reached the  border in the later stages of the war.

During World War II,  remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between [[Vichy ]] and Francoist . Many  criticised the passivity of the General Council for impeding both the entry and expulsion of foreigners and refugees, committing economic crimes, reducing the rights of citizens and sympathy with [[Francoism]]. General Council members justified the council's political and diplomatic actions as necessary for 's survival and the protection of its sovereignty.  was relatively unscathed by the two world wars and the  Civil War. Certain [[Resistance during World War II|groups]] formed to help victims of oppression in [[Nazi |Nazi]]-occupied countries, while participating in smuggling to help  survive. Among the most prominent was the [[Hostal Palanques]] Evasion Network Command, which, in contact with the  [[MI6]], helped almost 400 fugitives, among whom were [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] military personnel. The Command remained active between 1941 and 1944, although there were struggles with [[Axis powers|pro-Axis]] informers and [[Gestapo]] agents in .

In the capital city there was a smuggling black market of propaganda, culture and cinematic art not favourable to totalitarian regimes, promulgated in such places as the Hotel Mirador or the Casino Hotel, as a meeting place for [[Free |Free ]] forces and a route for escorting downed Allied pilots out of Europe. The network was maintained after the war, when film societies were formed, where movies, music and books [[Censorship in Francoist |censored in Franco's ]] were imported, becoming an anti-censorship attraction for the Catalan or foreign public even within . The  Group (Agrupament Andorrà), an [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist organisation]] linked to the Occitanie's [[ Resistance]], accused the  representative (veguer) of collaboration with [[Nazism]].

The  opening to the [[capitalist economy]] resulted in two axes: mass tourism and the country's tax exemption. The first steps towards the capitalist boom date from the 1930s, with the construction of FHASA and the creation of professional banking with [[Andbank|Banc Agrícol]] (1930) and [[Crèdit Andorrà]] (1949), later with [[Mora Banc Grup|Banca Mora]] (1952), [[Banca Privada d'|Banca Cassany]] (1957) and SOBANCA (1960). Shortly after, activities such as skiing and shopping helped the country become a tourist attraction, with the inauguration of ski resorts and cultural entities in the late 1930s. A revived hotel industry also developed. In April 1968 a social health insurance system was created ([[Caixa Andorrana de Seguretat Social|CASS]]).

 experienced an era commonly known as the " dream" (similar to the [[ Dream]]) along with the [[Trente Glorieuses]]: mass culture rooted itself in the country experiencing radical changes in the economy and culture. Proof of this was [[Ràdio ]], the top musical radio station in Europe in this period, with guests and speakers of great importance promoting musical hits from [[chanson française]], [[Swing (dance)|swing]], [[rhythm & blues]], [[jazz]], [[rock and roll]] and [[Country music| country music]]. During this period  achieved a GDP per capita and a life expectancy higher than most standard countries of the time.

Given its relative isolation,  has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than ,  and [[]]. But in recent times its thriving tourist industry, along with developments in transport and communications, have removed the country from its isolation. Since 1976 the country has seen the need to reform  institutions due to anachronisms in sovereignty, human rights and the balance of powers as well as the need to adapt legislation to modern demands. In 1982 a first separation of powers took place when instituting the Govern d', under the name of the executive board (Consell Executiu), chaired by the first prime minister [[Òscar Ribas Reig]] with the co-princes' approval. In 1989 the Principality signed an agreement with the [[European Economic Community]] to regularise trade relations.

Its political system was modernised in 1993 after the [[ constitutional referendum, 1993| constitutional referendum]], when the [[Constitution of |constitution]] was drafted by the co-princes and the General Council and approved on 14 March by 74.2% of voters, with a 76% turnout.
