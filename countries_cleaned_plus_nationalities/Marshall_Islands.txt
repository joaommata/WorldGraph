===Prehistory===
[[File:Sailing Canoe brailed on starboard tack, Jaliut Lagoon,  (1899-1900).jpg|thumb|Marshall Islanders sailing, with sails [[brail]]ed ([[reefing|reefed]]), c. 1899–1900]]

Linguistic and anthropological studies have suggested that the first [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] settlers of the  arrived from the [[ (archipelago)|]]. [[Radiocarbon dating]] suggests that [[Bikini Atoll]] may have been inhabited as early as 1200 BCE, though samples may not have been collected from secure [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] contexts and older driftwood samples may have affected results. Archaeological digs on other atolls have found evidence of human habitation dating around the 1st century CE at the village of [[Laura, |Laura]] on [[Majuro]] and on [[Kwajalein Atoll]].

The Austronesian settlers [[Domesticated plants and animals of Austronesia|introduced Southeast Asian crops]], including [[coconut]]s, [[Cyrtosperma merkusii|giant swamp taro]], and [[breadfruit]], as well as domesticated chickens throughout the . They possibly seeded the islands by leaving coconuts at seasonal fishing camps before permanently settling years later. The southern islands receive heavier rainfall than the north, so communities in the wet south subsisted on prevalent taro and breadfruit, while northerners were more likely to subsist on [[pandanus]] and coconuts. Southern atolls probably supported larger, more dense populations.

[[File:Stick chart-BHM 1920.530.0032-P8260228.JPG|thumb|A  [[ stick chart|stick chart]]. Most were made from a grid of coconut frond midribs with small shells representing the relative location of islands.]]

The  sailed between islands on [[walap]]s made from breadfruit-tree wood and coconut-fiber rope. They navigated by using the stars for orientation and initial course setting, but also developed a [[piloting]] technique of interpreting disruptions in [[Swell (ocean)|ocean swells]] to determine the location of low coral atolls below the horizon. They noticed that swells refracted around the undersea slope of atolls. When refracted swells from different directions met, they created noticeable disruption patterns, which  pilots could read to determine the direction of an island. When interviewed by anthropologists, some  sailors noted that they piloted their canoes by both sight and feeling changes in the motion of the boat. Sailors also invented [[ stick chart|stick charts]] to map the swell patterns, but unlike western navigational charts, the  stick charts were tools for teaching students and for consultation before embarking on a voyage; navigators did not take charts with them when they set sail.

When  explorer [[Otto von Kotzebue]] visited the Marshalls in 1817, the islanders still showed few signs of western influence. He observed that the  lived in thatched-roof huts, but their villages did not include the large ornate meeting houses found in other parts of . They did not have furniture, except for woven mats, which they used for both floor coverings and clothing. The  had pierced ears and [[tattoo]]s. He learned that  families practiced [[infanticide]] after the birth of a third child as a form of population planning due to frequent [[famine]]s. He also noted that  [[Iroijlaplap|iroij]] held considerable authority and rights to all property, though he had a more favorable view of the condition of  commoners than of that of [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] commoners. The Marshalls' two island groups, the [[Ratak]] and [[Ralik]] chains, were each ruled by a paramount chief, or iroijlaplap, who held authority over the individual island iroij.

===European exploration===

On August 21, 1526,  explorer [[Alonso de Salazar]] was the first European to sight the . While commanding the ''[[Loaísa Expedition|Santa Maria de la Victoria]]'', he sighted an atoll with a green lagoon, which may have been [[Bokak Atoll|Taongi]]. The crew could not land, because of strong currents and water too deep for the ship's anchor, so the ship sailed for [[Guam]] two days later.

On January 2, 1528, the expedition of [[Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón]] landed on an uninhabited island, possibly in [[Ailinginae Atoll]], where they resupplied and stayed for six days. Natives from a neighboring island briefly met the . This expedition named the islands 'Los Pintados' or "the Painted Ones" for the natives who wore tattoos. Later  explorers of the Marshalls included [[Ruy López de Villalobos]], [[Miguel López de Legazpi]], [[Alonso de Arellano]], and [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira]], though coordinates and geographic descriptions in 16th century  logs are sometimes imprecise, leaving uncertainty about the specific islands they sighted and visited.

On July 6, 1565, the  ship ''San Jeronimo'' nearly wrecked at [[Ujelang Atoll]] after the ship's pilot [[Lope Martín]] led a mutiny. While the mutineers were resupplying at Ujelang, several crew members took back control of the ship and marooned Martín and twenty-six other mutineers in the Marshalls. By the late 16th century,  galleons sailing between the Americas and the  kept to a sea lane at 13°N and provisioned at Guam, avoiding the Marshalls, which  sailors saw as unprofitable islands amid hazardous waters.

The British sea captains [[John Marshall (Royal Navy officer, born 1748)|John Marshall]] and [[Thomas Gilbert (sea captain)|Thomas Gilbert]] visited the islands in 1788. Their vessels had been part of the [[First Fleet]] taking convicts from England to [[Botany Bay]] in [[New South Wales]], and were en route to [[Guangzhou]] when they passed through the [[Gilbert Islands]] and . On June 25, 1788, the British ships had peaceful interactions and traded with islanders at [[Mili Atoll]]; their meeting may have been the first contact between Europeans and  since the Mendaña expedition of 1568. Subsequent navigational charts and maps named the islands for John Marshall.

From the 1820s through the 1850s, the Marshall Islanders became increasingly hostile to western vessels, possibly because of violent punishments that sea captains exacted for theft as well as the [[Blackbirding|abduction]] of  people for sale into slavery on Pacific plantations. One of the earliest violent encounters occurred in February 1824, when the inhabitants of Mili Atoll massacred marooned sailors from the  [[whaler]] ''[[Globe (1815 whaleship)|Globe]]''. Similar encounters occurred as late as 1851 and 1852, when three separate  attacks on ships occurred at [[Ebon Atoll|Ebon]], [[Jaluit Atoll|Jaluit]], and [[Namdrik Atoll]]s.

===Colonial period===

In 1857, [[ Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] sent two families to establish a mission church and school at [[Ebon Atoll|Ebon]]. By 1875, the missionaries had established churches on five atolls and had baptized more than 200 islanders, and one traveler noted that most women on Ebon wore western clothes and many men wore trousers by the mid-1870s.

In 1859, Adolph Capelle and another merchant arrived at Ebon and set up a trading post for the  company Hoffschlaeger & Stapenhorst. When the firm went bankrupt in 1863, Capelle partnered with  ex-whaler Anton Jose DeBrum to establish a [[copra]] trading firm: Capelle & Co. In 1873, the company moved its headquarters to [[Jaluit Atoll|Jaluit]], the home of [[Kabua the Great|Kabua]], a powerful [[iroijlaplap|iroij]] and disputed successor for the [[paramount chief]]tainship of the southern [[Ralik|Ralik Chain]]. In the 1870s, various other companies from , Hawaii, , and the  engaged in the copra trade in the . By 1885, the  firms [[Hernsheim & Co]]. and Deutsche Handels- und Plantagen-Gesellschaft Der Südsee Inseln zu Hamburg controlled two-thirds of the trade.

Contact between the  and westerners led to sometimes lethal outbreaks of western diseases, including [[influenza]], [[measles]], [[syphilis]], and [[typhoid fever]]. Increased access to alcohol led to social problems in some  communities, and on several atolls conflicts erupted between rival iroij with access to firearms.

==== protectorate====
[[File: colonial album 1880s img12.jpg|thumb| colonial administration building at Jaluit Atoll in 1886]]

In 1875, the British and  governments conducted a series of secret negotiations to divide the Western Pacific into [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]. The  sphere included the . On November 26, 1878, the  warship [[SMS Ariadne (1871)|SMS ''Ariadne'']] anchored at Jaluit to begin treaty negotiations with the chiefs to grant the [[ Empire]] "[[Most favoured nation|most favored nation]]" status in the Ralik Chain. During the second day of negotiations, Captain {{ill|Bartholomäus von Werner|de}} ordered his men to give military demonstrations which he later said were intended to "show the islanders, who have not seen anything like it before, the power of the Europeans." On November 29, Werner signed a treaty with Kabua and several other Ralik Chain iroij which secured a  [[fuelling station]] at Jaluit and free use of the atoll's harbor.

On August 29, 1885, [[Chancellor of | Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] authorized the annexation of the  as a [[protectorate]] following repeated petitions by  business interests. The  gunboat {{SMS|Nautilus|1871|2}} docked at Jaluit on October 13 to take control. On October 15, iroij Kabua, Loeak, Nelu, Lagajime, and Launa signed a protection treaty in  and  at the  consulate. While the  text made no distinction of rank among the five chiefs, the  text recognized Kabua as the King of the , despite an ongoing dispute between Kabua and Loeak over the [[iroijlaplap|paramount chief]]tainship. A company of  marines hoisted the [[flag of the  Empire]] over Jaluit, and performed similar ceremonies at seven other atolls in the Marshalls, though several pro- iroij refused to recognize the  protectorate until threatened with  naval force in mid-1886. [[]] was incorporated into the  Protectorate of the  in 1888, following the [[Anglo- Declarations about the Western Pacific Ocean|Anglo- Declarations]] of April 1886.

The  commercial interests formed the [[Joint-stock company|joint-stock]] [[Jaluit Company]], which was responsible for financing the colony's administration. In addition to controlling two-thirds of the  copra trade, the company had the authority to collect commercial license fees and an annual [[poll tax]]. The company also had the right to be consulted on all new laws and ordinances and nominated all colonial administrative staff. The company's licensing fees and legal advantages pushed out  and British competition, creating a monopoly in the  Pacific colonies. The British government protested the regulations benefiting the Jaluit Company as a violation of the Anglo- Declarations' free-trade provision. On March 31, 1906, the  government assumed direct control and reorganized the  and  as part of the protectorate of [[ New ]].

==== mandate====
[[File:Nan'yo-cho Jaluit Branch Office.JPG|thumb|South Seas Government branch office, Jaluit, c. 1932]]

The [[Imperial  Navy]] invaded [[Enewetak Atoll|Enewetak]] on September 29, 1914, and [[Jaluit Atoll|Jaluit]] on September 30 at the beginning of [[Asian and Pacific theatre of World War I|World War I]]. An occupation force was stationed on Jaluit on October 3. At the [[Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919, 's Pacific colonies north of the equator became the  [[South Seas Mandate]] under the system of [[League of Nations mandate]]s.  ceded the  to  with the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] on June 28, 1919.

The  navy administered the islands from late 1914 through 1921. The civilian {{nihongo|South Seas Government|南洋廳|Nan'yō-chō}} set up its headquarters in [[]] in April 1922 and administered the Marshalls until World War II.  surveys determined that the Marshalls' value was primarily strategic, because they could enable future [[Nanshin-ron|southward expansion]]. The Marshalls also continued to be a major producer of copra during the  period, with the {{nihongo|South Seas Trading Company|南洋貿易会社|Nan'yō Bōeki Kaisha}} taking over the Jaluit Company's operations and building upon the  colonial infrastructure. Other parts of the South Seas Mandate experienced heavy  settlement, shifting the population to majority  in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] and , but  settlers remained a minority under 1,000 people in the  throughout the  period, because the islands were distant from  and had the most limited economic potential in .

[[File:Kwajalein-Invasion 1944.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Kwajalein]] in 1944]]

On March 27, 1933,  declared its intentions to withdraw from the [[League of Nations]], officially withdrawing in 1935 but continuing to control the territory of the South Seas Mandate.  military planners initially discounted the Marshalls as too distant and indefensible for extensive fortification, but as  developed long-range bombers, the islands became useful as a forward base to attack , British colonies, and the . In 1939 and 1940, the navy built military airfields on [[Kwajalein Atoll|Kwajalein]], [[Maloelap Atoll|Maloelap]], and [[Wotje Atoll]]s as well as seaplane facilities at Jaluit.

After the outbreak of the [[Pacific War]], the [[ Pacific Fleet]] carried out the [[Marshalls–Gilberts raids]], which struck Jaluit, Kwajalein, Maloelap, and Wotje on February 1, 1942. They were the first  air raids on  territory. The  invaded the  on January 31, 1944, during the [[Gilbert and  campaign]]. The Americans simultaneously invaded Majuro and Kwajalein. By autumn 1944, the Americans controlled all of the , except for Jaluit, Maloelap, Mili, and Wotje. As the  campaign advanced through  and [[Volcano and Ryukyu Islands campaign|into the Ryukyu Islands]], the four -held atolls were cut off from supplies and subject to  bombardment. The garrisons began running out of provisions in late 1944, leading to high casualties from starvation and disease.

====U.S. Trust Territory====

In 1947, the  entered into an agreement with the [[UN Security Council]] to administer much of [[]], including the , as the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]].

From 1946 to 1958, it served as the [[Pacific Proving Grounds]] for the  and was the site of 67 [[nuclear test]]s on various atolls.

[[Operation Crossroads]] atomic bomb testing began in 1946 on [[Bikini Atoll]] after some of the residents were forcibly evacuated.

The world's first [[hydrogen bomb]], codenamed "[[Ivy Mike|Mike]]", was tested at the [[Enewetak atoll]] in the  on November 1 (local date) in 1952, which produced significant fallout in the region.

Over the years just one of over 60 islands was cleaned by the U.S. government, and the inhabitants are still waiting for the 2 billion dollars in compensation assessed by the Nuclear Claims Tribunal. Many of the islanders and their descendants still live in exile, as the islands remain contaminated with high levels of radiation.

A significant [[radar]] installation was constructed on [[Kwajalein]] atoll.

===Independence===
[[File:Runit Dome 001.jpg|thumb|The Runit Dome, built to contain radioactive debris]]
On May 1, 1979, in recognition of the evolving political status of the , the  recognized the [[constitution of the ]] and the establishment of the Government of the Republic of the . The constitution incorporates both  and British constitutional concepts.

There have been a number of local and national elections since the Republic of the  was founded. The United Democratic Party, running on a reform platform, won the [[1999  general election|1999 general election]], taking control of the presidency and cabinet.

The islands signed a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the  in 1986. Trusteeship was ended under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 683]] of December 22, 1990. Until 1999 the islanders received [[ dollar|US$]]180 million for continued  use of Kwajalein atoll, US$250 million in compensation for [[nuclear test]]ing, and US$600 million in other payments under the compact.

Despite the constitution, the government was largely controlled by Iroij. It was not until 1999, following [[political corruption]] allegations, that the [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] government was overthrown, with [[Imata Kabua]] replaced by the [[commoner]] [[Kessai Note]].

The Runit Dome was built on [[Runit Island]] to deposit U.S.-produced [[radioactive]] soil and debris, including lethal amounts of [[plutonium]]. There are ongoing concerns about deterioration of the waste site and a potential [[radioactive contamination|radioactive spill]].

In February 2018, the  became the first country in the world to recognize its [[cryptocurrency]] as its own legal tender for [[digital currency]].

In January 2020, [[David Kabua]], son of founding president [[Amata Kabua]], was elected as the new [[President of the ]]. His predecessor [[Hilda Heine]] lost the position after a vote.

Since the late 1980s,  have migrated to the US, with over 4,000 in Arkansas and over 7,000 in Hawaii in the 2010 US Census.

Following independence, the  continued to play a prominent role in the testing and launches of missiles and rockets for both military and commercial space purposes. All five of the [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 1]] rocket flights were carried out on [[Omelek Island]] within the Kwajalein Atoll. The fourth launch of the [[Falcon 1]] was successful, marking the first time in history a privately developed, fully liquid-fueled launch vehicle achieved orbit.

In early 2025, the  established its first marine protected area, covering 48,000 sq kms around the northern atolls of [[Bikar]] and [[Bokak]], in its intention to protect two of the country's most pristine marine ecosystems, including the largest turtle nesting site and a significant shark population, by prohibiting extractive activities of fishing. The MPA combines traditional knowledge with modern science to preserve its vital ocean habitats for the future.{{citation needed|date=November 2025}}
