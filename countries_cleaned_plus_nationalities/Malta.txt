 has been inhabited from at least {{Circa|6500 BC}}, with the arrival of [[Mesolithic]] hunter-gatherers likely originating from Sicily. Discoveries at [[Latnija Cave]] led by the  archaeologist Eleanor Scerri included the remains of hearths, stone tools and an abundant and diverse range of animal bones. These included indigenous red deer that are now extinct, fish and marine mammals, as well as abundant edible marine [[gastropods]]. To arrive on , these hunter-gatherers had to cross around 100&nbsp;km of open water, documenting the longest yet-known sea crossing by hunter-gatherers in the Mediterranean. The extinction of the [[Hippopotamus melitensis|dwarf hippos]], [[Cygnus falconeri|giant swans]] and [[Palaeoloxodon falconeri|dwarf elephants]] has historically been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on . However this seems unlikely since recent work suggests these animals went extinct many thousands of years before the arrival of the first people, and no such animals were found in association with the earliest known Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. The claim for an earlier occupation of the island by [[Neanderthal]]s is widely rejected. <sup>Supplementary Information</sup> [[Early European Farmers|Neolithic Farmers]], also originating from Sicily, are thought to have arrived on the islands by around 5400 BC. Prehistoric farming settlements dating to the [[Early Neolithic]] include the [[Għar Dalam]] cave site in the uppermost layers associated with domesticated animals. The Neolithic population on  grew [[cereals]], raised livestock and, in common with other ancient Mediterranean cultures, worshipped a [[mother goddess|fertility figure]].

A culture of [[megalith]]ic temple builders then either supplanted or arose from this early period. Around 3500 BC, these people built some of the oldest existing free-standing structures in the world in the form of the megalithic [[Ġgantija]] temples on [[Gozo]]; other early temples include those at [[Ħaġar Qim]] and [[Mnajdra]]. The temples have distinctive architecture, typically a complex [[trefoil]] design, and were used from 4000 to 2500 BC. Tentative information suggests that [[animal sacrifice]]s were made to the goddess of fertility, whose statue is now in the National Museum of Archaeology in Valletta. Another archaeological feature of the  Islands often attributed to these ancient builders is equidistant uniform grooves dubbed "cart tracks" or "cart ruts", which can be found in several locations throughout the islands, with the most prominent being those found in [[Misraħ Għar il-Kbir|Misraħ Għar il-Kbir ("Clapham Junction")]]. These may have been caused by wooden-wheeled carts eroding soft limestone. The culture apparently disappeared from the islands around 2500 BC, possibly due to famine or disease.

After 2500 BC, the  Islands were depopulated for several decades until an influx of [[Bronze Age]] immigrants, a culture that [[Cremation|cremated]] its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called [[dolmen]]s. They are claimed to belong to a population certainly different from that which built the previous megalithic temples. It is presumed the population arrived from [[Sicily]] because of the similarity of  dolmens to some small constructions found there.

===Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and Romans===

[[File:Justinian555AD.png|thumb|right| The lands which comprise modern-day  were a part of the Byzantine Empire (the empire in 555 under [[Justinian the Great]], at its greatest extent since the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] (its [[vassal state|vassals]] in pink)).]]
[[Phoenicia]]n traders [[Phoenician colonization|colonised]] the islands under the name Ann ({{lang|phn|𐤀𐤍𐤍‎}}, {{sc|ʾnn}}){{sfnp|Culican|1992}}{{sfnp|Filigheddu|2006}} sometime after {{nowrap|1000 BC}} as a stop on their trade routes from the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] to [[Cornwall]]. Their seat of government was apparently at [[Mdina]], which shared the island's name;{{sfnp|Culican|1992}}{{sfnp|Filigheddu|2006}} the primary port was at [[Cospicua]] on the [[Grand Harbour]], which they called Maleth. After the [[Siege of Tyre (332 BC)|fall of Phoenicia]] in 332 BC, the area came under the control of [[Carthage]]. During this time, the people on  mainly cultivated [[olive]]s and [[Ceratonia siliqua|carob]] and produced textiles.

During the [[First Punic War]], the island was conquered after harsh fighting by [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]]. After the failure of his expedition, the island fell back in the hands of Carthage, only to be [[Capture of  (218 BC)|conquered again]] during the [[Second Punic War]] in {{nowrap|218 BC}} by the [[Roman consul]] [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 218 BC)|Tiberius Sempronius Longus]].  became a {{lang|la|[[Civitas|Foederata Civitas]]}}, a designation that meant it was exempt from paying [[tribute]] or the rule of [[Roman law]], and fell within the jurisdiction of the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]]. Its capital at [[Mdina]] was renamed {{lang|la|[[Melita (ancient city)|Melita]]|italic=no}} after the  and Roman name for the island. Punic influence, however, remained vibrant on the islands with [[Cippi of Melqart]], pivotal in deciphering the [[Punic language]], dedicated in the second {{nowrap|century BC.}} Local Roman coinage, which ceased in the first {{nowrap|century BC,}} indicates the slow pace of the island's Romanisation: the last locally minted coins still bear inscriptions in [[Ancient ]] and Punic motifs, showing the resistance of the  and Punic cultures.

In the second century, Emperor [[Hadrian]] upgraded the status of  to a {{nowrap|[[municipium]]}} or free town: the island's local affairs were administered by four [[duumviri|duumvirs]] and a municipal senate, while a Roman [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]] living in [[Mdina]] represented the [[proconsul]] of Sicily. In {{nowrap|AD 58,}} [[Paul the Apostle]] and [[Luke the Evangelist]] were shipwrecked on the islands. Paul remained for three months, preaching the [[Early Christianity|Christian faith]]. The island is mentioned at the [[Acts of the Apostles]] as Melitene ({{langx|grc|Μελιτήνη}}).

In 395, when the [[Division of the Roman Empire|Roman Empire was divided for the last time]] at the death of [[Theodosius I]], , following Sicily, fell under the control of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. During the [[Migration Period]] as the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|Western Roman Empire declined]],  was conquered or occupied a number of times. From 454 to 464 the islands were subdued by the [[Vandals]], and after 464 by the [[Ostrogoths]]. In 533, [[Belisarius]], on his way to conquer the [[Vandal Kingdom]] in North Africa, reunited the islands under Imperial ([[Byzantine Empire|Eastern]]) rule. Little is known about the [[Byzantine |Byzantine rule in ]]: the island depended on the [[Sicily (theme)|theme of Sicily]] and had  governors and a small  garrison. While the bulk of population continued to be constituted by the old, [[Latin Church|Latinized]] dwellers, during this period its religious allegiance oscillated between the Pope and the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]]. The Byzantine rule introduced [[|]] families to the  collective.  remained under the [[Byzantine Empire]] until 870, when it was conquered by the [[Arabs]].

 became involved in the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]], and the conquest of  is closely linked with [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|that of Sicily]] that began in 827 after [[Euphemius (Sicily)|Admiral Euphemius]]' betrayal of his fellow Byzantines, requesting that the [[Aghlabids]] invade the island. The [[Muslims|Muslim]] chronicler and geographer [[Kitab al-Rawd al-Mitar|al-Himyari]] recounts that in 870, following [[Siege of Melite (870)|a violent struggle]] against the defending Byzantines, the Arab invaders, first led by Halaf al-Hadim, and later by Sawada ibn Muhammad, pillaged the island, destroying the most important buildings, and leaving it practically uninhabited until it was recolonised by the Arabs from Sicily in 1048–1049. It is uncertain whether this new settlement resulted from demographic expansion in Sicily, a higher [[standard of living]] in Sicily (in which case the recolonisation may have taken place a few decades earlier), or a civil war that broke out among the Arab rulers of Sicily in 1038. The [[Arab Agricultural Revolution]] introduced new irrigation, cotton, and some fruits. The [[Siculo-Arabic]] language was adopted on the island from Sicily; it eventually evolved into the [[ language]].

===Norman conquest===

The [[Normans]] attacked  in 1091, as part of their [[Norman conquest of Sicily|conquest of Sicily]]. The Norman leader, [[Roger I of Sicily]], was welcomed by Christian captives, though contrary to myth he did not tear off a portion of his checkered red-and-white banner and present it to the [[ people|]] in gratitude for having fought on his behalf, forming the basis of the modern [[flag of ]].

 became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Sicily]], which also covered the island of Sicily and the southern [[ Peninsula]]. The [[Catholic Church]] was reinstated as the state religion, with  under the [[See of Palermo]], and some [[Norman architecture]] sprang up around , especially in its ancient capital [[Mdina]]. [[King Tancred]] made  a [[fief]] of the kingdom and installed a [[Count of ]] in 1192. As the islands were much desired due to their strategic importance, it was during this time that the men of  were militarised to fend off attempted conquest; early Counts were skilled [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] [[privateer]]s.

The kingdom passed on to the [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty from 1194 until 1266. As [[Emperor Frederick II]] began to reorganise his Sicilian kingdom, Western culture and religion started to exert their influence more intensely.  was declared a county and a [[Marquess|marquisate]], but its trade was totally ruined. For a long time it remained solely a fortified [[garrison]].

A mass expulsion of Arabs occurred in 1224, and the entire Christian male population of [[Celano]] in Abruzzo was deported to  in the same year. In 1249 [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], decreed that all remaining Muslims be expelled from  or compelled to convert.

For a brief period, the kingdom passed to the [[Capetian House of Anjou]], but high taxes made the dynasty unpopular in , due in part to [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]]'s war against the Republic of Genoa, and the island of [[Gozo]] was sacked in 1275.

 was ruled by the [[House of Barcelona]], the ruling dynasty of the [[Crown of Aragon]], from 1282 to 1409, with the Aragonese aiding the  insurgents in the [[Sicilian Vespers]] in [[Battle of  (1283)|the naval battle]] in [[Grand Harbour]] in 1283.

Relatives of the [[kings of Aragon]] ruled the island until 1409 when it formally passed to the Crown of Aragon. Early on in the Aragonese ascendancy, the sons of the monarchs received the title [[Count of ]]. During this time much of the local nobility was created. By 1397, however, the bearing of the comital title reverted to a feudal basis, with two families fighting over the distinction. This led King [[Martin I of Sicily]] to abolish the title. The dispute over the title returned when the title was reinstated a few years later and the , led by the local nobility, rose up against Count [[Gonsalvo Monroy]]. Although they opposed the Count, the  voiced their loyalty to the [[List of monarchs of Sicily|Sicilian Crown]], which so impressed [[Alfonso V of Aragon|King Alfonso V]] that he did not punish the people for their rebellion. Instead, he promised never to grant the title to a third party and incorporated it back into the crown. The city of [[Mdina]] was given the title of ''Città Notabile''.

In September&nbsp;1429, [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsid]] Saracens [[Siege of  (1429)|attempted to capture ]] but were repelled by the . The invaders pillaged the countryside and took about 3,000&nbsp;inhabitants as [[Slavery in |slaves]].

On 23 March 1530, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], gave the islands to the [[Knights Hospitaller]] under the leadership of Frenchman [[Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam]], in perpetual lease for which they had to pay an annual [[Tribute of the  Falcon|tribute of a single  Falcon]]. These knights, a military religious order also known as the Order of St John and later as the Knights of , had been driven out of [[Rhodes]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1522.

[[Knights Hospitaller|The Knights Hospitaller]] ruled  and Gozo between 1530 and 1798. During this period, the strategic and military importance of the island grew greatly as the small yet efficient fleet of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of  John]] launched their attacks from this new base targeting the shipping lanes of the Ottoman territories around the Mediterranean Sea.

In 1551, the population of the island of [[Gozo]] (around 5,000 people) were [[Barbary slave trade|enslaved]] by [[Barbary pirates]] and taken to the [[Barbary Coast]] in North Africa.

The knights, led by Frenchman [[Jean Parisot de Valette]], withstood the [[Great Siege of ]] by the Ottomans in 1565. The knights, with the help of ,  and  forces, repelled the attack. After the siege they decided to increase 's [[fortification]]s, particularly in the inner-harbour area, where the new city of [[Valletta]], named in honour of Valette, was built. They also established [[watchtower]]s along the coasts&nbsp;– the [[Wignacourt towers|Wignacourt]], [[Lascaris towers|Lascaris]] and [[De Redin towers]]&nbsp;– named after the Grand Masters who ordered the work. The Knights saw the completion of many architectural and cultural projects, including the embellishment of Città Vittoriosa (modern [[Birgu]]) and the construction of new cities including Città Rohan (modern [[Ħaż-Żebbuġ]]). However, by the late 1700s the power of the Knights had declined.

The Knights' reign ended when [[Napoleon I of |Napoleon]] captured  on his way to [[]] during the [[ Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1798| Revolutionary Wars]] in 1798. During 12–18 June 1798, Napoleon resided at the [[Palazzo Parisio (Valletta)|Palazzo Parisio]] in Valletta. He reformed national administration with the creation of a Government Commission, twelve municipalities, a public finance administration, the abolition of all feudal rights and privileges, the [[Abolitionism in |abolition of slavery]] and the granting of freedom to all [[ people|]] and [[Jews|Jewish]] slaves. On the judicial level, a family code was framed and twelve judges were nominated. [[Public education]] was organised along principles laid down by Bonaparte himself, providing for primary and secondary education. He then sailed for , leaving a substantial garrison in .

The  forces left behind became unpopular with the , due particularly to the  forces' hostility towards Catholicism and pillaging of local churches to fund war efforts.  financial and religious policies so angered the  that they rebelled, forcing the  to depart. Great Britain, along with the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], sent ammunition and aid to the , and Britain also sent [[Royal Navy|its navy]], which blockaded the islands.

On 28 October 1798, Captain Sir [[Alexander Ball]] successfully completed negotiations with the  garrison on Gozo for a surrender and transfer of the island to the . The  transferred the island to the locals that day, and it was administered by Archpriest [[Saverio Cassar]] on behalf of [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand III of Sicily]]. [[Gozo (independent state)|Gozo remained independent]] until Cassar was removed by the  in 1801.

General [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois]] surrendered his  forces in 1800.  leaders presented the main island to Sir Alexander Ball, asking that the island become a  [[Dominion]]. The  people created a [[ Protectorate#Declaration of Rights|Declaration of Rights]] in which they agreed to come "under the protection and sovereignty of the King of the free people, His Majesty the King of the  of Great Britain and ". The Declaration also stated that "his Majesty has no right to cede these Islands to any power...if he chooses to withdraw his protection, and abandon his sovereignty, the right of electing another sovereign, or of the governing of these Islands, belongs to us, the inhabitants and aborigines alone, and without control."

In 1814, as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]],  officially became a part of the  Empire and was used as a shipping way-station and fleet headquarters. After the [[Suez Canal]] opened in 1869, 's position halfway between the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and  proved to be its main asset, and it was considered an important stop on the way to , a central trade route for the . A [[ Military Cemetery]] was commissioned by [[Sultan Abdul Aziz]] and built between 1873 and 1874 for the fallen Ottoman soldiers of the [[Great Siege of ]].

Between 1915 and 1918, during the [[First World War]],  became known as ''the Nurse of the Mediterranean'' due to the large number of wounded soldiers who were accommodated there. On 7 June 1919, the  public rioted in response to a [[cost-of-living crisis]];  troops eventually managed to suppress the riots, killing four in the process. The event, known as [[Sette Giugno]] ("7 June"), is commemorated every year and is one of five National Days. Until the [[Second World War]],  politics was dominated by the [[Language Question ()|Language Question]] fought out by [[Italophone]] and [[Anglophone]] parties.

Before the Second World War, Valletta was the location of the Royal Navy's Mediterranean fleet headquarters; however, despite [[Winston Churchill]]'s objections, the command was moved to [[Alexandria]], , in 1937 out of fear that it was too susceptible to air attacks from Europe. During the war  played an important role for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]; being a  colony, situated close to Sicily and the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] shipping lanes,  was bombarded by the  and  air forces.  was used by the  to launch attacks on the  Navy and had a submarine base. It was also used as a listening post, intercepting  radio messages including [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] traffic. The bravery of the  people during the second [[Siege of  (World War II)|siege of ]] moved [[King George VI]] to [[Award of the George Cross to |award the George Cross to ]] on a collective basis on 15 April 1942. Some historians argue that the award caused Britain to incur disproportionate losses in defending , as  credibility would have suffered if  had surrendered, [[Battle of |as  forces in  had done]]. A depiction of the George Cross now appears on the [[Flag of ]] and the country's [[Coat of arms of |arms]].

Under its 1964 constitution,  initially retained [[Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of ]] and thus head of state, with a [[governor-general]] exercising executive authority on her behalf. In 1971, the [[ Labour Party]] led by [[Dom Mintoff]] won the general elections, resulting in  declaring itself a republic on 13 December 1974 ([[Republic Day ()|Republic Day]]) within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. A defence agreement was signed soon after independence, and after being re-negotiated in 1972, expired on 31 March 1979 ([[Freedom Day ()|Freedom Day]]). Upon its expiry, the  base closed and lands formerly controlled by the  were given to the  government.

In the aftermath of the departure of the remaining  troops in 1979, the country intensified [[ and the Non-Aligned Movement|its participation in the Non-Aligned Movement]].  adopted a policy of [[Neutral country|neutrality]] in 1980. In that same year, three of 's sites, including the capital [[Valletta]], were inscribed on the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]].
