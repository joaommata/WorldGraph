The [[Isthmus of ]] was formed about three&nbsp;million years ago when the land bridge between North and South America finally became complete, and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions. The existence of the [[isthmus]] affected the dispersal of people, agriculture and technology throughout the Americas from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities.

The earliest discovered artifacts of [[Indigenous peoples of |indigenous peoples]] in  include [[Paleo-|Paleo-]] [[projectile point]]s. Later central  was home to some of the first [[pottery]]-making in the Americas, for example the cultures at [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]], which date back to 2500–1700 BC. These evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials (dating to c. 500–900 AD) at the [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]] [[archaeological site]], and their [[Gran Coclé]] style [[polychrome pottery]]. The monumental [[monolith]]ic sculptures at the [[Barriles]] (Chiriqui) site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures.

Before Europeans arrived  was widely settled by [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan]], [[Chocoan]], and [[Cueva people|Cueva]] peoples. The largest group were the Cueva (whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented). The size of the [[Indigenous peoples of |indigenous]] population of the isthmus at the time of European colonization is uncertain. Estimates range as high as two million people, but more recent studies place that number closer to 200,000. Archaeological finds and testimonials by early European explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developed{{clarify|date=August 2016|reason=Is this an anthropological term?}} by regular regional routes of commerce. [[Austronesians]] had a trade network to  as there is evidence of [[coconuts]] reaching the Pacific coast of  from the [[]] in [[Columbian Exchange|Precolumbian]] times.

When  was colonized, the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands. Scholars believe that [[Infection|infectious disease]] was the primary cause of the population decline of the natives. The indigenous peoples had no [[Adaptive immune system|acquired immunity]] to diseases such as [[smallpox]] which had been chronic in [[Eurasia]]n populations for centuries.

[[Rodrigo de Bastidas]] sailed westward from [[]] in 1501 in search of gold, and became the first European to explore the isthmus of . A year later, [[Christopher Columbus]] visited the isthmus, and established a short-lived settlement in the province of [[Darién Province|Darien]]. [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]'s tortuous trek from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1513 demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas, and  quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of 's empire in the [[New World]]. King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] assigned [[Pedro Arias Dávila]] as Royal Governor. He arrived in June 1514 with 19 vessels and 1,500 men. In 1519, Dávila founded [[ City]]. Gold and silver were brought by ship from South America, hauled across the isthmus, and loaded aboard ships for . The route became known as the Camino Real, or Royal Road, although it was more commonly known as Camino de Cruces (Road of Crosses) because of the number of gravesites along the way. At 1520 the Genoese controlled the port of . The Genoese obtained a concession from the  to exploit the port of  mainly for the slave trade, until the destruction of the primeval city in 1671. In the meantime in 1635 Don [[Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera]], the then governor of , had recruited [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]], , and , as soldiers to wage war against Muslims in the  and to found the city [[Zamboanga City|of Zamboanga]].

 was under [[ Empire| rule]] for almost 300 years (1538–1821), and became part of the [[Viceroyalty of ]], along with all other  possessions in South America. From the outset,  identity was based on a sense of "geographic destiny", and  fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus. The colonial experience spawned  nationalism and a racially complex and highly stratified society, the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalism.

 authorities had little control over much of the territory of . Large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until late in the colonial era. Because of this, indigenous people of the area were often referred to as "indios de guerra" (war ). However,  was important to  strategically because it was the easiest way to ship silver mined in  to Europe. Silver cargoes were landed on the west coast of  and then taken overland to [[Portobelo, Colón|Portobello]] or [[Nombre de Dios, Colón|Nombre de Dios]] on the Caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment. Aside from the European route, there was also an Asian- route, which led to traders and adventurers carrying silver from [[]] going over land through  to reach Acapulco,  before sailing to Manila,  using the famed [[Manila galleon]]s. In 1579, the royal monopoly that Acapulco,  had on trading with Manila,  was relaxed and  was assigned as another port that was able to trade directly with Asia.

Because of incomplete  control, the  route was vulnerable to attack from pirates (mostly  and ), and from "new world" Africans called [[cimarron people ()|cimarrons]] who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or ''palenques'' around the Camino Real in 's Interior, and on some of the islands off 's Pacific coast. One such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under [[Bayano]], which emerged in the 1552 to 1558 period. Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s famous raids on  in 1572–73 and [[John Oxenham]]'s crossing to the Pacific Ocean were aided by  cimarrons, and  authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in 1582.

The following elements helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within  well before the rest of the colonies: the prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries (1540–1740) while contributing to colonial growth; the placing of extensive regional judicial authority (Real Audiencia) as part of its jurisdiction; and the pivotal role it played at the height of the  Empire – the first modern global empire.

 was the site of the ill-fated [[Darien scheme]], which set up a [[Kingdom of Scotland|]] colony in the region in 1698. This failed for a number of reasons, and the ensuing debt contributed to the [[Acts of Union 1707|union of England and Scotland in 1707]].

In 1671, the [[privateer]] [[Henry Morgan]], licensed by the  government, [[Henry Morgan's  expedition|sacked and burned]] the city of [[Panamá Viejo|]] – the second most important city in the  New World at the time. In 1717 the [[viceroyalty of New Granada]] (northern South America) was created in response to other Europeans trying to take  territory in the Caribbean region. The Isthmus of  was placed under its jurisdiction. However, the remoteness of New Granada's capital, [[Santa Fe de Bogotá]] (the modern capital of [[]]) proved a greater obstacle than the  crown anticipated as the authority of New Granada was contested by the seniority, closer proximity, and previous ties to the [[viceroyalty of ]] and even by 's own initiative. This uneasy relationship between  and Bogotá would persist for centuries.

In 1744, Bishop Francisco Javier de Luna Victoria DeCastro established the [[College of San Ignacio de Loyola]] and on June 3, 1749, founded La Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Javier. By this time, however, 's importance and influence had become insignificant as 's power dwindled in Europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted ships to round [[Cape Horn]] in order to reach the Pacific. While the  route was short it was also labor-intensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and laden-down trek required to get from the one coast to the other.

As the [[  wars of independence]] were heating up all across Latin America,  City was preparing for independence; however, their plans were accelerated by the unilateral Grito de La Villa de Los Santos (Cry From the Town of ), issued on November 10, 1821, by the residents of [[Azuero Peninsula|Azuero]] without backing from  City to declare their separation from the  Empire. In both [[Veraguas]] and the capital this act was met with disdain, although on differing levels. To Veraguas, it was the ultimate act of treason, while to the capital, it was seen as inefficient and irregular, and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans.

Nevertheless, the Grito was a sign, on the part of the residents of Azuero, of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital. Those in the capital region in turn regarded the Azueran movement with contempt, since the separatists in  City believed that their counterparts in Azuero were fighting not only for independence from , but also for their right to self-rule apart from  City once the Spaniards were gone.

It was seen as a risky move on the part of Azuero, which lived in fear of Colonel [[History of #José de Fábrega|José Pedro Antonio de Fábrega y de las Cuevas]] (1774–1841). The colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus' military supplies in his hands. They feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists.

What they had counted on, however, was the influence of the separatists in the capital. Ever since October 1821, when the former Governor General, [[Juan de la Cruz Mourgeón|Juan de la Cruz Murgeón]], left the isthmus on a campaign in [[Quito]] and left a colonel in charge, the separatists had been slowly converting Fábrega to the separatist side. So, by November 10, Fábrega was now a supporter of the independence movement. Soon after the separatist declaration of Los Santos, Fábrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the city's support for independence. No military repercussions occurred because of skillful bribing of royalist troops.

In the 80 years following independence from ,  was a [[Subdivisions of Gran |subdivision of Gran ]], after voluntarily joining the country at the end of 1821. It then became part of the [[Republic of New Granada]] in 1831 and was divided into several [[Provinces of the Republic of New Granada|provinces]]. In 1855, the autonomous [[ State|State of ]] was created within the Republic out of the New Granada provinces of , Azuero, Chiriquí, and Veraguas. It continued as a state in the [[Granadine Confederation]] (1858–1863) and [[ of ]] (1863–1886). The [[ Constitution of 1886|1886 constitution]] of the modern Republic of [[]] created a [[ Department (1886)|new  Department]].

The people of the isthmus made over 80 attempts to secede from . They came close to success in 1831, then again during the [[Thousand Days' War]] of 1899–1902, understood among Indigenous  as a struggle for land rights under the leadership of Victoriano Lorenzo.

The US intent to influence the area, especially the  Canal's construction and control, led to the [[secession of  from ]] in 1903 and its political independence. When the [[Senate of ]] rejected the [[Hay–Herrán Treaty]] on January 22, 1903, the  decided to support and encourage the  secessionist movement.

In November 1903, , tacitly supported by the , proclaimed its independence and concluded the [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]] with the  without the presence of a single . [[Philippe Bunau-Varilla]], a  engineer and lobbyist represented  even though 's president and a delegation had arrived in New York to negotiate the treaty. Bunau-Varilla was a shareholder in a  company (the ''Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de ''), which had acquired the rights of the original  company which had gone bankrupt in 1889.{{sfn|McCullough|1977|pp=276-282}} The treaty was quickly drafted and signed the night before the  delegation arrived in Washington. The treaty granted rights to the  "as if it were sovereign" in a [[ Canal Zone|zone]] roughly {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long. In that zone, the US would build a canal, then administer, fortify, and defend it "in perpetuity".

[[File: Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|thumb|Construction work on the [[Gaillard Cut]] of the  Canal, 1907]]

In 1914, the  completed the existing {{convert|83|km||adj=mid|abbr=off|-long|sp=us}} canal.

Because of the strategic importance of the canal during [[World War II]], the US extensively fortified access to it.

From 1903 to 1968,  was a [[constitutional democracy]] dominated by a commercially oriented [[oligarchy]]. During the 1950s, the  military began to challenge the oligarchy's political hegemony. The early 1960s saw also the beginning of sustained pressure in  for the renegotiation of the [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]], including riots that broke out in early 1964, resulting in widespread looting and dozens of deaths, and the evacuation of the  embassy.

Amid negotiations for the Robles–Johnson treaty,  held [[1968  general election|elections in 1968]]. The candidates were:
* Dr. [[Arnulfo Arias]] Madrid, Unión Nacional (National Union)
* Antonio González Revilla, [[People's Party ()|Democracia Cristiana]] (Christian Democrats)
* Engr. David Samudio, Alianza del Pueblo (People's Alliance), who had the government's support.

Arias Madrid was declared the winner of elections that were marked by violence and accusations of fraud against Alianza del Pueblo. On October 1, 1968, Arias Madrid took office as president of , promising to lead a government of "national union" that would end the reigning corruption and pave the way for a new . A week and a half later, on October 11, 1968, the National Guard (Guardia Nacional) [[1968  coup d'état|ousted]] Arias and initiated the downward spiral that would culminate with the ' invasion in 1989. Arias, who had promised to respect the hierarchy of the National Guard, broke the pact and started a large restructuring of the Guard. To preserve the Guard's and his vested interests, Lieutenant Colonel [[Omar Torrijos]] Herrera and Major Boris Martínez commanded another military coup against the government.

The military justified itself by declaring that Arias Madrid was trying to install a dictatorship, and promised a return to constitutional rule. In the meantime, the Guard began a series of populist measures that would gain support for the coup. Among them were:
* Price freezing on food, medicine and other goods until January 31, 1969
* rent level freeze
* legalization of the permanence of squatting families in boroughs surrounding the historic site of  Viejo
Parallel to this, the military began a policy of repression against the opposition, who were labeled communists. The military appointed a Provisional Government Junta that was to arrange new elections. However, the National Guard would prove to be very reluctant to abandon power and soon began calling itself ''El Gobierno Revolucionario'' (The Revolutionary Government).

====Post-1970====
[[File:Omar Torrijos with  farmers.jpg|thumb|[[Omar Torrijos]] (right) with farmers in the  countryside. The Torrijos government was well known for its policies of [[land redistribution]].]]

Under [[Omar Torrijos]]'s control, the military transformed the political and economic structure of the country, initiating massive coverage of social security services and expanding public education.

The constitution was changed in 1972. To reform the constitution, the military created a new organization, the Assembly of Corregimiento Representatives, which replaced the National Assembly. The new assembly, also known as the Poder Popular (Power of the People), was composed of 505 members selected by the military with no participation from political parties, which the military had eliminated. The new constitution proclaimed [[Omar Torrijos]] as the Maximum Leader of the  Revolution, and conceded him unlimited power for six years, although, to keep a façade of constitutionality, [[Demetrio B. Lakas]] was appointed president for the same period.

In 1981, Torrijos died in a plane crash. Torrijos' death altered the tone of 's political evolution. Despite the [[1983  constitutional referendum|1983 constitutional amendments]] which proscribed a political role for the military, the [[ Defense Forces| Defense Force]] (PDF), as they were then known, continued to dominate  political life. By this time, General [[Manuel Noriega|Manuel Antonio Noriega]] was firmly in control of both the PDF and the civilian government.{{when|date=May 2016}}

In the [[1984  general election|1984 elections]], the candidates were:
* [[Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino]], supported by the military in a union called UNADE
* Arnulfo Arias Madrid, for the opposition union ADO
* ex-General [[Rubén Darío Paredes]], who had been forced to an early retirement by Manuel Noriega, running for the Partido Nacionalista Popular (PAP; "Popular Nationalist Party")
* Carlos Iván Zúñiga, running for the Partido Acción Popular (PAPO; Popular Action Party)
Barletta was declared the winner of elections that had been considered to be fraudulent. Barletta inherited a country in economic ruin and hugely indebted to the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]]. Amid the economic crisis and Barletta's efforts to calm the country's creditors, street protests arose, and so did military repression.

Meanwhile, Noriega's regime had fostered a well-hidden criminal economy that operated as a parallel source of income for the military and their allies, providing revenues from drugs and [[money laundering]]. Toward the end of the military dictatorship, a new wave of  migrants arrived on the isthmus in the hope of migrating to the . The smuggling of  became an enormous business, with revenues of up to 200 million dollars for Noriega's regime (see Mon 167).

The military dictatorship assassinated or tortured more than one hundred  and forced at least a hundred more dissidents into exile. (see Zárate 15). Noriega's regime was supported by the  and it began playing a double role in Central America. While the [[Contadora group]], an initiative launched by the foreign ministers of various Latin  nations including 's, conducted diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region, Noriega supplied  [[Contras]] and other guerrillas in the region with weapons and ammunition on behalf of the CIA.

On June 6, 1987, the recently retired Colonel Roberto Díaz Herrera, resentful that Noriega had broken the agreed-upon "Torrijos Plan" of succession that would have made him the chief of the military after Noriega, decided to denounce the regime. He revealed details of electoral fraud, accused Noriega of planning Torrijos's death and declared that Torrijos had received 12 million dollars from the Shah of  for giving the exiled  leader asylum. He also accused Noriega of the assassination by decapitation of then-opposition leader, Dr. [[Hugo Spadafora]].

On the night of June 9, 1987, the Cruzada Civilista ("Civic Crusade") was created{{where|date=May 2016}} and began organizing actions of civil disobedience. The Crusade called for a general strike. In response, the military suspended constitutional rights and declared a state of emergency in the country. On July 10, the [[Civic Crusade]] called for a massive demonstration that was violently repressed by the "Dobermans", the military's special riot control unit. That day, later known as El Viernes Negro ("Black Friday"), left many people injured and killed.

 President [[Ronald Reagan]] began a series of sanctions against the military regime. The  froze economic and military assistance to  in the middle of 1987 in response to the domestic political crisis in  and an attack on the US embassy. The sanctions failed to oust Noriega, but severely hurt 's economy. 's gross domestic product (GDP) declined almost 25 percent between 1987 and 1989.

On February 5, 1988, General Manuel Antonio Noriega was accused of drug trafficking by federal juries in Tampa and Miami. [[Human Rights Watch]] wrote in its 1989 report: "Washington turned a blind eye to abuses in  for many years until concern over drug trafficking prompted indictments of the general [Noriega] by two grand juries in Florida in February 1988".

In April 1988, US President Ronald Reagan invoked the [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]], freezing  government assets in all US organizations. In May 1989  voted overwhelmingly for the anti-Noriega candidates. The Noriega regime promptly annulled the election and embarked on a new round of repression.

{{Further| invasion of }}

The  invaded  on December 20, 1989, codenamed [[Operation Just Cause]]. The U.S. stated the operation was "necessary to safeguard the lives of U.S. citizens in , defend democracy and human rights, combat drug trafficking, and secure the neutrality of the  Canal as required by the [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties]]". The US reported 23 servicemen killed and 324 wounded, with the number of  soldiers killed estimated at 450. The estimates for civilians killed in the conflict ranges from 200 to 4,000. The United Nations put the  civilian death toll at 500, [[Americas Watch]] estimated 300, the  gave a figure of 202 civilians killed and former US attorney general [[Ramsey Clark]] estimated 4,000 deaths. It represented the largest  military operation since the  War. The number of US civilians (and their dependents), who had worked for the [[ Canal Authority| Canal Commission]] and the US military, and were killed by the  Defense Forces, has never been fully disclosed.

On December 29, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] approved a resolution calling the intervention in  a "flagrant violation of international law and of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the States". A similar resolution was vetoed in the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] by the , the , and . Noriega was captured and flown to Miami to be tried. The conflict ended on January 31, 1990.

The urban population, many living below the poverty level, was greatly affected by the 1989 intervention. As pointed out in 1995 by a UN Technical Assistance Mission to , the fighting displaced 20,000 people. The most heavily affected district was the [[El Chorrillo]] area of  City, where several blocks of apartments were completely destroyed. The economic damage caused by the fighting has been estimated at between 1.5 and 2 billion dollars. Most [[]] supported the intervention.

===Post-intervention era===
's Electoral Tribunal moved quickly to restore civilian constitutional government, reinstated the results of the May 1989 election on December 27, 1989, and confirmed the victory of President [[Guillermo Endara]] and Vice Presidents [[Guillermo Ford]] and [[Ricardo Arias Calderón]].

During its five-year term, the often-fractious government struggled to meet the public's high expectations. Its new police force was a major improvement over its predecessor but was not fully able to deter crime. [[Ernesto Pérez Balladares]] was sworn in as president on September 1, 1994, after an internationally monitored election campaign.

On September 1, 1999, [[Mireya Moscoso]], the widow of former president [[Arnulfo Arias Madrid]], took office after defeating PRD candidate [[Martín Torrijos]], son of [[Omar Torrijos]], in a free and fair election. During her administration, Moscoso attempted to strengthen social programs, especially for child and youth development, protection, and general welfare. Moscoso's administration successfully handled the  Canal transfer and was effective in the administration of the Canal.

The PRD's Martin Torrijos won the presidency and a legislative majority in the National Assembly in 2004. Torrijos ran his campaign on a platform of, among other pledges, a "zero tolerance" for corruption, a problem endemic to the Moscoso and Perez Balladares administrations. After taking office, Torrijos passed a number of laws which made the government more transparent. He formed a National Anti-Corruption Council whose members represented the highest levels of government and civil society, labor organizations, and religious leadership. In addition, many of his closest Cabinet ministers were non-political [[Technocracy|technocrats]] known for their support for the Torrijos government's anti-corruption aims. Despite the Torrijos administration's public stance on corruption, many high-profile cases, particularly involving political or business elites, were never acted upon.

Conservative supermarket magnate [[Ricardo Martinelli]] was elected to succeed Martin Torrijos with a landslide victory in the May [[2009  general election]]. Martinelli's business credentials drew voters worried by slowing growth during the [[Great Recession]]. Standing for the four-party opposition Alliance for Change, Martinelli gained 60 percent of the vote, against 37 percent for the candidate of the governing left-wing [[Democratic Revolutionary Party]] (PRD).

On May 4, 2014, Vice President [[Juan Carlos Varela]], candidate of the [[Panameñista Party|Partido Panamenista]] ( Party) won the 2014 [[2014  general election|presidential election]] with over 39 percent of the votes, against the party of his former political partner Ricardo Martinelli, Cambio Democrático, and their candidate [[José Domingo Arias]]. He was sworn in on July 1, 2014. On July 1, 2019 [[Laurentino Cortizo]] took possession of the presidency. Cortizo was the candidate of [[Democratic Revolutionary Party|Democratic Revolution Party]] (PRD) in the May 2019 [[2019  general election|presidential election]].

During the presidency of Cortizo, numerous events happened in the country, including the [[COVID-19 pandemic in |COVID-19 pandemic]] and its [[Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic|economic impact]], and the [[2022  protests|2022]] and [[2023  protests|2023 protests]].

On July 1, 2024, [[José Raúl Mulino]] was sworn in as 's new president.

Based on [[Coalescent theory|coalescence]] of [[Mitochondrial DNA]] and [[Y Chromosome]] data, it is thought that the earliest extant [[lineage (evolution)|lineage]]s of anatomically modern humans or ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' on the  subcontinent had reached there from Africa between 80,000 and 50,000 years ago, and with high likelihood by 55,000 years ago.

Politically, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the ''[[mahajanapadas]]''.{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp = 260–265}}{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp = 53–54}} The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions.

=== Medieval  ===
{{Main|Medieval }}
The  early medieval age, from {{CE|600 to 1200}}, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 132}} When [[Harsha]] of [[Kannauj]], who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from {{CE|606 to 647}}, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] ruler of the Deccan.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 119–120}} When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] king of [[Bengal]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 119–120}} When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]] from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandyas]] and the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]] from still farther south.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 119–120}} No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 132}} During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 121–122}} The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 121–122}}

In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first [[Bhakti|devotional hymns]] were created in the Tamil language.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 123}} They were imitated all over  and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all [[Languages of |modern languages of the subcontinent]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 123}}  royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 124}} Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as  underwent another urbanisation.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 124}} By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South  culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], and [[]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 127–128}}  merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in  seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp = 127–128}}

After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using [[courser (horse)|swift-horse]] cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1206.{{sfn|Ludden|2002|p = 68}} The sultanate was to control much of North  and to make many forays into South . Although at first disruptive for the  elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 47}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 6}}

By repeatedly repulsing [[Mongol Empire|Mongol raiders]] in the 13th century, the sultanate saved  from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of [[Human migration|migration]] of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.{{sfn|Ludden|2002|p = 67}}{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|pp = 50–51}} The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South  paved the way for the indigenous [[Vijayanagara Empire]].{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 53}} Embracing a strong [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular ,{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 12}} and was to influence South  society for long afterwards.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 53}}

In the early 16th century, northern , then under mainly Muslim rulers,{{sfn|Robb|2001|p = 80}} fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 164}} The resulting [[Mughal Empire]] did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 115}}{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp = 90–91}} and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 17}} leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 152}} Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under [[Akbar]], the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 17}}

The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 158}} and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 169}} caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 152}} The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in 's economic expansion,{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 152}} resulting in greater patronage of [[Mughal painting|painting]], literary forms, textiles, and [[Mughal architecture|architecture]].{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 186}} Newly coherent social groups in northern and western , such as the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], the [[Rajput]]s, and the [[Sikh Empire|Sikhs]], gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 23–24}} Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new  commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern .{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 23–24}} As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 256}}

By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the [[East  Company| East  Company]], had established coastal outposts.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 286}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 44–49}} The East  Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the  elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the [[Bengal]] region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp = 98–100}}{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 286}}{{sfn|Ludden|2002|pp = 128–132}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 51–55}} Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of  by the 1820s.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 68–71}}  was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the [[ Empire]] with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of 's colonial period.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 286}} By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the  parliament and having effectively been made an arm of  administration, the East  Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p = 289}}

The appointment in 1848 of [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] as Governor General of the East  Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in [[Europe]].{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp = 151–152}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 94–99}}{{sfn|Brown|1994|p = 83}}{{sfn|Peers|2006|p = 50}} Disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the [[ Rebellion of 1857]]. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive -style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central  and shook the foundations of Company rule.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 100–103}}{{sfn|Brown|1994|pp = 85–86}} The East  Company was disbanded, and the  government began to[[ Raj|directly administer ]]. Proclaiming a [[unitary state]] and a gradual but limited -style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 239}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 103–108}} In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over , leading eventually to the founding of the [[ National Congress]] (generally referred to as the Congress) in 1885.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p = 183}}{{sfn|Sarkar|1983|pp = 1–4}}{{sfn|Copland|2001|pp = ix–x}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 123}}

The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p = 260}} There was an increase in the number of large-scale [[Famine in |famines]],{{sfn|Stein|2010|p=245|ps=: An expansion of state functions in  and in princely  occurred as a result of the terrible famines of the later nineteenth century, ...

After [[World War I]], in which approximately [[ Army during World War I|one million  served]],{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 163}} a new period began. It was marked by [[Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms| reforms]] but also [[Rowlatt act|repressive legislation]], by more strident  calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a [[nonviolent]] movement of non-co-operation, of which [[Mahatma Gandhi]] would become the leader and enduring symbol.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 167}} During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the ; the  National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp = 195–197}} The next decade was beset with crises: [[ in World War II| participation in World War&nbsp;II]], the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of [[Muslim nationalism in South Asia|Muslim nationalism]].

{{Main|Prehistoric Iberia}}

[[File:Cromeleque dos Almendres - Southeast - 2.jpg|thumb|[[Almendres Cromlech]], the largest [[stone circle]] in the Iberian Peninsula.]]
The region has been inhabited by humans since circa 400,000 years ago, when [[Homo heidelbergensis]] entered the area. The oldest human fossil found in  is the 400,000-year-old ''[[Aroeira 3]]'' ''H. Heidelbergensis'' skull discovered in the [[Cave of Aroeira]] in 2014. Later [[Neanderthal]]s roamed the northern Iberian peninsula and a tooth has been found at Nova da Columbeira cave in [[Estremadura Province (1936–76)|Estremadura]]. [[Homo sapiens sapiens]] arrived in  around 35,000 years ago and spread rapidly, with the earliest signs of [[Human settlement|settlement]] dating to 5500 BC. Pre-Celtic tribes inhabited . The [[Cynetes]] developed a written language, leaving [[stelae]], which are mainly found in the south.

The [[Lusitanians]] were an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]-speaking people living in the far west of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], in present-day central  and regions of Western [[]]. 
It is uncertain whether the Lusitanians were Celticized Iberians, representatives of the ancient [[Beaker Culture]] (with Proto-Lusitanian tribes possibly originating from [[Gallia Belgica]]) or Celts, related to the [[Lusones]].
Early in the first millennium BC, several waves of [[Celts]] arrived in  from Central Europe and intermarried with the local populations to form several different ethnic groups.

The [[Celts|Celtic]] presence and heritage is patent in archaeological and linguistic evidence. They dominated most of northern and central , while the south maintained some of its older character (believed non-Indo-European, likely related to [[Basque language|Basque]]) until the Roman conquest. In southern , some small, semi-permanent commercial outposts were also founded by Mediterranean peoples namely [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[]] and [[Carthaginian Iberia|Carthaginians]] along the coast.

=== Roman  ===

[[File:Évora - 49619137673.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman Temple of Évora]], one of the best preserved landmarks of Roman presence in ]]
Romans first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC. The Carthaginians, Rome's opponent in the [[Punic Wars]], were expelled from their coastal colonies. During [[Julius Caesar]]'s rule, almost the entire peninsula was annexed to Rome. The conquest took two hundred years and many died, including those sentenced to work in slave mines or sold as slaves to other parts of the empire. The Roman occupation suffered a setback in 155 BC, when a [[Lusitanian War|rebellion]] began in the north. The [[Lusitanians]] and other native tribes, under the leadership of [[Viriathus]], wrested control of all of western Iberia. Rome sent legions to quell the rebellion but were unsuccessful. Roman leaders bribed Viriathus's allies to kill him in 139 BC; he was replaced by [[Tautalus]].

In 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of [[Roman province]]. Later, a northern province was separated from the province of [[Hispania Tarraconensis|Tarraconensis]], under Emperor [[Diocletian]]'s reforms, known as [[Gallaecia]]. There are numerous ruins of castros ([[hill forts]]) and remains of the [[Castro culture]], like the [[Castro of Monte Mozinho|Mozinho]], [[Castro of Zambujal|Zambujal]], [[Castro of Cidadelhe|Cidadelhe]], [[Conímbriga]], [[Miróbriga|Mirobriga]], [[Citânia de Briteiros|Briteiros]] archaeological sites.

=== Germanic kingdoms ===
[[File:Reino suevo.svg|thumb|A map of the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] in the 5th and 6th centuries]]

In 409, with the decline of the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was occupied by [[Germanic tribes]]. In 411, with a federation contract with [[Emperor Honorius]], many of these people settled in [[Hispania]]. An important group was made up of the [[Suebi]], [[Buri tribe|Buri]], [[Vandals]] in [[Gallaecia]], who founded a [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebi Kingdom]] with its capital in [[Braga]]. They came to dominate central , including [[Aeminium]] ([[Coimbra]]) all the way to the [[River Tagus|Tagus]], while the [[Visigoths]] occupied the south.
The [[Suebi]] and the Visigoths were the Germanic tribes who had the most lasting presence in the territories corresponding to modern . As elsewhere in Western Europe, there was a sharp decline in urban life during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]].

Roman institutions disappeared in the wake of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] invasions with the exception of [[ecclesiastical]] organisations, which were fostered by the Suebi in the fifth century and adopted by the Visigoths afterwards. Although the Suebi and Visigoths were initially followers of [[Arianism]] and [[Priscillianism]], they adopted [[Catholicism]] from the local inhabitants. St. [[Martin of Braga]] was a particularly influential evangelist.

In 429, the Visigoths moved south to expel the [[Alans]] and [[Vandals]] and founded a kingdom with its capital in [[Toledo, |Toledo]]. From 470, conflict between the Suebi and Visigoths increased. In 585, the Visigothic King [[Liuvigild]] conquered Braga and annexed Gallaecia; the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was unified under a [[Visigothic Kingdom]]. A new class emerged, unknown in Roman times: a [[nobility]], which played a key social and political role during the [[Middle Ages]]. It was under the Visigoths that the Church began to play an important part within the state. As the Visigoths did not learn Latin from the local people, they had to rely on bishops to continue the Roman system of governance. The laws were made by councils of bishops, and the [[clergy]] emerged as a high-ranking class.

=== Islamic period ===
Today's continental , along with most of modern , was invaded from the South and became part of [[al-Andalus]] between 726 and 1249, following the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. This rule lasted decades in the North, up to five centuries in the South.
[[File:Aljezur-nucleo-urbano-2025-09-msu--1820.jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Aljezur]] castle, in the [[Algarve]] built by the [[Moors]] in the 10th century.]]
After defeating the [[Visigoths]] in a few months, the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula. Beginning in 726, the land that is now  became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of [[Damascus]], until its collapse in 750. That year the west of the empire gained its independence under [[Abd-ar-Rahman I]] with the establishment of the [[Emirate of Córdoba]]. The Emirate became the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] in 929, until its dissolution in 1031, into 23 small kingdoms, called [[Taifa]] kingdoms.

The governors of the taifas proclaimed themselves [[Emir]] of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the Christian kingdoms of the north. Most of present-day  fell into the hands of the [[Taifa of Badajoz]] of the [[Aftasid Dynasty]], and in 1022 the [[Taifa of Seville]] of the [[Abbadids]] poets. The Taifa period ended with the conquest of the [[Almoravids]] in 1086, then by the [[Almohads]] in 1147.
Al-Andaluz was divided into districts called ''Kura''. [[Gharb Al-Andalus]] at its largest consisted of ten kuras, each with a distinct capital and governor. The main cities were in the southern half of the country: [[Beja ()|Beja]], [[Silves Municipality, |Silves]], [[Alcácer do Sal]], [[Santarém, |Santarém]] and [[Lisbon]]. The Muslim population consisted mainly of native Iberian converts to Islam and [[Berbers]]. The Arabs (mainly noblemen from [[]]) although a minority, constituted the elite. The Berbers who joined them, were nomads from the [[Rif Mountains]] of North Africa.

[[File:Siglaspoveirasbase.png|thumb|"Marcas" share similarities with [[bomärken]], in Scandinavia]]
Invasions from the North also occurred in this period, with [[Viking]] incursions raiding the coast between the 9th and 11th centuries, including Lisbon. This resulted in the establishment of small [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlements in the coastline between [[Douro]] and [[Minho Province|Minho]].

One likely Viking cultural heritage is found in the ancient ''Marcas Poveiras'' or [[Siglas Poveiras]]. It is generally accepted that the ''siglas'', also known as ''marcas'', are of [[Scandinavian people|Scandinavian]] origin. Based on numerous similarities initially found at the [[National Museum of |Nationalmuseet]] in [[Copenhagen]], several objects marked with "[[home-marks]]" were also identified in [[Funen]] (also known as [[Fyn]]), [[]]. Further studies revealed that the complex hereditary marking system of Póvoa de Varzim was also present in Fyn. Given the geographical distance, historical Viking incursions along the  coast, and pagan rituals practiced by people from this particular fishing region, it is believed that there is a partial Norse ancestry and cultural legacy.

=== Reconquista ===
{{Main| in the Reconquista}}
[[File:Porto April 2019-18.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.7|A statue of Count [[Vímara Peres]], first [[County of |Count of ]] (868–873)]]
The [[Reconquista]] was a period when Christians reconquered the Iberian Peninsula from [[Moors|Moorish]] domination. An Asturian Visigothic noble named [[Pelagius of Asturias]] was elected leader in 718 by many of the ousted [[Visigoth]] nobles. Pelagius called for the remnants of the Christian Visigothic armies to rebel against the Moors and regroup in the unconquered northern Asturian highlands, known today as the [[Cantabrian Mountains]], in north-west . After defeating the Moors in the [[Battle of Covadonga]] in 722, Pelagius was proclaimed king, thus founding the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and starting the war of Christian reconquest.

At the end of the 9th century, the region of  between the rivers Minho and Douro was reconquered from the Moors by nobleman and knight [[Vímara Peres]] on the orders of King [[Alfonso III of Asturias]]. Finding many towns deserted, he decided to repopulate and rebuild them.

Vímara Peres elevated the region to the status of [[County]], naming it the [[County of ]] after its major port city – ''Portus Cale'' or modern [[Porto]]. One of the first cities he founded is Vimaranes, known today as [[Guimarães]] – "birthplace of the  nation" or the "cradle city".

After annexing the County of  into one of the counties that made up the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], King [[Alfonso III of Asturias]] knighted Vímara Peres, in 868, as the First Count of Portus Cale (). The region became known as ''Portucale'', ''Portugale'', and simultaneously ''Portugália''. With the forced abdication of Alfonso III in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms; they were reunited in 924 under the crown of [[Kingdom of León|León]].

In 1093 [[Alfonso VI of León]] bestowed the county to Henry of Burgundy and married him to his daughter, [[Theresa, Countess of |Teresa of León]]. Henry thus became [[Henry, Count of ]] and based his newly formed county from Bracara Augusta (modern [[Braga]]).

At the [[Battle of São Mamede]], in the outskirts of [[Guimarães]], in 1128, [[Afonso I of |Afonso Henriques]], Count of , defeated his mother [[Teresa, Countess of |Countess Teresa]] and her lover [[Fernão Peres de Trava]], establishing himself as sole leader of the [[County of |county]]. Afonso continued his father Henry of Burgundy's Reconquista wars. His campaigns were successful and in 1139, he obtained a victory in the [[Battle of Ourique]], so was proclaimed [[King of ]] by his soldiers. This is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of  became the independent [[Kingdom of ]] and, in 1129, the capital city was transferred from Guimarães to Coimbra. Afonso was recognised as the first king of  in 1143 by King [[Alfonso VII of León]], and in 1179 by [[Pope Alexander III]] as Afonso I of , with the [[papal bull]] ''[[Manifestis Probatum]]''.

Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military [[Christian monasticism|monastic orders]], continued pushing southwards against the Moors. In 1217, during the reign of King [[Afonso II of |Afonso II]],  troops, supported by [[Crusades|crusaders]] and others, retook [[Siege of Alcácer do Sal|Alcácer do Sal]], with further land conquests from the Moors during the reign of [[Sancho II of |Sancho II]], mainly the start of the [[ conquest of the Algarve|conquest of the Algarve]] in 1238. After internal tensions, Sancho II was deposed from the throne and his brother, [[Afonso III of |Afonso III]], became king in 1248. In 1249, the Reconquista ended with the capture of the [[Algarve]], in the aftermath of the [[Siege of Faro (1249)|Siege of Faro]], and the last Moorish settlements were expelled. With minor readjustments, 's territorial borders have remained the same, making it one of the oldest established nations in Europe.

After a conflict with the [[kingdom of Castile]], [[Denis of ]] signed the [[Treaty of Alcañices]] in 1297 with Ferdinand IV of Castile. This treaty established the border between the kingdoms of  and Leon. During the reign of Denis, the first university in  opened in Lisbon, on March 1, 1290, being then transferred to Coimbra in 1308. Denis died in 1325 and was succeeded by his son, [[Afonso IV of |Afonso IV]], who had a strained relationship with his father that nearly [[Battle of Alvalade|ended in war]]. In 1355, in the aftermath of the assassination of [[Inês de Castro]], [[Peter I of |Peter's I]] lover, a civil war broke between the King, Afonso IV, and his son, and heir, Peter, with peace only being achieved in 1357. The reigns of Denis, Afonso IV, and Peter I mostly saw peace with the other kingdoms of Iberia.

In 1348-49 , as with the rest of Europe, was devastated by the [[Black Death]]. In 1373, , during the reign of [[Ferdinand I of |Ferdinand I]], made an [[Anglo- Alliance|alliance with England]], the oldest standing alliance in the world. This alliance was signed during the [[Fernandine Wars]], a series of conflicts between  and Castile over the right to the throne of Castile. This alliance would be reinforced with the signing of the [[Treaty of Windsor (1386)|Treaty of Windsor]] in 1386.

John of Aviz, later [[John I of ]], led a revolt against this claim and defeated the Castilians in the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]], with the [[House of Aviz]] becoming the ruling house.

In 1498 [[Vasco da Gama]] became the first European to reach  by sea, bringing [[Economic history of |economic prosperity to ]] and helping to start the [[ Renaissance]]. In 1500, the  explorer [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] reached what is now [[]] and founded the town of [[ Cove-St. Philip's]], one of many [[ colonization of the Americas| colonies of the Americas]].

 voluntarily entered a dynastic union (1580&ndash;1640) because the last two kings of the [[House of Aviz]] ([[Sebastian, King of ]], followed by his grand-uncle [[Henry, King of ]]) died without heirs, resulting in the [[ succession crisis of 1580]]. [[Philip II of ]] claimed the throne, under the pretext that his mother was a  princess, [[Isabella of ]], the second child and first daughter of King [[Manuel I of ]]. Philip II of  was accepted as Philip I of . Yet,  did not lose its formal independence. Instead, a [[Iberian Union|union]] of kingdoms was formed. But the joining of the two crowns deprived  of an independent foreign policy, and led to its involvement in the [[Eighty Years' War]] between  and the .

[[File:Europa -  - Lisboa - Mafra - Palacio.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of Mafra]] built by John V, now a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]]]
War led to a deterioration of relations with [[Anglo- Alliance|'s oldest ally, England]], and the loss of [[Ormus|Hormuz]], a strategic trading post located between [[]] and [[]]. From 1595 to 1663 the [[- War|  War]] primarily involved  companies invading  [[colonies]] and commercial interests in , Africa,  and the Far East, resulting in the loss of 's  sea trade monopoly. 

In 1640 [[John IV of ]] spearheaded an uprising backed by disgruntled nobles and was proclaimed king. The [[ Restoration War]] ended the 60-year period of the Iberian Union under the [[House of Habsburg]]. This was the beginning of the [[House of Braganza]], which reigned until 1910. [[John V of |John V]] saw a reign characterised by the influx of gold into the royal treasury, supplied largely by the [[royal fifth]] (tax on precious metals) from the [[ empire| colonies]] of [[State of |]] and [[State of Maranhão (colonial)|Maranhão]]. Most estimates place the number of  migrants to [[Colonial ]] during the gold rush of the 18th century at 600,000. This represented one of the largest movements of European populations to their colonies, during colonial times.

In 1738 [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo]], later ennobled as 1st [[Marquis of Pombal (title)|Marquis of Pombal]], began a career as the  Ambassador in London, later in Vienna. King [[Joseph I of |Joseph I]] was crowned in 1750 and made him his [[political minister|Minister]] of Foreign Affairs. As the King's confidence in Carvalho e Melo increased, he entrusted him with more control of the state. By 1755, Carvalho e Melo was made prime minister. Impressed by  economic success witnessed as ambassador, he successfully implemented similar [[Economic system|economic]] policies in .

In 1761, during the reign of King José I, he banned the import of black slaves into mainland  and , not for humanitarian reasons, but because they were a necessary work force in . At the same time, he encouraged the trade of black slaves ("the pieces", in the terms of that time) to that colony, and with the support and direct involvement of the Marquis of Pombal, two companies were founded - the ''Companhia do Grão-Pará e Maranhão'' and the ''Companhia Geral de Pernambuco e Paraíba'' - whose main activity was the trafficking of slaves, mostly Africans, to  lands.

He reorganised the army and navy and ended legal discrimination against different [[Christianity|Christian]] sects. He created companies and guilds to regulate commercial activity and one of the first [[appellation|appellation systems]] by demarcating the region for production of [[port wine|Port]] to ensure the wine's quality. This was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He imposed strict law upon all classes of  society, along with a widespread review of the tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes.

Lisbon was struck by a major [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake on 1 November 1755]], magnitude estimated to have been between 7.7 and 9.0, with casualties ranging from 12,000 to 50,000. Following the earthquake, Joseph I gave his prime minister more power, and Carvalho de Melo became an [[Enlightened absolutism|enlightened despot]]. In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination. The [[Marquis of Távora]], several members of his family and even servants were tortured and executed in public with extreme brutality (even by the standards of the time), as alleged part of the [[Távora affair]].

The following year, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppressed and expelled]]. This crushed opposition by publicly demonstrating even the aristocracy was powerless before Pombal. Further titled "Marquês de Pombal" in 1770, he ruled  until Joseph I's death in 1777. The new ruler, Queen [[Maria I of ]], disliked Pombal because of his excesses, and upon her accession to the throne, withdrew all his political offices. Pombal was banished to his estate at [[Pombal, |Pombal]], where he died in 1782.

Historians argue that Pombal's "enlightenment," while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial exploitation and consolidating personal control, and profit.

During the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic invasions]], the [[Transfer of the  court to | royal family transferred]] the court to [[Rio de Janeiro]], in , making it the capital of the  empire between 1808 and 1821.

In 1820, [[constitutionalist]] insurrections took place at [[Porto]] and Lisbon, and King John VI and his court were forced to return to mainland  in 1821. Lisbon regained its status as the capital of  when  declared its independence in 1822. The death of King [[John VI of |John VI]] in 1826 led to a crisis of royal succession. His eldest son, [[Pedro I of ]], briefly became [[Pedro IV of ]], but neither the  nor  wanted a unified monarchy.

Consequently, Pedro abdicated the  crown in favour of his 7-year-old daughter, [[Maria II of |Maria da Glória]], on the condition that when she came of age she would marry his brother, [[Miguel I of |Miguel]]. Dissatisfaction at Pedro's constitutional reforms led the "absolutist" faction of landowners and the church to proclaim Miguel king in February 1828. This led to the [[Liberal Wars]], also known as the ''War of the Two Brothers'' or the '' Civil War'', in which Pedro forced Miguel to abdicate and go into exile in 1834 and place his daughter on the throne as Queen [[Maria II of ]].

On 1 February 1908, King [[Carlos I of |Carlos I]] and his son and heir, [[Luís Filipe, Prince Royal of |Luís Filipe, Prince Royal]], were [[Lisbon Regicide|assassinated]] by Republican and [[Carbonária]] members. Two years later, on 5 October 1910, a [[5 October 1910 revolution|coup d'état]] overthrew the near 800-year-old Monarchy and the Republic was proclaimed. During World War I,  helped the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] fight the [[Central Powers]]; however the war hurt its weak economy.

Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the [[First  Republic]]. Several coups occurred during the First Republic, like the failed [[Monarchy of the North]] coup, but others had success, like the [[December 1917 coup d'état]], which led to the rise of [[Sidónio Pais]] to power. In 1921, the [[Bloody Night (Lisbon, 1921)|''Bloody Night'']] revolt ended in the assassination of the Prime Minister and other high-ranking officials of the Republic.

These conditions led to the [[28 May 1926 coup d'état]] and creation of the National Dictatorship ({{lang|pt-PT|[[Ditadura Nacional]]}}). This in turn led to the right-wing dictatorship of the {{lang|pt-PT|[[Estado Novo ()|Estado Novo]]}} (New State), under [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] in 1933.

New economic development projects and relocation of mainland  citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated, with [[ |]] and [[ |]] being the main targets of those initiatives. These actions were used to affirm 's status as a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental]] nation and not a colonial empire.

Pro- residents of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], separated those territories from  rule in 1954. In 1961, [[Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá]]'s annexation by the [[Republic of Dahomey]] was the start of a process that led to the dissolution of the centuries-old  Empire. Another forcible retreat occurred in 1961 when  refused to relinquish [[Goa]]. The  were involved in armed conflict in [[ ]] against the [[ Armed Forces]]. The [[Annexation of Goa|operations resulted in the defeat]] and loss of the remaining  territories in the [[ subcontinent]]. The  regime refused to recognise  sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in the National Assembly until the coup of 1974.

Also in the early 1960s the independence movements in the  provinces of [[ ]], [[ ]], and [[ ]] in Africa, resulted in the [[ Colonial War]] (lasting from 1961 till 1974). The war mobilised around 1.4 million men for military or for civilian support service, and led to large casualties. Throughout the colonial war period  dealt with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by the international community. The authoritarian and conservative Estado Novo regime, tried to preserve the empire.

Salazar governed until 1968, when he suffered a [[brain hemorrhage]], and was replaced by [[Marcelo Caetano]], which raised hopes of a "liberalization" of the Estado Novo regime, called the ''Marcelist Spring'', but those hopes were soon crushed.

=== Carnation Revolution and return to democracy===
{{Main|Carnation Revolution}}
[[File:Revolução dos Cravos.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Crowd celebrates on a [[Panhard EBR]] armoured car in [[Lisbon]] on 25 April 1974]]
The government and army resisted the [[decolonization]] of its overseas territories until April 1974, when a left-wing military [[coup]] in Lisbon, the Carnation Revolution, led the way for the independence of territories, as well as the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (''[[Processo Revolucionário Em Curso]]''). This period was characterised by power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. By the summer of 1975, the tensions were so high, that the country was on the verge of civil war. Forces connected to the extreme left-wing launched another coup on 25 November, but a military faction, the Group of Nine, initiated a counter-coup.

The Group of Nine emerged victorious, preventing the establishment of a [[communist state]] and ending political instability. The retreat from the overseas territories prompted a mass exodus of  citizens from its African territories. Over one million [[White African# in Africa| refugees]] fled the former  provinces, as white settlers were usually not considered part of the former colonies. By 1975, all  African territories were independent and  held [[1975  Constituent Assembly election|its first democratic elections]] in 50 years.

 continued to be governed by a [[National Salvation Junta]] until the [[1976  legislative election| legislative election of 1976]]. It was won by the [[Socialist Party ()| Socialist Party]] and Mário Soares, its leader, became prime minister. Soares would be prime minister from 1976 to 1978 and 1983 to 1985. Soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution. He initiated the process of accession to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC).

After the transition to democracy,  flipped between [[socialism]] and adherence to the [[neoliberal]] model. [[Land reform]] and [[nationalization|nationalisations]] were enforced; the [[ Constitution]] was rewritten to accommodate socialist and communist principles. Until the revisions of 1982 and 1989, the constitution had references to socialism, the rights of workers, and the desirability of a [[socialist economy]]. 's economic situation after the revolution obliged the government to pursue [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)-monitored stabilisation programmes in 1977–78 and 1983–85.[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 2007, when  held the presidency for the [[European Council]]]] In 1986  alongside , joined the European Economic Community which later became the [[European Union]] (EU). 's economy progressed considerably as a result of [[European Structural and Investment Funds]] and companies' easier access to foreign markets.

's last overseas territory, [[Macau]], was peacefully handed over to  in 1999. In 2002, the independence of [[East ]] (Asia) was formally recognised by . In 1995,  started to implement [[Schengen Area]] rules, eliminating border controls with other Schengen members.

In 2004 [[José Manuel Barroso]], the then [[Prime Minister of ]], was nominated [[President of the European Commission]].

On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] entered into force, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union. Economic disruption and an unsustainable growth in [[government debt]] during the [[2008 financial crisis]] led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the [[European Financial Stability Mechanism]] and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]], a loan to help the country stabilise its finances.

Stone tool evidence indicates humans sporadically frequented the [[Monte Verde]] valley area as long as 18,500 years ago. About 10,000 years ago, migrating [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous peoples]] settled in fertile valleys and coastal areas of what is present-day . Settlement sites from very early human habitation include Monte Verde, [[Cueva del Milodón]] and the [[Pali-Aike Crater]]'s [[lava tube]].

The Incas briefly extended their empire into what is now northern , but the [[Mapuche]] (or Araucanians as they were known by the Spaniards) successfully resisted many attempts by the [[Inca Empire]] to subjugate them, despite their lack of state organization. They fought against the Sapa Inca Tupac Yupanqui and his army. The result of the bloody three-day confrontation known as the [[Battle of the Maule]] was that the Inca conquest of the territories of  ended at the [[Maule river]].

In 1520, while attempting to circumnavigate the globe, [[Ferdinand Magellan]] discovered the southern passage now named after him (the [[Strait of Magellan]]) thus becoming the first European to set foot on what is now . The next Europeans to reach  were Diego de Almagro and his band of [[Conquistador| conquistadors]], who came from [[]] in 1535 seeking gold. The  encountered various cultures that supported themselves principally through [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture and hunting.

The conquest of  began in earnest in 1540 and was carried out by [[Pedro de Valdivia]], one of [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s lieutenants, who founded the city of Santiago on 12 February 1541. Although the  did not find the extensive gold and silver they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential of 's central valley, and  became part of the [[ Empire]].

Conquest took place gradually, and the Europeans suffered repeated setbacks. A massive [[Mapuche]] insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia's death and the destruction of many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of [[slavery]] by the  crown in 1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the Mapuche intensified resistance rather than cowing them into submission. Despite royal prohibitions, relations remained strained from continual colonialist interference.{{verify source|date=August 2024|reason="page 66" was deleted from this citation by a user of the ReFill script at one point, but page 66 of this source does not seem to support this claim. the reference previously pointed to a djvu of the source, so pagination may have differed, but the djvu is no longer available via archive.org}}

Cut off to the north by desert, to the south by the Mapuche, to the east by the Andes Mountains, and to the west by the ocean,  became one of the most centralized, homogeneous territories in  America. Serving as a sort of frontier [[garrison]], the colony found itself with the mission of forestalling encroachment by both the Mapuche and 's European enemies, especially the [[Kingdom of England|]] and the [[ Republic|]]. [[Buccaneer]]s and [[Piracy|pirates]] menaced the colony in addition to the Mapuche, as was shown by [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]]'s 1578 raid on Valparaíso, the colony's principal port.  hosted one of the largest standing armies in the Americas, making it one of the most militarized of the  possessions, as well as a [[Real Situado|drain on the treasury of the Viceroyalty of ]].

The first general census was conducted by the government of [[Agustín de Jáuregui]] between 1777 and 1778; it indicated that the population consisted of 259,646 inhabitants: 73.5% of [[White Latin |European descent]], 7.9% [[mestizo]]s, 8.6% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and 9.8% blacks. Francisco Hurtado, Governor of the province of [[Chiloé Province|Chiloé]], conducted a census in 1784 and found the population consisted of 26,703 inhabitants, 64.4% of whom were whites and 33.5% of whom were natives. The Diocese of [[Concepción, |Concepción]] conducted a census in areas south of the [[Maule river]] in 1812, but did not include the indigenous population or the inhabitants of the province of Chiloé. The population was estimated at 210,567, 86.1% of whom were [[ |]] or of European descent, 10% of whom were indigenous and 3.7% of whom were mestizos, blacks and [[mulatto]]s.

A 2021 study by [[Jörg Baten|Baten]] and Llorca-Jaña shows that regions with a relatively high share of North European migrants developed faster in terms of [[numeracy]], even if the overall number of migrants was small. This effect might be related to [[Externality|externalities]]: the surrounding population adopted a similar behavior as the small non-European immigrant group, and new schools were created. Ironically, there might have been positive [[spillover effects]] from the educational investment made by migrants, at the same time numeracy might have been reduced by the greater inequality in these regions. However, the positive effects of immigration were apparently stronger.

===Independence and nation building===

In 1808, [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]]'s enthronement of his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] as the [[ monarchy| King]] precipitated the drive by  for [[ War of Independence|independence from ]]. A national [[Junta (governing body)|junta]] in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of |Ferdinand]] – heir to the deposed king – was formed on 18 September 1810. The [[Government Junta of  (1810)|Government Junta of ]] proclaimed an autonomous government for  within the  monarchy (in memory of this day,  celebrates its [[Fiestas Patrias ()|National Day]] on 18 September each year).

After these events, a movement for total independence, under the command of [[José Miguel Carrera]] (one of the most renowned patriots) and his two brothers Juan José and [[Luis Carrera]], soon gained a wider following.  attempts to re-impose arbitrary rule during what was called the [[Reconquista ( America)|Reconquista]] led to a prolonged struggle, including infighting from [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], who challenged Carrera's leadership.

Intermittent warfare continued until 1817. With Carrera in prison in , O'Higgins and anti-Carrera cohort [[José de San Martín]], hero of the [[ War of Independence]], led [[Army of the Andes|an army]] that [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes]] into  and defeated the royalists. On 12 February 1818, [[ Declaration of Independence| was proclaimed an independent republic]]. The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th-century  society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful. Bernardo O'Higgins once planned to expand  by liberating the [[]] from  and incorporating the islands. In this regard he tasked the  naval officer, Lord Thomas Cochrane, in a letter dated 12 November 1821, expressing his plan to conquer [[Guayaquil]], the [[Galapagos Islands]], and the [[– relations|]]. There were preparations, but the plan did not push through because O'Higgins was exiled.

 slowly started to expand its influence and to establish its borders. By the Tantauco Treaty, the archipelago of [[Chiloé]] was incorporated in 1826. The economy began to boom due to the discovery of silver ore in Chañarcillo, and the growing trade of the port of Valparaíso, which led to conflict with  over maritime supremacy in the Pacific. At the same time, attempts were made to strengthen sovereignty in southern  intensifying [[Occupation of Araucanía|penetration into Araucanía]] and [[ colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|colonizing Llanquihue with  immigrants]] in 1848. Through the founding of [[Fort Bulnes]] by the [[Schooner Ancud]] under the command of [[John Williams Wilson]], the [[Magallanes Region]] [[ colonization of the Strait of Magellan|started to be controlled by country in 1843]], while the [[Antofagasta Region]], at the time in [[Atacama Desert border dispute|dispute with ]], began to fill with people.

After the [[ Civil War of 1829–1830]] in which the conservatives won, under the [[Joaquín Prieto]] Administration, the [[ Constitution of 1833]] was written and put into effect with high influence from the triple minister [[Diego Portales]]. Two other civil wars happened in  in the 1850s, one in [[1851  revolution|1851]] and the other one in [[1859  revolution|1859]].

[[File:Territorial losses of the Republic of  de jure.svg|300px|thumb|Territorial losses of the Republic of  de jure (by law) according to  historiography]]
Toward the end of the 19th century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by the [[Occupation of Araucanía]]. The [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between  and ]] confirmed  sovereignty over the [[Strait of Magellan]] but also made the country renounce its claims in the rest of East Patagonia after a [[East Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego and Strait of Magellan Dispute|dispute that started in 1842]]. As a result of the [[War of the Pacific]] with  and  (1879–83),  expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating 's access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable [[Caliche (mineral)# caliche|nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence.  had joined the stand as one of the high-income countries in South America by 1870.

On 9 September 1888,  took possession of [[Easter Island]] by the signing of a mutual will agreement with the local king, thanks to the efforts of the Bishop of Tahiti, Monsignor José María Verdier since the island was constantly attacked by slave merchants. The naval officer [[Policarpo Toro]] represented the  Government and [[Atamu Tekena]] was the head of the Council of Rapanui. The Rapa Nui elders ceded sovereignty, without renouncing their titles as chiefs, the ownership of their lands, the validity of their culture and traditions on equal terms. The Rapa Nui sold nothing and were integrated in equal conditions into .

The [[1891  Civil War]] brought about a redistribution of power between the President and Congress, and  established a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] style democracy. However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful  banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards which had strong ties to foreign investors. Soon after, the country engaged in a [[– naval arms race|vastly expensive naval arms race]] with [[]] amid escalating geopolitical competition and the [[Puna de Atacama dispute]].

The [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1883) against  and  resulted in  annexing resource-rich territory from both countries and further consolidating its status as a regional power. It subsequently emerged as a leading naval power in the Americas, even sending a ship to protest  involvement in the [[ crisis of 1885]].  potentially threatened U.S. hegemony in the Western Hemisphere, with the two countries almost going to war during the [[Baltimore crisis]] in 1891.

===20th century===

The early 20th century saw  fully consolidate its territory and resolve long-running diplomatic and territorial disputes. Its current borders with  were finalized [[1902 Arbitral award of the Andes between  and |through  arbitration]] in 1902 and a bilateral settlement of the [[Puna de Atacama dispute]] the following year. In 1904,  and  signed a [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship (1904)|Treaty of Peace and Friendship]] which clarified the border between both countries.

The  economy partially degenerated into a system protecting the interests of a ruling [[oligarchy]]. By the 1920s, the emerging middle and working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, [[Arturo Alessandri]], whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress. In the 1920s, [[Marxism|Marxist]] groups with strong popular support arose.

A military coup led by General [[Luis Altamirano]] in 1924 set off a period of political instability that lasted until 1932. Of the ten governments that held power in that period, the longest lasting was that of General [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]], who briefly ruled as [[de facto]] dictator in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931. These authoritarian governments were comparatively less harsh and corrupt than counterparts elsewhere in Latin America.

By relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor, Ibáñez del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years, in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his ideology. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. During the period of [[Radical Party ()|Radical Party]] dominance (1932–52), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ibáñez del Campo to office for another six years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded Ibáñez del Campo in 1958, bringing  conservatism back into power democratically for another term.

The [[1964  presidential election|1964 presidential election]] of [[Christian Democrat Party of |Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] by an [[Majority|absolute majority]] initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan "Revolution in Liberty", the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and [[agrarian reform]], including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.
[[File:Salvador Allende Gossens-.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Salvador Allende]]]]

In the 1970 election, Senator [[Salvador Allende]] of the [[Socialist Party of ]] (then part of the "[[Popular Unity ()|Popular Unity]]" coalition which included the Communists, Radicals, Social-Democrats, dissident Christian Democrats, the Popular Unitary Action Movement, and the Independent Popular Action), achieved a partial majority in a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in a three-way contest, followed by candidates Radomiro Tomic for the Christian Democrat Party and Jorge Alessandri for the Conservative Party. Allende was not elected with an absolute majority, receiving fewer than 35% of the votes.

The [[National Congress of | Congress]] conducted a runoff vote between the leading candidates, Allende and former president Jorge Alessandri, and, keeping with tradition, chose Allende by a vote of 153 to 35. Frei refused to form an alliance with Alessandri to oppose Allende, on the grounds that the Christian Democrats were a workers' party and could not make common cause with the right wing.

An [[economic depression]] that began in 1972 was exacerbated by [[capital flight]], plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and unemployment rose. Allende adopted measures including price freezes, wage increases, and tax reforms, to increase consumer spending and redistribute income downward. Joint public-private [[public works]] projects helped reduce unemployment.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Much of the banking sector was [[nationalization|nationalized]]. Many enterprises within the [[Copper#Production|copper]], coal, iron, [[Caliche (mineral)# caliche|nitrate]], and steel industries were [[Nationalization#Expropriation|expropriated]], nationalized, or subjected to state intervention. Industrial output increased sharply and unemployment fell during the Allende administration's first year.

Allende's program included advancement of workers' interests, replacing the judicial system with "socialist legality", nationalization of banks and forcing others to bankruptcy, and strengthening "popular militias" known as MIR. Started under former President Frei, the Popular Unity platform also called for nationalization of 's major copper mines in the form of a constitutional amendment. The measure was passed unanimously by Congress. As a result, the [[Richard Nixon]] administration [[ intervention in |organized and inserted secret operatives]] in , in order to swiftly destabilize Allende's government. In addition, US financial pressure restricted international economic credit to .

The economic problems were also exacerbated by Allende's public spending, financed mostly through printing money, and by poor credit ratings given by commercial banks. Simultaneously, opposition media, politicians, business guilds and other organizations helped to accelerate a campaign of domestic political and economical destabilization, some of which was backed by the . By early 1973, inflation was out of control. On 26 May 1973, 's Supreme Court, which was opposed to Allende's government, unanimously denounced Allende's ''disruption of the legality of the nation''. Although illegal under the  constitution, the court supported and strengthened Pinochet's soon-to-be seizure of power.

====Pinochet era (1973–1990)====

[[File:Golpe de Estado 1973.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fighter aircraft|Fighter jets]] bombing the Presidential Palace of ''La Moneda'' during the [[ coup of 1973]]]]
On 11 September 1973, a [[ coup of 1973|military coup]] overthrew Allende, who apparently committed suicide as the armed forces bombarded the [[La Moneda Palace|presidential palace]]. The degree to which [[U.S. intervention in #1973 coup|the  was involved in the coup]] remains debated; after Allende was overthrown, U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] told [[President of the |U.S. president]] [[Richard Nixon]] that the  had "helped" the coup indirectly. Historian Sebastián Hurtado contends there is no documentary evidence to support that the U.S. government was actively involved in the coordination and execution the coup; however, upon Allende's election in 1970, Kissinger had stated "I don't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go Communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people", while Nixon had expressed that the Allende government should not be consolidated and acted decisively to destabilize his government.

A military junta, led by General [[Augusto Pinochet]], took control of the country. His regime was marked by widespread [[Human rights violations in Pinochet's |human rights violation]]s.  initiated and actively participated in [[Operation Condor]], a U.S.-backed campaign to suppress leftists and their sympathizers. In October 1973, at least 72 people were murdered by the [[Caravan of Death]]. According to the [[Rettig Report]] and [[Valech Commission]], during the Pinochet regime's 15-year rule, at least 2,115 were killed, and at least 27,265 were tortured (including 88 children younger than 12 years old); many were detained, tortured, and executed at the national stadium. In 2011,  recognized an additional 9,800 victims, bringing the total number killed, tortured or imprisoned for political reasons to 40,018. Among the victims was internationally known poet-singer [[Víctor Jara]].

A new Constitution was approved by a controversial [[plebiscite]] on 11 September 1980, and General Pinochet became president of the republic for an eight-year term. After Pinochet obtained rule of the country, several hundred committed  revolutionaries joined the [[Sandinista]] army in [[]], guerrilla forces in [[]] or training camps in [[]], Eastern Europe and Northern Africa.

In the late 1980s, largely as a result of events such as the 1982 economic collapse and mass [[civil resistance]] in 1983–1988, the government gradually permitted greater freedom of assembly, [[Freedom of speech|speech]], and association, to include trade union and political activity. The government launched market-oriented reforms with [[Hernán Büchi]] as Minister of Finance.  moved toward a [[free market economy]] that saw an increase in domestic and foreign private investment, although the [[Copper#Production|copper]] industry and other important mineral resources were not opened to competition. In a [[1988  national plebiscite|plebiscite]] on 5 October 1988, Pinochet was denied a second eight-year term as president (56% against 44%).  elected a new president and the majority of members of a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] congress on 14 December 1989. Christian Democrat [[Patricio Aylwin]], the candidate of a coalition of 17 political parties called the ''[[Concertación]]'', received an absolute majority of votes (55%). President Aylwin served from 1990 to 1994, in what was considered a transition period.

In December 1993, Christian Democrat [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]], the son of previous president Eduardo Frei Montalva, led the Concertación coalition to victory with an absolute majority of votes (58%). Frei Ruiz-Tagle was succeeded in 2000 by Socialist [[Ricardo Lagos]], who won the presidency in an unprecedented [[1999–2000  presidential election|runoff election]] against [[Joaquín Lavín]] of the rightist [[Alliance for ]]. In January 2006,  elected their first female president, [[Michelle Bachelet Jeria]], of the Socialist Party, defeating [[Sebastián Piñera]], of the [[National Renewal ()|National Renewal]] party, extending the ''Concertación'' governance for another four years. In January 2010,  [[2009–10  presidential election|elected]] [[Sebastián Piñera]] as the first rightist President in 20 years, defeating former President [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]] of the ''Concertación'', for a four-year term succeeding Bachelet. Due to term limits, [[Sebastián Piñera]] did not stand for re-election in 2013, and his term expired in March 2014 resulting in [[Michelle Bachelet]] returning to office. Sebastián Piñera succeeded Bachelet again in 2018 as the [[President of ]] after winning the December 2017 presidential [[2017  general election|election]].

On 25 October 2020,  voted 78.28 percent in favor of a new constitution, while 21.72 percent rejected the change; voter turnout was 51 percent. An [[2021  Constitutional Convention election|election]] for the members of the [[Constitutional Convention ()|Constitutional Convention]] was held in  between 15 and 16 May 2021; the results saw a complete rearrangement of the political system established since the end of [[Military dictatorship of  (1973–1990)|Pinochet's dictatorship]] in 1990, with various independent and leftist candidates performing strongly relative to conventional center-right and center-left parties.

On 19 December 2021, a leftist candidate, the 35-year-old former student protest leader [[Gabriel Boric]], won 's presidential [[2021  general election|election]] to become the country's youngest leader. On 11 March 2022, Boric was sworn in as president to succeed outgoing President Sebastian Piñera. The majority of Boric's Cabinet—14 out of 24—are women, which is a first in the Western Hemisphere.

The area that is now  was settled in, at the latest, around 8,500 BC during the [[Stone Age]] towards the end of the [[last glacial period]]. The [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] the first settlers left behind present characteristics that are shared with those found in [[]], , and . The earliest people were [[hunter-gatherer]]s, using stone tools.

The first pottery appeared in 5200&nbsp;BC, when the [[Comb Ceramic culture]] was introduced. The area of present-day  was in the western limits of the culture, which produced pottery with a distinct [[Comb Ceramic|comb pattern]].{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=2}} The arrival of the [[Corded Ware culture]] in the south of coastal  between 3000 and 2500 BC may have coincided with the start of agriculture. Even with the introduction of agriculture, hunting and fishing continued to be important parts of the subsistence economy.

Based upon linguistic evidence,  seems to have been primarily inhabited by speakers of [[Paleo-European languages|Paleo-European]] languages prior to the migration of the Finno-Ugric peoples, which influenced the [[Sámi languages]] who were the first Finno-Ugric peoples to move towards . These languages have been divided into [[Paleo-Laplandic languages]] which was spoken around Lappland, and the Lakelandic languages spoken in most of modern-day . Many toponyms in  such as Inari, Saimaa, Päijänne and Imatra seem to derive from these Paleo-European languages, as their etymologies are not explainable by either Indo-European or Finno-Ugric roots.

In the [[Bronze Age]], permanent all-year-round cultivation and [[animal husbandry]] spread, but the cold climate slowed the change. The [[Seima-Turbino phenomenon]] brought the first bronze artefacts to the region and possibly also the [[Finno-Ugric languages]]. Commercial contacts that had so far mostly been to  started to extend to Scandinavia. Domestic manufacture of bronze artefacts started 1300 BC.

In the [[Iron Age]], population grew. [[ Proper]] was the most densely populated area. Commercial contacts in the [[Baltic Sea]] region grew and extended during the eighth and ninth centuries. Main exports from  were furs, slaves, [[castoreum]], and falcons to European courts. Imports included silk and other fabrics, jewelry, [[Ulfberht swords]], and, in lesser extent, glass. Production of iron started approximately in 500 BC. At the end of the ninth century, indigenous artefact culture, especially weapons and women's jewelry, had more common local features than ever before. This has been interpreted to be expressing common  identity.

An early form of [[Finnic languages]] spread to the Baltic Sea region approximately 1900 BC. Common Finnic language was spoken around [[Gulf of ]] 2000 years ago. The dialects from which the modern-day  language was developed came into existence during the Iron Age. Contacts with the ancient [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] and eastern [[Germanic peoples]] greatly influenced the [[Proto-Finnic language]].{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=2}} Although distantly related, the [[Sámi people]] retained the hunter-gatherer lifestyle longer than the Finns. The Sámi cultural identity and the [[Sámi languages]] have survived in [[Lapland ()|Lapland]], the northernmost province.

The 12th and 13th centuries were a violent time in the northern Baltic Sea. The [[Livonian Crusade]] was ongoing and the [[ tribes]] such as the [[Tavastians]] and [[Karelia (historical province of )|Karelians]] were in [[Early  wars|frequent conflicts]] with [[Republic of Novgorod|Novgorod]] and with each other. Also, during the 12th and 13th centuries several crusades from the Catholic realms of the Baltic Sea area were made against the  tribes. [[Danes]] waged at least three crusades to , in 1187 or slightly earlier, in 1191 and in 1202, and [[Swedes]], possibly the so-called [[Second  Crusade|second Crusade to ]], in 1249 against Tavastians and the [[Third  Crusade|third Crusade to ]] in 1293 against the Karelians.

{{Main|Grand Duchy of }}
The  era ended with the [[ War]] of 1809. On 29 March 1809, after being conquered by the armies of [[Alexander I of ]],  became [[Grand Duchy of |an autonomous grand duchy]] within the [[ Empire]], as recognised by the [[Diet of Porvoo]]. This situation continued until the end of 1917. In 1812, Alexander I incorporated the  [[Vyborg Governorate|province of Vyborg]] into the Grand Duchy of . In 1854,  became involved in 's involvement in the [[Crimean War]] when the  and  navies bombed the  coast and [[Åland]] during the so-called [[Åland War]].

Although  was still widely spoken, the  language began to gain recognition during this period. From the 1860s, a strong  [[Ethnic nationalism|nationalist movement]], known as the [[Fennoman movement]], grew. One of the movement's most prominent leaders was the philosopher and politician [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman|J.V. Snellman]], who worked to stabilise the status of the  language and its own currency, the [[ markka]], in the Grand Duchy of . Milestones included the publication of what would become 's [[national epic]], the ''[[Kalevala]]'', in 1835 and the legal equality of the  language with  in 1892. In the spirit of [[Adolf Ivar Arwidsson]] – "we are not Swedes, we do not want to become , so let us be Finns" – a  national identity was established. Nevertheless, there was no real independence movement in  until the early 20th century.

The [[ famine of 1866–1868]] occurred after freezing temperatures in early September devastated crops and killed around 15% of the population, making it one of the worst [[famine]]s in European history. The famine led the  Empire to relax financial regulations, and investment increased in the following decades. Economic development was rapid. The [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) per capita was still half of that of the  and a third of that of Britain.

From 1869 to 1917, the  Empire pursued [[Russification of |a policy of Russification]], which was suspended between 1905 and 1908. In 1906, [[universal suffrage]] was introduced in the Grand Duchy of . However, relations between the Grand Duchy of  and the  Empire soured when the  government began to take steps to restrict 's special status and autonomy. For example, universal suffrage was virtually meaningless in practice, as the [[tsar]] did not have to approve any of the laws passed by the  parliament. The desire for independence gained ground, first among radical [[Liberalism|liberals]] and [[Socialism|socialists]], partly driven by a declaration called the'' [[February Manifesto]]'' by the last tsar of the  Empire, [[Nicholas II of |Nicholas II]], on 15 February 1899.

===Civil war and early independence===
{{Main|Independence of | Civil War}}
After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, 's position as a Grand Duchy under the rule of the  Empire was questioned. The [[Parliament of | parliament]], controlled by the [[Social Democratic Party of |Social Democrats]], passed the so-called [[Independence of #Power act|Power Act]] to give the parliament supreme authority. This was rejected by the [[ Provisional Government]], which decided to dissolve the parliament. New elections were held in which the right-wing parties won by a small majority. Some social democrats refused to accept the result, claiming that the dissolution of parliament and the subsequent elections were extra-legal. The two almost equally powerful political blocs, the right-wing parties and the Social Democratic Party, were deeply divided.

The [[October Revolution]] in  changed the geopolitical situation once again. Suddenly the right-wing parties in  began to reconsider their decision to block the transfer of supreme executive power from the  government to  when the [[Bolsheviks]] came to power in . The right-wing government, led by Prime Minister [[P. E. Svinhufvud]], presented the [[ Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on 4 December 1917, which was officially approved by the  Parliament on 6 December. The [[ Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR), led by [[Vladimir Lenin]] was the first country to recognise 's independence on 4 January 1918.

On 27 January 1918, the government began to disarm the  forces in [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia]]. The socialists took control of southern  and Helsinki, but the white government continued in exile in [[Vaasa]]. This led to a short but bitter [[ Civil War|civil war]]. The [[White Guard ()|Whites]], backed by [[ Empire|Imperial ]], prevailed over the [[Red Guards ()|Reds]] and their self-proclaimed [[ Socialist Workers' Republic]]. After the war, tens of thousands of Reds were interned in camps where thousands were executed or died of malnutrition and disease. A deep social and political enmity was sown between the Reds and the Whites that would last until the [[Winter War]] and beyond. The civil war and the activist expeditions to Soviet  in 1918–1920, known as the "[[Heimosodat|Kinship Wars]]", strained relations with the East.

After a [[Kingdom of  (1918)|brief experiment with monarchy]], when an attempt to make [[Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse]] the king of  failed, a [[Constitution of |republican constitution]] was adopted and  became a [[presidential republic]], with [[K. J. Ståhlberg]] elected as its first president on 25 July 1919. A [[Civic nationalism|liberal nationalist]] with a legal background, Ståhlberg anchored the state in [[liberal democracy]], promoted the [[rule of law]] and initiated internal reforms.  was also one of the first European countries to strongly promote [[Women's rights|women's equality]], with [[Miina Sillanpää]] becoming the first female minister in  history in [[Tanner Cabinet|Väinö Tanner's cabinet]] in 1926–1927. The - border was established in 1920 by the [[Treaty of Tartu (–)|Treaty of Tartu]], which largely followed the historical border but gave  [[Pechengsky District|Pechenga]] ({{langx|fi|Petsamo}}) and its [[Barents Sea]] port.  democracy survived Soviet coup attempts and the anti-communist [[Lapua movement]].

In 1917 there were three million people in the country. After the civil war, a credit-based [[land reform]] was introduced, increasing the proportion of the population with access to capital. About 70% of the workforce was employed in agriculture and 10% in industry.

===World War II===
{{Main| in World War II}}

[[File:Kolmen valtakunnan rajapyykki 27.4.1945.png|thumb|left| troops [[Raising the Flag on the Three-Country Cairn|raise a flag on the three-country cairn]] in April 1945 at the close of the [[Military history of  during World War II|World War II in ]].]]
The [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi ]] signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] on 23 August 1939, which divided Europe into spheres of influence between the two dictatorships. In accordance with the pact, the Soviet Union launched the [[Winter War]] on 30 November 1939 in order to annex . The [[ Democratic Republic]] was set up by [[Joseph Stalin]] at the beginning of the war to govern  after Soviet conquest. There was widespread international condemnation of the unprovoked attack and it led to the Soviet Union being expelled from the [[League of Nations]]. The [[Red Army]] was defeated in numerous battles, most notably the [[Battle of Suomussalmi]]. After two months of negligible progress on the battlefield, as well as heavy losses in men and material, Soviet forces began to advance in February and [[Battle of Vyborg Bay (1940)|reached Vyborg]] ({{langx|fi|Viipuri}}) in March. The [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] was signed on 12 March 1940, and the war ended the following day.  had defended its independence, but ceded 9% of its territory to the Soviet Union. Between 1939 and 1944, some 400,000 people were [[Evacuation of  Karelia|evacuated from Karelia]]. 

[[File: areas ceded in 1944.png|thumb|upright|Areas ceded by  to the [[Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]]. The [[Porkkala]] land lease was returned to  in 1956.]]
Hostilities resumed in June 1941 with the [[Continuation War]], when  allied itself with  following the [[Operation Barbarossa|latter's invasion of the Soviet Union]]; the main aim was to regain the territory lost to the Soviets barely a year earlier.  troops [[ military administration in Eastern Karelia|occupied Eastern Karelia]] from 1941 to 1944 and assisted the  army in the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. The massive Soviet [[Vyborg–Petrozavodsk offensive]] in the summer of 1944 led to a breakthrough until the Finns finally repulsed it at [[Battle of Tali–Ihantala|Tali–Ihantala]]. This partial Soviet success led to a stalemate and later an [[Moscow Armistice|armistice]]. This was followed by the [[Lapland War]] of 1944–1945, when  fought retreating  forces in northern . 

The [[Moscow Armistice|Armistice]] and [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|treaty]] signed with the Soviet Union in 1944 and 1948 included  obligations, restraints, and reparations, as well as further territorial concessions. As a result of the two wars,  lost 12% of its land area, 20% of its industrial capacity, its second largest city, [[Vyborg]] ({{langx|fi|Viipuri}}), and the ice-free port of [[Liinakhamari]] ({{langx|fi|Liinahamari}}). The Finns lost around 97,000 soldiers and were forced to pay war reparations initially set at $300 million in 1938 prices, later adjusted to $226.5 million. However, the country avoided occupation by Soviet forces and managed to retain its independence. Along with [[Great Britain]],  emerged from the war as one of the only European countries to have taken part in hostilities that was never occupied and managed to preserve its democracy throughout.

In the decades following World War II, the [[Communist Party of |Communists]] were a strong political party. Furthermore, the Soviet Union persuaded  to refuse [[Marshall Plan]] aid. However, in the hope of preserving 's independence, the  provided secret development aid and supported the [[Social Democratic Party of |Social Democratic Party]].

===After the war===
[[File:Urho-Kekkonen-1975b (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Urho Kekkonen]] was 's longest-serving president in 1956–1982.]]
The development of trade with the Western powers, such as the , and the payment of reparations to the Soviet Union led to 's transformation from a primarily [[agrarian society]] to an industrialised one. [[Valmet]], originally a shipyard and then several metal workshops, was established to produce materials for war reparations. After the reparations were paid,  continued to trade with the Soviet Union as part of [[bilateral trade]].

In 1950, 46% of  workers were employed in agriculture and a third lived in urban areas, but new jobs in manufacturing, services and trade quickly attracted people to the cities. The average number of births per woman fell from a [[baby boom]] peak of 3.5 in 1947 to 1.5 in 1973. As the baby boomers entered the workforce, the economy failed to create jobs fast enough and hundreds of thousands emigrated to more industrialised , with emigration peaking in 1969 and 1970.  participated in trade liberalisation in the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]].

During the [[Cold War]],  officially embraced a policy of [[Neutral country|neutrality]]. The [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|YYA Treaty]] (Finno-Soviet Pact of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance) recognized 's desire to remain outside great-power conflicts. From 1956 president [[Urho Kekkonen]] had a virtual monopoly on relations with the Soviet Union, which was crucial to his continued popularity. In politics, there was a tendency to avoid any policy or statement that could be interpreted as anti-Soviet. This phenomenon was dubbed "[[Finlandisation]]" by the West  press.

[[File:2018_Helsinki,_Finland_(41401402010).jpg|thumb|left|[[Alvar Aalto]]'s [[Finlandia Hall]] hosted the [[Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in 1975.]]
A [[market economy]] was maintained in . Various industries benefited from trade privileges with the Soviets. Economic growth was rapid in the post-war period, and by 1975 's GDP per capita was the 15th highest in the world. During the 1970s and 1980s,  built one of the most extensive [[welfare state]]s in the world. In 1973,  negotiated a treaty with the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) that reduced tariffs, enhancing trade relations.

Miscalculated macroeconomic decisions, a [[ banking crisis of 1990s|banking crisis]], the collapse of its largest trading partner, the Soviet Union, and a global economic downturn caused a deep recession in  in the [[Early 1990s depression in |early 1990s]]. The recession bottomed out in 1993 and  enjoyed more than a decade of steady economic growth. After the collapse of the Soviet Union,  began to integrate more closely with the West.  [[1995 enlargement of the European Union|joined]] the [[European Union]] in 1995 and the [[euro zone]] in 1999. Much of the economic growth of the late 1990s was fuelled by the success of mobile phone manufacturer [[Nokia]].

===Prehistory===
{{Main|Prehistory of }}

The oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now  date from approximately 1.8&nbsp;million years ago. [[Neanderthal]]s occupied the region into the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era but were slowly replaced by ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'' around 35,000 BC. This period witnessed the emergence of [[cave painting]] in the [[Dordogne]] and [[Pyrenees]], including at [[Lascaux]], dated to {{Circa|18,000}} BC. At the end of the [[Last Glacial Period]] (10,000 BC), the climate became milder; from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of Western Europe entered the [[Neolithic]] era, and its inhabitants became [[Sedentism|sedentary]].

After demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia BC, [[Three-age system|metallurgy appeared]], initially working gold, [[Chalcolithic|copper]] and [[Bronze Age|bronze]], then later [[Iron Age|iron]].  has numerous [[megalith]]ic sites from the Neolithic, including the [[Carnac stones]] site (approximately 3,300 BC).

===Antiquity (6th century BC – 5th century AD)===
In 600 BC, [[Ionia]]n [[ in pre-Roman Gaul|]] from [[Phocaea]] founded the colony of [[Massalia]] (present-day [[Marseille]]). Celtic tribes penetrated parts of eastern and northern , spreading through the rest of the country between the 5th and 3rd century BC. Around 390 BC, the Gallic chieftain [[Brennus (leader of the Senones)|Brennus]] and his troops made their way to [[Roman ]], defeated the Romans in the [[Battle of the Allia]], and besieged and ransomed Rome. This left Rome weakened, and the Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC when they entered into a peace treaty. But the Romans and the Gauls remained adversaries for centuries.

Around 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region {{Lang|la|[[Gallia Narbonensis|Provincia Nostra]]}} ("Our Province"), which evolved into [[Provence]] in . [[Julius Caesar]] conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt by Gallic chieftain [[Vercingetorix]] in 52 BC. Gaul was divided by [[Augustus]] into provinces, and many cities were founded during the [[Roman Gaul|Gallo-Roman period]], including [[Lugdunum]] (present-day [[Lyon]]), the capital of the Gauls. In 250–290 AD, Roman Gaul suffered a crisis with its [[Limes (Roman Empire)|fortified borders]] attacked by barbarians. The situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, a period of revival and prosperity. In 312, Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|converted to Christianity]]. Christians, who had been persecuted, increased. But from the 5th century, the [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]] resumed. [[Teutons|Teutonic]] tribes invaded the region, the [[Visigoths]] settling in the southwest, the [[Burgundians]] along the [[Rhine Valley]], and the Franks in the north.

===Early Middle Ages (5th–10th century)===
In [[late antiquity]], Gaul was divided into Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory. [[Celtic Britons]], fleeing the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]], settled in west [[Armorica]]; the Armorican peninsula was renamed [[Brittany]], and [[Celts|Celtic culture]] was revived.

The first leader to unite all Franks was [[Clovis I]], who began his reign as king of the [[Salian Franks]] in 481, routing the last forces of the Roman governors in 486. Clovis said he would be baptised a Christian in the event of victory against the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], which was said to have guaranteed the battle. Clovis [[Franco-Visigothic Wars|regained the southwest from the Visigoths]] and was baptised in 508. Clovis was the first [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] conqueror after the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]] to convert to Catholic Christianity; thus  was given the title "Eldest daughter of the Church" by the papacy, and  kings were called "the Most Christian Kings of ".

[[File:Chlodwigs taufe.jpg|thumb|alt=painting of Clovis I conversion to Catholicism in 498, a king being baptised in a tub in a cathedral surrounded by bishop and monks|With [[Clovis I|Clovis]]'s conversion to Catholicism in 498, the [[List of Frankish kings|Frankish monarchy]], [[Elective monarchy|elective]] and [[Secular state|secular]] until then, became [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary]] and of [[Divine right of kings|divine right]].]]
The Franks embraced the Christian [[Gallo-Roman culture]], and Gaul was renamed ''[[Francia]]'' ("Land of the Franks"). The Germanic Franks adopted [[Romance languages|Romanic languages]]. Clovis made [[Paris]] his capital and established the [[Merovingian dynasty]], but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from that of Clovis: Paris, [[Orléans]], [[Soissons]], and [[Reims|Rheims]]. The [[Roi fainéant|last Merovingian kings]] [[Power behind the throne|lost power]] to their [[Mayor of the palace|mayors of the palace]] (head of household). One mayor of the palace, [[Charles Martel]], defeated an [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] invasion at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732. His son, [[Pepin the Short]], seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Pepin's son [[Charlemagne]] reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built an empire across Western and [[Central Europe]].

Proclaimed [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Pope Leo III]] and thus establishing the  government's longtime [[History of the Catholic Church in |historical association]] with the [[Catholic Church]], Charlemagne tried to revive the [[Western Roman Empire]] and its cultural grandeur. Charlemagne's son [[Louis the Pious|Louis I]] kept the empire united, however in 843 it was divided between Louis' three sons into [[East Francia]], [[Middle Francia]] and [[West Francia]]. West Francia approximated the area occupied by modern  and was its precursor.

During the 9th and 10th centuries, threatened by [[Viking expansion|Viking invasions]],  became a decentralised state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and so was less effective and challenged by noblemen. Thus was established [[feudalism]] in . Some king's vassals grew so powerful they posed a threat to the king. After the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] added "King of England" to his titles, becoming vassal and the equal of the king of , creating recurring tensions.

The Carolingian dynasty ruled  until 987, when [[Hugh Capet]] was crowned [[List of  monarchs|king of the Franks]]. His descendants unified the country through wars and inheritance. From 1190, the [[Capetian dynasty|Capetian rulers]] began to be referred as "kings of " rather than "kings of the Franks". Later kings expanded their directly possessed [[Crown lands of |''domaine royal'']] to cover over half of modern  by the 15th century. Royal authority became more assertive, centred on a [[Estates of the realm|hierarchically conceived society]] distinguishing [[ nobility|nobility]], clergy, and [[Estates General ()|commoners]].

The nobility played a prominent role in [[Crusades]] to restore Christian access to the [[Holy Land]].  knights made up most reinforcements in the 200 years of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs referred to crusaders as ''Franj''.  Crusaders imported  into the [[Levant]], making [[Old ]] the base of the ''[[lingua franca]]'' ("Frankish language") of the [[Crusader states]]. The [[Albigensian Crusade]] was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical [[Catharism|Cathars]] in the southwest of modern-day .

From the 11th century, the [[House of Plantagenet]], rulers of the [[County of Anjou]], established its dominion over the surrounding provinces of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] and [[Touraine]], then built an "empire" from England to the [[Pyrenees]], covering half of modern . Tensions between  and the [[Angevin Empire|Plantagenet empire]] would last a hundred years, until [[Philip II of ]] conquered, between 1202 and 1214, most continental possessions of the empire, leaving England and [[Aquitaine]] to the Plantagenets.

[[Charles IV of |Charles IV the Fair]] died without an heir in 1328. The crown passed to [[Philip VI of |Philip of Valois]] rather than Edward of Plantagenet, who became [[Edward III of England]]. During the reign of Philip, the monarchy reached the height of its medieval power. However Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward in 1337, and England and  entered the off-and-on [[Hundred Years' War]]. Boundaries changed, but landholdings inside  by  kings remained extensive for decades. With charismatic leaders such as [[Joan of Arc]],  counterattacks won back most  continental territories.  was struck by the [[Black Death]], from which half of the 17&nbsp;million population died.

{{Main| in the early modern period}}

The [[ Renaissance]] saw cultural development and standardisation of , which became the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts|official language of ]] and Europe's aristocracy.  became rivals of the [[House of Habsburg]] during the [[ Wars]], which would dictate much of their later foreign policy until the mid-18th century.  explorers claimed lands in the Americas, paving expansion of the [[ colonial empire]]. The rise of Protestantism led  to a civil war known as the [[ Wars of Religion]]. This forced [[Huguenots]] to flee to Protestant regions such as the [[ Isles]] and [[]]. The wars were ended by [[Henry IV of |Henry IV]]'s [[Edict of Nantes]], which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots. [[Habsburg |]] troops assisted the Catholics from 1589 to 1594 and invaded  in 1597.  and  returned to all-out war between 1635 and 1659. The [[Franco- War (1635–1659)|Franco- War]] cost  300,000 casualties.

Under [[Louis XIII]], [[Cardinal Richelieu]] promoted centralisation of the state and reinforced royal power. He destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private armies. By the end of the 1620s, Richelieu established "the royal monopoly of force".  fought in the [[Thirty Years' War]], supporting the Protestant side against the Habsburgs. From the 16th to the 19th century,  was responsible for about 10% of the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]].

[[File:Louis XIV of .jpg|thumb|upright=.8|alt=Louis XIV of  standing in plate armour and blue sash facing left holding baton|[[Louis XIV]], the "Sun King", was the [[Absolute monarchy in |absolute monarch of ]] who made the country the [[leading power]] in Europe.]]

During [[Louis XIV]]'s minority, trouble known as [[The Fronde]] occurred. This rebellion was driven by feudal lords and [[Parliament|sovereign courts]] as a reaction to the [[Absolutism (European history)|royal absolute power]]. The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and reign of Louis XIV, during which  further increased its influence. By turning lords into [[courtier]]s at the [[Palace of Versailles]], his command of the military went unchallenged. The "Sun King" made  the leading European power.  became the [[Demographics of |most populous European country]] and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture.  became the most-used language in diplomacy, [[Languages of science|science]], and literature until the 20th century.  took control of territories in the Americas, Africa and Asia. In 1685, Louis XIV [[Edict of Fontainebleau|revoked the Edict of Nantes]], forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile and published the ''[[Code Noir]]'' providing the legal framework for slavery and expelling Jews from  colonies.

Under the wars of [[Louis XV]],  lost [[New ]] and most [[ | possessions]] after its defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763). Its [[Metropolitan |European territory]] kept growing, however, with acquisitions such as [[Lorraine]] and [[Corsica]]. Louis XV's weak rule, including the decadence of his court, discredited the monarchy, which in part paved the way for the [[ Revolution]].

[[Louis XVI]] [[ in the  Revolutionary War|supported America with money, fleets and armies]], helping them win [[ Revolutionary War|independence from Great Britain]].  gained revenge but verged on bankruptcy—a factor that contributed to the Revolution. Some of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] occurred in  intellectual circles, and scientific breakthroughs, such as the [[Antoine Lavoisier|naming of oxygen]] and the first [[Montgolfier brothers|hot air balloon carrying passengers]], were achieved by  scientists.  explorers took part in the [[European and  voyages of scientific exploration|voyages of scientific exploration]] through maritime expeditions. Enlightenment philosophy, in which [[Rationalism|reason]] is advocated as the primary source of [[Political legitimacy|legitimacy]], undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and was a factor in the Revolution.

===Revolutionary  (1789–1799)===
[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|alt=drawing of the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, smoke of gunfire enveloping stone castle|The [[Storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789 was the most emblematic event of the [[ Revolution]].]]
The  Revolution was a period of political and societal change that began with the [[Estates General of 1789]], and ended with the [[coup of 18 Brumaire]] in 1799 and the formation of the [[ Consulate]]. Many of its ideas are fundamental principles of [[liberal democracy]], while its values and institutions remain central to modern political discourse.

[[Causes of the  Revolution|Its causes]] were a combination of social, political and economic factors, which the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien Régime]]}} proved unable to manage. A financial crisis and social distress led in May 1789 to the [[convocation]] of the [[Estates General of 1789|Estates General]], which was converted into a [[National Assembly ( Revolution)|National Assembly]] in June. The [[Storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, among them the [[Abolition of feudalism in |abolition of feudalism]], state control over the [[Catholic Church in ]], and a [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|declaration of rights]].

The next three years were dominated by struggle for political control, exacerbated by [[economic depression]]. Military defeats following the outbreak of the [[ Revolutionary Wars]] in April 1792 resulted in the [[insurrection of 10 August 1792]]. The [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|monarchy was abolished]] and replaced by the [[ First Republic]] in September, while [[execution of Louis XVI|Louis XVI was executed]] in January 1793.

After another [[Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793|revolt in June 1793]], the constitution was suspended and power passed from the [[National Convention]] to the [[Committee of Public Safety]]. About 16,000 people were executed in a [[Reign of Terror]], which [[Thermidorian Reaction|ended in July 1794]]. Weakened by external threats and internal opposition, the Republic was replaced in 1795 by the [[ Directory|Directory]]. Four years later in 1799, the [[ Consulate|Consulate]] seized power in a [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|coup]] led by [[Napoleon]].

[[Napoleon]] became [[ Consulate|First Consul]] in 1799 and later [[Constitution of the Year XII|Emperor]] of the [[First  Empire| Empire]]. Changing sets of [[ Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars|European coalitions]] declared [[Napoleonic Wars|wars on Napoleon's empire]]. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt|battles of Jena-Auerstadt]] and [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]]. Members of the [[House of Bonaparte|Bonaparte]] family were appointed monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.

These victories led to the worldwide expansion of  revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the [[metric system]], [[Napoleonic Code]] and [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|Declaration of the Rights of Man]]. In 1812 Napoleon [[ invasion of |attacked ]], reaching [[Moscow]]. Thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease,  attacks, and finally winter. After this catastrophic campaign and the ensuing [[War of the Sixth Coalition|uprising of European monarchies]] against his rule, Napoleon was defeated. About a million Frenchmen [[Napoleonic Wars casualties|died during the Napoleonic Wars]]. After his [[Hundred Days|brief return]] from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and the [[Bourbon Restoration in |Bourbon monarchy was restored]] with new constitutional limitations.

===Colonial empire===

The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the [[July Revolution]] of 1830, which established the constitutional [[July Monarchy]];  troops began the [[ conquest of |conquest of ]]. Unrest led to the [[ Revolution of 1848]] and the end of the July Monarchy. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of male universal suffrage was re-enacted in 1848. In 1852, president of the  Republic, [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]], Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the [[Second  Empire|Second Empire]], as Napoleon III. He multiplied  interventions abroad, especially in [[Crimean War|Crimea]], [[Second  intervention in |]] and [[Second  War of Independence|]]. Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, and his regime was replaced by the [[ Third Republic|Third Republic]]. By 1875, the  conquest of  was complete, with approximately 825,000  killed from famine, disease, and violence.

Including metropolitan , the total area reached almost 13&nbsp;million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s, 9% of the world's land. Known as the ''[[Belle Époque]]'', the turn of the century was characterised by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity and technological, scientific and cultural innovations.

A rich industrial area in the north was occupied.  and the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] emerged victorious against the [[Central Powers]] at tremendous human cost. It left 1.4 million  soldiers dead, 4% of its population. Interwar was marked by [[Events preceding World War II in Europe|intense international tensions]] and social reforms introduced by the [[Popular Front ()|Popular Front government]] (e.g., [[annual leave]], [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour workdays]], [[women in government]]).

In 1940,  was [[Battle of |invaded and quickly defeated]] by [[Nazi ]].  was divided into a [[ military administration in occupied  during World War II| occupation zone]] in the north, an [[ occupation of | occupation zone]] and an unoccupied territory, the rest of , which consisted of southern  and the  empire. The [[Vichy |Vichy government]], an authoritarian regime collaborating with , ruled the unoccupied territory. [[Free ]], the government-in-exile led by&nbsp;[[Charles de Gaulle]], was set up in London.

From 1942 to 1944, about 160,000  citizens, including around [[The Holocaust in |75,000 Jews]], were deported to [[Extermination camp|death]] and [[Internment|concentration camps]]. On 6 June 1944, the Allies [[Operation Overlord|invaded Normandy]], and in August they [[Operation Dragoon|invaded Provence]]. The Allies and [[ Resistance]] emerged victorious, and  sovereignty was restored with the [[Provisional Government of the  Republic]] (GPRF). This interim government, established by de Gaulle, continued to [[Western Allied invasion of |wage war against ]] and to [[Épuration légale|purge collaborators from office]]. It made important reforms e.g. suffrage extended to women and the creation of a [[Social security in |social security]] system.

A new constitution resulted in the [[ Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] (1946–1958), which saw strong economic growth (''les [[Trente Glorieuses]]'').  was a founding member of [[NATO]] and attempted to [[First Indochina War|regain control of  Indochina]], but was defeated by the [[Viet Minh]] in 1954.  faced another [[anti-colonialist]] [[ War|conflict in ]], then part of  and home to over one million European settlers ([[Pied-Noir]]). The  systematically used torture and repression, including extrajudicial killings to keep control. This conflict nearly led to a coup and civil war.

During the [[May 1958 crisis in |May 1958 crisis]], the weak Fourth Republic gave way to the [[ Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]], which included a strengthened presidency. The war concluded with the [[Évian Accords]] in 1962 which led to [[1962  independence referendum| independence]], at a high price: between half a million and one million deaths and over 2&nbsp;million internally-displaced . Around one million Pied-Noirs and [[Harki]]s fled from  to . A vestige of the empire is the [[Overseas | overseas departments and territories]].

During the [[Cold War]], de Gaulle pursued a policy of "national independence" towards the [[Western Bloc|Western]] and [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern blocs]]. He withdrew from NATO's military-integrated command (while remaining within the alliance), launched a [[Force de dissuasion|nuclear development programme]] and made  the [[ and weapons of mass destruction|fourth nuclear power]]. He [[Élysée Treaty|restored]] cordial [[– relations|Franco- relations]] to create a European counterweight between  and Soviet spheres of influence. However, he opposed any development of a [[Supranational union|supranational Europe]], favouring [[Sovereign state|sovereign nations]]. The revolt of [[May 68|May 1968]] had an enormous social impact; it was a watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted to a more liberal moral ideal (secularism, individualism, sexual revolution). Although the revolt was a political failure (the [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] party emerged stronger than before) it announced a split between the  and de Gaulle, who resigned.

In the post-Gaullist era,  remained one of the most developed [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|economies in the world]] but faced crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries,  has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational [[European Union]], notably by signing the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in 1992, establishing the [[eurozone]] in 1999 and signing the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] in 2007.  has fully reintegrated into NATO and since participated in most NATO-sponsored wars. Since the 19th century,  has [[Immigration to |received many immigrants]], often male [[foreign worker]]s from European Catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed. During the 1970s  faced an economic crisis and allowed new immigrants (mostly from the [[Maghreb]], in northwest Africa) to permanently [[Family reunification|settle in  with their families]] and acquire citizenship. It resulted in hundreds of thousands of Muslims living in subsidised public housing and suffering from high unemployment rates. The government had a policy of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of immigrants, where they were expected to adhere to  values and norms.

Since the [[1995  bombings|1995 public transport bombings]],  has been targeted by Islamist organisations, notably the [[January 2015 Île-de- attacks|''Charlie Hebdo'' attack]] in 2015 which provoked the [[Republican marches|largest public rallies]] in  history, gathering 4.4&nbsp;million people, the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]] which resulted in 130 deaths, the deadliest attack on  soil since World War II and the deadliest in the European Union since the [[2004 Madrid train bombings|Madrid train bombings in 2004]].

===Antiquity===
Following the post-glacial flooding of the [[Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf basin]], debris from the [[Tigris–Euphrates river system|Tigris–Euphrates river]] formed a substantial delta, creating most of the land in present-day  and establishing the present coastlines. One of the earliest evidence of human presence in  dates back to the [[Mesolithic]] era (c. 8000 BC). Historically, most of present-day  was part of ancient [[Mesopotamia]].

During the [[Ubaid period]] (c. 5500–3700 BC),  was the central site of interaction between the peoples of [[Mesopotamia]] and Neolithic [[Eastern Arabia]], including [[Bahra 1]] and [[H3 ()|site H3]] in [[Subiya, |Subiya]]. The Neolithic inhabitants of  were among the world's earliest maritime traders. One of the world's earliest [[reed boats]] was discovered at [[H3 ()|site H3]] dating back to the Ubaid period. Other Neolithic sites in  are located in Khiran and [[Sulaibikhat]].

[[Mesopotamian]]s first settled in the  island of [[Failaka Island|Failaka]] in 2000 BC. Traders from the [[Sumer]]ian city of [[Ur]] inhabited Failaka and ran a mercantile business. The island had many Mesopotamian-style buildings typical of those found in [[]] dating from around 2000 BC. In 4000 BC until 2000 BC,  was home to the [[Dilmun civilization]]. Dilmun included Al-Shadadiya, [[Akkaz Island|Akkaz]], [[Umm an Namil Island|Umm an Namil]], and [[Failaka Island|Failaka]]. At its peak in 2000 BC, Dilmun controlled the [[Persian Gulf]] trading routes.

During the Dilmun era (from ca. 3000 BC), Failaka was known as "[[Agarum (toponym)|Agarum]]", the land of [[Enzak]], a great god in the Dilmun civilization according to Sumerian cuneiform texts found on the island. As part of Dilmun, Failaka became a hub for the civilization from the end of the 3rd to the middle of the 1st millennium BC. After the Dilmun civilization, Failaka was inhabited by the [[Kassites]] of [[Mesopotamia]], and was formally under the control of the [[Kassites#Kassite Dynasty of Babylon|Kassite dynasty of Babylon]]. Studies indicate traces of human settlement can be found on Failaka dating back to as early as the end of the 3rd millennium BC, and extending until the 20th century AD. Many of the artifacts found in Falaika are linked to Mesopotamian civilizations and seem to show that Failaka was gradually drawn toward the civilization based in [[Antioch]].
[[File:Achaemenid_Empire_500_BCE.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Achaemenid Empire]] at its greatest territorial extent]]
Under [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], the bay of  was under [[Babylonia]]n control. Cuneiform documents found in Failaka indicate the presence of Babylonians in the island's population. [[List of Kings of Babylon|Babylonian Kings]] were present in Failaka during the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] period, [[Nabonidus]] had a governor in Failaka and Nebuchadnezzar II had a palace and temple in Falaika. Failaka also contained temples dedicated to the worship of [[Shamash]], the Mesopotamian sun god in the Babylonian pantheon.

Following the [[Fall of Babylon]], the bay of  came under the control of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (c. 550‒330 BC) as the bay was repopulated after seven centuries of abandonment. Failaka was under the control of the Achaemenid Empire as evidenced by the archaeological discovery of Achaemenid strata. There are [[Aramaic]] inscriptions that testify Achaemenid presence.

In fourth century BC, the [[ancient ]] colonized the bay of  under [[Alexander the Great]]. The ancient  named mainland  ''Larissa'' and Failaka was named ''[[Ikaros (Failaka Island)|Ikaros]]''. The bay of  was named ''Hieros Kolpos''. According to [[Strabo]] and [[Arrian]], Alexander the Great named Failaka ''Ikaros'' because it resembled the [[Aegean island|Aegean Island]] of that name in size and shape. Elements of [[ mythology]] were mixed with the local cults. "Ikaros" was also the name of a prominent city situated in Failaka. Large [[Hellenistic]] [[Towns of ancient #Military settlements|fort]]s and [[ temple]]s were uncovered. Archaeological remains of  colonization were also discovered in Akkaz, Umm an Namil, and Subiya.

At the time of Alexander the Great, the mouth of the [[Euphrates|Euphrates River]] was located in northern . The Euphrates river flowed directly into the Persian Gulf via Khor [[Subiya, |Subiya]] which was a river channel at the time. Failaka was located 15 kilometers from the mouth of the Euphrates river. By the first century BC, the Khor Subiya river channel dried out completely.

In 127 BC,  was part of the [[Parthian Empire]] and the kingdom of [[Characene]] was established around [[Teredon]] in present-day . Characene was centered in the region encompassing southern Mesopotamia, Characene coins were discovered in Akkaz, Umm an Namil, and Failaka. A busy Parthian commercial station was situated in .

In 224 AD,  became part of the [[Sassanid Empire]]. At the time of the Sassanid Empire,  was known as ''Meshan'', which was an alternative name of the kingdom of Characene. Akkaz was a [[Parthian Empire|Partho]]-[[Sassanian]] site; the [[Zoroastrianism|Sassanid religion]]'s [[tower of silence]] was discovered in northern Akkaz. Late Sassanian settlements were discovered in Failaka. In [[Bubiyan Island|Bubiyan]], there is archaeological evidence of Sassanian to early Islamic periods of human presence as evidenced by the recent discovery of torpedo-jar pottery shards on several prominent beach ridges.

In 636 AD, the [[Battle of Chains]] between the Sassanid Empire and [[Rashidun Caliphate]] was fought in . As a result of Rashidun victory in 636 AD, the bay of  was home to the city of [[Kazma]] (also known as "Kadhima" or "Kāzimah") in the early Islamic era.

In the early to mid 1700s, [[ City]] was a small [[fishing village]]. Administratively, it was a sheikhdom, ruled by [[sheikh]]s from the local [[Bani Khalid]] clan. Sometime in the mid 1700s, the [[Bani Utbah]] settled in  City. Sometime after the death of the Bani Khalid's leader Barak bin Abdul Mohsen and the fall of the [[Bani Khalid Emirate]], the Utub were able to wrest control of  as a result of successive [[Marriage of state|matrimonial alliances]].

In the latter half of the eighteenth century,  began establishing itself as a maritime [[port]] and gradually became a principal commercial center for the transit of goods between [[Baghdad]], , Persia, [[Muscat]], and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. By the late-1700s,  had established itself as a trading route from the Persian Gulf to [[Aleppo]]. During the [[Ottoman–Persian War (1775–1776)|Persian siege of Basra in 1775–79]],  merchants took refuge in  and were partly instrumental in the expansion of 's boat-building and trading activities. As a result, 's maritime commerce boomed, as the  trade routes with Baghdad, Aleppo, [[Smyrna]] and [[Constantinople]] were diverted to  during this time. The [[East  Company]] was diverted to  in 1792. The East  Company secured the sea routes between ,  and the east coasts of Africa. After the Persians withdrew from [[Basra]] in 1779,  continued to attract trade away from Basra. The flight of many of Basra's leading merchants to  continued to play a significant role in Basra's commercial stagnation well into the 1850s.

The instability in Basra helped foster economic prosperity in . In the late 18th century,  was a haven for Basra merchants fleeing [[Ottoman government|Ottoman]] persecution.  was the center of [[boat building]] in the Persian Gulf, its ships renowned throughout the [[ Ocean]]. Its sailors developed a positive reputation in the Persian Gulf. In the 19th century,  became significant in the [[horse trading|horse trade]], with regular shipments in sailing vessels. In the mid 19th century, it was estimated that  exported an average of 800 horses to  annually.

In 1899, ruler Sheikh [[Mubarak Al-Sabah|Mubarak Al Sabah]] signed an agreement with the [[Presidencies and provinces of  | government in ]] (subsequently known as the [[Anglo- Agreement of 1899]]) making  a [[ protectorate]]. This gave Britain exclusive access and trade with , while denying Ottoman and  provinces to the north a port on the Persian Gulf. The [[Sheikhdom of ]] remained a  protectorate until 1961.

After the [[Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913]],  was established as an autonomous ''[[kaza]],'' or district, of the Ottoman Empire and a ''[[de facto]]'' protectorate of Great Britain.

During [[World War I]], the [[ Empire]] imposed a trade blockade against  because its ruler at the time, [[Salim Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah]], supported the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The  economic blockade heavily damaged 's economy.

In 1919, Sheikh [[Salim Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah]] intended to build a commercial city in the south of . This caused a diplomatic crisis with Najd, but Britain intervened, discouraging Sheikh Salim. In 1920, an attempt by the [[Ikhwan]] to build a stronghold in southern  led to the [[Battle of Hamdh]]. The Battle of Hamdh involved 2,000 [[Ikhwan]] fighters against 100  [[cavalrymen]] and 200  [[infantrymen]]. The battle lasted for six days and resulted in heavy but unknown casualties on both sides resulting in the victory of the Ikhwan forces and leading to the battle of Jahra around the  Red Fort. The [[Battle of Jahra]] happened as the result of the [[Battle of Hamdh]]. A force of three to four thousand [[Ikhwan]], led by [[Faisal Al-Dawish]], attacked the [[ Red Fort|Red Fort]] at Al-Jahra, defended by fifteen hundred men. The fort was besieged and the  position precarious. The Ikhwan attack repulsed for the while, negotiations began between Salim and Al-Dawish; the latter threatened another attack if the  forces did not surrender. The local merchant class convinced Salim to call in help from  troops, who showed up with airplanes and three warships, ending the attacks. After the Battle of Jahra, Ibn Saud's warriors, the [[Ikhwan]], demanded that  follows five rules. They demanded that all the [[Shias]] be evicted, that all should adopt the [[Wahhabism|Ikhwan doctrine]], that the Turks be labelled "[[heretics]]", that smoking, [[Munkar and Nakir|munkar]], and prostitution be abolished, and that  missionary hospital be destroyed.

[[File:Jahra-castle.jpg|thumb|The [[ Red Fort]] in [[Al Jahra]]]]
The [[–Najd War]] of 1919–20 erupted in the [[aftermath of World War I]]. The war occurred because [[Ibn Saud]] of Najd wanted to annex . The sharpened conflict between  and Najd led to the death of hundreds of . The war resulted in sporadic border clashes throughout 1919–1920.

When [[Percy Cox]] was informed of the border clashes in , he sent a letter to the [[Emirate of Arabistan|Ruler of Arabistan]] Sheikh [[Khazʽal Ibn Jabir]] offering the  throne to either him or one of his heirs. Khaz'al refused. He then asked: {{blockquote|...even so, do you think that you have come to me with something new? Al Mubarak's position as ruler of  means that I am the true ruler of . So there is no difference between myself and them, for they are like the dearest of my children and you are aware of this. Had someone else come to me with this offer, I would have complained about them to you. So how do you come to me with this offer when you are well aware that myself and Al Mubarak are one soul and one house, what affects them affects me, whether good or evil.}}

Following the –Najd War in 1919–20, Ibn Saud imposed a trade blockade against  from the years 1923 until 1937. The goal of the  economic and military attacks on  was to annex as much of 's territory as possible. At the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Uqair conference]] in 1922, the boundaries of  and Najd were set; as a result of  interference,  had no representative at the Uqair conference. After the Uqair conference,  was still subjected to a  economic blockade and intermittent  [[Raid (military)|raiding]].

 immensely declined in regional economic importance, due to the trade blockades and the world economic depression. Before [[Mary Bruins Allison]] visited  in 1934,  had already lost its prominence in long-distance trade.

[[File:Kuwait1944.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Celebration at [[Seif Palace]] in 1944]]
The [[Great Depression]] harmed 's economy, starting in the late 1920s. International trading was one of 's main sources of income before oil. 's merchants were mostly intermediary merchants. As a result of the decline of European demand for goods from  and Africa, 's economy suffered. The decline in international trade resulted in an increase in gold smuggling by 's ships to . Some local merchant families became rich from this smuggling. 's [[pearl]] industry also collapsed as a result of the worldwide economic depression. At its height, 's pearl industry had led the world's luxury market, regularly sending out between 750 and 800 ships to meet the European elite's desire for pearls. During the economic depression, luxuries like pearls were in little demand. The  invention of [[cultured pearl]]s also contributed to the collapse of 's pearl industry.

[[Freya Stark]] wrote about the extent of poverty in  at the time:{{blockquote|Poverty has settled in  more heavily since my last visit five years ago, both by sea, where the pearl trade continues to decline, and by land, where the blockade established by  now harms the merchants.}}

On 22 February 1938, [[Petroleum|oil]] was first discovered in the [[Burgan field]].

===1946–1980: State-building===
Between 1946 and 1980,  experienced a period of prosperity driven by oil and its liberal cultural atmosphere; this period is called the "golden era of ". In 1946, crude oil was exported for the first time. In 1950, a major public-work programme began to enable  citizens to enjoy a luxurious standard of living.

By 1952, the country became the largest oil exporter in the Persian Gulf region. This massive growth attracted many foreign workers, especially from , , , and  – with the latter being particularly political within the context of the [[Arab Cold War]]. It was also in 1952 that the first masterplan of  was designed by the  planning firm of [[Anthony Minoprio|Minoprio]], [[Hugh Spencely|Spenceley]], and Macfarlane. In 1958, ''[[Al-Arabi (magazine)|Al-Arabi]]'' magazine was first published. Many foreign writers moved to  because they enjoyed greater [[freedom of expression]] than elsewhere in the Middle East. 's press was described as one of the [[Freedom of the press|freest in the world]].  was the pioneer of the post-[[Nahda]] literary renaissance in the Middle East.

In June 1961,  became independent with the end of the [[Sheikhdom of #History as a Protected State of Britain| protectorate]] and the Sheikh [[Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah]] became [[Emir of ]]. 's [[Public holidays in |national day]], however, is celebrated on 25 February, the anniversary of the coronation of Sheikh Abdullah (it was originally celebrated on 19 June, the date of independence, but concerns over the summer heat caused the government to move it).

At the time,  was considered the most developed country in the region.  was the pioneer in the Middle East in diversifying its earnings away from oil exports. The [[ Investment Authority]] is the world's first sovereign wealth fund.

 society embraced liberal and non-traditional attitudes throughout the 1960s and 1970s. For example, most  women did not wear the [[hijab]] in the 1960s and 70s.

Although  formally gained independence in 1961,  initially refused to recognize the country's independence by maintaining that  is part of , albeit  later briefly backed down following a show of force by Britain and [[Arab League]] support of 's independence.

The short-lived [[Operation Vantage]] crisis evolved in July 1961, as the  government threatened to invade  and the invasion was finally averted following plans by the Arab League to form an international Arab force against the potential  invasion of . As a result of Operation Vantage, the Arab League took over the border security of  and the  had withdrawn their forces by 19 October.  prime minister [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] was killed in a coup in 1963 but, although  recognised  independence and the military threat was perceived to be reduced, Britain continued to monitor the situation and kept forces available to protect  until 1971. There had been no  military action against  at the time: this was attributed to the political and military situation within  which continued to be unstable.

A treaty of friendship between  and  was signed in 1963 by which  recognised the 1932 border of . Under the terms of the newly drafted [[Constitution of |Constitution]],  held its first [[ parliamentary election, 1963|parliamentary elections in 1963]].

[[ University]] was established in 1966. 's [[#Television and theatre|theatre industry]] became well known throughout the region. After the 1967 [[Six Day War]],  along with other Arabic speaking countries voted the three no's of the [[Khartoum Resolution]]: no peace with , no recognition of , and no negotiations with . From the 1970s onward,  scored highest of all Arab countries on the [[Human Development Index]]. The  poet [[Ahmed Matar]] left  in the 1970s to take refuge in the more liberal environment of .  is the 25th most peaceful country in the world, according to the 2024 [[Global Peace Index]].

The [[- 1973 Sanita border skirmish|- 1973 Samita border skirmish]] evolved on 20 March 1973, when  army units occupied El-Samitah near the  border, which evoked an international crisis.

On 6 February 1974, [[1974 attack on the  Embassy in | militants occupied the  embassy in ]], taking the ambassador and ten others hostage. The militants' motive was to support the [[ Red Army]] members and  militants who were holding hostages on a  ferry in what is known as the [[Laju incident|''Laju'' incident]]. Ultimately, the hostages were released, and the guerrillas allowed to fly to [[Aden]]. This was the first time  guerrillas struck in  as the Al Sabah ruling family, headed by Sheikh Sabah Al-Salim Al-Sabah, funded the  resistance movement.  had been a regular endpoint for  [[aircraft hijacking|plane hijacking]] in the past and had considered itself safe.

===1981–1991: Wars and terrorism===
{{main|1983–1988  terror attacks|Gulf War}}
The Al Sabah strongly advocated [[Islamism]] throughout the 1980s. At that time, the most serious threat to the continuity of Al Sabah came from home-grown democrats, who were protesting the [[ general election, 1975|1976 suspension of the parliament]]. The Al Sabah were attracted to Islamists preaching the virtues of a [[hierarchical]] order that included loyalty to the  monarchy. In 1981, the  government [[gerrymandered]] electoral districts in favour of the Islamists. Islamists were the government's main allies, hence Islamists were able to dominate state agencies, such as the [[government ministries]].

During the [[– War]],  ardently supported . As a result, there were [[1983–1988  terror attacks|various pro- terror attacks]] across , including the 1983 bombings, the attempted assassination of [[Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah|Emir Jaber]] in May 1985, the [[1985  City bombings]], and the hijacking of several  Airways planes. 's economy and scientific research sector significantly suffered due to the pro- terror attacks.

Simultaneously,  experienced a major [[economic crisis]] after the [[Souk Al-Manakh stock market crash]] and [[1980s oil glut|decrease in oil price]].

After the – War ended,  declined an  request to forgive its US$65&nbsp;billion debt. An economic rivalry between the two countries ensued after  increased its oil production by 40 percent. Tensions between the two countries increased further in July 1990, after  complained to [[OPEC]] claiming that  was stealing its oil from a field near the border by [[slant drilling]] of the [[Rumaila field]].

[[File:Vendel I helmet 456057.jpg|thumb|A [[Vendel Period|Vendel-era]] helmet, at the  Museum of National Antiquities]]
's prehistory begins in the [[Allerød oscillation]], a warm period around 12,000 BC, with Late [[Palaeolithic]] [[reindeer]]-hunting camps of the [[Bromme culture]] at the edge of the ice in what is now the country's southernmost province, [[Scania]]. This period was characterised by small clans of [[hunter-gatherer]]s who relied on [[flint]] technology.

 and its people were first described by the Roman historian [[Publius Cornelius Tacitus]] in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' (98 AD). In [[s:Germania#XLIV|''Germania'' 44 and 45]] he mentions the Swedes (''Suiones'') as a powerful tribe with ships that had a [[prow]] at each end ([[longship]]s). Which kings ({{Lang|gem-x-proto|kuningaz}}) ruled these Suiones is unknown, but [[Norse mythology]] presents a long line of legendary and semi-legendary kings going back to the last centuries BC. The [[Runes|runic script]] was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the second century AD, but all that has survived from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke [[Proto-Norse]] at the time, a language ancestral to  and other [[North Germanic languages]].

In the sixth century, the Byzantine historian [[Jordanes]] names two tribes living in [[Scandza]], both of which are now considered to be synonymous with the Swedes: the {{Lang|la|Suetidi}} and {{Lang|la|Suehans}}. The {{Lang|la|Suehans}} were known to the Roman world as suppliers of black fox skins and, according to Jordanes, had very fine horses, similar to those of the ''[[Thuringians|Thyringi]]'' of {{Lang|la|Germania}} ("{{Lang|la|alia vero gens ibi moratur Suehans, quae velud Thyringi equis utuntur eximiis}}").

===Viking Age===
{{See also|Early  history|Consolidation of |Varangians}}
[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|upright=1.3|thumb|left|[[Viking]] expeditions (blue lines)]]

The  [[Viking Age]] lasted roughly from the eighth century to the 11th century. It is believed that  Vikings and [[Gutes|Gutar]] mainly travelled east and south, going to , , the [[Baltic countries]], , , , the [[Black Sea]] and even as far as [[Baghdad]]. Their routes passed [[The Trade Route from the Varangians to the |through the Dnieper]] south to [[Constantinople]], on which they carried out numerous raids. The [[Byzantine Emperor|Byzantine emperor]] [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] noticed their great skills in war and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard, known as the [[Varangian Guard]]. The  Vikings, called [[Rus (people)|Rus]], are believed to be the founders of [[Kievan Rus']]. The Vikings were described by many outside sources, such as the Arab traveler [[Ibn Fadlan]]. The actions of these [[Vikings| Vikings]] are commemorated on many [[runestone]]s in , such as the [[ runestones]] and the [[Varangian runestones]]. There was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards, which are commemorated on stones such as the [[England runestones]]. The last major  Viking expedition appears to have been the ill-fated expedition of [[Ingvar the Far-Travelled]] to [[Serkland]], the region south-east of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Its members are commemorated on the [[Ingvar runestones]], none of which mentions any survivor.

During the early stages of the Viking Age, a centre of trade in [[Northern Europe]] developed at [[Birka]] on the island of [[Björkö, Ekerö|Björkö]], not far from where Stockholm was later constructed, in mid-latitude . Birka was founded around 750 AD as a trading port by a king or merchants trying to control trade. Birka was the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] link in the [[Dnieper trade route]] through [[Staraya Ladoga|Ladoga]] (''Aldeigja'') and [[Novgorod Land|Novgorod]] (''Holmsgard'') to the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. It was abandoned around 975, at about the same time [[Sigtuna]] was founded as a town some 35&nbsp;km to the northeast. It has been estimated that the population in Viking Age Birka was between 500 and 1000 people. Archaeological finds indicate that Birka still was wealthy in the 9th and 10th centuries. Thousands of graves, coins, jewelry and other luxury items have been found there.

===Kingdom of ===
[[File:Map of  ca 1280.png|thumb|right|A rough map of the extent of  rule, {{circa|1280}}]]
The exact age of the kingdom of  is unknown. Determining its age depends mostly on whether  is considered a nation when the {{Lang|sv|[[Svear]]}} (Swedes) ruled Svealand or when the {{Lang|sv|Svear}} and the {{Lang|sv|[[Götar]]}} (Geats) of Götaland were united under a single ruler. Svealand was described by [[Tacitus]] in 98 AD as being under a single ruler, though it is unknown how long this had been the case. The epic poem ''Beowulf'' describes semi-legendary [[-Geatish wars]] in the sixth century.

However, historians typically start the line of [[ monarchs]] from when Svealand and Götaland were ruled under the same king, namely [[Erik the Victorious]] and his son [[Olof Skötkonung]] in the tenth century. These events are often described as the [[consolidation of ]], although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later. In this context, "Götaland" primarily refers to the provinces of [[Östergötland]] and [[Västergötland]]. [[Småland]] was of little interest at the time due to its deep pine forests, with only the city of [[Kalmar]] and its castle holding any significant importance. There were also  settlements along the southern coastline of [[Norrland]], one of the four [[lands of ]].

[[Ansgar| Ansgar]] is traditionally credited with introducing Christianity to  in 829, but the new religion did not begin to fully replace [[paganism]] until the 12th century. During that century,  was undergoing dynastic struggles between the [[House of Eric|Erik]] and [[House of Sverker|Sverker]] clans. The conflict ended when a third clan married into the Erik clan, founding the [[House of Bjälbo|Bjälbo]] dynasty, which gradually consolidated  into a stronger state. According to the ''Legend of [[ Erik]]'' and the ''[[Erik's Chronicle]]'',  kings conducted [[ Crusades (disambiguation)|a series of Crusades]] to pagan  and started conflicts with the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']], who by then had no further connections with . As a result of the Crusades, mostly with the Second  Crusade led by [[Birger Jarl]]  gradually became part of the kingdom of  and the sphere of influence of the [[Catholic Church]]. The Swedes built fortresses in [[Häme|Tavastland]] and [[Åbo]], while a  royal council was instituted, an administrative structure and fiscal apparatus was created, and law codes were codified during the reigns of [[Magnus Ladulås]] (1275–1290) and [[Magnus Eriksson]] (1319–1364). As a result, the  lands were firmly integrated into the  realm.

Except for the provinces of Scania, Blekinge, and Halland in the southwest of the Scandinavian peninsula, which were part of the Kingdom of  during this period, [[feudalism]] never developed in  as it did in much of Europe. As a result, the peasantry remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of  history. [[Slavery]], also known as [[thrall]]dom, was not common in , and the institution gradually diminished due to the spread of Christianity, the difficulty of obtaining slaves from lands east of the Baltic Sea, and by the development of cities before the 16th century. Indeed, both slavery and [[serfdom]] were abolished altogether by a decree of King [[Magnus Eriksson]] in 1335.  remained a poor and economically underdeveloped country, where barter was the primary means of exchange.

In 1319,  and  were united in a [[personal union]] under King Magnus Eriksson, the grandson of King [[Magnus Ladulås]] of  and of King [[Haakon V of |Haakon V]] of . Magnus Eriksson also ruled Scania from 1332 to 1360. In the mid-14th century,  was struck by the [[Black Death]]. The population of  and most of Europe was decimated. The population did not reach its pre-1348 levels until the beginning of the 19th century, with one third of the population dying between 1349 and 1351. During this period, the cities began to acquire greater rights and were heavily influenced by  merchants of the [[Hanseatic League]], active especially at [[Visby]]. In 1397, Queen [[Margaret I of ]] (the former daughter-in-law of Magnus Eriksson) established the personal union of , , and  through the [[Kalmar Union]]. However, Margaret's successors, whose rule was centred in , were unable to control the  nobility.

[[File:Gustav Vasa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Gustav I of |Gustav I]] [[ War of Liberation|liberated]]  from [[Christian II of ]], ending the [[Kalmar Union]]. He established the [[House of Vasa]] which ruled  and  until the 17th century.]]

In 1520, King [[Christian II of ]], who attempted to restore the Union of Kalmar through military force, ordered the massacre of  nobles in Stockholm, an event known as the "[[Stockholm Bloodbath]]." This atrocity incited the  nobility to renew their resistance, and on 6 June 1523 (now celebrated as [[National Day of |'s National Day]]), they made [[Gustav Vasa]] their king. This is sometimes considered as the [[foundation of modern ]]. Shortly afterwards the new king rejected Catholicism and led  into the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The term {{Lang|sv|riksdag}} was used for the first time in the 1540s, although the first meeting where representatives of different social groups were called to discuss and determine affairs affecting the country as a whole took place as early as 1435, in the town of [[Arboga]]. During the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Riksdag assemblies]] of 1527 and 1544, under King Gustav Vasa, representatives of all four [[estates of the realm]] (clergy, [[ nobility|nobility]], [[Bourgeoisie|townsmen]] and [[peasant]]s) were called on to participate for the first time. The monarchy became hereditary in 1544. When Gustav Vasa broke the monopoly power of the [[Hanseatic League]], he was regarded as a hero by the  people. Furthermore, when  became more developed, after breaking the trade monopoly of the Hanseatic League, and entered its golden age, the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that a greater share of the economic benefits went to them rather than to a feudal landowning class.

The end of the 16th century was marked by a final phase of rivalry between the remaining Catholics and the new Protestant communities. In 1592, Gustav Vasa's Catholic grandson and [[king of ]], [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund]], ascended the  throne. He pursued to strengthen [[Holy See|Rome]]'s influence by initiating [[Counter-Reformation]] and created a dual monarchy that temporarily became known as the [[- Union]]. His despotic rule, strongly characterised by intolerance towards the Protestants, sparked a [[War against Sigismund|civil war]] that plunged  into poverty. In opposition, Sigismund's uncle and successor, [[Charles IX of |Charles Vasa]], summoned the [[Uppsala Synod]] in 1593 which officially confirmed the modern [[Church of ]] as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]. Following his [[deposition (politics)|deposition]] in 1599, Sigismund attempted to reclaim the throne sparing no expense, and hostilities between [[– Commonwealth|]] and  continued for the next hundred years.

In the 17th century,  was engaged in many wars, for example with –, with both sides competing for territories of today's [[Baltic states]]. The – War (1626–1629) ended with a ceasefire in [[Stary Targ]] ([[Truce of Altmark]]) on 26 September 1629 that was in favour of the Swedes, to whom  ceded the larger part of [[Livonia]] together with its important port of [[Riga]]. The Swedes also gained the right to tax ’s Baltic trade (3.5% on the value of goods), and kept control of several cities in [[Royal Prussia]] and [[Ducal Prussia]] (including [[Pillau]] (Baltiysk), [[Klaipėda|Memel]] (Klaipėda) and [[Elbing]] (Elbląg)). The Swedes later conducted a series of invasions into the – Commonwealth, known as the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]].{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=156}} After more than half a century of almost constant warfare, the  economy had deteriorated.

In addition, [[The plague during the Great Northern War|the plague raging in East Central Europe]] devastated the [[ dominions]] and reached Central  in 1710. Returning to  in 1715, Charles XII launched [[Great Northern War and |two campaigns against ]] in 1716 and 1718, respectively. During the second attempt, he was shot to death during the [[siege of Fredriksten]] fortress.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=295}} The Swedes were not militarily defeated at Fredriksten, but the whole structure and organisation of the campaign fell apart with the king's death.

Executive power was historically shared between the King and an aristocratic [[Privy council]] until 1680, followed by the King's [[autocracy|autocratic rule]] initiated by the commoner estates of the [[Riksdag]]. As a reaction to the failed Great Northern War, a parliamentary system was introduced in 1719, followed by three different flavours of constitutional monarchy in 1772, 1789 and 1809, [[ constitution of 1809|the latter]] granting several civil liberties. Already during the first of those three periods, the 'Era of Liberty' (1719–72) the  Riksdag had developed into a very active parliament, and this tradition continued into the nineteenth century, laying the basis for the transition towards modern democracy at the end of that century.
In the 18th century,  did not have enough resources to maintain its territories outside Scandinavia, and most of them were lost, culminating with [[ War|the loss in 1809]] of eastern  to , which became the highly autonomous [[Grand Duchy of |Grand Principality of ]] in [[ Empire|Imperial ]].

The  attempts to keep their status as a sovereign state were rejected by the  king, [[Charles XIII]]. He launched a [[– War (1814)|military campaign against ]] on 27 July 1814, ending in the [[Convention of Moss]], which forced  into a [[Union between  and |personal union]] with  under the  crown, which lasted until 1905.

The [[ East  Company]] began in 1731. The obvious choice of home port was [[Gothenburg]] ({{langx|sv|Göteborg}}) at 's west coast, as the mouth of [[Göta älv|Göta älv river]] was very wide and had the county's largest and best harbour for high-seas journeys. The trade continued into the 19th century, and caused the little town to become 's second city.
Between 1750 and 1850, the population in  doubled. According to some scholars, mass emigration to America became the only way to prevent famine and rebellion; over 1% of the population emigrated annually during the 1880s. It is thought that between 1850 and 1910 more than one million [[ emigration to the |Swedes moved to the ]]. Nevertheless,  remained poor, retaining a nearly entirely agricultural economy even as Western European countries began to industrialise.

Despite the slow rate of industrialisation into the 19th century, many important changes were taking place in the agrarian economy due to constant innovations and a rapid population growth. These innovations included government-sponsored programmes of [[enclosure]], aggressive exploitation of agricultural lands, and the introduction of new crops such as the potato. The  farming culture began to take on a critical role in  politics, which has continued through modern times with modern Agrarian party (now called the Centre Party). Between 1870 and 1914,  began developing the industrialised economy that exists today.

Strong grassroots movements sprang up in  during the latter half of the 19th century (trade unions, [[temperance movement|temperance]] groups, and independent religious groups), creating a strong foundation of democratic principles. These movements precipitated 's migration into a modern parliamentary democracy, achieved by the time of World War I. As the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed during the 20th century, people gradually moved into cities to work in factories and became involved in socialist unions.

 was one of the founding states of the [[European Free Trade Area]] (EFTA). During the 1960s the EFTA countries were often referred to as the Outer Seven, as opposed to the [[Inner Six]] of the then-[[European Economic Community]] (EEC).

Like many industrialised countries,  entered a period of economic decline and upheaval following the oil embargoes of 1973–74 and 1978–79. In the 1980s several key  industries were significantly restructured. Shipbuilding was discontinued, wood pulp was integrated into modernised paper production, the steel industry was concentrated and specialised, and mechanical engineering was robotised.  GDP per capita ranking declined during this time.

A bursting real estate bubble caused by inadequate controls on lending combined with an international recession and a policy switch from anti-unemployment policies to anti-inflationary policies resulted in a [[ financial crisis 1990-1994|fiscal crisis]] in the early 1990s. 's GDP declined by around 5%. In 1992, a run on the currency caused the central bank to briefly increase interest rates to 500%.

The response of the government was to cut spending and institute a multitude of reforms to improve 's competitiveness, among them reducing the [[welfare state]] and [[Privatisation|privatising]] public services and goods. [[1994  European Union membership referendum|A referendum]] passed with 52.3% in favour of joining the EU on 13 November 1994.  joined the [[European Union]] on 1 January 1995.

On 28 September 1994, the [[Sinking of the MS |MS  sank]] as the ship was crossing the Baltic Sea, en route from Tallinn, , to Stockholm, . The disaster claimed the lives of 852 people (501 of them were Swedes), being one of the worst maritime disasters of the 20th century.

Until 2022,  generally remained non-aligned militarily, although it participated in some joint military exercises with the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and some other countries, stationed its troops under NATO command in [[Islamic Republic of |]], took part in EU-sponsored [[peacekeeping]] operations in [[Kosovo]], [[]], and [[]], and [[2011 military intervention in |helped enforce]] a [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973|UN-mandated no-fly zone]] over  during the [[Arab Spring]].

In recent decades  has become a more culturally diverse nation due to significant immigration; in 2013, it was estimated that 15% of the population was foreign-born, and an additional 5% of the population were born to two immigrant parents. The influx of immigrants has brought new social challenges. Violent incidents have [[Rosengård#Violence|periodically occurred]] including the [[May 2013 Stockholm riots|2013 Stockholm riots]]. In response to these violent events, the [[Far-right politics|anti-immigration]] opposition party, the [[ Democrats]], promoted their anti-immigration policies, while the [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] opposition blamed growing inequality caused by the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] government's socioeconomic policies.

Since the postwar period, [[LGBTQ rights in ]] have gradually expanded through the steady extension of legal and social protections for LGBTQ+ people. Over subsequent decades, anti-discrimination laws, adoption rights, and the ability to change legal gender were progressively strengthened, contributing to high levels of public support for LGBTQ+ equality. In the mid-2010s, however,  also saw the rise of [[Anti-gender movement in |anti-gender mobilizations]], which gender studies scholars situate within a broader process of [[democratic backsliding]].

=== Indigenous prehistory ===
{{Main|Prehistory of |Indigenous }}

[[File:Bradshaw rock paintings.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|[[Aboriginal rock art]] in the [[Kimberley (Western )|Kimberley]] region of Western ]]

[[Indigenous ]] comprise two broad groups:
* [[Aboriginal ]], who are the various [[Indigenous peoples]] of the  mainland and many of its islands, including [[Aboriginal Tasmanians|Tasmania]]
* [[Torres Strait Islanders]], who are a distinct [[Melanesia]]n people of [[Torres Strait Islands]]

Human habitation of the  continent is estimated to have begun 50,000 to 65,000 years ago, with the migration of people by [[land bridge]]s and short sea crossings from what is now Southeast Asia. It is uncertain how many waves of immigration may have contributed to these ancestors of modern Aboriginal . The [[Madjedbebe]] rock shelter in [[Arnhem Land]] is possibly the oldest site showing the presence of humans in . The oldest human remains found are the [[Lake Mungo remains]], which have been dated to around 42,000 years ago.

Aboriginal  culture is one of the oldest continuous cultures on Earth. At the time of first European contact, Aboriginal  belonged to wide range of societies, with diverse economies spread across at least [[ Aboriginal languages|250 different language groups]]. Estimates of the Aboriginal population before  settlement range from 300,000 to 3 million. Aboriginal  cultures were (and remain) deeply connected with the land and the environment, with stories of [[The Dreaming]] maintained through [[oral tradition]], [[Songline|songs]], dance and paintings. Certain groups engaged in [[fire-stick farming]], [[fish farming]], and built [[Indigenous architecture#|semi-permanent shelters]]. These practices have variously been characterised as "[[hunter-gatherer]]", "[[Agriculture|agricultural]]", "natural cultivation" and "intensification".

Torres Strait Islander people first settled their islands at least 2,500 years ago. Culturally and linguistically distinct from mainland Aboriginal peoples, they were seafarers and obtained their livelihood from seasonal horticulture and the resources of their reefs and seas. Agriculture also developed on some islands and villages appeared by the 1300s. By the mid-18th century in northern , [[Makassan contact with |contact, trade and cross-cultural engagement]] had been established between local Aboriginal groups and [[Makassar people|Makassan]] [[trepanging|trepangers]], visiting from present-day .

===European exploration and colonisation===
{{Main|European maritime exploration of |European land exploration of |History of  (1788–1850)}}

[[File:Landing of Lieutenant James Cook at Botany Bay, 29 April 1770 (painting by E Phillips Fox).jpg|alt=Landing of Lieutenant James Cook at Botany Bay, 29 April 1770|left|thumb|Landing of [[James Cook]] at [[Botany Bay]] on 29 April 1770]]
The [[ East  Company]] ship, ''[[Duyfken]]'', captained by [[Willem Janszoon]], made the first documented European landing in  in 1606. Later that year, [[Luís Vaz de Torres]] sailed to the north of  through [[Torres Strait]], along New 's southern coast. [[Abel Tasman]]'s voyage of 1642 was the first known European expedition to reach [[Van Diemen's Land]]. On his second voyage of 1644, he mapped the north coast of  south of New . Following Tasman's voyages, the  were able to make almost complete maps of 's northern and western coasts and much of its southern and south-eastern Tasmanian coasts. They named the continent [[New Holland ()|New Holland]]''.''

In 1770, Captain [[James Cook]] sailed along and mapped the east coast, which he named "[[New South Wales]]" and claimed for Great Britain. in 1786, the  government announced its intention to establish a [[penal colony]] in New South Wales. On 26 January 1788, the [[First Fleet]] commanded by Captain [[Arthur Phillip]], arrived at [[Sydney Cove]], Port Jackson. A camp was established and the [[Union Jack|Union Flag]] raised. The date later became [[ Day|'s national day]].

Most early settlers were [[convicts in |convicts]], [[penal transportation|transported]] for petty crimes and [[convict assignment|assigned]] as labourers or servants to "free settlers" (willing immigrants). Once [[emancipist|emancipated]], convicts tended to integrate into colonial society. Aboriginal resistance, convict rebellions and [[Bushranger|bushranging]] were sometimes suppressed under martial law. The 1808 [[Rum Rebellion]], carried out by officers of the [[New South Wales Corps|New South Wales Corp]], led to a temporary [[military junta]]. During the next two decades, social and economic reforms, together with the establishment of a [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] and [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Supreme Court]], saw the penal colony transition to a civil society.

<!-- Please take note of talk page discussion (archive 21, Colonial expansion, treaties and land rights) before editing -->The indigenous population declined for 150 years following European settlement, mainly due to infectious disease.  colonial authorities did not sign any treaties with [[Aboriginal #Groups and sub-groups|Aboriginal groups]]. As settlement expanded, tens of thousands of Indigenous people and thousands of settlers were killed in [[ frontier wars|frontier conflicts]], which many historians argue included acts of [[Genocide of Indigenous |genocide]] by settlers. Settlers dispossessed surviving Indigenous peoples of most of their land.

Forested land rises gently to a peak several kilometres back from the shore.|Tasmania's [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] penal settlement is one of eleven UNESCO World Heritage-listed [[ Convict Sites]].]]

In 1803, a settlement was established in [[Van Diemen's Land]] (present-day [[Tasmania]]), and in 1813, [[Gregory Blaxland]], [[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]] and [[William Wentworth]] [[1813 crossing of the Blue Mountains|crossed the Blue Mountains]] west of Sydney, opening the interior to European settlement. The  claim was extended to the whole  continent in 1827 when Major [[Edmund Lockyer]] established a settlement on [[King George Sound]] (modern-day [[Albany, Western |Albany]]). The [[Swan River Colony]] (present-day [[Perth]]) was established in 1829, evolving into the largest  colony by area, [[History of Western |Western ]]. Separate colonies were carved from New South Wales: Tasmania in 1825, [[ colonisation of South |South ]] in 1836, [[Colony of Victoria|Victoria]] in 1851, and [[Colony of Queensland|Queensland]] in 1859. South  and Victoria were founded as free colonies—they never accepted transported convicts. Growing [[Australasian Anti-Transportation League|opposition to the convict system]] culminated in its abolition in the eastern colonies by the 1850s. Initially a free colony, Western  accepted convicts from 1850 to 1868.

The six colonies individually gained [[responsible government]] between 1855 and 1890, managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the [[ Empire]]. The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs. The colonial parliaments progressively extended voting rights to adult men from 1856, with [[women's suffrage]] on equal terms following between the 1890s and 1900s. Some colonies introduced racial restrictions on voting from 1885.

In the mid-19th century, explorers such as [[Burke and Wills expedition|Burke and Wills]] charted 's interior. A [[ gold rushes|series of gold rushes]] beginning in the early 1850s led to an influx of new migrants from [[ |]], North America and continental Europe, as well as outbreaks of [[bushranger|bushranging]] and civil unrest; the latter peaked in 1854 when [[Ballarat]] miners launched the [[Eureka Rebellion]] against gold licence fees. The 1860s saw the rise of [[blackbirding]], where [[South Sea Islanders]] were coerced or abducted into [[indentured labour]], mainly by Queensland colonists.

From 1886,  colonial governments began [[Stolen Generations|removing many Aboriginal children]] from their families and communities, justified on the grounds of child protection and [[forced assimilation]] policies. The [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902) marked the largest overseas deployment of [[colonial forces of |'s colonial forces]].

On 1 January 1901, [[Federation of |federation of the colonies]] was achieved after a decade of planning, [[Constitutional Convention ()|constitutional conventions]] and [[1898–1900  constitutional referendums|referendums]], resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of  as a nation under the new [[Constitution of | Constitution]].

From 1901,  was a self-governing [[dominion]] within the  Empire. It was one of the founding members of the [[League of Nations]] in 1920, and the [[Member states of the United Nations|United Nations]] in 1945. The ''[[Statute of Westminster 1931]]'' ended the ability of the UK to legislate for  at the federal level without 's consent.  [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942|adopted it]] in 1942, but it was backdated to 1939 to confirm the validity of legislation passed during World War II.

The [[ Capital Territory]] was formed in 1911 as the location for the future federal capital of [[Canberra]]. While it was being constructed, [[Melbourne]] served as the temporary capital from 1901 to 1927. The [[Northern Territory]] was transferred from the control of South  to the Commonwealth in 1911.  took over the administration of the [[Territory of Papua]] (which had previously been a  colony) in 1905 and of the [[Territory of New ]] (formerly [[ New ]]) in 1920. The two were unified as the [[Territory of Papua and New ]] in 1949 and gained independence from  in 1975.

In 1914,  joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in the First World War, and took part in the fighting on several fronts. Of the 324,000 men who served overseas, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were wounded. Many  regard the defeat of the [[ and  Army Corps]] (ANZAC) at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] in 1915 as the "baptism of fire" that forged the [[Anzac spirit|new nation's identity]]. The [[Landing at Anzac Cove|beginning of the campaign]] is commemorated annually on [[Anzac Day]], a date which rivals [[ Day]] as the nation's most important.

From 1939 to 1945,  joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in fighting the Second World War. 's [[ Defence Force|armed forces]] fought in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]], [[European Theatre of World War II|European]] and [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]] [[List of theaters and campaigns of World War II|theatres]]. The shock of Britain's [[fall of |defeat in ]] in 1942, followed soon after by the [[bombing of Darwin]] and [[Air raids on , 1942–43|other  attacks on  soil]], led to a widespread belief in  that [[Proposed  invasion of  during World War II|a  invasion was imminent]], and a shift from the  to the [[– relations|]] as 's principal ally and security partner.

In the three decades following World War II,  experienced significant increases in living standards, leisure time and suburban development. Governments encouraged a [[Post-war immigration to |large wave of immigration from across Europe]] and called these migrants "[[New ]]". High immigration was justified to  using the slogan "populate or perish," and from the 1960s the [[white  policy]] was gradually relaxed.

Tensions over communist influence in society led to [[1951  Communist Party ban referendum|unsuccessful attempts]] by the [[Menzies Government (1949–1966)|Menzies Government]] to ban the [[Communist Party of ]], and a [[ Labor Party split of 1955|bitter split]] in the [[ Labor Party|Labor Party]] in 1955.

As a result of a [[ referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]], the federal government gained the power to legislate with regard to Aboriginal , and Aboriginal  were fully included in the [[Census in |census]]. [[Aboriginal title|Pre-colonial land interests]] (referred to as [[Native title in |native title]] in ) was recognised in law for the first time when the [[High Court of ]] held in ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]]'' that  was not ''[[terra nullius]]'' ({{Gloss|land belonging to no one}}) at the time of European settlement.

Following the abolition of the last vestiges of the [[White  policy]] in 1973, 's demography and culture transformed as a result of a large and ongoing wave of non-European immigration, mostly from Asia. The late 20th century also saw an increasing focus on foreign policy ties with other [[Asia–Pacific|Asia{{En dash}}Pacific]] nations. The [[ Acts]] of 1986 severed the remaining constitutional ties between  and the  while maintaining the monarch in her independent capacity as [[Queen of ]]. In a [[1999  republic referendum|1999 constitutional referendum]], 55% of voters rejected [[Republicanism in |abolishing the monarchy]] and becoming a republic.

In response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in |COVID-19 pandemic]], from March 2020 [[COVID-19 lockdowns|lockdowns]] and other restrictions on public gatherings and movement across the national and state borders were implemented by the Federal, state and territory governments.

Owing to its location, the present territory of  was a corridor of early human civilization from [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Caribbean]] to the [[Andes]] and [[Amazon basin]]. The oldest archaeological finds are from the Pubenza and El Totumo sites in the Magdalena Valley {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} southwest of Bogotá. These sites date from the [[Paleo-|Paleoindian]] period (18,000–8000&nbsp;BCE). At [[Puerto Hormiga archaeological site|Puerto Hormiga]] and other sites, traces from the [[Archaic Period (Americas)|Archaic Period]] (~8000–2000&nbsp;BCE) have been found. Vestiges indicate that there was also early occupation in the regions of [[El Abra]] and [[Tequendama]] in [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]]. The oldest pottery discovered in the Americas, found in [[San Jacinto, Bolívar|San Jacinto]], dates to 5000–4000&nbsp;BCE.

Indigenous people inhabited the territory that is now  by 12,500&nbsp;BCE. Nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]] tribes at the El Abra, [[Tibitó]] and Tequendama sites near present-day [[Bogotá]] traded with one another and with other cultures from the [[Magdalena River]] Valley. A site including {{Convert|8|mi|0|spell=in|sp=us}} of [[Pictogram|pictographs]] that is under study at Serranía de la Lindosa was revealed in November 2020. Their age is suggested as being 12,500 years old (c. 10,480 B.C.) by the anthropologists working on the site, because of extinct fauna depicted. It was during the earliest known human occupation of the area.

Between 5000 and 1000&nbsp;BCE, hunter-gatherer tribes transitioned to agrarian societies; fixed settlements were established, and pottery appeared. Beginning in the 1st millennium BCE, groups of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] including the [[Muisca]], [[Zenú]], [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya]], and [[Tairona]] developed the political system of ''[[cacicazgo]]s'' with a pyramidal structure of power headed by ''caciques''. The Muisca inhabited mainly the area of what is now the [[Departments of |Departments]] of [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] and [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] high plateau (''[[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]]'') where they formed the [[Muisca Confederation]]. They farmed maize, potato, quinoa, and cotton, and traded gold, [[ emeralds|emeralds]], blankets, ceramic handicrafts, coca and especially [[Halite|rock salt]] with neighboring nations. The Tairona inhabited northern  in the isolated mountain range of [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]]. The Quimbaya inhabited regions of the [[Cauca River]] Valley between the [[Cordillera Occidental ()|Western]] and [[Cordillera Central ()|Central]] Ranges of the  Andes. Most of the Amerindians practiced agriculture and the social structure of each indigenous community was different. Some groups of indigenous people such as the Caribs lived in a state of permanent war, but others had less bellicose attitudes. During the 1200s, [[Austronesian expansion|Malayo-Polynesian]]s and [[Indigenous peoples in |Native ]] in  made contact, thereby spreading Native  genetics from Precolonial  to some Pacific Ocean islands.

[[Alonso de Ojeda]] (who had sailed with Columbus) reached the [[Guajira Peninsula]] in 1499.  explorers, led by [[Rodrigo de Bastidas]], made the first exploration of the [[Caribbean Basin|Caribbean coast]] in 1500. [[Christopher Columbus]] navigated near the Caribbean in 1502. In 1508, [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] accompanied an expedition to the territory through the region of [[Gulf of Urabá]] and they founded the town of [[Santa María la Antigua del Darién]] in 1510, the first stable settlement on the continent.{{efn|Balboa is best known for being the first European to see the Pacific Ocean in 1513, which he called ''Mar del Sur'' (or "Sea of the South") and would facilitate  exploration and settlement of South America.}} [[Santa Marta]] was founded in 1525, and [[Cartagena, |Cartagena]] in 1533.  [[conquistador]] [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] led an expedition to the interior in April 1536, and christened the districts through which he passed "[[New Kingdom of Granada]]". In August 1538, he provisionally founded its capital near the Muisca [[cacicazgo]] of [[Bacatá|Muyquytá]], and named it "Santa Fe". The name soon acquired a suffix and was called Santa Fe de Bogotá. Two other notable journeys by early conquistadors to the interior took place in the same period. [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]], conqueror of [[Quito]], traveled north and founded [[Cali]], in 1536, and [[Popayán]], in 1537; from 1536 to 1539,  conquistador [[Nikolaus Federmann]] crossed the [[Orinoquía natural region|Llanos Orientales]] and went over the [[Cordillera Oriental ()|Cordillera Oriental]] in a search for [[El Dorado]], the "city of gold". The legend and the gold would play a pivotal role in luring the  and other Europeans to New Granada during the 16th and 17th centuries.

The [[List of conquistadors in |conquistadors]] made frequent alliances with the enemies of different indigenous communities. [[ auxiliaries|Indigenous allies]] were crucial to conquest, as well as to creating and maintaining empire. Indigenous peoples in  experienced a decline in population due to conquest as well as Eurasian diseases, such as [[smallpox]], to which they had no immunity. Regarding the land as deserted, the  Crown sold properties to all persons interested in colonized territories, creating large farms and possession of mines. In the 16th century, the [[Navigation|nautical science]] in  reached a great development thanks to numerous scientific figures of the [[Casa de Contratación]] and nautical science was an essential pillar of the [[Iberian ship development, 1400–1600|Iberian expansion]]. In 1542, the region of New Granada, along with all other  possessions in South America, became part of the [[Viceroyalty of ]], with its capital in [[Lima]]. In 1547, New Granada became a separate captaincy-general within the viceroyalty, with its capital at Santa Fe de Bogota. In 1549, the [[Real Audiencia|Royal Audiencia]] was created by a royal decree, and New Granada was ruled by the [[Royal Audience of Santa Fe de Bogotá]], which at that time comprised the provinces of Santa Marta, Rio de San Juan, Popayán, Guayana and Cartagena.

The [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] was established in 1717, then temporarily removed, and then re-established in 1739. Its capital was Santa Fé de Bogotá. This Viceroyalty included some other provinces of northwestern South America that had previously been under the jurisdiction of the [[New |Viceroyalties of New ]] or [[Viceroyalty of |]] and correspond mainly to today's , , and .

Started in 1783, this became known as the [[Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada]]. It classified plants and wildlife, and founded the first astronomical observatory in the city of Santa Fe de Bogotá. In July 1801 the Prussian scientist [[Alexander von Humboldt]] reached Santa Fe de Bogotá where he met with Mutis. In addition, historical figures in the process of independence in New Granada emerged from the expedition as the astronomer [[Francisco José de Caldas]], the scientist [[Francisco Antonio Zea]], the zoologist [[Jorge Tadeo Lozano]] and the painter [[Salvador Rizo]].

Rebellions against  rule had occurred in the empire since the advent of conquest and colonization, but most were either crushed or remained too weak to change the overall situation. The last one that sought outright independence from  sprang up around 1810 and culminated in the  Declaration of Independence, issued on 20 July 1810, the day that is now celebrated as the nation's Independence Day. This movement followed the independence of [[-Domingue]] (present-day ) in 1804, which provided some support to an eventual leader of this rebellion: [[Simón Bolívar]]. [[Francisco de Paula Santander]] also would play a decisive role.

A movement was initiated by [[Antonio Nariño]], who opposed  centralism and led the opposition against the [[Viceroyalty]]. [[Cartagena, |Cartagena]] became independent in November 1811. In 1811, the [[United Provinces of New Granada]] were proclaimed, headed by [[Camilo Torres Tenorio]]. The emergence of two distinct ideological currents among the patriots ([[federalism]] and [[Unitary state|centralism]]) gave rise to a period of instability called the [[Patria Boba]]. Shortly after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] ended, [[Ferdinand VII]], recently restored to the throne in , unexpectedly decided [[ reconquest of New Granada|to send military forces]] to retake most of northern South America. The viceroyalty was restored under the command of [[Juan de Sámano]], whose regime punished those who participated in the patriotic movements, ignoring the political nuances of the [[Junta (  Independence)|junta]]s. The retribution stoked renewed rebellion, which, combined with a weakened , made possible a successful rebellion led by the -born [[Military career of Simón Bolívar|Simón Bolívar]], who finally proclaimed [[  wars of independence|independence]] in 1819. The [[Royalist (  Independence)|pro- resistance]] was defeated in 1822 in the present territory of  and in 1823 in . During the Independence War, between 250 and 400 thousand people (12–20% of the pre-war population) died.

The territory of the Viceroyalty of New Granada became the [[Gran |Republic of ]], organized as a [[subdivisions of Gran |union of the current territories]] of , , , , parts of  and  and north of [[Marañón River]]. The [[Congress of Cúcuta]] in 1821 adopted a [[ Constitution of 1821|constitution]] for the new Republic. Simón Bolívar became the first [[President of ]], and Francisco de Paula Santander was made [[Vice President of |Vice President]]. However, the new republic was unstable and the Gran  ultimately collapsed.

Internal political and territorial divisions led to the dissolution of [[Gran ]] in 1830. The so-called "[[Cundinamarca Province|Department of Cundinamarca]]" adopted the name "[[Republic of the New Granada|New Granada]]", which it kept until 1858 when it became the "Confederación Granadina" ([[Granadine Confederation]]). After a [[ Civil War (1860–1862)|two-year civil war]] in 1863, the [[ of ]] was created, which became known as the Republic of  in 1886. Internal divisions remained between the bipartisan political forces, occasionally igniting very bloody civil wars, the most significant being the [[Thousand Days' War]] (1899–1902), in which between 100 and 180 thousand  lost their lives when the [[ Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], supported by [[ of |]], [[History of  (1895–1925)|]], [[]], and [[]] rebelled against the [[ Conservative Party|Nationalist government]] and took control of [[Santander State|Santander]], ultimately being defeated in 1902 by nationalist forces.

Its cause was mainly mounting tensions between the two leading political parties, which subsequently ignited after the assassination of the Liberal presidential candidate [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]] on 9 April 1948. The ensuing riots in Bogotá, known as [[El Bogotazo]], spread throughout the country and claimed the lives of at least 180,000 .

After Rojas' deposition, the  Conservative Party and the  Liberal Party agreed to create the [[National Front ()|National Front]], a coalition that would jointly govern the country. Under the deal, the presidency would alternate between conservatives and liberals every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices. The National Front ended "La Violencia", and National Front administrations attempted to institute far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the [[Alliance for Progress]]. Despite the progress in certain sectors, many social and political problems continued, and guerrilla groups were formally created such as the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of |FARC]], the [[National Liberation Army ()|ELN]] and the [[19th of April Movement|M-19]] to fight the government and political apparatus.

's history goes back to numerous [[List of ancient peoples of |Italic peoples]] – notably including the [[ancient Romans]], who conquered the Mediterranean world during the [[Roman Republic]] and ruled it for centuries during the [[Roman Empire]].

Ancient Rome, a settlement on the [[River Tiber]] in central , [[Founding of Rome|founded]] in 753 BC, was ruled for 244 years by a monarchical system. In 509 BC, the Romans, favouring a government of the Senate and the People ([[SPQR]]), [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|expelled the monarchy]] and established an oligarchic republic.

The  Peninsula, named ''Italia'', was consolidated into a unified entity during Roman expansion, the conquest of new territories often at the expense of the [[Samnite Wars|other Italic tribes]], [[Roman–Etruscan Wars|Etruscans]], [[Roman–Gallic wars|Celts]], and [[Pyrrhic War|]]. A permanent association, with most of the local tribes and cities, was formed, and Rome began the conquest of Western Europe, North Africa, and the [[History of the Middle East# and Roman Empire|Middle East]]. In the wake of [[Julius Caesar]]'s assassination in 44 BC, Rome grew into a massive empire stretching from [[Roman Britain|Britain]] to the borders of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Persia]], engulfing the whole Mediterranean basin, in which , Roman, and other cultures merged into a powerful civilisation. The long reign of the first emperor, [[Augustus]], began an age of peace and prosperity. Roman  remained the [[metropole]] of the empire, homeland of the Romans and territory of the capital. 

The [[History of the Roman Empire|first two centuries of the empire]] saw a period of unprecedented stability known as the [[Pax Romana]] ({{Literal translation|Roman Peace}}). Rome reached its [[Borders of the Roman Empire|greatest territorial extent]] under [[Trajan]] ({{Reign|98|117|era=AD}}), but a period of increasing trouble and decline began under [[Commodus]] ({{Reign|180|192}}). The [[Migration Period]], involving [[Germanic–Roman contacts|large invasions by Germanic peoples]], led to the decline of the Roman Empire.

The Roman Empire was among the largest in history, wielding great economical, cultural, political, and military power. At its greatest extent, it had an area of {{Convert|5|e6km2|abbr=off}}. The [[Legacy of the Roman Empire|Roman legacy]] has deeply influenced Western civilisation shaping the modern world. The widespread use of [[Romance languages]] derived from Latin, [[Roman numerals|numerical system]], modern Western alphabet and calendar, and the emergence of Christianity as a world religion, are among the many legacies of Roman dominance.

After the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]],  fell under the [[Kingdom of  (476–493)|Odoacer's kingdom]], and was seized by the [[Ostrogoths]]. Invasions resulted in a chaotic succession of kingdoms and the supposed "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]". The invasion of another [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] in the 6th century, the [[Lombards]], reduced Byzantine presence and ended political unity of the peninsula. The north formed the [[Lombard kingdom]], central-south was also controlled by the Lombards, and other parts remained Byzantine.
[[File:Marco Polo Mosaic from Palazzo Tursi.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.7|[[Marco Polo]], 13th-century explorer]]

The Lombard kingdom was absorbed into [[Francia]] by [[Charlemagne]] in the late 8th century and became the Kingdom of . The Franks helped form the [[Papal States]]. Until the 13th century, politics was dominated by relations between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s and the Papacy, with city-states siding with the former ([[Ghibellines]]) or with the latter ([[Guelphs]]) for momentary advantage. The Germanic emperor and Roman pontiff became the [[universal power]]s of medieval Europe. However, conflict over the [[Investiture Controversy]] and between Guelphs and Ghibellines ended the imperial-feudal system in the north, where cities gained independence. In 1176, the [[Lombard League]] of city-states defeated Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]], ensuring their independence.

City-states – e.g. [[Milan]], [[Florence]], [[Venice]] – played a crucially innovative role in financial development by devising banking practices, and enabling new forms of social organisation. In coastal and southern areas, maritime republics dominated the Mediterranean and monopolised trade to the Orient. They were independent [[thalassocratic]] city-states, in which merchants had considerable power. Although oligarchical, the relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement. The best-known maritime republics were Venice, [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]], and [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]]. Each had dominion over overseas lands, islands, lands on the Adriatic, Aegean, and Black seas, and commercial colonies in the Near East and North Africa.

Venice and Genoa were Europe's gateways to the East, and producers of fine glass, while Florence was a centre of silk, wool, banking, and jewellery.

In the south, Sicily had become an [[Emirate of Sicily|Arab Islamic emirate]] in the 9th century, thriving until the [[Italo-Normans]] conquered it in the late 11th century, together with most of the Lombard and Byzantine principalities of southern .

During the 1400s and 1500s,  was the birthplace and heart of the [[Renaissance]]. This era marked the transition from the medieval period to the modern age and was fostered by the wealth accumulated by merchant cities and the patronage of dominant families.  polities were now regional states effectively ruled by princes, in control of trade and administration, and their courts became centres of the arts and sciences. These princedoms were led by political dynasties and merchant families, such as the [[Medici]] of Florence. After the end of the [[Western Schism]], newly elected [[Pope Martin V]] returned to the [[Papal States]] and restored  as the sole centre of Western Christianity. The [[Medici Bank]] was made the credit institution of the Papacy, and significant ties were established between the Church and new political dynasties.

In 1453, despite activity by [[Pope Nicholas V]] to support the Byzantines, the city of [[Constantinople]] fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. This led to the migration of [[ scholars in the Renaissance| scholars]] and texts to , fuelling the rediscovery of  [[humanism]]. Humanist rulers such as [[Federico da Montefeltro]] and [[Pope Pius II]] worked to establish [[ideal city|ideal cities]], founding [[Urbino]] and [[Pienza]]. [[Pico della Mirandola]] wrote the ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'', considered the manifesto of the Renaissance. In the arts, the  Renaissance exercised a dominant influence on European art for centuries, with artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Botticelli]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Giotto]], [[Donatello]], and [[Titian]], and architects such as [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Andrea Palladio]], and [[Donato Bramante]].  [[List of  explorers|explorers]] and navigators from the maritime republics, eager to find an alternative route to the Indies to bypass the Ottomans, offered their services to monarchs of Atlantic countries and played a key role in ushering the [[Age of Discovery]] and colonisation of the Americas. The most notable were: [[Christopher Columbus]], who opened the Americas for conquest by Europeans; [[John Cabot]], the first European to explore North America since the [[Norsemen|Norse]]; and [[Amerigo Vespucci]], for whom the continent of [[Naming of the Americas|America]] is named.

A defensive alliance known as the [[Italic League]] was formed between Venice, Naples, Florence, Milan, and the Papacy. [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo ''the Magnificent'' de Medici]] was the Renaissance's greatest patron, his support allowed the League to [[Siege of Otranto|abort invasion]] by the Turks. The alliance, however, collapsed in the 1490s; the invasion of [[Charles VIII of ]] initiated a series of wars in the peninsula. During the [[High Renaissance]], popes such as [[Julius II]] (1503–1513) fought for control of  against foreign monarchs; [[Paul III]] (1534–1549) preferred to mediate between the European powers to secure peace. In the middle of such conflicts, the Medici popes [[Leo X]] (1513–1521) and [[Clement VII]] (1523–1534) faced the [[Protestant Reformation]] in , England and elsewhere.

In 1559, at the end of the [[ wars]] between  and the Habsburgs, about half of  (the southern Kingdoms of [[kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], and the [[Duchy of Milan]]) was under  rule, while the other half remained independent (many states continued to be formally part of the Holy Roman Empire). The Papacy launched the [[Counter-Reformation]], whose key events include: the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563); adoption of the [[Gregorian calendar]]; the [[Jesuit  mission]]; the [[ Wars of Religion]]; end of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648); and the [[Great  War]]. The  economy declined in the 1600s and 1700s.

During the [[War of the  Succession]] (1700–1714),  acquired most of the  domains in , namely Milan, Naples and Sardinia; the latter was given to the House of Savoy in exchange for Sicily in 1720. Later, a branch of the Bourbons ascended to the throne of Sicily and Naples. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], north and central  were reorganised as [[Sister Republics]] of  and, later, as a [[Kingdom of  (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of ]]. The south was administered by [[Joachim Murat]], Napoleon's brother-in-law. 1814's [[Congress of Vienna]] restored the situation of the late 18th century, but the ideals of the [[ Revolution]] could not be eradicated, and re-surfaced during the [[political upheaval]]s that characterised the early 19th century. The first adoption of the [[ tricolour]] by an  state, the [[Cispadane Republic]], occurred during [[Flags of Napoleonic |Napoleonic ]], following the  Revolution, which advocated national [[self-determination]]. This event is celebrated by [[Tricolour Day]].

=== Unification ===
{{Main|Unification of }}
The [[birth of the Kingdom of ]] was the result of efforts of  nationalists and monarchists loyal to the [[House of Savoy]] to establish a  encompassing the entire [[ Peninsula]]. By the mid-19th century, rising [[ nationalism]] led to revolution. Following the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, the political and social  unification movement, or [[Risorgimento]], emerged to unite  by consolidating the states and liberating them from foreign control. A radical figure was the patriotic journalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], founder of the political movement [[Young ]] in the 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement. 1847 saw the first public performance of "[[Il Canto degli Italiani]]", which became the national anthem in 1946.

The most famous member of Young  was the revolutionary and general [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] who led the republican drive for unification in southern . However, the  monarchy of the House of Savoy, in the [[Kingdom of Sardinia (1720–1861)|Kingdom of Sardinia]], whose government was led by [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]], also had ambitions of establishing a united  state. In the context of the [[1848 liberal revolutions]] that swept Europe, an unsuccessful [[First  War of Independence]] was declared against [[-|]]. In 1855, Sardinia became an ally of Britain and  in the [[Crimean War]]. Sardinia fought the  Empire in the [[Second  War of Independence]] of 1859, with the aid of , resulting in liberating [[Lombardy]]. On the basis of the [[Plombières Agreement]], the Sardinia ceded [[Savoy]] and [[Nice]] to , an event that caused the [[Niçard exodus]].

In 1860–1861, Garibaldi led the drive for unification in Naples and Sicily. [[Teano]] was the site of a famous meeting between Garibaldi and [[Victor Emmanuel II]], the last king of Sardinia, during which Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel's hand and hailed him as [[King of ]]. Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's southern  in a union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. This allowed the Sardinian government to [[Proclamation of the Kingdom of |declare a united  kingdom]] on 17 March 1861, with Victor Emmanuel II as its first king. In 1865, the kingdom's capital was moved from Turin to Florence. In 1866, Victor Emmanuel II, allied with [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War]], waged the [[Third  War of Independence]], which resulted in  annexing [[Veneto|Venetia]].

Sardinia's constitution was extended to all of  in 1861, and provided basic freedoms for the new state; but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied classes. The new kingdom was governed by a parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberals. As northern  quickly industrialised, southern and northern rural areas remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions to migrate and fuelling [[ diaspora|a large and influential diaspora]]. The [[ Socialist Party]] increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment. In the last two decades of the 19th century,  developed into [[ Empire|a colonial power]] by subjugating [[ |]], [[ |]], [[ Tripolitania|Tripolitania]], and [[ Cyrenaica|Cyrenaica]] in Africa. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. The pre-[[World War I]] period was dominated by [[Giovanni Giolitti]], prime minister five times between 1892 and 1921.

[[ entry into World War I| entered into the First World War]] in 1915 with the aim of completing national unity, so it is also considered the Fourth  War of Independence, from a historiographical perspective, as the conclusion of the [[unification of ]]. , nominally allied with the [[ Empire|]] and [[Austro-]] empires in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], in 1915 joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], entering World War I with a [[Treaty of London (1915)|promise]] of substantial territorial gains that included west [[Inner Carniola]], the former [[ Littoral]], and [[Dalmatia]], as well as parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The country's contribution to the Allied victory earned it a place as one of the "[[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]]" powers. Reorganisation of the army and conscription led to  victories. In October 1918, the  launched a massive offensive, culminating in victory at the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]]. This marked the end of war on the  Front, secured dissolution of the Austro- Empire, and was instrumental in [[Armistice with |ending]] the war less than two weeks later.

During the war, more than 650,000  soldiers and as many civilians died, and the kingdom was on the brink of bankruptcy. The [[Treaty of -Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of -Germain-en-Laye]] (1919) and [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] (1920) allowed for annexation of [[Trentino Alto-Adige]], the [[Julian March]], [[Istria]], the [[Kvarner Gulf]], and the Dalmatian city of [[Zadar|Zara]].

=== Fascist regime and World War II ===

[[File:Mussolini mezzobusto.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|left|The fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] titled himself ''[[Duce]]'' and ruled the country from 1922 until [[Fall of the Fascist regime in |his overthrow]] in 1943.]]

The [[Biennio Rosso|socialist agitations]] that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the [[ Revolution]], led to counter-revolution and repression throughout . The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small [[National Fascist Party]], led by Mussolini. In October 1922, the [[Blackshirts]] of the National Fascist Party organised a [[mass demonstration]] and the "[[March on Rome]]" [[coup]]. King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] appointed Mussolini as [[Prime Minister of |prime minister]], transferring power to the fascists without armed conflict. 
Mussolini banned political parties and curtailed personal liberties, establishing a dictatorship. These actions attracted international attention and inspired similar dictatorships in [[Nazi ]] and [[Francoist ]].

[[Fascism]] was based upon  nationalism and imperialism, seeking to expand  possessions via [[Irredentism|irredentist claims]] based on the legacy of the Roman and [[Venetian empire]]s. 
For this reason the fascists engaged in [[interventionist foreign policy]]. In 1935, Mussolini [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded ]] and founded [[ East Africa]], resulting in international isolation.  withdrew from the [[League of Nations]].  then [[Pact of Steel|allied with Nazi ]] and the [[Tripartite Pact|Empire of ]], and strongly supported [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[ Civil War]]. In April 1939,  [[ invasion of |invaded ]].

 entered World War II on 10 June 1940. At this date,  practically had lost the [[Battle of ]].
At different times,  advanced in [[ conquest of  Somaliland| Somaliland]], [[ invasion of |]], the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]], and eastern fronts. They were, however, [[ participation on the Eastern Front|defeated on the Eastern Front]] as well as in the [[East African campaign (World War II)|East African]] and [[North African campaign|North African]] campaigns, losing their territories in Africa and the Balkans. [[ war crimes]] included [[extrajudicial killing]]s and [[ethnic cleansing]] by deportation of about 25,000 people – mainly Yugoslavs – to [[ concentration camps]] and elsewhere. [[Yugoslav Partisans]] perpetrated their own crimes against the ethnic  population during and after the war, including the [[foibe massacres]]. An [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] began in July 1943, leading to the [[Fall of the Fascist regime in |collapse of the Fascist regime]] on 25 July. Mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of King [[Victor Emmanuel III]]. On 3 September,  signed the [[Armistice of Cassibile]],<!-- it became effective on 8 Sept---> ending its war with UK and USA. The , with the assistance of  fascists, succeeded in taking control of north and central  ([[Operation Achse]]). The country remained a battlefield, with the Allies moving up from the south.
[[File:01 partigiani a milano1.jpg|thumb|[[ resistance movement| partisans]] in Milan during the final insurrection leading to the [[liberation of ]] in April 1945]]

In the north, the  set up the [[ Social Republic]] (RSI), a Nazi [[puppet state]] and [[collaborationist]] regime with Mussolini installed as leader after he was [[Gran Sasso raid|rescued]] by  paratroopers. What remained of the  troops was organised into the [[ Co-belligerent Army]], which fought alongside the Allies, while other  forces, loyal to Mussolini, opted to fight alongside the  in the [[National Republican Army]].  troops, with RSI collaboration, committed massacres and deported thousands of Jews to death camps. The post-armistice period saw the emergence of the [[ Resistance]], who fought a guerrilla war against the [[Operation Achse|Nazi  occupiers]] and collaborators. 
An aspect of this period was the [[ civil war]] due to fighting between partisans and fascist RSI forces. In April 1945, with defeat looming, Mussolini attempted to escape north, but was captured and [[Death of Benito Mussolini|summarily executed]] by partisans.

Hostilities ended on 29 April 1945, [[Surrender of Caserta|when the  forces in  surrendered]]. Nearly half a million  died in the war, society was divided, and the economy all but destroyed – per capita income in 1944 was at its lowest point since 1900. 
In the aftermath of the war there was a revival of  republicanism, leading to the [[1946  institutional referendum]].

=== Republican era ===
{{Main|History of the  Republic}}
 became a republic after the 1946 referendum held on 2 June, a day celebrated since as ''[[Festa della Repubblica]]''. This was the first time women voted nationally. Victor Emmanuel III's son, [[Umberto II]], was forced to abdicate. The [[Constitution of |Republican Constitution]] was approved in 1948. Under the [[Treaty of Paris between  and the Allied Powers]], areas next to the [[Adriatic Sea]] were annexed by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], resulting in the [[Istrian-Dalmatian exodus]], which involved the emigration of around 300,000 [[Istrian |Istrian]] and [[Dalmatian ]].  lost all colonial possessions, ending the [[ Empire]].

Fears of a Communist takeover proved crucial in [[ general election, 1948|1948]], when the [[Christian Democracy ()|Christian Democrats]], under [[Alcide De Gasperi]], won a landslide victory. Consequently, in 1949  became a member of [[NATO]]. The [[Marshall Plan]] revived the economy, which, until the late 1960s, enjoyed a period called the [[ economic miracle]]. In the 1950s,  became a founding country of the [[European Communities]], a forerunner of the European Union. From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, the country experienced the ''[[Years of Lead ()|Years of Lead]]'', characterised by economic difficulties, especially after the [[1973 oil crisis]]; social conflicts; and terrorist massacres.

The economy recovered and  became the world's fifth-largest industrial nation after it gained entry into the [[G7]] in the 1970s. However, national debt skyrocketed past 100% of GDP. Between 1992 and 1993,  faced terror attacks perpetrated by the [[Sicilian Mafia]] as a consequence of new anti-mafia measures by the government. Voters – disenchanted with political paralysis, massive public debt and extensive corruption uncovered by the [[Mani pulite|Clean Hands]] investigation – demanded radical reform. The Christian Democrats, who had ruled for almost 50 years, underwent a crisis and disbanded, splitting into factions. The Communists reorganised as a [[social-democratic]] force. During the 1990s and 2000s, [[Centre-right coalition ()|centre-right]] (dominated by media magnate [[Silvio Berlusconi]]) and [[Centre-left coalition ()|centre-left]] coalitions (led by professor [[Romano Prodi]]) alternately governed.

In 2011, amidst the [[Great Recession]], Berlusconi [[Resignation of Silvio Berlusconi|resigned]] and was replaced by the technocratic cabinet of [[Mario Monti]]. In 2014, [[Matteo Renzi]] became [[Prime Minister of |prime minister]] and the government started constitutional reform. This was rejected in a 2016 [[ constitutional referendum, 2016|referendum]] and [[Paolo Gentiloni]] became prime minister.

During the [[European migrant crisis]] of the 2010s,  was the entry point and leading destination for most asylum seekers entering the EU. Between 2013 and 2018, it took in over 700,000 migrants, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, which put a strain on the public purse and led to a surge in support for far-right or euro-sceptic parties. After the [[ general election, 2018|2018 general election]], [[Giuseppe Conte]] became prime minister of [[Government of Change|a populist coalition]].

With almost 200,000 victims,  was one of the countries with the most deaths in the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] and one of the most [[Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic|affected economically]]. In February 2021, after [[2021  government crisis|a government crisis]], Conte resigned. [[Mario Draghi]], former president of the [[European Central Bank]], formed a [[Draghi Cabinet|national unity government]] supported by most main parties, pledging to implement an economic stimulus to face the crisis caused by the pandemic. In 2022, [[Giorgia Meloni]] was sworn in as 's first female prime minister.

=== Prehistory ===
[[File:National Museum of  2014.02.01 14-43-38.jpg|thumb|10,000-year-old pottery, [[Xianren Cave]] culture (18000–7000 BCE)]]

[[Archaeological excavation|Archaeological evidence]] suggests that early [[Hominidae|hominids]] inhabited  2.25 million years ago. The hominid fossils of [[Peking Man]], a ''[[Homo erectus]]'' who [[Control of fire by early humans|used fire]], have been dated to between 680,000 and 780,000 [[Before Present|years ago]]. The fossilized teeth of ''Homo sapiens'' (dated to 125,000–80,000 years ago) have been discovered in [[Fuyan Cave]].  [[proto-writing]] existed in [[Jiahu]] around 6600 BCE, at [[Damaidi]] around 6000 BCE, [[Dadiwan culture|Dadiwan]] from 5800 to 5400 BCE, and [[Banpo]] dating from the 5th millennium BCE. Some scholars have suggested that the [[Jiahu symbols]] (7th millennium BCE) constituted the earliest  writing system.

=== Early dynastic rule ===
{{Further|Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|Xia dynasty|Shang dynasty|Zhou dynasty|Spring and Autumn period|Warring States period}}
[[File:甲骨文发现地 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Yinxu]], the ruins of the capital of the late [[Shang dynasty]] (14th century BCE)]]

According to traditional [[ historiography]], the [[Xia dynasty]] was established during the late 3rd millennium&nbsp;BCE, marking the beginning of the dynastic cycle that was understood to underpin 's entire political history. In the modern era, the Xia's historicity came under increasing scrutiny, in part due to the earliest known attestation of the Xia being written millennia after the date given for their collapse. In 1958, archaeologists discovered sites belonging to the [[Erlitou culture]] that existed during the early [[Bronze Age]]; they have since been characterized as the remains of the historical Xia, but this conception is often rejected. The [[Shang dynasty]] that traditionally succeeded the Xia is the earliest for which there are both contemporary written records and undisputed archaeological evidence. The Shang ruled much of the [[Yellow River]] valley until the 11th century&nbsp;BCE, with the earliest hard evidence dated {{circa|1300&nbsp;BCE}}. The [[oracle bone script]], attested from {{circa|1250&nbsp;BCE|lk=no}} but generally assumed to be considerably older, represents the oldest known form of [[written ]], and is the direct ancestor of modern [[ characters]].

The Shang were overthrown by the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]], who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuries&nbsp;BCE, though the centralized authority of [[Son of Heaven]] was slowly eroded by ''[[fengjian]]'' lords. Some principalities eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou and continually waged war with each other during the 300-year [[Spring and Autumn period]]. By the time of the [[Warring States period]] of the 5th–3rd centuries&nbsp;BCE, there were seven major powerful states left.

=== Imperial  ===
{{further| Empire|History of #Imperial }}

==== Qin and Han ====
[[File:Han Expansion.png|The [[southward expansion of the Han dynasty]] during the 2nd century&nbsp;BCE|thumb|upright=1.1]]

The Warring States period ended in 221&nbsp;BCE after the [[Qin (state)|state of Qin]] conquered the other six states, reunited  and established the dominant order of [[autocracy]]. [[King Zheng of Qin]] proclaimed himself the Emperor of the [[Qin dynasty]], becoming the first emperor of a unified . He enacted Qin's [[Legalism ( philosophy)|legalist]] reforms, notably the standardization of  characters, [[ units of measurement|measurements]], road widths, and [[history of  currency|currency]]. His dynasty also [[Qin campaign against the Baiyue|conquered the Yue tribes]] in [[Guangxi]], [[Guangdong]], and [[Northern ]]. The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after the First Emperor's death.

Following [[Chu–Han Contention|widespread revolts]] during which the imperial library [[List of destroyed libraries#Human action|was burned]],{{efn|Owing to Qin Shi Huang's earlier policy involving the "[[burning of books and burying of scholars]]", the destruction of the confiscated copies at [[Xianyang]] was an event similar to the [[destruction of the Library of Alexandria|destructions]] of the [[Library of Alexandria]] in the west. Even those texts that did survive had to be painstakingly reconstructed from memory, luck, or forgery. The [[Old Texts]] of the [[Five Classics]] were said to have been found hidden in a wall at the Kong residence in [[Qufu]]. [[Mei Ze]]'s "rediscovered" edition of the [[Book of Documents]] was [[Yan Ruoqu|only shown to be a forgery in the Qing dynasty]].}} the [[Han dynasty]] emerged to rule  between 206&nbsp;BCE and 220&nbsp;CE, creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the modern [[Han ]]. The Han [[History of the Han dynasty|expanded the empire's territory considerably]], with military campaigns reaching [[Han–Xiongnu War|Central Asia, ]], [[Han conquest of Gojoseon|]], and [[Han campaigns against Dian|Yunnan]], and the [[Southward expansion of the Han dynasty|recovery of Guangdong and northern ]] from [[Nanyue]]. Han involvement in Central Asia and [[Sogdia]] helped establish the land route of the [[Silk Road]], replacing the earlier path over the [[Himalayas]] to . Han  gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world. Despite the Han's initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the Qin philosophy of Legalism in favor of [[Confucianism]], Qin's legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the Han government and its successors.

==== Three Kingdoms, Jin, Northern and Southern dynasties ====
After the [[end of the Han dynasty]], a period of strife known as [[Three Kingdoms]] followed, at the end of which [[Cao Wei|Wei]] was swiftly overthrown by the [[Jin dynasty (266–420)|Jin dynasty]]. The Jin fell to [[War of the Eight Princes|civil war]] upon the ascension of a [[Emperor Hui of Jin|developmentally disabled emperor]]; the [[Five Barbarians]] then [[Upheaval of the Five Barbarians|rebelled]] and ruled northern  as the [[Sixteen Kingdoms|Sixteen States]]. The [[Xianbei]] unified them as the [[Northern Wei]], whose [[Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaowen]] reversed his predecessors' apartheid policies and [[Northern dynasties|enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects]]. In the south, the general [[Emperor Wu of Liu Song|Liu Yu]] secured the abdication of the Jin in favor of the [[Liu Song]]. The various successors of these states became known as the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]], with the two areas finally reunited by the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] in 581.{{Citation needed|date=June 2024}}

==== Sui, Tang and Song ====
The Sui restored the Han to power through , reformed its agriculture, economy and [[imperial examination]] system, constructed the [[Grand Canal of |Grand Canal]], and patronized [[ Buddhism|Buddhism]]. However, they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a [[Goguryeo–Sui War|failed war]] in [[Goguryeo|northern ]] provoked widespread unrest.
Under the succeeding [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song dynasties]],  economy, technology, and culture entered a golden age. The Tang dynasty retained control of the [[Western Regions]] and the Silk Road, which brought traders to as far as [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Horn of Africa]], and made the capital [[Chang'an]] a cosmopolitan urban center. However, it was devastated and weakened by the [[An Lushan rebellion]] in the 8th century. In 907, the Tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable. The Song dynasty ended the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|separatist situation]] in 960, leading to a balance of power between the Song and the [[Liao dynasty]]. The Song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first  polity to establish a permanent navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade.

Between the 10th and 11th century CE, the population of  doubled to around 100 million people, mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern , and the production of abundant food surpluses. The Song dynasty also saw a [[Neo-Confucianism|revival of Confucianism]], in response to the growth of Buddhism during the Tang, and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts, as [[landscape art]] and [[porcelain]] were brought to new levels of complexity. However, the military weakness of the Song army was observed by the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]]. In 1127, [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Emeritus Huizong]], [[Emperor Qinzong of Song]] and the capital [[Kaifeng|Bianjing]] were captured during the [[Jin–Song wars]]. The remnants of the Song retreated to [[Northern and southern |southern ]] and reestablished [[Southern Song Dynasty|the Song]] at [[Nanjing|Jiankang]].

==== Yuan, Ming and Qing ====
[[File:Badaling  Great-Wall-of--01.jpg|'s first emperor, [[Qin Shi Huang]], is famed for having united the [[Warring States]]' walls to form the [[Great Wall of ]]. Most of the present structure dates to the [[Ming dynasty]].|thumb|upright=1.1]]
The [[Mongol conquest of ]] began in 1205 with the [[Mongol conquest of Western Xia|campaigns]] against [[Western Xia]] by [[Genghis Khan]], who also [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty|invaded Jin territories]]. In 1271, the Mongol leader [[Kublai Khan]] established the [[Yuan dynasty]], which [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|conquered the last remnant of the Song dynasty]] in 1279. Before the Mongol invasion, the population of Song  was 120 million citizens; this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300. A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang [[Red Turban Rebellions|overthrew the Yuan]] in 1368 and founded the [[Ming dynasty]] as the [[Hongwu Emperor]]. Under the Ming dynasty,  enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture. It was during this period that admiral [[Zheng He]] led the [[Ming treasure voyages]] throughout the  Ocean, reaching as far as East Africa.

In the early Ming dynasty, 's capital was moved from [[Nanjing]] to Beijing. With the budding of capitalism, philosophers such as [[Wang Yangming]] critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of [[individualism]] and equality of [[four occupations]]. The [[scholar-official]] stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements, which, together with the famines and defense against [[ invasions of  (1592–1598)]] and [[Later Jin (1616–1636)|Later Jin]] incursions led to an exhausted treasury. In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of [[Late Ming peasant rebellions|peasant rebel]] forces led by [[Li Zicheng]]. The [[Chongzhen Emperor]] committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu [[Qing dynasty]], then allied with Ming dynasty general [[Wu Sangui]], overthrew Li's short-lived [[Shun dynasty]] and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty.

[[File:Qing Empire circa 1820 EN.svg|The [[Qing conquest of the Ming]] and expansion of the empire|thumb|upright=1.1]]
The Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of . The [[Transition from Ming to Qing|Ming-Qing transition]] (1618–1683) cost 25 million lives, but the Qing appeared to have restored 's imperial power and inaugurated another flowering of the arts. After the [[Southern Ming]] ended, the further conquest of the [[Dzungar Khanate]] added , Tibet and Xinjiang to the empire. Meanwhile, 's population growth resumed and shortly began to accelerate. It is commonly agreed that pre-modern 's population experienced two growth spurts, one during the [[Northern Song]] period (960–1127), and other during the Qing period (around 1700–1830). By the [[High Qing era]]  was possibly the most commercialized country in the world, and imperial  experienced a second commercial revolution by the end of the 18th century. On the other hand, the centralized autocracy was strengthened in part to suppress [[anti-Qing sentiment]] with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce, like the ''[[Haijin]]'' during the early Qing period and ideological control as represented by the [[literary inquisition]], causing some social and technological stagnation.

=== Fall of the Qing dynasty ===

In the mid-19th century, the [[Opium Wars]] with Britain and [[]] forced  to pay compensation, open treaty ports, allow [[extraterritoriality]] for foreign nationals, and cede [[ Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] to the  under the 1842 [[Treaty of Nanking]], the first of what have been termed the [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]]. The [[First Sino- War]] (1894–1895) resulted in Qing 's loss of influence in the [[ Peninsula]], as well as the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|cession of Taiwan]] to [[Empire of |]]. The Qing dynasty also began experiencing [[Timeline of late anti-Qing rebellions|internal unrest]] in which tens of millions of people died, especially in the [[White Lotus Rebellion]], the failed [[Taiping Rebellion]] that ravaged southern  in the 1850s and 1860s and the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–1877)]] in the northwest. The initial success of the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s.

In the 19th century, the great [[ emigration| diaspora]] began. Losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the [[Northern  Famine of 1876–1879]], in which between 9 and 13 million people died. The [[Guangxu Emperor]] drafted a [[Hundred Days' Reform|reform plan]] in 1898 to establish a modern [[constitutional monarchy]], but these plans were thwarted by the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]]. The ill-fated anti-foreign [[Boxer Rebellion]] of 1899–1901 further weakened the dynasty. Although Cixi sponsored a program of reforms known as the [[late Qing reforms]], the [[1911 Revolution|Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911–1912 ended the Qing dynasty and established the [[Republic of  (1912–1949)|Republic of ]].

On 1 January 1912, the Republic of  (ROC) was established, and [[Sun Yat-sen]] of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) was proclaimed provisional president. In March 1912, the presidency was given to [[Yuan Shikai]], a former Qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself [[Empire of  (1915–1916)|Emperor of ]]. In the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own [[Beiyang Army]], he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republic in 1916. After Yuan Shikai's death in 1916,  was politically fragmented. Its Beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless; regional warlords controlled most of its territory. During this [[Warlord Era|period]],  [[ during World War I|participated in]] [[World War I]] and saw a far-reaching popular uprising called the [[May Fourth Movement]].
[[File:1945 Mao and Chiang.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chiang Kai-shek]] and [[Mao Zedong]] toasting together in 1945 following the [[End of World War II in Asia|end of World War II]]]]In the late 1920s, the Kuomintang under [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political maneuverings known collectively as the [[Northern Expedition]]. The Kuomintang moved the nation's capital to [[Nanjing]] and implemented "political tutelage", an intermediate stage of political development outlined in Sun Yat-sen's [[Three Principles of the People]] program for transforming  into a modern democratic state. The Kuomintang [[First United Front|briefly allied]] with the [[ Communist Party]] (CCP) during the Northern Expedition, though the alliance broke down in 1927 after Chiang [[Shanghai massacre|violently suppressed]] the CCP and other leftists in Shanghai, marking the beginning of the [[ Civil War]]. The CCP declared [[Communist-controlled  (1927–1949)|areas of the country]] as the [[ Soviet Republic]] (Jiangxi Soviet) in November 1931 in [[Ruijin]], [[Jiangxi]]. The Jiangxi Soviet was [[Encirclement campaigns|wiped out]] by the KMT armies in 1934, leading the CCP to initiate the [[Long March]] and relocate to [[Yan'an]] in [[Shaanxi]]. It would be the base of the communists before major combat in the  Civil War ended in 1949.

In 1931,  [[ invasion of Manchuria|invaded and occupied Manchuria]].  invaded other parts of  in 1937, precipitating the [[Second Sino- War]] (1937–1945), a [[Theater (warfare)|theater]] of [[World War II]]. The war forced an [[Second United Front|uneasy alliance]] between the Kuomintang and the CCP.  forces committed numerous [[ war crimes|war atrocities]] against the civilian population; as many as 20 million  civilians died. An estimated 40,000 to over 300,000  were [[Nanjing Massacre|massacred in Nanjing]] alone during the  occupation. The Republic of , along with the UK, the , and the [[Soviet Union]], were recognized as the Allied "[[Four Policemen|Big Four]]" in the [[Declaration by United Nations]]. Along with the other three great powers,  was one of the four major [[Allies of World War II]], and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war. After the [[surrender of ]] in 1945,  emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained. Taiwan, along with the [[Penghu]], were [[Retrocession of Taiwan|handed over to ROC control]]; however, the validity of this handover is controversial. In June 1946, fighting between CCP and KMT forces broke out and the country resumed a state of civil war that lasted more than three years. Constitutional rule was established in 1947, but because of the ongoing war, many provisions of the [[Constitution of the Republic of |ROC constitution]] were never implemented in mainland .

The CCP consolidated its popularity among the peasants through the [[Land Reform Movement]], which included the state-tolerated executions of between 1 and 2 million landlords by peasants and former tenants. Though the PRC initially allied closely with the [[Soviet Union]], the relations between the two [[Communism|communist]] nations [[Sino-Soviet split|gradually deteriorated]], leading  to develop an independent industrial system and [[ and weapons of mass destruction|its own nuclear weapons]]. The  population increased from 550 million in 1950 to 900 million in 1974. The historical consensus is that the policies of the Mao-era significantly reduced [[Poverty in |poverty]].

In 1964,  [[Project 596|detonated its first atomic bomb]]. In 1966, Mao and his allies launched the [[Cultural Revolution]], sparking a decade of political recrimination and social upheaval that lasted until Mao's [[Death and state funeral of Mao Zedong|death]] in 1976.[[File:Události na náměstí Tian an men, Čína 1989, foto Jiří Tondl.jpg|thumb|The [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests]] was ended by a military-led massacre.]]

[[File: Map Gallia Tribes Towns.png|thumb|left|''[[Gallia Belgica]]'' at the time of [[Julius Caesar]]'s conquest of [[Gaul]] in 54 BCE]]

According to [[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's]] ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', the [[Belgae]] inhabited the northernmost part of [[Gaul]], a region extending from the [[Seine]] and [[Marne (river)|Marne]] rivers to the [[Rhine]]. This area was larger than present-day  and included parts of modern [[]], , [[]], and [[]]. Caesar noted that the Belgae were the bravest among the Gauls due to their distance from the civilization and refinement of the [[Roman province|Roman Province]], minimal contact with merchants importing luxury goods, and their continual warfare with the neighboring [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] across the Rhine. Within this broad region, Caesar referred to a specific area as "," which was politically dominant and located in what is now northern .

Modern , along with neighboring regions of the  and , corresponds to the territories of the northernmost Belgae tribes, including the [[Morini]],{{efn|The Morini were located along the coast of modern , particularly in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] region, centered around [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]].

Their territory included areas along the [[Haine]] and [[Sambre]] rivers.}} [[Germani cisrhenani|Germani Cisrhenani]],{{efn|The Germani Cisrhenani inhabited regions on the eastern side of the [[Rhine]], corresponding to parts of modern-day , but their influence extended into the northeastern part of Gaul.}} and [[Atuatuci|Aduatuci]].{{efn|The [[Aduatuci]] lived in the eastern part of modern-day , particularly in the [[Meuse|Meuse valley]] and the [[Hesbaye|Hesbaye region]].}} Julius Caesar described these tribes as particularly warlike and economically undeveloped, noting their kinship with the Germanic tribes east of the Rhine. Additionally, the area around [[Arlon]] in southern  was part of the territory of the powerful [[Treveri]] tribe, whose lands extended into present-day  and adjacent regions of  and .

Following Caesar's conquests, Gallia Belgica became the [[Latin]] name for a large Roman province encompassing most of [[Gaul|Northern Gaul]], including the lands of the Belgae and Treveri. Subsequently, areas closer to the lower Rhine frontier, such as the eastern part of modern , were incorporated into the frontier province of [[Germania Inferior]]. As the central government of the [[Western Roman Empire]] collapsed, the provinces of Belgica and Germania were inhabited by a mix of Romanized populations and Germanic-speaking [[Franks]], who came to dominate the military and political spheres.

===Middle Ages===
During the 5th century, the area came under the rule of the Frankish [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] kings, who initially established a kingdom ruling over the Romanized population in what is now northern , and then conquered the other Frankish kingdoms. During the 8th century, the empire of the Franks came to be ruled by the [[Carolingian dynasty]], whose centre of power included the area which is now eastern . Over the centuries, it was divided up in many ways, but the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843 divided the Carolingian Empire into three kingdoms whose borders had a lasting impact on medieval political boundaries. Most of modern  was in the [[Middle Francia|Middle Kingdom]], later known as [[Lotharingia]], but the coastal [[county of Flanders]], west of the [[Scheldt]], became the northernmost part of [[West Francia]], the predecessor of [[]]. In 870 in the [[Treaty of Meerssen]], modern  lands all became part of the western kingdom for a period, but in 880 in the [[Treaty of Ribemont]], Lotharingia came under the lasting control of the eastern kingdom, which became the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The lordships and bishoprics along the "March" (frontier) between the two great kingdoms maintained important connections between each other. For example, the county of Flanders expanded over the Scheldt into the empire, and during several periods was ruled by the same lords as the [[county of Hainaut]].

In the 13th and 14th centuries, the cloth industry and commerce boomed especially in the County of Flanders and it became one of the richest areas in Europe. This prosperity played a role in conflicts between Flanders and the [[king of ]]. Famously, Flemish militias scored a surprise victory at the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] against a strong force of mounted knights in 1302, but  soon regained control of the rebellious province.

===Burgundian and Habsburg ===
[[File:Karte-Haus-Burgund 4-FR.png|thumb|upright|The [[Burgundian |Burgundian State]] of [[Charles the Bold]] in the 15th century]]

In the 15th century, the [[Duke of Burgundy]] in  took control of Flanders, and from there [[Burgundian inheritance in the Low Countries|proceeded to unite]] much of what is now the Benelux, the so-called [[Burgundian ]]. "Burgundy" and "Flanders" were the first two common names used for the Burgundian  which was the predecessor of the  , the predecessor of modern . The union, technically stretching between two kingdoms, gave the area economic and political stability which led to an even greater prosperity and artistic creation.

Born in , the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles&nbsp;V]] was heir of the Burgundians, but also of the royal families of [[House of Habsburg|]], [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]]. With the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]] he gave the [[Seventeen Provinces]] more legitimacy as a stable entity, rather than just a temporary [[personal union]]. He also increased the influence of these  over the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]], which continued to exist as a large semi-independent enclave.

=== and  ===
The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) was triggered by the  government's policy towards [[Protestantism]], which was becoming popular in the Low Countries. The rebellious northern [[ Republic|United Provinces]] (''Belgica Foederata'' in [[Latin]], the "Federated ") eventually separated from the [[Southern ]] (''Belgica Regia'', the "Royal "). The southern part continued to be ruled successively by the [[Habsburg |]] ([[ ]]) and the [[History of |]] [[House of Habsburg]]s ([[ ]]) and comprised most of modern . This was the theatre of several more protracted conflicts during much of the 17th and 18th centuries involving , including the [[Franco- War]] (1672–1678), the [[Nine Years' War]] (1688–1697), the [[War of the  Succession]] (1701–1714), and part of the [[War of the  Succession]] (1740–1748).

Human habitation in  dates back to 50,000 years ago. Settlements and tools dating back to the [[Stone Age]] have been unearthed in the peninsula. [[Mesopotamia]]n artifacts originating from the [[Ubaid period]] (c. 6500–3800 BC) have been discovered in abandoned coastal settlements. [[Al Da'asa]], a settlement located on the western coast of , is the most important Ubaid site in the country and is believed to have accommodated a small seasonal encampment.  Some historians have theorised that the Sumerians may have originated from this region.

[[Kassites|Kassite]] [[Babylonia]]n material dating back to the second millennium BC found in [[Al Khor Island]]s attests to trade relations between the inhabitants of  and the Kassites in modern-day . Among the findings were crushed snail shells and Kassite potsherds. It has been suggested that  is the earliest known site of shellfish dye production, owing to a Kassite [[Tyrian purple|purple dye]] industry which existed on the coast.

In 224 AD, the [[Sasanian Empire]] gained control over the territories surrounding the Persian Gulf.  played a role in the commercial activity of the Sasanids, contributing at least two commodities: precious pearls and purple dye. Under the Sasanid reign, many of the inhabitants in eastern Arabia were introduced to [[Christianity]] following the eastward dispersal of the religion by Mesopotamian Christians. Monasteries were constructed and further settlements were founded during this era. During the latter part of the Christian era,  comprised a region known as 'Beth Qatraye' ([[Syriac language|Syriac]] for "house of the "). The region was not limited to ; it also included [[]], [[Tarout Island]], Al-Khatt, and [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Hasa]].

In 628, the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] sent a Muslim envoy to a ruler in eastern Arabia named [[Munzir ibn Sawa Al-Tamimi]] and requested that he and his subjects accept Islam. Munzir obliged his request, and accordingly most of the Arab tribes in the region converted to Islam.{{better source needed|date=June 2017}} In the middle of the century, the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] resulted in the fall of the Sasanian Empire.

Much of eastern Arabia was controlled by the [[Usfurids]] in 1253, but control of the region was seized by the prince of [[Ormus]] in 1320. 's pearls provided the kingdom with one of its main sources of income. In 1515, [[Manuel I of ]] vassalised the Kingdom of Ormus. [[Kingdom of |]] went on to seize a significant portion of eastern Arabia in 1521. In 1550, the inhabitants of [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Hasa]] voluntarily submitted to the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], preferring them to the .

===  era (1507–1650) ===
After the fall of the [[Jabrids|Jabrid]] Dynasty with the conquest of  by the , the Arabian coast up to [[Uqair|Al Hassa]] came under the rule and influence of the  empire. Attempts by the Ottomans to dominate the region were eliminated with the reconquest of the castle of [[Tarout Castle|Tarout]] or [[Siege of Qatif (1551)|Al Qatif]] in 1551.

Archaeological finds are still being excavated from one of the  fortresses that served as a base to dominate the region as [[Ruwayda]]. The first representation of  appears on the  map by Luis Lázaro in 1563, showing the "city of " as a fortress, possibly referring to the fort of Ruwayda.

In 1766, members of the [[House of Khalifa|Al Khalifa]] family of the [[Utub]] tribal confederation migrated from [[]] to [[Zubarah]] in . By the time of their arrival, the Bani Khalid exercised weak authority over the peninsula, notwithstanding the fact that the largest village was ruled by their distant kin. In 1783, -based [[Bani Utbah]] clans and allied Arab tribes [[Bani Utbah invasion of |invaded]] and annexed [[]] from the Persians. The Al Khalifa imposed their authority over  and retained their jurisdiction over Zubarah.

Following his swearing-in as crown prince of the [[First  state|Emirate of Diriyah]] in 1788, [[Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (1748–1814)|Saud ibn Abd al-Aziz]] moved to expand [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] territory eastward towards the Persian Gulf and . After defeating the Bani Khalid in 1795, the Wahhabi were attacked on two fronts. The Ottomans and [[Ottoman |]] assaulted the western front, while the Al Khalifa in  and the [[ Empire|]] launched an attack against the eastern front. Upon being made aware of the  advance on the western frontier in 1811, the Wahhabi amir reduced his garrisons in  and Zubarah in order to redeploy his troops. [[Said bin Sultan]], Sultan of [[Muscat and ]], capitalised on this opportunity and raided the Wahhabi garrisons on the eastern coast, setting fire to the fort in Zubarah. The Al Khalifa was effectively returned to power thereafter.

[[File:, Zubarah (10), ruined city.JPG|thumb|A partially restored section of the ruined town of [[Zubarah]]]]

As punishment for piracy, an [[East  Company]] vessel bombarded [[Doha]] in 1821, destroying the town and forcing hundreds of residents to flee. In 1825, the [[House of Thani]] was established with Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Thani]] as the first leader.

Although  was considered a [[dependent territory|dependency]] of , the Al Khalifa faced opposition from the local tribes. In 1867, the Al Khalifa, along with the ruler of [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi]], sent a massive naval force to [[Al Wakrah]] in an effort to crush the  rebels. This resulted in the maritime [[– War]] of 1867–68, in which  and Abu Dhabi forces sacked and looted Doha and Al Wakrah. The  hostilities were in violation of the [[Perpetual Truce of Peace and Friendship]] of 1861. The joint incursion, in addition to the  counter-attack, prompted  Political Resident, Colonel [[Lewis Pelly]] to impose a settlement in 1868. His mission to  and  and the resulting peace treaty were milestones because they implicitly recognised the distinctness of  from  and explicitly acknowledged the position of Mohammed bin Thani. In addition to censuring  for its breach of agreement, Pelly negotiated with  sheikhs who were represented by Mohammed bin Thani.

Under military and political pressure from the governor of the Ottoman [[Vilayet of Baghdad]], [[Midhat Pasha]], the ruling Al Thani tribe submitted to Ottoman rule in 1871. The Ottoman government imposed reformist ([[Tanzimat]]) measures concerning taxation and land registration to fully integrate these areas into the empire. Despite the disapproval of local tribes, Al Thani continued supporting the Ottoman rule. -Ottoman relations stagnated, and in 1882 they suffered further setbacks when the Ottomans refused to aid Al Thani in his expedition of Abu Dhabi-occupied [[Khor Al Adaid]] and offered only limited support in the [[–Abu Dhabi War]], mainly due to fear of  intervention on Abu Dhabi's side. In addition, the Ottomans supported the Ottoman subject Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab who attempted to supplant Al Thani as [[kaymakam]] of  in 1888. This eventually led Al Thani to rebel against the Ottomans, whom he believed were seeking to usurp control of the peninsula. He resigned as kaymakam and stopped paying taxes in August 1892.

In February 1893, Mehmed Hafiz Pasha arrived in  in the interests of seeking unpaid taxes and accosting Jassim bin Mohammed's opposition to proposed Ottoman administrative reforms. Fearing that he would face death or imprisonment, Jassim retreated to Al Wajbah ({{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on|order=flip|disp=or}} west of Doha), accompanied by several tribe members. Mehmed's demand that Jassim disband his troops and pledge his loyalty to the Ottomans was met with refusal. In March, Mehmed imprisoned Jassim's brother and 13 prominent  tribal leaders on the Ottoman [[corvette]] ''Merrikh'' as punishment for his insubordination. After Mehmed declined an offer to release the captives for a fee of 10,000 [[ lira|liras]], he ordered a column of approximately 200 troops to advance towards Jassim's [[Al Wajbah Fort]] under the command of Yusuf Effendi, thus signalling the start of the [[Battle of Al Wajbah]].

Effendi's troops came under heavy gunfire by a sizable troop of  infantry and cavalry shortly after arriving at Al Wajbah. They retreated to Shebaka fortress where they were again forced to draw back from a  incursion. After they withdrew to Al Bidda fortress, Jassim's advancing column besieged the fortress, resulting in the Ottomans' concession of defeat and agreement to relinquish their captives in return for the safe passage of Mehmed Pasha's cavalry to [[Hofuf]] by land. Although  did not gain full independence from the Ottoman Empire, the result of the battle forced a treaty that would later form the basis of 's emerging as an autonomous country within the empire.

By the [[Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913]], the Ottomans agreed to renounce their claim to  and withdraw their garrison from Doha. With the outbreak of [[World War I]] however, nothing was done to carry this out, and the garrison remained in the fort at Doha, although its numbers dwindled as men deserted. In 1915, with the presence of  gunboats in the harbour, Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani (who was pro-) persuaded the remainder to abandon the fort, and when  troops approached the following morning, they found it deserted.

The treaty reserved foreign affairs and defence to the  but allowed internal autonomy. While Abdullah agreed not to enter into any relations with any other power without the prior consent of the  government, the latter guaranteed the protection of  from aggression by sea and provide its 'good offices' in the event of an attack by land. This latter undertaking was left deliberately vague.

On 5 May 1935, while agreeing an oil concession with the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]], Abdullah signed another treaty with the  government which granted  protection against internal and external threats. Oil reserves were first discovered in 1939. Exploitation and development were, however, delayed by [[World War II]].

The focus of  interests in  changed after the Second World War with the independence of , the creation of [[]] in 1947, and the development of oil in . In 1949, the appointment of the first  political officer in Doha, John Wilton, signified a strengthening of Anglo- relations. Oil exports began in 1949, and oil revenues became the country's main source of revenue; the pearl trade had gone into decline. These revenues were used to fund the expansion and modernisation of 's infrastructure.

When Britain officially announced in 1968 that it would withdraw from the Persian Gulf in three years' time,  joined talks with  and seven other Trucial States to create the [[Federation of Arab Emirates]]. Regional disputes, however, persuaded  and  to withdraw from the talks and become independent states separate from the Trucial States, which went on to become the [[]].

According to the UN, the nation's economic growth, measured by GDP, was the fastest in the world during this decade. The basis of this growth lay in the exploitation of [[natural gas]] in the North Field during the 1990s. At the same time, the population tripled between 2001 and 2011, mostly from an influx of foreigners.

Settlement by [[Cro-Magnons]] of what was to become the  occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago. The island has been continuously inhabited since the last retreat of ice around 11,500 years ago. By the end of the [[Prehistoric Britain|region's prehistoric period]], the population is thought to have belonged largely to a culture termed [[Insular Celts|Insular Celtic]], comprising [[Britons (historical)|Brittonic Britain]] and [[Gaelic ]].

The [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest]], beginning in AD 43, and the 400-year [[Roman Britain|rule of southern Britain]], was followed by an invasion by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Anglo-Saxon]] settlers, reducing the Brittonic area mainly [[Wales#Post-Roman era|to what was to become Wales]], [[Cornwall]] and, until the latter stages of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, the [[Hen Ogledd]] (northern England and parts of southern Scotland). Most of the [[Anglo-Saxon England|region settled by the Anglo-Saxons]] became unified as the Kingdom of England in the 10th century. [[Dál Riata|Gaelic speakers in north-west Britain]] (with connections to the north-east of  and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century) united with the [[Picts]] to create the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] in the 9th century.

In 1066 the [[Normans]] invaded England from northern . After [[Norman conquest of England|conquering England]] they seized [[Norman invasion of Wales|large parts of Wales]], [[Norman invasion of |conquered much of ]] and were invited to settle in Scotland, bringing to each country [[feudalism]] on the Northern  model and [[Norman-]] culture. The [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[ruling class]] greatly influenced, but eventually assimilated with, the local cultures. Subsequent [[House of Plantagenet|medieval  kings]] completed the [[conquest of Wales]] and tried unsuccessfully [[Wars of  Independence|to annex Scotland]]. Asserting its independence in the 1320 [[Declaration of Arbroath]], Scotland maintained its independence thereafter, albeit in [[Anglo- Wars|near-constant conflict with England]].

In 1215 [[Magna Carta]] was the first document to state that no government was above the law and that citizens have rights protecting them.

The  monarchs, through inheritance of [[Angevin Empire|substantial territories in ]] and claims to the  crown, were also heavily involved in conflicts in , most notably the [[Hundred Years' War]], while the [[List of  monarchs|Kings of Scots]] were in [[Auld Alliance|an alliance with the ]] during this period. [[Early modern Britain]] saw religious conflict resulting from the [[Reformation]] and the introduction of [[Protestant]] state churches in each country. The [[ Reformation]] ushered in political, constitutional, social and cultural change in the 16th century and [[State religion|established]] the [[Church of England]]. It defined a national identity for England and slowly, but profoundly, changed people's religious beliefs. Wales was [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542|fully incorporated into the Kingdom of England]], and  was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the  crown. In what was to become Northern , the lands of the independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and [[Plantation of Ulster|given to Protestant settlers]] from England and Scotland.

[[File:Bayeux Tapestry WillelmDux.jpg|thumb|The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] depicts the [[Battle of Hastings]], 1066, and the events leading to it.]]

In 1603 the kingdoms of England, Scotland and  were united in a [[personal union]] when [[James VI of Scotland]] inherited the crowns of England and  and moved his court from Edinburgh to London; each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political, legal and religious institutions.

In the mid-17th century, all three kingdoms [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|were involved in a series of connected wars]] (including the [[ Civil War]]) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy, with [[Execution of Charles I|the execution]] of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], and the establishment of the short-lived [[unitary republic]] of the [[Commonwealth of England]], Scotland and .

Although the [[Restoration (1660)|monarchy was restored]], the [[Interregnum (1649–1660)|Interregnum]] along with the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and the subsequent [[Bill of Rights 1689]] in England and [[Claim of Right Act 1689]] in Scotland ensured that, unlike much of the rest of Europe, [[royal absolutism]] would not prevail, and a professed Catholic could never accede to the throne. The [[ constitution]] would develop on the basis of [[constitutional monarchy]] and the [[parliamentary system]]. With the founding of the [[Royal Society]] in 1660, science was greatly encouraged. During this period, particularly in England, the development of [[ navy|naval power]] and the interest in [[Age of Discovery|voyages of discovery]] led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies, particularly in North America and the Caribbean.

Though previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within Great Britain in 1606, 1667 and 1689 had proved unsuccessful, the attempt initiated in 1705 led to the [[Treaty of Union]] of 1706 being agreed and ratified by both parliaments.

[[File:Articles of Union between England and Scotland 28 Jan 1707.png|thumb|right|170px|The [[Treaty of Union]] which unified the [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland]] on 1 May 1707]]
On 1 May 1707 the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed, the result of the [[Acts of Union 1707]] between the [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. In the 18th century cabinet government developed under [[Robert Walpole]], who is considered the ''[[de facto]]'' first [[Prime Minister of the |prime minister]] from 1721 to 1742. A series of [[Jacobite uprisings]] sought to remove the Protestant [[House of Hanover]] from the throne and restore the Catholic [[House of Stuart]]. The Jacobites were finally defeated at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746, after which the [[ Highlanders]] were forcibly assimilated into Scotland by revoking the feudal independence of [[ clan chief|clan chiefs]].

 merchants played a leading part in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], mainly between 1662 and 1807 when  or -colonial [[slave ships]] transported nearly 3.3&nbsp;million slaves from Africa. The slaves were taken to [[Plantation economy|work on plantations]], principally [[History of the  West Indies|in the Caribbean]] but also [[ America|in North America]]. However, with pressure from the [[Abolitionism in the |abolitionist movement]], Parliament banned the trade in 1807, banned slavery in the  Empire in 1833, and Britain took a leading role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide through the [[blockade of Africa]] and pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties.

In 1800 the parliaments of Great Britain and  each passed an Act of Union, uniting the two kingdoms and creating the  of Great Britain and  on 1 January 1801.

After the defeat of  at the end of the [[ Revolutionary Wars]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1792–1815) the  emerged as the principal naval and imperial power (with London the [[List of largest cities throughout history|largest city in the world from about 1830]]). [[History of the Royal Navy (after 1707)#Pax Britannica, 1815–1914|Unchallenged at sea]],  dominance was later described as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]'' (" Peace"), a period of [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)|relative peace amongst the great powers]] (1815–1914) during which the  Empire became the global [[hegemon]] and adopted the role of [[global policeman]]. From 1853 to 1856 Britain took part in the [[Crimean War]], allied with the [[Ottoman Empire]] against [[ Empire|Tsarist ]]. Following the [[ Rebellion of 1857]] the  government led by [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] assumed [[direct rule]] over [[ Raj|]]. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies,  dominance of much of world trade meant that it [[Informal empire|effectively controlled]] the economies of regions such as [[East Asia]] and [[Latin America]].

Throughout the [[Victorian era]] (1837–1901) political attitudes favoured [[free trade]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' policies. Beginning with the [[Great Reform Act]] in 1832, Parliament gradually [[Reform Acts|widened the voting franchise]], with the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|1884 Reform Act]] championed by [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] granting [[suffrage]] to a majority of males for the first time. The  population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid [[urbanisation]], causing significant social and economic stresses. By the late 19th century the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under [[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] initiated a period of [[Scramble for Africa|imperial expansion in Africa]], maintained a policy of "[[splendid isolation]]" in Europe, and attempted to contain the influence of the [[ Empire]] in [[Emirate of |]] and [[Qajar |Persia]], in what came to be known as the [[Great Game]].

Britain was one of the principal [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] that defeated the [[Central Powers]] in the [[First World War]] (1914–1918). Alongside their ,  and (after 1917)  counterparts,  armed forces were engaged across much of the  Empire and in several regions of Europe, particularly on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. The high fatalities of [[trench warfare]] caused the loss of much of a generation of men, with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order. Britain had suffered 2.5&nbsp;million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt. 

The consequences of the war persuaded the government to expand the right to vote in national and local elections to all adult men and most adult women with the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]]. After the war Britain became a permanent member of the Executive Council of the [[League of Nations]] and received [[League of Nations mandate|a mandate]] over a number of former  and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] colonies. Under the leadership of [[David Lloyd George]], the  Empire reached its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of its population.

By the mid-1920s most of the  population could listen to [[BBC]] radio programmes. Experimental [[Television in the |television]] broadcasts [[History of television#|began in 1929]] and the [[First day of BBC television|first scheduled BBC Television Service]] commenced in 1936. The rise of [[ nationalism]], and disputes within  over the terms of [[ Home Rule]], led eventually to the [[Partition of |partition of the island]] in 1921. [[The Troubles in Ulster (1920–1922)|A period of conflict in what is now Northern ]] occurred from June 1920 until June 1922. The [[ Free State]] became independent, initially with [[Dominion]] status in 1922, and [[Statute of Westminster 1931# Free State|unambiguously independent in 1931]]. Northern  remained part of the . The [[1928 Equal Franchise Act]] gave women electoral equality with men in national elections. Strikes in the mid-1920s culminated in the [[General Strike of 1926]]. Britain had still not recovered from the effects of the First World War when the [[Great Depression in the |Great Depression]] (1929–1932) led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas, as well as political and social unrest with rising membership in communist and socialist parties. [[National Government (1931)|A coalition government]] was formed in 1931.

Nonetheless, Britain was described as "a very wealthy country, formidable in arms, ruthless in pursuit of its interests and sitting at the heart of a global production system." After [[Nazi ]]'s [[invasion of ]] in 1939, Britain entered the [[Second World War]]. Despite the defeat of its European allies in the first year, Britain and its empire continued the war against .

In 1940 the [[Royal Air Force]] defeated the  ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' in the [[Battle of Britain]]. Urban areas suffered heavy bombing during [[the Blitz]].

The UK was one of the [[Big Three (World War II)|Big Three]] powers (with the US and the Soviet Union) who met to plan the [[Aftermath of World War II|post-war world]]; it drafted the [[Declaration by United Nations]] with the  and became one of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]]. It worked closely with the  to establish the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]] and [[NATO]]. The war left the UK severely weakened and financially dependent on the  [[Marshall Plan]], but it was spared the total war that devastated [[eastern Europe]].

In the immediate post-war years the [[Labour Government 1945–1951|Labour government]] under [[Clement Attlee]] initiated a radical programme of reforms, which significantly affected  society [[Post-war consensus|in the following decades]]. Major industries and public utilities were [[nationalised]], a [[welfare state]] was established, and a comprehensive, publicly funded healthcare system, the [[National Health Service]], was created. The rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with Britain's much-diminished economic position after [[History of the  during the First World War|its involvement in the First World War]] and [[Military history of the  during World War II|the Second World War]], so that a policy of [[decolonisation]] was unavoidable. Independence was granted to  and  in 1947. Over the next three decades, most colonies of the  Empire gained their independence, and many became members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

The UK was the third country to develop [[Nuclear weapons and the |a nuclear weapons arsenal]], with its first atomic bomb test, [[Operation Hurricane]], in 1952, but the post-war limitations of Britain's international role were illustrated by the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956. The [[-speaking world|international spread of the  language]], the world's [[List of languages by total number of speakers|most-widely-spoken language]] and [[List of languages by number of native speakers|third-most-spoken native language]], ensured the continuing international influence of [[ literature|its literature]] and [[Culture of the |culture]]. As a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s, the government [[Modern immigration to the |encouraged immigration]] from [[Commonwealth countries]]. In the following decades the UK became a more [[Multiracialism|multiracial]] and [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] society. Despite rising living standards in the late 1950s and 1960s, the UK's economic performance was less successful than many of its main competitors such as , [[West ]] and . The UK was the first democratic nation to [[Representation of the People Act 1969|lower its voting age to 18]] in 1969.

In the decades-long process of [[European integration]] the UK was a founding member of the [[Western European Union]], established with the [[London and Paris Conferences]] in 1954. In 1960 the UK was one of the seven founding members of the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA), but in 1973 it left to join the [[European Communities]] (EC). In a [[1975  European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]] 67 per cent voted to stay in it. When the EC became the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1992, the UK was one of the 12 founding member states.

From the late 1960s, Northern  experienced communal and [[paramilitary]] violence, sometimes affecting other parts of the UK, known as [[the Troubles]]. It is usually considered to have ended with the 1998 [[Belfast Agreement|Belfast "Good Friday" Agreement]]. Following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of the 1980s led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] initiated a radical policy of [[monetarism]], [[deregulation]], particularly of the financial sector (for example, the [[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]] in 1986) and labour markets, the sale of state-owned companies (privatisation), and the withdrawal of subsidies to others.

In 1982 [[]] invaded the  territories of [[South  and the South Sandwich Islands|South ]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], leading to the 10-week [[Falklands War]] in which  forces were defeated. The inhabitants of the islands strongly favour  sovereignty, expressed in a [[2013 Falkland Islands sovereignty referendum|2013 referendum]].

Another  Overseas Territory, [[Gibraltar]], is [[Port of Gibraltar|a key military base]]; a [[2002 Gibraltar sovereignty referendum|referendum in 2002]] on shared sovereignty with  was rejected.

Around the end of the 20th century, there were major changes to the governance of the UK with the establishment of [[devolution|devolved]] administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern .

La Balma de la [[La Margineda|Margineda]], found by archaeologists at [[Sant Julià de Lòria]], was settled in 9,500 BCE as a passing place between the two sides of the Pyrenees. The seasonal camp was perfectly located for hunting and fishing by the groups of hunter-gatherers from [[Ariège (river)|Ariege]] and [[Segre (river)|Segre]].

During the [[Neolithic]], a group of people moved to the [[Madriu-Perafita-Claror Valley|Valley of Madriu]] (the present-day Natural Park located in [[Escaldes–Engordany|Escaldes-Engordany]] declared [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]) as a permanent camp in 6640 BCE.

Influenced by the [[Proto-Celtic language|Celtic]], [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]], [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Iberian languages]], the locals developed some current toponyms.

The Visigoths remained in the valleys for 200 years, during which time [[Gothic Christianity|Christianity]] spread.

Tradition holds that Charles the Great (Charlemagne) granted a charter to the  people for a contingent of 5,000 soldiers under the command of Marc Almugaver, in return for fighting against the [[Moors]] near [[Porté-Puymorens]] ([[Cerdanya]]).

Tradition also holds that it was guaranteed by the son of Charlemagne, [[Louis the Pious]], writing the ''Carta de Poblament'' or a local [[municipal charter]] {{Circa|805}}.

The first document that mentions  as a territory is the ''Acta de Consagració i Dotació de la Catedral de la Seu d'Urgell'' (Deed of Consecration and Endowment of the Cathedral of La Seu d'Urgell). The document, dated 839, depicts the six old [[Parishes of |parishes]] of the  valleys that made up the country's administrative division.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 96 a 146}}

In 988, Count [[Borrell II]] of Urgell gave the  valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in [[Cerdanya]]. Since then, the bishop of Urgell, based in Seu d'Urgell, has been [[Co-Princes of |co-prince]] of .

Before 1095,  had no military protection, and the bishop of Urgell, who knew that the count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the  valleys, asked the [[Lord of Caboet]] for help and protection. In 1095, the lord of Caboet and the bishop of Urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co-sovereignty over . [[Arnalda de Caboet]], daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the viscount of Castellbò. Their daughter, [[Ermessenda de Castellbò]], married the [[count of Foix]], [[Roger-Bernard II, Count of Foix|Roger-Bernard II]]. Roger-Bernard II and Ermessenda shared rule over  with the bishop of Urgell.

In the 13th century, a military dispute arose between the bishop of Urgell and the count of Foix as aftermath of the [[Cathar Crusade]]. The conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of the [[king of Aragon]], [[Peter III of Aragon|Peter III]], between the bishop and the count, by the signing of the [[Paréage of  1278|first paréage]], which provided that 's sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix (whose title would ultimately transfer to the  head of state) and the bishop of Urgell, in the [[Principality of Catalonia]]. This gave the principality its territory and political form.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp = 96 a 146}}{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009}}

After being ratified by Bishop Francesc Tovia and Count [[John I, Count of Foix|John I]], the Consell de la Terra or [[General Council ()|Consell General de les Valls]] (General Council of the Valleys) was founded in 1419, the second oldest parliament in Europe. The syndic Andreu d'Alàs and the General Council organised the creation of the [[Politics of #Judicial branch|Justice Courts]] (La Cort de Justicia) in 1433 with the co-princes and the collection of taxes like foc i lloc (literally "fire and site", a national tax active since then).{{sfn|Guillamet Anton|2009|pp = 78, 79, 80, 81, 88, 89}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}}

The Catalan Pyrenees were embryonic of the [[Catalan language]] at the end of the 11th century.  was influenced by this language, which was adopted locally decades before it expanded to the rest of the Crown of Aragon.

The local economy during the [[Middle Ages]] was based on livestock, agriculture, furs and weavers. Later, at the end of the 11th century, the first [[Bloomery#Early to Medieval Europe|iron foundries]] began to appear in Northern Parishes like [[Ordino]], much appreciated by the master artisans who developed the art of the forges, an important economic activity in the country from the 15th century.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009}}

With the passage of time, the co-title to  passed to the kings of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. After [[Henry IV of |Henry III of Navarre]] became [[king of ]], he issued an edict in 1607 that established the head of the  state and the bishop of Urgell as [[Co-Princes of ]], a political arrangement that still holds.

The country had a unique and experienced guild of weavers, Confraria de Paraires i Teixidors, in [[Escaldes-Engordany]]. Founded in 1604, it took advantage of the local thermal waters.

On 5 April 1933 Joves  seized the  Parliament. These actions were preceded by the arrival of Colonel René-Jules Baulard with 50 [[National Gendarmerie|gendarmes]] and the mobilisation of 200 local militias or sometent led by the Síndic Francesc Cairat.

On 6 July 1934, adventurer and nobleman [[Boris Skossyreff]], with his promise of freedoms and modernisation of the country and wealth through the establishment of a tax haven and foreign investments, received the support of the members of the General Council to proclaim himself the sovereign of . On 8 July 1934 Boris issued a proclamation in Urgell, declaring himself Boris I, King of , simultaneously declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell and approving the King's constitution on 10 July. He was arrested by the Co-Prince and Bishop [[Justí Guitart i Vilardebó]] and their authorities on 20 July and ultimately expelled from [[Second  Republic|]]. From 1936 until 1940, a  military detachment of [[Garde Mobile]] led by well-known Colonel René-Jules Baulard was garrisoned in  to secure the principality against disruption from the [[ Civil War]] and [[Francoist ]] and also face the rise of [[Republicanism]] in the aftermath of the 1933 Revolution.

In the capital city there was a smuggling black market of propaganda, culture and cinematic art not favourable to totalitarian regimes, promulgated in such places as the Hotel Mirador or the Casino Hotel, as a meeting place for [[Free |Free ]] forces and a route for escorting downed Allied pilots out of Europe. The network was maintained after the war, when film societies were formed, where movies, music and books [[Censorship in Francoist |censored in Franco's ]] were imported, becoming an anti-censorship attraction for the Catalan or foreign public even within .

The  opening to the [[capitalist economy]] resulted in two axes: mass tourism and the country's tax exemption. The first steps towards the capitalist boom date from the 1930s, with the construction of FHASA and the creation of professional banking with [[Andbank|Banc Agrícol]] (1930) and [[Crèdit Andorrà]] (1949), later with [[Mora Banc Grup|Banca Mora]] (1952), [[Banca Privada d'|Banca Cassany]] (1957) and SOBANCA (1960). Shortly after, activities such as skiing and shopping helped the country become a tourist attraction, with the inauguration of ski resorts and cultural entities in the late 1930s. A revived hotel industry also developed. In April 1968 a social health insurance system was created ([[Caixa Andorrana de Seguretat Social|CASS]]).

Since 1976 the country has seen the need to reform  institutions due to anachronisms in sovereignty, human rights and the balance of powers as well as the need to adapt legislation to modern demands. In 1982 a first separation of powers took place when instituting the Govern d', under the name of the executive board (Consell Executiu), chaired by the first prime minister [[Òscar Ribas Reig]] with the co-princes' approval. In 1989 the Principality signed an agreement with the [[European Economic Community]] to regularise trade relations.

In the 14th century, the [[Java]]nese manuscript ''[[Nagarakretagama]]'', written by [[Mpu Prapanca|Prapanca]] in 1365, mentioned ''Barune'' as the constituent state of Hindu [[Majapahit]], which had to make an annual [[tribute]] of 40 [[catty|katis]] of [[camphor]]. In 1369, Sulu which was also formerly part of Majapahit, had successfully rebelled and then attacked Boni, and had invaded the Northeast Coast of Borneo and afterwards had looted the capital of its treasure and gold including sacking two sacred pearls.

As customary for close affiliation and alliances in Southeast Asia, the royal family of Luzon intermarried with the ruling houses of the [[ Empire|Sultanate of ]]. Intermarriage was a common strategy for Southeast Asian states to extend their influence.  However, Islamic 's power was not uncontested in Borneo since it had a Hindu rival in a state founded by  called [[Kutai]] in the south which they overpowered but didn't destroy.

Nevertheless, by the 16th century, Islam was firmly rooted in , and the country had built one of its biggest mosques. In 1578, Alonso Beltrán, a  traveller, described it as being five stories tall and built on the water.

However, [[Colonialism|European influence]] gradually brought an end to 's [[regional power]], as  entered a period of decline compounded by internal strife over royal succession. In the face of these invasions by European Christian powers, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Caliphate]] aided the beleaguered Southeast Asian Sultanates by making [[Ottoman expedition to Aceh|Aceh]] a [[protectorate]] and sending expeditions to reinforce, train and equip the local [[mujahideen]]. Turks were routinely migrating to  as evidenced by the complaints of Manila Oidor Melchor Davalos who in his 1585 report, say that Turks were coming to Sumatra, Borneo and Ternate every year, including defeated veterans from the [[Battle of Lepanto]].

 [[Castille War|declared war]] in 1578, planning to attack and capture [[Kota Batu, -Muara|Kota Batu]], 's capital at the time. This was based in part on the assistance of two  [[Pengiran#|noblemen]], Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The former had travelled to [[Manila]], then the centre of the  colony. Manila itself was captured from , Christianised and made a territory of the [[Viceroyalty of New ]] which was centered in  City. Pengiran Seri Lela came to offer  as a [[tributary state|tributary]] to  for help to recover the throne usurped by his brother, Saiful Rijal. The  agreed that if they succeeded in conquering , Pengiran Seri Lela would be appointed as the sultan, while Pengiran Seri Ratna would be the new [[Bendahara]].

In March 1578, a fresh  fleet had arrived from  and settled at the . They were led by [[Francisco de Sande|De Sande]], acting as [[Capitán-General]]. He organised an expedition from Manila for , consisting of 400 Spaniards and , 1,500 [[ people|]] natives, and 300 Borneans. The campaign was one of many, which also included action in [[Mindanao]] and [[Sulu Archipelago|Sulu]]. The racial make-up of the Christian side was diverse since it were usually made up of [[Mestizos]], [[Mulattoes]] and Amerindians ([[Aztecs]], [[Maya peoples|Mayans]] and [[Incans]]) who were gathered and sent from  and were led by  officers who had worked together with native  in military campaigns across the Southeast Asia. The Muslim side was also equally racially diverse. In addition to the native Malay warriors, the Ottomans had repeatedly sent military expeditions to nearby [[Ottoman expedition to Aceh|Aceh]]. The expeditions were composed mainly of [[Turkic people|Turks]], [[]], [[Swahili people|Swahilis]], [[]], [[Sindhis]], [[Gujaratis]] and [[Malabars]]. These expeditionary forces had also spread to other nearby Sultanates such as  and had taught new fighting tactics and techniques on how to forge cannons.

Eventually, the  captured the capital on 16 April 1578, with the help of Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The Sultan Saiful Rijal and Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Abdul Kahar were forced to flee to Meragang then to [[Jerudong]]. In Jerudong, they made plans to chase the conquering army away from . Suffering high fatalities due to a [[cholera]] or [[dysentery]] outbreak, the  decided to abandon  and returned to Manila on 26 June 1578, after 72 days.

Pengiran Seri Lela died in August or September 1578, probably from the same illness suffered by his  allies.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} There was suspicion that the legitimist sultan could have been poisoned by the ruling sultan.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} Seri Lela's daughter, a  princess, "Putri", had left with the , she abandoned her claim to the crown and then she married a Christian [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], named Agustín de Legazpi de Tondo. [[Agustin de Legaspi]] along with his family and associates were soon implicated in the [[Conspiracy of the Maharlikas]], an attempt by  to link up with the  Sultanate and  Shogunate to expel the Spaniards from the . However, upon the  suppression of the conspiracy, the  descended aristocracy of precolonial Manila were exiled to [[Guerrero, ]] which consequently later became a center of the [[Isidoro Montes de Oca| war of independence against ]].

The local  accounts{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=41}} of the Castilian War differ greatly from the generally accepted view of events. What was called the Castilian War was seen as a heroic episode, with the Spaniards being driven out by [[Bendahara Sakam]], purportedly a brother of the ruling sultan, and a thousand native warriors. Most historians consider this to be a [[folk-hero]] account, which probably developed decades or centuries after.

 eventually descended into anarchy. The country suffered a [[ Civil War of 1660|civil war]] from 1660 to 1673.

===  occupation ===
{{Main| occupation of  Borneo}}
[[File:Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin (AWM P10841.001).JPG|thumb|[[Ahmad Tajuddin]], the [[List of Sultans of |27th Sultan of ]], with members of his court in April 1941, eight months before the  invaded ]]
The  invaded  on 16 December 1941, eight days after their [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on the  Navy. They landed 10,000 troops of the [[Kawaguchi Detachment]] from [[Cam Ranh Bay]] at [[Kuala Belait]]. After six days' fighting, they occupied the entire country. The only Allied troops in the area were the 2nd Battalion of the [[15th Punjab Regiment]] based at [[Kuching]], Sarawak.

Once the  occupied , they made an agreement with [[Ahmad Tajuddin|Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin]] over governing the country. Inche Ibrahim (known later as Pehin Datu Perdana Menteri Dato Laila Utama Awang Haji Ibrahim), a former Secretary to the  Resident, Ernest Edgar Pengilly, was appointed [[chief administrative officer]] under the  Governor. The  had proposed that Pengilly retain his position under their administration, but he declined. Both he and other  nationals still in  were interned by the  at [[Batu Lintang camp]] in Sarawak. While the  officials were under  guard, Ibrahim made a point of personally shaking each one by the hand and wishing him well.

The Sultan retained his throne and was given a pension and honours by the . During the later part of the occupation, he resided at Tantuya, [[Limbang]] and had little to do with the . Most of the Malay government officers were retained by the . 's administration was reorganised into five prefectures, which included  [[North Borneo]]. The Prefectures included [[Miri Division|Baram]], Labuan, [[Lawas]], and [[Limbang]]. Ibrahim hid numerous significant government documents from the  during the occupation. Pengiran Yusuf (later YAM Pengiran Setia Negara Pengiran [[Haji Mohd Yusuf]]), along with other , was sent to  for training. Although in the area the day of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], Yusuf survived.

The  had anticipated a  attack, but lacked the resources to defend the area because of their engagement in the war in Europe. The troops from the Punjab Regiment filled in the [[Seria]] oilfield oilwells with concrete in September 1941 to deny the  their use. The remaining equipment and installations were destroyed when the [[ invasion of Malaya| invaded Malaya]]. By the end of the war, 16 wells at [[Miri, |Miri]] and Seria had been restarted, with production reaching about half the pre-war level. Coal production at [[Muara, |Muara]] was also recommenced, but with little success.

During the occupation, the  had their language taught in schools, and Government officers were required to learn . The local currency was replaced by what was to become known as [[Banana money|''duit pisang'' (banana money)]]. From 1943 hyper-inflation destroyed the currency's value and, at the end of the war, this currency was worthless. Allied attacks on shipping eventually caused trade to cease. Food and medicine fell into short supply, and the population suffered from famine and disease.

The [[ International Airport|airport]] runway was constructed by the  during the occupation, and in 1943  naval units were based in [[ Bay]] and Labuan. The naval base was destroyed by Allied bombing, but the airport runway survived. The facility was developed as a public airport. In 1944 the Allies began a bombing campaign against the occupying , which destroyed much of the town and Kuala Belait, but missed [[Kampong Ayer]].

=== Post-World War II ===
After [[World War II]], a new government was formed in  under the [[ Military Administration (Borneo)| Military Administration]] (BMA). It consisted mainly of  officers and servicemen.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=79}} The administration of  was passed to the Civil Administration on 6 July 1945.

The party intended to "preserve the sovereignty of the Sultan and the country, and to defend the rights of the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]]". BARIP also contributed to the composition of the country's national anthem. The party was dissolved in 1948 due to inactivity.

In 1959, a new constitution was written declaring  a self-governing state, while its foreign affairs, security, and defence remained the responsibility of the . A small [[rebellion]] erupted against the monarchy in 1962, which was suppressed with help of the UK.

=== Writing of the Constitution ===
[[File:Omar Ali Saifuddien III.jpg|thumb|Sultan [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]]]]
In July 1953, Sultan [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]] formed a seven-member committee named ''Tujuh Serangkai'', to determine the citizens' views regarding a written constitution for . In May 1954, the Sultan, Resident and High Commissioner met to discuss the findings of the committee. They agreed to authorise the drafting of a constitution. In March 1959, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III led a delegation to London to discuss the proposed Constitution.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=98}} The  delegation was led by Sir [[Alan Lennox-Boyd]], Secretary of State for the Colonies. The  Government later accepted the draft constitution.

On 29 September 1959, the Constitution Agreement was signed in [[Bandar Seri Begawan| Town]]. The agreement was signed by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III and Sir Robert Scott, the Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia.
It included the following provisions:{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=59}}
* The Sultan was made the Supreme Head of State.
*  was responsible for its internal administration.
* The  Government was responsible for foreign and defence affairs only.
* The post of Resident was abolished and replaced by a  High Commissioner.

Five councils were established:{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=100}}
* The Executive Council
* [[Legislative Council of |The Legislative Council of ]]
* The Privy Council
* The Council of Succession
* The State Religious Council

=== National development plans ===
A series of National Development Plans was initiated by the 28th Sultan of , [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]].

The first was introduced in 1953.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=92}} A total sum of B$100&nbsp;million was approved by the  State Council for the plan. E.R. Bevington, from the Colonial Office in [[]], was appointed to implement it.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=129}} A US$14&nbsp;million Gas Plant was built under the plan. In 1954, survey and exploration work were undertaken by the  Shell Petroleum on both offshore and onshore fields. By 1956, production reached 114,700 [[barrels per day|bpd]].

[[File:THE  ARMY IN , JANUARY 1963.jpg|thumb| soldiers in the [[ protectorate]] of  on guard in the [[Seria Field|Seria oilfield]], January 1963]]
The plan also aided the development of public education. By 1958, expenditure on education totalled at $4&nbsp;million.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=129}} Communications were improved, as new roads were built and reconstruction at [[Old Airport, |Berakas Airport]] was completed in 1954.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=21}}

The second National Development Plan was launched in 1962.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=21}} A major oil and gas field was discovered in 1963. Developments in the oil and gas sector have continued, and oil production has steadily increased since then.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=96}} The plan also promoted the production of meat and eggs for consumption by citizens. The fishing industry increased its output by 25% throughout the course of the plan. The [[List of Panamax ports|deepwater port]] at [[Muara, |Muara]] was also constructed during this period. Power requirements were met, and studies were made to provide electricity to rural areas.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=96}} Efforts were made to eradicate [[malaria]], an endemic disease in the region, with the help of the [[World Health Organization]]. Malaria cases were reduced from 300 cases in 1953 to only 66 cases in 1959. The death rate was reduced from 20 per thousand in 1947 to 11.3 per thousand in 1953. Infectious disease has been prevented by public sanitation and improvement of drainage, and the provision of piped pure water to the population.

=== Independence ===
On 14 November 1971, Sultan [[Hassanal Bolkiah]] left for London to discuss matters regarding the amendments to the 1959 constitution. A new agreement was signed on 23 November 1971 with the  representative being [[Anthony Royle, Baron Fanshawe of Richmond|Anthony Royle]].

Under this agreement, the following terms were agreed upon:
*  was granted full internal self-government
* The UK would still be responsible for external affairs and defence.
*  and the UK agreed to share the responsibility for security and defence.

This agreement also caused [[ Military Garrison |Gurkha units]] to be deployed in , where they remain up to this day.

[[File:Sultan of  with Janin Erih.jpg|thumb|Sultan [[Hassanal Bolkiah]] (right), handing his credentials to ambassador [[Janin Erih]] in 2004]]
On 7 January 1979, another treaty was signed between  and the . It was signed with Lord Goronwy-Roberts being the representative of the UK. This agreement granted  to take over international responsibilities as an independent nation. Britain agreed to assist  in diplomatic matters. In May 1983, it was announced by the UK that the date of independence of  would be 1 January 1984.

On 31 December 1983, a mass gathering was held on main mosques on all four of the districts of the country and at midnight, on 1 January 1984, the Proclamation of Independence was read by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. The sultan subsequently assumed the title "[[Majesty|His Majesty]]", rather than the previous "[[His Royal Highness]]".  was [[Member states of the United Nations|admitted to the United Nations]] on 22 September 1984, becoming the organisation's 159th member.

=== 21st century ===
In October 2013, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah announced his intention to impose [[Penal Code]] from [[Sharia]] on the country's Muslims, which make up roughly two-thirds of the country's population. This would be implemented in three phases, culminating in 2016, and making  the first and only country in East Asia to introduce Sharia into its penal code, excluding the subnational  special territory of [[Aceh]]. The move attracted international criticism, the United Nations expressing "deep concern".

=== Antiquity ===
{{main|Capsian culture|Ancient Carthage}}

Farming methods reached the [[Nile|Nile Valley]] from the [[Fertile Crescent]] region about 5000 BC, and spread to the [[Maghreb]] by about 4000 BC. Agricultural communities in the humid coastal plains of central  then were ancestors of today's [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes.
[[File:Carthaginianempire.PNG|left|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Punic people|Carthaginian]] dependencies and protectorates through the [[Punic Wars]]]]
It was believed in ancient times that Africa was originally populated by [[Gaetuli]]ans and , both nomadic peoples. According to the Roman historian [[Sallust]], the demigod Hercules died in  and his polyglot eastern army was left to settle the land, with some [[Human migration|migrating]] to Africa. Persians went to the West and intermarried with the Gaetulians and became the Numidians. The Medes settled and were known as Mauri, later Moors.

The Numidians and Moors belonged to the race from which the Berbers are descended. The translated meaning of Numidian is Nomad and indeed the people were semi-nomadic until the reign of [[Masinissa]] of the Massyli tribe.

At the beginning of recorded history,  was inhabited by [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes. Its coast was settled by [[Phoenicia]]ns starting as early as the 12th century BC ([[Bizerte]], [[Utica, |Utica]]). The city of [[Carthage]] was founded in the 9th century BC by Phoenicians. Legend says that [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] from Tyre, now in modern-day , founded the city in 814 BC, as retold by the [[|]] writer [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus of Tauromenium]]. The settlers of Carthage brought their culture and religion from Phoenicia, now present-day [[]] and adjacent areas.
[[File:Mommsen p265.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of the Carthaginian general [[Hannibal|Hannibal Barca]]]]
After the series of wars with  city-states of Sicily in the 5th century BC, Carthage rose to power and eventually became the dominant civilization in the Western [[Mediterranean]]. The people of Carthage worshipped a pantheon of Middle Eastern gods including [[Baal]] and [[Tanit]]. Tanit's symbol, a simple female figure with extended arms and long dress, is a popular icon found in ancient sites. The founders of Carthage also established a [[Tophet]], which was altered in Roman times.

A Carthaginian invasion of  led by [[Hannibal]] during the [[Second Punic War]],  one of a series of wars with [[Roman Republic|Rome]], nearly crippled the rise of Roman power. From the conclusion of the Second Punic War in 202 BC, Carthage functioned as a client state of the Roman Republic for another 50 years.

Following the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]] which began in 149 BC during the [[Third Punic War]], Carthage was conquered by Rome in 146 BC.{{sfn|Steel|2013|p=9–10}} Following its conquest, the Romans renamed Carthage to [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], incorporating it as a province.

During the Roman period, the area of what is now  enjoyed a huge development. The economy, mainly during the Empire, boomed: the prosperity of the area depended on agriculture. Called the ''Granary of the Empire'', the area of actual  and coastal [[Tripolitania]], according to one estimate, produced one million tons of cereals each year, one quarter of which was exported to the Empire. Additional crops included beans, figs, grapes, and other fruits.

By the 2nd century, olive oil rivalled cereals as an export item. In addition to the cultivations and the capture and transporting of exotic wild animals from the western mountains, the principal production and exports included textiles, marble, wine, timber, livestock, pottery such as [[African Red Slip]], and wool.

There was even a huge production of mosaics and ceramics, exported mainly to , in the central area of [[El Djem]] (where there was the second biggest amphitheatre in the Roman Empire).

Berber bishop [[Donatus Magnus]] was the founder of a Christian group known as the [[Donatist]]s. During the 5th and 6th centuries (from 430 to 533 AD), the Germanic [[Vandals]] invaded and ruled over a kingdom in Northwest Africa that included present-day Tripoli. The region was easily reconquered in 533–534 AD, during the rule of Emperor [[Justinian I]], by the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Romans]] led by General [[Belisarius]], preluding a 165-year era of [[Byzantine North Africa|Byzantine rule]].

{{main|History of medieval }}

[[File:Statue de Okba ibn Nafi al Fihri en Algérie.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Uqba ibn Nafi]] led the [[Umayyad]] conquest of  in the late 7th century.]]
Sometime between the second half of the 7th century and the early part of the 8th century, [[Arab]] [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Muslim conquest occurred in the region]]. They founded the first Islamic city in Northwest Africa, [[Kairouan]]. It was there in 670 AD that the [[Mosque of Uqba]], or the Great Mosque of Kairouan, was constructed. This mosque is the oldest and most prestigious sanctuary in the Muslim West with the oldest standing [[minaret]] in the world; it is also considered a masterpiece of Islamic art and architecture. The [[Arab migration to the Maghreb]] began during this time.

The region in its entirety was taken in 695, retaken by the Byzantine Eastern Romans in 697, but lost permanently in 698. The transition from a Latin-speaking Christian Berber society to a Muslim and mostly Arabic-speaking society took over 400 years (the equivalent process in  and the Fertile Crescent took 600 years) and resulted in the final disappearance of Christianity and Latin in the 12th or 13th century. The majority of the population were not Muslim until quite late in the 9th century; a vast majority were during the 10th. Also, some  Christians emigrated; some richer members of society did so after the conquest in 698 and others were welcomed by Norman rulers to Sicily or  in the 11th and 12th centuries – the logical destination because of the 1200 year close connection between the two regions.

The Arab governors of Tunis founded the [[Aghlabids|Aghlabid dynasty]], which ruled , [[Tripolitania]] and eastern  from 800 to 909.  flourished under Arab rule when extensive systems were constructed to supply towns with water for household use and irrigation that promoted agriculture (especially olive production). This prosperity permitted luxurious court life and was marked by the construction of new palace cities such as al-Abbasiya (809) and Raq Adda (877).
[[File:Panorama of the courtyard of the Great Mosque of Kairouan.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Domes of the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]]. Founded in 670, it dates in its present form largely from the Aghlabid period (9th century). It is the oldest mosque in the [[Maghreb]].]]
After conquering [[Cairo]], the [[Fatimids]] abandoned  and parts of Eastern  to the local [[Zirids]] (972–1148). Zirid  flourished in many areas: agriculture, industry, trade, and religious and secular learning. Management by the later Zirid [[emirs]] was neglectful though, and political instability was connected to the decline of  trade and agriculture.

The depredation of the  campaigns by the [[Banu Hilal]], a warlike Arab tribe encouraged by the Fatimids of  to seize Northwest Africa, sent the region's rural and urban economic life into further decline. Consequently, the region underwent rapid urbanisation as famines depopulated the countryside and industry shifted from agriculture to manufactures. The Arab historian [[Ibn Khaldun]] wrote that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.

The main  cities were conquered by the [[Normans]] of [[Sicily]] under the [[Kingdom of Africa]] in the 12th century, but following [[Almohad conquest of Ifriqiya|the conquest of ]] in 1159–1160 by the [[Almohads]] the Normans were evacuated to Sicily. Communities of  Christians would still exist in [[Nefzaoua]] up to the 14th century. The Almohads initially ruled over  through a governor, usually a near relative of the Caliph. Despite the prestige of the new masters, the country was still unruly, with continuous rioting and fighting between the townsfolk and wandering Arabs and Turks, the latter being subjects of the Muslim  adventurer Karakush. Also,  was occupied by [[Ayyubids]] between 1182 and 1183 and again between 1184 and 1187.

The greatest threat to Almohad rule in  was the [[Banu Ghaniya]], relatives of the [[Almoravids]], who from their base in [[Mallorca]] tried to restore Almoravid rule over the Maghreb. Around 1200 they succeeded in extending their rule over the whole of  until they were crushed by Almohad troops in 1207. After this success, the Almohads installed Walid Abu Hafs as the governor of .  remained part of the Almohad state, until 1230 when the son of Abu Hafs declared himself independent.

During the reign of the [[Hafsid dynasty]] from their capital Tunis, fruitful commercial relationships were established with several Christian Mediterranean states. In the late 16th century the coast became a [[pirate]] stronghold.

In the last years of the [[Hafsid dynasty]],  seized many of the coastal cities, but these were recovered by the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The [[Conquest of Tunis (1534)|first Ottoman conquest of Tunis]] took place in 1534 under the command of [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha]], the younger brother of Oruç Reis, who was the [[Kapudan Pasha]] of the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman Fleet]] during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. However, it was not until the [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|final Ottoman reconquest of Tunis from ]] in 1574 under Kapudan Pasha [[Uluç Ali Reis]] that the Ottomans permanently acquired the former [[History of medieval #Hafsid dynasty of Tunis|Hafsid ]], retaining it until the [[ conquest of ]] in 1881.

Initially under  rule from Algiers, soon the [[Ottoman Porte]] appointed directly for [[Tunis]] a governor called the [[Pasha]] supported by [[janissary]] forces. Before long, however,  became in effect an autonomous province, under the local [[bey]]. Under its [[ People|]] governors, the beys,  attained virtual independence. The [[Husainid Dynasty|Hussein dynasty]] of beys, established in 1705, lasted until 1957. This evolution of status was from time to time challenged without success by Algiers. During this era, the governing councils controlling  remained largely composed of a foreign elite who continued to conduct state business in the [[ language]].

Attacks on European shipping were made by [[Barbary corsairs|corsairs]], primarily from Algiers, but also from Tunis and [[Tripoli, |Tripoli]], yet after a long period of declining raids the growing power of the European states finally forced its termination.

The [[Second plague pandemic|plague epidemics]] ravaged  in 1784–1785, 1796–1797 and 1818–1820.

In the 19th century, the rulers of  became aware of the ongoing efforts at political and social [[Tanzimat|reform in the Ottoman capital]]. The Bey of Tunis then, by his own lights but informed by the  example, attempted to effect a modernizing reform of institutions and the economy.  international debt grew unmanageable. This was the reason or pretext for  forces to establish a [[History of  era |protectorate]] in 1881.

In 1869,  declared itself bankrupt and an international financial commission took control over its economy. In 1881, using the pretext of a  incursion into [[]], the  invaded with an army of about 36,000 and forced the Bey of Tunis, [[Muhammad III as-Sadiq]], to agree to the terms of the 1881 [[Treaty of Bardo]]. With this treaty,  was officially made a [[ occupation of | protectorate]], over the objections of . European settlements in the country were actively encouraged; the number of [[ people|]] colonists grew from 34,000 in 1906 to 144,000 in 1945. In 1910 there were also 105,000 [[ | in ]].

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the protectorate of  was controlled by the collaborationist [[Vichy |Vichy]] government in Metropolitan . The antisemitic [[Vichy anti-Jewish legislation|Statute on Jews]] enacted by the Vichy government was also implemented in Vichy-controlled Northwest Africa and other overseas  territories. Thus, the persecution and murder of the Jews from 1940 to 1943 was part of [[the Holocaust]] in .

From November 1942 until May 1943, Vichy-controlled  was occupied by . [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] Commander [[Walter Rauff]] continued to implement the "Final Solution" there. From 1942 to 1943,  was the scene of the [[ Campaign]], a series of battles between the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces. The battle opened with initial success by the  and  forces, but the massive supply and numerical superiority of the Allies led to the [[ Campaign|Axis surrender]] on 13 May 1943. The six-month campaign of 's liberation from Axis occupation signalled the end of the war in Africa.

=== Struggle for independence (1943–1956) ===

After the liberation of  from the , the  regained control over the government and made participation in a nationalist party illegal once more. [[Moncef Bey]], who was popular amongst , was deposed by the . The  claimed that his removal was due to him being sympathetic to the Axis countries during  occupation, but the real reason is up for debate.

In 1945 after escaping  surveillance,  nationalist [[Habib Bourguiba]] arrived in [[Cairo]]. While there, he was able to make contact with the [[Arab League]]. Later in 1946, after traveling to other Middle Eastern countries, he made his way to the  to speak to both the [[United Nations]] at their headquarters at [[Lake Success, New York|Lake Success]] and [[ Department of State|U.S. State Department]] officials in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]], pleading the case of the  nationalists.

As part of postwar , a new all- labor organization was formed, the [[ General Labour Union|Union Générale des Travailleurs (UGTT)]]. This was one of the stronger components of the nationalist group [[Neo-Destour]].

Habib Bourguiba made his way to the  on 13 September 1949. He attended the [[ Federation of Labor]] meeting in [[San Francisco]], California. The  were opposed to his presence there, and the US feared political change in North Africa due to the looming presence of possible [[Soviet Union]] communist expansion.

Bourguiba continued to plead to foreign leaders when he traveled to  on 6 November 1951. His contacts included [[Alberto Mellini Ponce De León]], [[Mario Toscano]], and [[Licinio Vestri]]. De León was an old friend of Bourguiba who had helped free him from  captivity, Toscano was the head of the ''Ufficio Studi e Documentazione'' in the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs ()|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], and Vestri was an [[Africanist (discipline)|Africanist]] scholar. Despite his best efforts, the  remained neutral as they did not want to ruin relations with [[NATO]] ally , nor did they want to hamper any possibility of future relations with  as it served as a key part of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].

The  Resident General in , {{ill|Jean de Hautecloque|de|Jean de Hauteclocque|fr}} left Tunis to go to Paris on 25 August 1953, when he was replaced by [[Pierre Voizard]]. Voizard had previously been the  Minister to [[]]. A month after his arrival in Tunis on 26 September 1953, Voizard made many changes to ease tensions in . He lifted press censorship and freed several political prisoners. He also restored the full powers of civil authorities and raised the state of siege in the [[Sahel, |Sahel]].

On 26 January 1954, Voizard announced that there would soon be new reforms in favor of granting more sovereignty to  while insuring the interests of the  and  citizens in , at the Cercle Republicain d'outre Mer in Paris. The Neo-Destour group was not in favor of these reforms if they themselves were not involved in their creation. They also demanded the freedom of Bourguiba who was imprisoned on the Isle of Galete.

 achieved independence from  on 20 March 1956 with [[Habib Bourguiba]] as Prime Minister. 20 March is celebrated annually as  Independence Day. A year later,  was declared a republic, with Bourguiba as [[List of Presidents of |the first President]]. From independence in 1956 until the 2011 revolution, the government and the [[Constitutional Democratic Rally]] (RCD), formerly [[Neo Destour]] and the [[Socialist Destourian Party]], were effectively one. Following a report by [[Amnesty International]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' called  "one of the most modern but repressive countries in the Arab world". On 12 May 1964,  nationalized foreign farmlands. Immediately after,  canceled all financial assistance for the country, which was to amount to more than $40 million. This led to the  National Assembly passing a bill that required all residents of the country to subscribe to a "popular loan" in proportion to their income. From 1977 until 2005,  was a shooting location for five films of the ''[[Star Wars (franchise)|Star Wars]]'' film franchise.

In 1982,  became the center of the [[ Liberation Organization]], based in the capital Tunis. On 1 October 1985, the [[ Air Force]] [[Operation Wooden Leg|bombed the PLO Headquarters]], killing at least 60 people.

[[File:Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.jpg|thumb|[[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]], president of  from 1987 to 2011|209x209px]]
In November 1987, doctors declared Bourguiba unfit to rule and, in a bloodless coup d'état, Prime Minister [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] assumed the presidency in accordance with Article 57 of the [[ constitution]]. The anniversary of Ben Ali's succession, 7 November, was celebrated as a national holiday. He was consistently re-elected with enormous majorities every five years (well over 80 percent of the vote), the last being 25 October 2009, until he fled the country amid popular unrest in January 2011.

Ben Ali and his family were accused of corruption and plundering the country's money. Economic liberalisation provided further opportunities for financial mismanagement, while corrupt members of the Trabelsi family, most notably in the cases of [[Imed Trabelsi]] and [[Belhassen Trabelsi]], controlled much of the business sector in the country. The First Lady [[Leila Ben Ali]] was described as an "unabashed [[Oniomania|shopaholic]]" who used the state airplane to make frequent unofficial trips to Europe's fashion capitals.  refused a  request for the extradition of two of the President's nephews, from Leila's side, who were accused by the  State prosecutor of having stolen two mega-yachts from a  marina. According to ''[[Le Monde]]'', Ben Ali's son-in-law was being primed to eventually take over the country.

Independent human rights groups, such as [[Amnesty International]], [[Freedom House]], and Protection International, documented that basic human and political rights were not respected. The regime obstructed in any way possible the work of local human rights organizations. In 2008, in terms of [[press freedom]],  was ranked 143rd out of 173.

=== Post-revolution (since 2011) ===
{{see also| Revolution}}
[[File: Unrest - VOA - Tunis 14 Jan 2011 (2).jpg|thumb|Tunis on 14 January 2011 during the [[ Revolution]]|242x242px|left]]
The  Revolution was an intensive campaign of [[civil resistance]] that was precipitated by high [[unemployment]], [[food inflation]], [[corruption]], a lack of [[freedom of speech]] and other [[political freedom]]s and poor [[living conditions]]. Labour unions were said to be an integral part of the protests. The protests inspired the [[Arab Spring]], a wave of similar actions throughout the Arab world. The catalyst for mass demonstrations was the death of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]], a 26-year-old  street vendor, who set himself afire on 17 December 2010 in protest at the confiscation of his wares and the humiliation inflicted on him by a municipal official named [[Faida Hamdy]]. Anger and violence intensified following Bouazizi's death on 4 January 2011, ultimately leading longtime [[President of |President]] [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] to resign and flee the country on 14 January 2011, after 23 years in power.

Protests continued for banning of the ruling party and the eviction of all its members from the transitional government formed by [[Mohamed Ghannouchi|Mohammed Ghannouchi]]. Eventually the new government gave in to the demands. A Tunis court banned the ex-ruling party RCD and confiscated all its resources. A decree by the minister of the interior banned the "political police", special forces which were used to intimidate and persecute political activists.

On 3 March 2011, the interim president announced that [[ Constituent Assembly election, 2011|elections to a Constituent Assembly]] would be held on 24 July 2011. On 9 June 2011, the prime minister announced the election would be postponed until 23 October 2011. International and internal observers declared the vote free and fair. The [[Ennahda Movement]], formerly banned under the Ben Ali regime, came out of the election as the largest party, with 89 seats out of a total of 217. On 12 December 2011, former dissident and veteran human rights activist [[Moncef Marzouki]] was elected president. In March 2012, Ennahda declared it will not support making sharia the main source of legislation in the new constitution, maintaining the secular nature of the state. Ennahda's stance on the issue was criticized by hardline Islamists, who wanted strict sharia, but was welcomed by secular parties. On 6 February 2013, [[Chokri Belaid]], the leader of the leftist opposition and prominent critic of Ennahda, was assassinated. In 2014, President [[Moncef Marzouki]] established 's [[Truth and Dignity Commission ()|Truth and Dignity Commission]], as a key part of creating a national reconciliation.

The [[ National Dialogue Quartet]] won the 2015 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for its work in building a peaceful, pluralistic political order in .

==== Presidency of Kais Saied (2019–present) ====
's first democratically elected president [[Beji Caid Essebsi]] died in July 2019. Following him, [[Kais Saied]] became 's president after a landslide victory in the [[2019  presidential election]]s in October. On 23 October 2019, Saied was sworn in as 's new president.

On 25 July 2021, amid ongoing demonstrations concerning government dysfunction and corruption and rises in [[COVID-19]] cases, Kais Saied unilaterally [[2021  political crisis|suspended parliament, dismissed the prime minister and withdrew immunity of parliament members]]. In September 2021, Saied said he would appoint a committee to help draft new constitutional amendments.{{Efn|The new constitution, which increased presidential powers, was passed in a [[2022  constitutional referendum|referendum]] the following year with a turnout of only around 30%, amidst a widespread boycott.}} On 29 September, he named [[Najla Bouden]] as the new prime minister and tasked her with forming a [[Bouden Cabinet|cabinet]], which was sworn in on 11 October. On 3 February 2022,  was voted to the African Union's (AU) Peace and Security Council for the term 2022–2024, according to the  Foreign Ministry. The poll took place on the fringes of the AU Executive Council's 40th ordinary session, which was held in the  capital of Addis Ababa, according to the ministry.

In February 2022,  and the International Monetary Fund held preliminary negotiations in the hopes of securing a multibillion-dollar bailout for an economy beset by recession, public debt, inflation, and unemployment.

In April 2023, the  government closed the headquarters of the [[Ennahda]] party and arrested its leader [[Rached Ghannouchi]]. In October 2023 [[Abir Moussi]], head of the [[Free Destourian Party|Free Destourian Party (FDL)]], became the latest prominent opponent of president Saied to have been detained or imprisoned. The FDL had emerged from the [[Democratic Constitutional Rally|Democratic Constitutional Assembly]].

In September 2023 Saied had asked to postpone a visit by a delegation of the [[European Commission|EU commission]] to discuss migration according to [[Ministry of the Interior ()|Minister of the Interior]] [[Kamel Feki]]. Meanwhile, human rights organisations were criticizing the July migration agreement. Feki said that , which is one of the most important transit countries for people on their way to Europe, cannot act as a border guard for other countries. In October 2023 Saied turned down 127 million in EU aid saying that the amount was small and doesn't square with a deal signed three months ago. This in turn caused surprise in Brussels. In April 2025,  dismantled dozens of makeshift camps housing African migrants, displacing as many as 7,000 people.

On 6 October 2024, President Kais Saied won a second term with more than 90% of the vote in a [[2024  presidential election|presidential election]] with a 28.8% turnout. Five political parties had urged people to boycott the elections.

{{main|History of }}

=== Prehistory and antiquity ===
The area of present-day  has been inhabited since at least [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic times]], beginning sometime between 190,000 and 90,000&nbsp;BC. A recent publication has suggested that there is evidence for even earlier human habitation of the area: ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' fossils that had been discovered in the late 2000s near the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]] in [[Jebel Irhoud]] were recently dated to roughly 315,000 years ago. During the [[Upper Paleolithic]], the [[Maghreb]] was more fertile than it is today, resembling a [[savanna]], in contrast to its modern arid landscape.

DNA studies of [[Iberomaurusian]] peoples at [[Taforalt]],  dating to around 15,000 years ago have found them to have a distinctive Maghrebi ancestry formed from a mixture of [[Near East]]ern and African ancestry, which is still found as a part of the genome of modern Northwest Africans. Later during the [[Neolithic]], from around 7,500 years ago onwards, there was a migration into Northwest Africa of [[Early European Farmers|European Neolithic Farmers]] from the Iberian Peninsula (who had originated in [[]] several thousand years prior), as well as pastoralists from the [[Levant]], both of whom also significantly contributed to the ancestry of modern Northwest Africans. The [[Proto-Berber language|proto-Berber]] tribes evolved from these prehistoric communities during the late [[Bronze Age|Bronze]]- and early [[Iron Age|Iron]] ages.

In the early part of [[Classical Antiquity]], Northwest Africa and  were slowly drawn into the wider emerging [[Mediterranean]] world by the [[Phoenicians]], who established trading colonies and settlements there, the most substantial of which were [[Chellah]], [[Lixus (ancient city)|Lixus]], and [[Mogador]]. Mogador was established as a Phoenician colony as early as the 6th century BC.{{page needed|date=February 2013}}

 later became a realm of the Northwest African civilisation of [[ancient Carthage]], and part of the Carthaginian empire. The earliest known independent  state was the [[Mauretania|Berber kingdom of Mauretania]], under King [[Baga (king)|Baga]]. This ancient kingdom (not to be confused with the modern state of [[]]) flourished around 225&nbsp;BC or earlier. [[Mauretania]] became a [[Client state|client]] kingdom of the [[Roman Empire]] in 33 BC. Emperor [[Claudius]] annexed Mauretania directly in 44 AD, making it a [[Roman province]] ruled by an imperial [[governor]] (either a ''procurator Augusti'', or a ''legatus Augusti pro praetore'').

[[Christianity]] in  appeared during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, when it was practiced by [[Berber Christians]] in Roman [[Mauretania Tingitana]]. During the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], parts of Mauretania were reconquered by Berbers. By the late 3rd century, direct Roman rule had become confined to a few coastal cities, such as Septum ([[Ceuta]]) in [[Mauretania Tingitana]] and [[Cherchell]] in [[Mauretania Caesariensis]]. When, in 429 AD, the area was devastated by the [[Vandals]], the Roman Empire lost its remaining possessions in Mauretania, and local [[Mauro-Roman kingdom|Mauro-Roman kings]] assumed control of them. In the 530s, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], under Byzantine control, re-established direct imperial rule of Septum and [[Tingi]], fortified Tingis and erected a church.

The [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]] that had begun during the mid-7th century was completed under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] by 709. The caliphate introduced both [[Islam]] and the Arabic language to the area; this period also saw the beginning of a trend of [[Arab migration to the Maghreb]] which would last for centuries and effect a demographic shift in the region. While constituting part of the larger empire,  was initially organised as a subsidiary province of [[Ifriqiya]], with the local governors appointed by the Muslim governor in [[Kairouan]].

The indigenous Berber tribes adopted Islam, but retained their [[customary law]]s. They also paid taxes and tribute to the new Muslim administration. The first independent Muslim state in the area of modern  was the [[Kingdom of Nekor]], an emirate in the [[Rif Mountains]]. It was founded by [[Salih I ibn Mansur]] in 710, as a client state to the Umayyad Caliphate. After the outbreak of the [[Berber Revolt]] in 739, the Berbers formed other independent states such as the [[Miknasa]] of [[Sijilmasa]] and the [[Barghawata]].

He convinced the Awraba Berber tribes to break their allegiance to the distant Abbasid caliphs and he founded the Idrisid dynasty in 788. The Idrisids established [[Fes, |Fes]] as their capital and  became a centre of Muslim learning and a major [[regional power]]. The Idrisids were ousted in 927 by the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] and their Miknasa allies. After Miknasa broke off relations with the Fatimids in 932, they were removed from power by the [[Maghrawa]] of Sijilmasa in 980.

From the 11th century onward, a series of Berber dynasties arose. Under the [[Sanhaja]] [[Almoravid dynasty]] and the [[Masmuda]] [[Almohad dynasty]],  dominated the Maghreb, [[al-Andalus]] in [[Iberia]], and the western Mediterranean region. From the 13th century onward the country saw a [[Arab migration to the Maghreb|massive migration]] of the [[Banu Hilal]] Arab tribes.

Under the Saadis, the sultanate [[ succession crisis of 1580|ended the  Aviz dynasty]] in 1578 at the [[Battle of Alcácer Quibir]]. The reign of [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] brought new wealth and prestige to the Sultanate, and a [[Saadian invasion of the Songhai Empire|large expedition]] to West Africa inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[Songhay Empire]] in 1591. However, managing the territories across the [[Sahara]] proved too difficult. Upon the death of al-Mansur, the country was divided among his sons.

After a period of political fragmentation and conflict during the decline of the Saadi dynasty,  was finally reunited by the Alawi sultan [[Al-Rashid of |al-Rashid]] in the late 1660s, who took Fez in 1666 and Marrakesh in 1668.{{Rp|230}}{{Rp|225}} The 'Alawis succeeded in stabilising their position, and while the kingdom was smaller than previous ones in the region, it remained quite wealthy.

However, Hassan declared a state of emergency and suspended parliament in 1965. In 1971 and 1972, there were two failed attempts to depose the king and establish a republic. A truth commission set up in 2005 to investigate human rights abuses during his reign confirmed nearly 10,000 cases, ranging from death in detention to forced exile. Some 592 people were recorded killed during Hassan's rule according to the truth commission.

In 1963, the [[Sand War]] was fought between  and  troops over  claims to parts of  territory. A formal peace agreement was signed in February 1964; however, relations remained strained between the two countries following the conflict. The  [[enclave]] of [[Ifni]] in the south was returned to  in 1969.

The [[Polisario movement]] was formed in 1973, with the aim of establishing an independent state in the  Sahara. On 6 November 1975, King Hassan asked for volunteers to cross into the  Sahara. Some 350,000 civilians were reported as being involved in the "[[Green March]]". A month later,  agreed to leave the  Sahara, soon to become Western Sahara, and to transfer it to joint - control, despite the objections and threats of military intervention by .  forces occupied the territory.

In 1984,  left the Organisation of African Unity in protest at the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|SADR]]'s admission to the body. Polisario claimed to have killed more than 5,000  soldiers between 1982 and 1985.  authorities have estimated the number of [[Sahrawi refugees]] in  to be 165,000. Diplomatic relations with  were restored in 1988. In 1991, a UN-monitored ceasefire began in Western Sahara, but the territory's status remains undecided and ceasefire violations are reported. The following decade saw much wrangling over a [[Houston Agreement|proposed referendum]] on the future of the territory but the deadlock was not broken.

Political reforms in the 1990s resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature with 's first opposition-led government coming to power. King Hassan II died in 1999 and was succeeded by his son, [[Mohammed VI of |Mohammed VI]]. He is a cautious moderniser who has introduced some economic and social liberalisation. Mohammed VI paid a controversial visit to the Western Sahara in 2002.  unveiled an autonomy blueprint for Western Sahara to the United Nations in 2007. The Polisario rejected the plan and put forward its own proposal.  and the Polisario Front held UN-sponsored talks in New York City but failed to come to any agreement. In 2010, security forces stormed a protest camp in the Western Sahara, triggering violent demonstrations in the regional capital [[El Aaiún]].

There were renewed tensions in 2005, as dozens of African migrants stormed the borders of the  enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta. In response,  deported dozens of the illegal migrants to  from Melilla. In 2006, the  Premier [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero|Zapatero]] visited  enclaves. He was the first  leader in 25 years to make an official visit to the territories. The following year,  King [[Juan Carlos I]] visited Ceuta and Melilla, further angering  which demanded control of the enclaves.

During the [[2011–2012  protests]], thousands of people rallied in Rabat and other cities calling for political reform and a new constitution curbing the powers of the king. In July 2011, the King won a landslide victory in a [[2011  constitutional referendum|referendum]] on a reformed constitution he had proposed to placate the [[Arab Spring]] protests. In the first [[2011  general election|general elections]] that followed, the moderate Islamist [[Justice and Development Party ()|Justice and Development Party]] won a plurality of seats, with [[Abdelilah Benkirane]] being designated as head of government per the new constitution. Despite the reforms made by Mohammed VI, demonstrators continued to call for deeper reforms. Hundreds took part in a trade union rally in Casablanca in May 2012. Participants accused the government of failing to deliver on reforms.

[[File:20100923 amman37.JPG|thumb|The [['Ain Ghazal Statues]], c. 7250 BC, uncovered in Amman, are some of the oldest human statues ever found.]]

The oldest known evidence of [[hominid]] habitation in  dates back at least 200,000 years.  is a rich source of [[Paleolithic]] human remains (up to 20,000 years old) due to its location within the [[Levant]], where [[Recent African origin of modern humans|migrations out of Africa]] converged, and its more humid climate during the [[Late Pleistocene]], which resulted in the formation of numerous remains-preserving wetlands in the region. Past lakeshore environments attracted different groups of hominids, and several remains of tools dating from the Late Pleistocene have been found there. Scientists have found the world's oldest known evidence of bread-making at a 14,500-year-old [[Natufian culture|Natufian]] site in 's northeastern desert.

During the [[Neolithic]] period (10,000–4,500 BC), there was a transition there from a [[hunter-gatherer]] culture to a culture with established populous agricultural villages. [[Ayn Ghazal (archaeological site)|'Ain Ghazal]], one such village located at a site in the eastern part of present-day [[Amman]], is one of the largest known prehistoric settlements in the [[Near East]]. [['Ain Ghazal Statues|Dozens of plaster statues]] of the human form, dating to 7250 BC or earlier, have been uncovered there. They are one of the oldest large-scale representations of humans ever found. During the [[Chalcolithic|Chalcolithic period]] (4500–3600 BC), several villages emerged in  including [[Teleilat el Ghassul|Tulaylet Ghassul]] in the [[ Valley]]; a series of circular stone enclosures in the eastern basalt desert from the same period have long baffled archaeologists.

[[File:Mesha Stele (511142469) (cropped).jpg|thumb|200px|upright|The [[Mesha Stele]] (c. 840 BC) records the glory of [[Mesha]], King of [[Moab]], displayed at the [[Louvre Museum]].]]
Fortified towns and urban centres first emerged in the southern Levant early in the [[Bronze Age]] (3600–1200 BC). [[Wadi Feynan]] became a regional centre for copper extraction: the metal was exploited on a large scale to produce bronze. Trade and movement of people in the Middle East peaked, causing cultural innovations and whole civilisations to spread. Villages in  expanded rapidly in areas with reliable water-resources and arable land. [[Ancient ]]ian populations expanded towards the Levant and came to control both banks of the  River.

During the [[Iron Age]] (1200–332 BC), after the withdrawal of the ,  was home to the kingdoms of [[Ammon]], [[Edom]] and [[Moab]]. These peoples spoke [[Semitic languages]] of the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite group]]. Archaeologists have concluded that their polities were tribal kingdoms rather than states. Ammon was located in the Amman plateau; Moab in the highlands east of the Dead Sea; and Edom in the area around [[Arabah|Wadi Araba]] in the south. The northwestern region of the , known then as [[Gilead]], was settled by the [[Israelites]]. 

The three kingdoms continually clashed with the neighbouring Hebrew kingdoms of [[Kingdom of  (Samaria)|]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], centred west of the  River. One record of this is the [[Mesha Stele]], erected by the Moabite king [[Mesha]] in 840 BC. In an inscription on it, he lauds himself for the building projects that he initiated in Moab and commemorates his glory and his victory against the Israelites. The stele constitutes one of the most important archeological parallels to [[Historicity of the Bible|accounts recorded in the Bible]]. At the same time,  and the Kingdom of [[Aram-Damascus]] competed for control of the Gilead.

Around 740–720 BC,  and Aram-Damascus were conquered by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]. The kingdoms of Ammon, Edom and Moab were subjugated but were allowed to maintain some degree of independence. Then in 627 BC, following after the disintegration of the Assyrians' empire, [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonians]] took control of the area. Although the kingdoms supported the Babylonians against Judah in the 597 BC [[Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)|sack of Jerusalem]], they rebelled against Babylon a decade later. The kingdoms were reduced to [[vassal]]s, a status they retained under the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] and [[ (ancient kingdom)|Hellenic]] empires. By the beginning of [[Roman Empire|Roman rule]] around 63 BC, the kingdoms of Ammon, Edom and Moab had lost their distinct identities and were assimilated into the Roman culture. Some Edomites survived longer – driven by the Nabataeans, they had migrated to southern [[Judea]], which became known as [[Idumaea]]. They were later converted to [[Judaism]] by the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmoneans]].

It is believed to be the [[mausoleum]] of the Arab Nabataean King [[Aretas IV Philopatris|Aretas IV]].

Roman legions under [[Pompey]] conquered much of the Levant in 63 BC, inaugurating a period of Roman rule that lasted four centuries. In 106 AD, Emperor [[Trajan]] annexed Nabataea unopposed and rebuilt the [[King's Highway (ancient)|King's Highway]] which became known as the [[Via Traiana Nova]] road. The Romans gave the  cities of —[[Philadelphia (Amman)|Philadelphia]] (Amman), [[Jerash|Gerasa]] (Jerash), [[Umm Qays|Gedara]] (Umm Quays), [[Pella, |Pella]] (Tabaqat Fahl) and [[Irbid|Arbila]] (Irbid)—and other Hellenistic cities in  and southern , a level of autonomy by forming the ''[[Decapolis]]'', a ten-city league.

In 324 AD, the Roman Empire split and the Eastern Roman Empire, later known as the [[Byzantine Empire]], continued to control or influence the region until 636. Christianity had [[Edict of Milan|become legal within the empire in 313]] after co-emperors [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] and [[Licinius]] signed an&nbsp;edict of toleration. In 380, the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] made Christianity the official state religion.  prospered during the Byzantine era, and Christian churches were built throughout the region.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=14}} 

The [[Aqaba Church]] in [[Aqaba|Ayla]] was built during this era. It is considered to be the [[List of oldest church buildings|world's first purpose built Christian church]]. [[Umm ar-Rasas]] in southern Amman contains at least 16 Byzantine churches. Meanwhile, Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after a [[Galilee earthquake of 363|363 earthquake]] destroyed many structures it declined further, eventually being abandoned. The [[Sasanian Empire]] in the east became the Byzantines' rivals, and [[Byzantine–Sasanian wars|frequent confrontations]] sometimes led to the Sasanids controlling some parts of the region, including .

=== Islamic era ===
In 629, during the [[Battle of Mu'tah]] in what is today [[Karak Governorate]], the Byzantines and their [[Patronage in ancient Rome|Arab Christian clients]], the [[Ghassanids]], staved off an attack by a Muslim [[Rashidun]] force that marched northwards towards the Levant from the Hejaz.

Under the Umayyad Caliphate, several [[desert castles]] were constructed in , including [[Qasr Al-Mshatta]] and [[Qasr Al-Hallabat]]. The [[Abbasid Caliphate]]'s campaign to take over the Umayyad's began in a village in  known as [[Humayma]]. The powerful [[749 Galilee earthquake|749 earthquake]] is thought to have contributed to the Umayyads' [[Abbasid revolution|defeat by the Abbasids]], who moved the caliphate's capital from Damascus to [[Baghdad]]. During Abbasid rule (750–969), several Arab tribes moved northwards and settled in the Levant.

Despite the fact that the  had limited involvement against the  forces, the events at Karameh gained wide recognition and acclaim in the Arab world. As a result, there was an upsurge of support for  paramilitary elements (the [[ fedayeen|fedayeen]]) within  from other Arab countries. The fedayeen activities soon became a threat to 's rule of law. In September 1970, the  army targeted the fedayeen and the resultant fighting led to the expulsion of  fighters from various PLO groups into , in a conflict that became known as [[Black September]].

On 7 February 1999, [[Abdullah II of |Abdullah II]] ascended the throne upon the death of his father Hussein, who had ruled for nearly 50 years. Abdullah embarked on economic liberalisation when he assumed the throne, and his reforms led to an economic boom which continued until 2008. Abdullah II has been credited with increasing foreign investment, improving public-private partnerships and providing the foundation for [[Aqaba]]'s free-trade zone and 's flourishing information and communication technology sector. He also set up five other special economic zones. However, during the following years 's economy experienced hardship as it dealt with the effects of the [[Great Recession]] and spillover from the [[Arab Spring]].

[[Al-Qaeda]] under [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]]'s leadership launched [[2005 Amman bombings|coordinated explosions]] in three hotel lobbies in Amman on 9 November 2005, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among .

The Arab Spring were large-scale protests that erupted in the [[Arab world]] in 2011, demanding economic and political reforms. Many of these protests tore down regimes in some Arab nations, leading to instability that ended with violent civil wars. In response to [[2011–2012  protests|domestic unrest]], Abdullah replaced his prime minister and introduced reforms including reforming the constitution and laws governing public freedoms and elections.

 has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic]] era. The [[Botai culture]] (3700–3100 BC) is credited with the first domestication of horses. The Botai population derived most of their ancestry from a deeply European-related population known as [[Ancient North Eurasian]]s, while also displaying some [[Genetic history of East Asians|Ancient East Asian]] admixture. [[Pastoralism]] developed during the [[Neolithic]]. The population was [[Caucasian race|Caucasoid]] during the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]] period.

Other groups included the nomadic [[Scythians]] and the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the southern territory of the modern country.

=== Turkic Khaganate ===
{{main|Turkic migration|First Turkic Khaganate}}

The main [[Turkic migration|migration]] of [[Turkic peoples]] occurred between the 5th and 11th centuries when they spread across most of Central Asia. The Turkic peoples slowly replaced and assimilated the previous [[ languages|]]-speaking locals, turning the population of Central Asia from largely [[Indo-|]], into primarily of East Asian descent.

The [[First Turkic Khaganate]] was founded by [[Bumin Qaghan|Bumin]] in 552 on the  Plateau and quickly spread west toward the Caspian Sea. The [[Göktürks]] drove before them various peoples: [[Xionites]], [[Uar (tribe)|Uar]], [[Onogurs|Oghur]]s, and others. These seem to have merged into the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Old Great |Bulgars]]. Within 35 years, the [[Eastern Turkic Khaganate|eastern half]] and the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]] were independent. The Western Khaganate reached its peak in the early 7th century.

[[File:Cumania (1200) eng.png|thumb|right|[[Cumania|Cuman–Kipchak confederation]] in Eurasia circa 1200. The  are descendants of [[Kipchaks]] and other Turkic and medieval Mongol tribes.]]

The [[Cuman people|Cumans]] entered the steppes of modern-day  around the early 11th century, where they later joined with the [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] and established the vast Cuman-Kipchak confederation. While ancient cities [[Taraz]] (Aulie-Ata) and [[Hazrat-e Turkestan]] had long served as important way-stations along the [[Silk Road]] connecting Asia and Europe, true political consolidation began only with the Mongol rule of the early 13th century. Under the [[Mongol Empire]], the first strictly structured administrative districts (Ulus) were established. After the [[division of the Mongol Empire]] in 1259, the land that would become modern-day  was ruled by the [[Golden Horde]], also known as the Ulus of Jochi. During the Golden Horde period, a [[Turco-Mongol tradition]] emerged among the ruling elite wherein [[Turkification|Turkicised]] descendants of [[Genghis Khan]] followed [[Islam]] and continued to reign over the lands.

===  Khanate ===
{{Main| Khanate}}

In 15th century, the [[ Khanate]] emerged as a result of the dissolution of the [[Golden Horde]]. Established by [[Janibek Khan]] and [[Kerei Khan]], it continued to be ruled by the [[Chinggisids|Chingissid]] clan of [[Töre (dynasty)|Tore]] ([[Jochi]]d dynasty). The  Khanate was a successor state of the left (eastern) wing of Ulus Of Jochi.

In the early 16th century,  transformed [[ Khanate|the Khanate]] into a [[nomadic empire]] stretching across the steppes east of the Caspian Sea and north of the [[Aral Sea]] as far as the upper [[Irtysh|Irtysh River]] and the western approaches to the [[Altai Mountains]]. During the reigns of [[Burunduk Khan]] (ruled 1488–1509) and [[Kasym Khan]] (1509–18), the  were the masters of virtually the entire steppe region, reportedly able to bring 200,000 cavalry into the field and feared by all their neighbours. Many historians consider Kasym Khan's leadership the starting point of a distinct and sovereign  state. His influence extended  authority from the southeastern regions of modern  to the [[Ural Mountains]]. [[Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat|Mirza Muhammad Haidar]] wrote in his ''Tarikh-i-Rashidi'' that:

{{Blockquote|Kásim Khán became the absolute ruler over all of [[Cumania|Dasht-i-Kipchák]]. His army numbered more than a million men, gaining such fame and power as no one had since [[jochi|Juji Khán]].|author=[[Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat]]}}

[[File:Huang Qing Zhigong Tu - 067.jpg|thumb|Noble . Portrait created by an artist of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in the second half of the 18th century]]

During the reign of the three sons of [[Kasym Khan]], the authority of the khan weakened somewhat, leading to the eventual fragmentation of the  Khanate into three distinct "hordes": the Great Horde in southeastern  north of the Tien Shan, the Middle Horde in the central steppe near the Aral Sea, and the Little Horde between the Aral Sea and the Ural River. In these regions, the khan’s power was often constrained by tribal leaders, known as sultans, and even more so by the beys and batyrs, heads of the clan-based communities. Although the khans nominally commanded a formidable military, their authority relied heavily on the loyalty of these local leaders.

The final son of Kasym Khan to rule, [[Haqnazar Khan|Haqnazar]], overcame these challenges, reunited the three hordes, and expanded his power beyond the steppes. He brought under his control not only the  hordes but also the [[Bashkirs]], [[ people|]] and [[Nogais]], as well as territories such as the [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]], [[Khanate of Sibir|Siberian]], and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan khanates]], and cities like [[Bukhara]], [[Khiva]], and [[Tashkent]]. According to Rychkov, Haqnazar’s reign was marked by a brutal consolidation of power, where he exploited the instability of neighboring peoples, imposed heavy tributes, and severely restricted their movements and resources. He limited them to a single cooking pot per three households, confiscated livestock, goods, and even children, and prohibited land ownership and movement across certain rivers. These actions rendered these peoples impoverished and submissive, but they also strengthened his dominion across the region.

{{blockquote|Akhnazar, having established himself as khan, greatly expanded his power, not only ruling over the Nogais and the Bashkirs, but also conquering the Kazan, Siberian, and Astrakhan kingdoms, as well as Bukhara, Khiva, Tashkent, and many other cities, bringing them under his control and extracting tribute from them. Before his rule, the Bashkirs were governed by various regional khans: Kucum Khan of Siberia to the east, the Kazan khans controlling the lands by the Belaya and Yaik rivers, and the Nogai khans in the southern mountains. Akhnazar, however, brought them all under his dominion, consolidating power and reducing them to subjugation. He took note of their instability, disorder, and various acts of theft, relentlessly exhausting their resources and rendering them powerless. He limited them to only a single cooking pot for every three households, seized their livestock, goods, and even their children, and prohibited them from owning land or crossing the Belaya River. Those who hunted for fur were forced to pay him tribute in the form of one fox, one beaver, and one marten for each person. This constant exploitation eventually led the people to the brink of utter poverty and destitution.}}

He initiated regular raids into [[Transoxiana]], a pattern continued by his successors, including Tauekel Khan, who briefly occupied [[Samarkand]]. However, by the early 17th century, the unity that had been restored began to unravel once again, leading to the fragmentation of the khanate. As a result, central power weakened significantly, and numerous smaller, local rulers emerged across the region.

After Tauke’s death in 1715/1718, the  Khanate lost its unity, and the three hordes effectively became separate khanates.

During the 17th century, the  fought the [[Oirats]], a federation of western [[Mongols|Mongol]] tribes, including the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]]. The beginning of the 18th century marked the zenith of the  Khanate. During this period the Little Horde participated in the 1723–1730 [[-Dzungar Wars|war against the Dzungar Khanate]], following their "Great Disaster" invasion of  territory. Under the leadership of [[Abul Khair Khan]], the  won major victories over the Dzungar at the Bulanty River in 1726 and at the [[Battle of Añyraqai]] in 1729.

[[File:Abulkhair_Khan.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Abul Khair Khan|Abulkhair Khan]], Khan of the Little Horde]]

[[Ablai Khan]] participated in the most significant battles against the Dzungars from the 1720s to the 1750s, for which he was declared a "''batyr''" ("hero") by the people. He later became the last khan whose authority was recognised across the  steppe, ruling the Middle Zhuz from 1771 to 1781. In 1740, Ablai had accepted  suzerainty, while pursuing a policy of balancing between [[ Empire]] and [[Qing dynasty]], which for a time allowed the  Khanate to preserve relative autonomy. After his death, his son Vali Khan (1781–1819) abandoned an independent policy and acknowledged [[ Empire|]] authority.

In 1822, the Khanate institution among the  [[zhuz|Hordes]] was abolished, sparking the [[Kenesary's Rebellion|uprising of Sultan Qasym]] in 1824–1827. The final attempt to restore the Khanate was led by Sultan [[Kenesary Qasymuly|Kenesary Qasymov]], who proclaimed himself khan in 1837 and conducted an armed struggle against  authorities until his death in 1847.

In the first half of the 18th century, the [[ Empire]] constructed the {{Interlanguage link|Irtysh line|ru|Иртышская линия}}, a series of forty-six forts and ninety-six redoubts, including [[Omsk]] (1716), [[Semey|Semipalatinsk]] (1718), [[Pavlodar]] (1720), [[Orenburg]] (1743) and [[Petropavl]]ovsk (1752), to prevent  and Oirat raids into  territory. In the late 18th century the  took advantage of [[Pugachev's Rebellion]], which was centred on the Volga area, to raid  and [[Volga |Volga ]] settlements. In the 19th century, the [[ Empire]] began to expand its influence into Central Asia. The "[[Great Game]]" period is generally regarded as running from approximately 1813 to the [[Anglo- Convention of 1907]]. The [[tsar]]s effectively ruled over most of the territory belonging to what is now the Republic of .

The  Empire introduced an administrative system and built military garrisons and barracks in its effort to establish a presence in Central Asia in the so-called "Great Game" for dominance in the area against the [[ Empire]], which was extending its influence from the south in  and Southeast Asia.  built its first outpost, [[Orsk]], in 1735.  introduced the  language in all schools and governmental organisations.

's efforts to impose its system aroused the resentment of the , and, by the 1860s, some  resisted its rule.  had disrupted the traditional nomadic lifestyle and livestock-based economy, and people were suffering from starvation, with some  tribes being decimated. The  national movement, which began in the late 19th century, sought to preserve the native language and identity by resisting the attempts of the  Empire to assimilate and stifle  culture.

Due to its incorporation into the  Empire,  intellectuals led a cultural renaissance that surpassed those of other Central Asian peoples.  schooling brought modern ideas to the steppe, and figures like [[Shoqan Walikhanov]] and [[Abai Qunanbaiuly|Abay Kunanbayev]] adapted these ideas to the specific needs of  society, creating a secular culture unparalleled in other parts of Asian .

From the 1890s onward, ever-larger numbers of settlers from the  Empire began [[Colonization|colonizing]] the territory of present-day , in particular, the province of [[Jetisu|Semirechye]]. The number of settlers rose still further once the [[Trans-Aral Railway]] from [[Orenburg]] to [[Tashkent]] was completed in 1906. A specially created Migration Department (Переселенческое Управление) in [[St. Petersburg]] oversaw and encouraged the migration to expand  influence in the area. During the 19th century, about 400,000  immigrated to , and about one million Slavs, , Jews, and others immigrated to the region during the first third of the 20th century. [[Vasile Balabanov]] was the administrator responsible for the resettlement during much of this time.

The competition for land and water that ensued between the  and the newcomers caused great resentment against colonial rule during the final years of the [[ Empire]]. The most serious uprising, the [[Central Asian revolt of 1916|Central Asian revolt]], occurred in 1916. The  attacked  and [[Cossacks|Cossack]] settlers and military garrisons. The revolt resulted in a series of clashes and in brutal massacres committed by both sides. Both sides resisted the communist government until late 1919.

In the wake of the [[ Revolution]], the [[Alash Autonomy|Alash Orda]] government was formed in 1917 as an attempt to secure  autonomy. Although it existed only in name, Alash Orda represented the  push for self-rule. The Bolshevik Red Army eventually defeated White  forces in the region by 1920, and  was incorporated into the Soviet Union.

{{Main| Soviet Socialist Republic}}

Following the [[October Revolution|collapse of central government]] in [[ Petersburg|Petrograd]] in November 1917, the  (then in  officially referred to as "Kirghiz") experienced a brief period of autonomy (the [[Alash Autonomy]]) before eventually succumbing to the [[Bolsheviks]]' rule. On 26 August 1920, the [[Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic (1920–25)|Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic]] within the [[ Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR) was established. The Kirghiz ASSR included the territory of present-day , but its administrative centre was the mainly -populated town of [[Orenburg]]. In June 1925, the Kirghiz ASSR was renamed the [[ Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazak ASSR]] and its administrative centre was transferred to the town of [[Kyzylorda]], and in April 1927 to [[Almaty|Alma-Ata]].

Despite their traditionally nomadic lifestyle, the  were among the most literate groups in Central Asia, which set them apart in the region. However, Soviet policies, including forced [[collectivization]] and repression of the traditional elite in the late 1920s and 1930s, led to devastating consequences for the  population. These policies caused widespread famine and high fatalities, with an estimated 1.5 million deaths between 1926 and 1939, mostly due to starvation and related diseases, as well as violence (see also: [[Famine in  of 1932–33]]). Thousands of  fled to , but many did not survive the journey. During the 1930s, some members of the  intelligentsia were executed – as part of the [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|policies of political reprisals]] pursued by the Soviet government in Moscow.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

On 5 December 1936, the [[ Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] (whose territory by then corresponded to that of modern ) was detached from the [[ Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR) and made the [[ Soviet Socialist Republic]], a full [[Republics of the Soviet Union|union republic]] of the USSR, one of eleven such republics at the time, along with the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]].

The republic was one of the destinations for exiled and convicted persons, as well as for mass resettlements, or deportations affected by the central USSR authorities during the 1930s and 1940s, such as approximately 400,000 [[Volga ]] deported from the [[Volga  Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] in September–October 1941, and then later the [[ in |]] and [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatars]]. Deportees and prisoners were interned in some of the biggest [[Gulag|Soviet labour camps]] (the Gulag), including [[Akmol|ALZhIR]] camp outside Astana, which was reserved for the wives of men considered "enemies of the people". Many moved due to the policy of [[population transfer in the Soviet Union]] and others were forced into [[involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union]].

The [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Soviet- War]] (1941–1945) led to an increase in industrialisation and [[mineral extraction]] in support of the war effort. At the time of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death in 1953, however,  still had an overwhelmingly agricultural economy. In 1953, Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] initiated the [[Virgin Lands Campaign]] designed to turn the traditional pasturelands of  into a major grain-producing region for the Soviet Union. The Virgin Lands policy brought mixed results. However, along with later modernisations under Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] (in power 1964–1982), it accelerated the development of the agricultural sector, which remains the source of livelihood for a large percentage of 's population. Because of the decades of privation, war and resettlement, by 1959 the [[]] had become a minority, making up 30% of the population. Ethnic [[]] accounted for 43%.

In 1947, the USSR, as part of its [[Soviet atomic bomb project|atomic bomb project]], founded an [[Semipalatinsk Test Site|atomic bomb test site]] near the north-eastern town of [[Semey|Semipalatinsk]], where the [[RDS-1|first Soviet nuclear bomb]] test was conducted in 1949. Hundreds of nuclear tests were conducted until 1989 with adverse consequences for the nation's environment and population. The [[Anti-nuclear movement in ]] became a major political force in the late 1980s.

In April 1961, [[Baikonur]] became the springboard of [[Vostok 1]], a spacecraft with Soviet cosmonaut [[Yuri Gagarin]] being the first human to enter space.

In December 1986, mass demonstrations by young ethnic , later called the [[Jeltoqsan]] riot, took place in Almaty to protest the replacement of the [[General Secretary|First Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of |Communist Party]] of the  SSR [[Dinmukhamed Konayev]] with [[Gennady Kolbin]] from the [[ SFSR]]. Governmental troops suppressed the unrest, several people were killed, and many demonstrators were jailed. In the waning days of Soviet rule, discontent continued to grow and found expression under Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' ("openness").

 declared its [[sovereignty]] within the Soviet Union on 25 October 1990. Following the failed August 1991 [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|coup attempt]] in Moscow, the country proclaimed full independence on 16 December 1991, becoming the last Soviet republic to do so. Ten days after 's declaration, the Soviet Union itself dissolved. This period marked a significant turning point in 's history, as it embarked on a new political and economic path separate from Moscow's control.

[[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], the communist-era leader of , became the country's first president. Under his leadership,  transitioned from a Soviet-era planned economy to a market economy, focusing on privatization and foreign investments. The emphasis on economic reform, particularly in the oil sector, helped  become one of Central Asia's most economically powerful nations. By 2006,  contributed around 60% of the region's GDP, primarily through its oil exports. However, political reforms lagged behind these economic strides, and Nazarbayev maintained an authoritarian rule throughout his presidency.

In 1997, Nazarbayev [[Capital relocation in |moved the capital]] from Almaty, the country's largest city, to [[Astana]] (later renamed Nur-Sultan in 2019), a decision that symbolized the government's desire to modernize and assert control over the country's vast territories. The capital city change was part of broader efforts to establish a new national identity and shift the political center from former Soviet-era heartlands.

's political landscape during Nazarbayev's rule was characterized by limited political pluralism. In the 2004 parliamentary elections, the pro-government Otan Party, led by Nazarbayev, dominated the Majilis (the lower house of parliament). Other parties sympathetic to the president, such as the agrarian-industrial bloc AIST and the Asar party (founded by Nazarbayev's daughter), secured most of the remaining seats, while opposition parties struggled to gain representation. International observers, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, criticized the elections for not meeting democratic standards.

Despite claims of progress toward democracy, 's political system remained authoritarian well into the 21st century. In 2010, the country was still ranked as an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian regime]] on ''[[The Economist]]'''s [[The Economist Democracy Index|Democracy Index]]. Nazarbayev, who had ruled since independence, announced his resignation on 19 March 2019, after nearly three decades in power. His successor, [[Kassym-Jomart Tokayev]], won the 2019 presidential election and took office on 12 June 2019. Tokayev's first official act was to rename the capital city to Nur-Sultan, in honor of Nazarbayev's legacy.

However, Tokayev's presidency faced significant challenges. In January 2022,  was gripped by [[2022  unrest|large-scale protests]] following a sharp rise in fuel prices. The unrest quickly escalated, and Tokayev responded decisively by assuming control of the country's Security Council, removing Nazarbayev from the post and consolidating his own power. This marked a dramatic shift in 's political dynamics, with Tokayev signaling a departure from the old Nazarbayev-era system. In September 2022, the capital's name was reverted back to Astana, a move seen as part of the broader efforts to distance the country from the former president's influence.

The presence of [[Clovis culture]] type spearheads and arrows from [[South America]] opens the possibility that, in this area, two different cultures coexisted.

Agriculture became evident in the populations that lived in  about 5,000 years ago. They mainly grew [[tubers]] and roots. For the first and second millennia BCE there were already settled farming communities. These were small and scattered, although the timing of the transition from [[hunter-gatherer|hunting]] and gathering to agriculture as the main livelihood in the territory is still unknown.

The earliest use of [[pottery]] appears around 2,000 to 3,000 BCE. Shards of pots, cylindrical vases, platters, gourds, and other vases decorated with grooves, prints, and some modeled after animals have been found.

The influence of Indigenous peoples on modern  culture has been relatively small compared to other nations since the country lacked a strong native civilization to begin with.{{clarify|date=October 2024}}{{citation needed|date=October 2024}} Most of the native population was absorbed into the -speaking [[ colonization of the Americas|colonial society]] through inter-marriage,{{citation needed|date=October 2024}} except for some small remnants, the most significant of which are the [[Bribri people|Bribri]] and [[Boruca people|Boruca]] tribes who still inhabit the mountains of the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]], in the southeastern part of , near the frontier with [[]].

The name {{lang|es|la }}, meaning "rich coast" in the  language, was in some accounts first applied by [[Christopher Columbus]], who sailed to the eastern shores of  during his final voyage in 1502, and reported vast quantities of gold jewelry worn by natives. The name may also have come from conquistador [[Gil González Dávila]], who landed on the west coast in 1522, encountered natives, and obtained some of their gold, sometimes by violent theft and sometimes as gifts from local leaders.

During most of the colonial period,  was the southernmost province of the [[Captaincy General of ]], nominally part of the [[New |Viceroyalty of New ]]. The captaincy general was a largely autonomous entity within the [[ Empire]]. 's distance from the capital of the captaincy in [[]], its legal prohibition under [[mercantilism|mercantilist]]  law from trade with its southern neighbor , then part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (i.e. [[]]), and lack of resources such as gold and silver, made  into a poor, isolated, and sparsely inhabited region within the  Empire.  was described as "the poorest and most miserable  colony in all America" by a  governor in 1719.

=== Independence ===
{{See also|Free State of |First  Republic}}
Like the rest of [[Central America]],  never fought for independence from . On 15 September 1821, after the final  defeat in the [[ War of Independence]] (1810–1821), the authorities in  declared the independence of all of Central America. That date is still celebrated as Independence Day in  even though, technically, under the [[ Constitution of 1812]] that had been readopted in 1820, [[]] and  had become an autonomous province with its capital in [[León, |León]].

On 3 March 1824, the government of the State of  officially proposed to the municipality of [[Nicoya]] its voluntary incorporation into the country, through a document in which it invited it "if it was convenient to join its Province without going against its will." On 4 July, an open town hall was convened in Nicoya to discuss the matter, but attendees declined the invitation under the argument "that this Party... cannot be dissident."

On 25 July 1824, a second [[plebiscite]] was called in the city of Nicoya. After deliberation, the incorporation into  was decided in an open town hall meeting, preparing a record in which the main reasons for it were noted, pointing out the advantages in terms of trade, the desire to participate in the advances that are palpable in , the economic, administrative and public service benefits, the creation of schools, security and quiet, referring to the state of war that  was experiencing at that time and the fear that it would spread to the Partido populations, in addition to point out the poverty in which its towns find themselves and the geography of the territory as justifications for the union. Three days later, another similar plebiscite was held in [[Santa Cruz (canton), |Santa Cruz]], with the same result. The election was by majority vote, with 77% of the Party's population in favor of incorporation, and 23% against it. The town of Guanacaste was the only one that declined annexation, due to the ties its residents had with the city of [[Rivas, ]].

Upon independence,  authorities faced the issue of officially deciding the future of the country. Two bands formed: the Imperialists, defended by [[Cartago, |Cartago]] and [[Heredia Province|Heredia cities]], which were in favor of [[Central America under  rule|joining]] the [[First  Empire| Empire]], and the Republicans, represented by the cities of [[San José, |San José]] and [[Alajuela]] who defended full independence. Because of the lack of agreement on these two possible outcomes, the first civil war in  occurred. The [[Battle of Ochomogo]] took place on the Hill of [[Ochomogo]], located in the [[ Central Valley|Central Valley]] in 1823. The conflict was won by the Republicans and, as a consequence, the city of [[Cartago, |Cartago]] lost its status as the capital, which moved to [[San José, |San José]].
[[File:First postal stamp CR 4 Reales 1863.jpg|thumb|upright|1849 [[Coat of arms of |national coat of arms]] was featured in the first postal stamp issued in 1862.]]

In 1838, long after the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] ceased to function in practice,  formally withdrew and proclaimed itself sovereign. The considerable distance and poor communication routes between [[ City]] and the Central Plateau, where most of the  population lived then and still lives now, meant the local population had little allegiance to the federal government in . Since colonial times,  has been reluctant to become economically tied with the rest of Central America. Even today, despite most of its neighbors'{{Efn|, , , , and }} efforts to increase regional integration,  has remained more independent.

Until 1849, when it became part of [[]], [[Chiriquí province|Chiriquí]] was part of .  pride was assuaged for the loss of this eastern (or southern) territory with the acquisition of [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]], in the north.

=== Economic growth in the 19th century ===
{{See also|Liberal State}}
[[Coffee]] was first planted in  in 1808, and by the 1820s, it surpassed [[tobacco]], [[sugar]], and [[cacao bean|cacao]] as a primary [[export]]. Coffee production remained 's principal source of wealth well into the 20th century, creating a wealthy class of growers, the so-called Coffee Barons. The revenue helped to modernize the country.

Most of the coffee exported was grown around the main centers of population in the Central Plateau and then transported by [[Bullock cart|oxcart]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] port of [[Puntarenas]] after the main road was built in 1846. By the mid-1850s the main market for coffee was Britain. It soon became a high priority to develop an effective transportation route from the Central Plateau to the Atlantic Ocean. For this purpose, in the 1870s, the  government contracted with U.S. businessman [[Minor C. Keith]] to build a railroad from San José to the [[Western Caribbean Zone|Caribbean]] port of [[Limón]]. Despite enormous difficulties with construction, disease, and financing, the railroad was completed in 1890.

Most Afro- descend from [[]]n immigrants who worked in the construction of that railway and now make up about 3% of 's population.{{Citation needed|date=February 2022}} U.S. convicts, , and  immigrants also participated in the construction project. In exchange for completing the railroad, the  government granted Keith large tracts of land and a lease on the train route, which he used to produce [[banana]]s and export them to the . As a result, bananas came to rival coffee as the principal  export, while foreign-owned corporations (including the [[United Fruit Company]] later) began to hold a major role in the national economy and eventually became a symbol of the exploitative export economy. The major labor dispute between the peasants and the United Fruit Company (The Great Banana Strike) was a major event in the country's history and was an important step that would eventually lead to the formation of effective [[trade unions in ]], as the company was required to sign a collective agreement with its workers in 1938.

=== 20th century ===
{{See also|Reform State}}
Historically,  has generally enjoyed greater peace and more consistent political stability than many of its fellow Latin  nations. During the 20th century, however,  experienced two significant periods of violence. In 1917–1919, General [[Federico Tinoco Granados]] ruled as a military dictator until he was overthrown and forced into exile. The unpopularity of [[Dictatorship of the Tinoco Brothers|Tinoco's regime]] led, after he was overthrown, to a considerable decline in the size, wealth, and political influence of the  military. In 1948, [[José Figueres Ferrer]] led an [[ Civil War|armed uprising]] in the wake of a disputed presidential election between [[Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia]] (who had been president between 1940 and 1944) and [[Otilio Ulate Blanco]]. With more than 2,000 dead, the resulting 44-day [[ Civil War]] was the bloodiest event in  during the 20th century.

The victorious rebels formed a government junta that [[military of |abolished the military]] all together and oversaw the drafting of a new constitution by a democratically elected assembly. Having enacted these reforms, the junta transferred power to Ulate on 8 November 1949. After the ''coup d'état'', Figueres became a national hero, winning the country's first democratic election under the new constitution [[ general election, 1953|in 1953]]. Since then,  has held 15 additional presidential elections, the latest [[ general election, 2022|in 2022]]. With uninterrupted democracy dating back to at least 1948, the country is the region's most stable.

[[File:Cántaro (26738115330).jpg|thumb|left|upright|2nd century [[Common Era|BCE]] era jar found in [[Mleiha Archaeological Centre|Mleiha Archaeological site]] in Sharjah]]

Stone tools recovered reveal a settlement of people from Africa some 127,000 years ago and a stone tool used for butchering animals discovered on the Arabian coast suggests an even older habitation from 130,000 years ago. In time, lively trading links developed with civilisations in [[Mesopotamia]], , and the [[Indus Valley civilisation|Harappan culture]] of the Indus Valley. This contact persisted and became wider, probably motivated by the trade in copper from the [[Hajar Mountains]], which commenced around 3,000 BCE. Sumerian sources talk of the [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] civilisation, which has been identified as encompassing the modern UAE and .

There are six periods of human settlement with distinctive behaviours in the region before Islam, which include the [[Hafit period]] from 3,200 to 2,600 BCE, the [[Umm Al Nar culture]] from 2,600 to 2,000 BCE, and the [[Wadi Suq culture]] from 2,000 to 1,300 BCE. From 1,200 BCE to the advent of Islam in Eastern Arabia, through three distinctive [[Iron Age in the |Iron Ages]] and the [[Mleiha]] period, the area was variously occupied by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] and other forces, and saw the construction of fortified settlements and extensive husbandry thanks to the development of the [[Qanat|''falaj'']] irrigation system.

===Islam===
The spread of [[Islam]] to the northeastern tip of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] is thought to have followed directly from a letter sent by the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] to the rulers of [[]] in 630 CE. This led to a group of rulers travelling to [[Medina]], converting to Islam, and subsequently driving a successful uprising against the unpopular [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanids]], who dominated the coast at the time.{{sfnp|Heard-Bey|1996|p=127}} Following the death of Muhammad, the new Islamic communities south of the [[Persian Gulf]] threatened to disintegrate, with insurrections against the [[Muslim leaders]]. Caliph [[Abu Bakr]] sent an army from the capital [[Medina]] which completed its reconquest of the territory ([[Ridda wars|the Ridda Wars]]) with the [[Battle of Dibba]] in which 10,000 lives are thought to have been lost.{{sfnp|Heard-Bey|1996|pp=127–128}} This assured the integrity of the [[Caliphate]] and the unification of the Arabian Peninsula under the newly emerging [[Rashidun Caliphate]].

In 637, Julfar (in the area of today's [[Ras Al Khaimah]]) was an important port that was used as a staging post for the Islamic invasion of the [[Sasanian Empire]]. The area of the [[Al Ain]]/[[Buraimi Oasis]] was known as Tu'am and was an important trading post for camel routes between the coast and the Arabian interior.{{sfnp|Heard-Bey|1996|pp=22–23}}

The earliest [[Christianity|Christian]] site in the UAE was first discovered in the 1990s, an extensive monastic complex on what is now known as [[Sir Bani Yas]] Island and which dates back to the seventh century. Thought to be [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] and built in 600 CE, the church appears to have been abandoned peacefully in 750 CE. It forms a rare physical link to a legacy of Christianity, which is thought to have spread across the peninsula from 50 to 350 CE following trade routes. Certainly, by the fifth century,  had a bishop named John – the last bishop of  being Etienne, in 676 CE.

The harsh desert environment led to the emergence of the "versatile tribesman", nomadic groups who subsisted due to a variety of economic activities, including animal husbandry, agriculture, and hunting. The seasonal movements of these groups led not only to frequent clashes between groups but also to the establishment of seasonal and semi-seasonal settlements and centres. These formed tribal groupings whose names are still carried by modern , including the [[Bani Yas]] and [[Al Nahyan family|Al Bu Falah]] of [[Abu Dhabi]], Al Ain, [[Liwa Oasis|Liwa]], and the west coast; the [[Dhawahir]], Awamir, [[Al Ali (tribe)|Al Ali]], and [[Manasir (tribe)|Manasir]] of the interior; the [[Sharqiyin]] of the east coast; and the [[Al-Qasimi|Qawasim]] to the north.

With the expansion of European [[colonial empire]]s, [[ Empire|]], [[ Empire|]], and [[ Empire|]] forces appeared in the Persian Gulf region. By the 18th century, the Bani Yas confederation was the dominant force in most of the area now known as Abu Dhabi,{{sfnp|Heard-Bey|1996|p=43}} while the Northern [[Al-Qasimi|Al Qawasim]] (Al Qasimi) dominated maritime commerce. The  maintained an influence over the coastal settlements, building [[Fortification|forts]] in the wake of the bloody 16th-century conquests of coastal communities by [[Afonso de Albuquerque|Albuquerque]] and the  commanders who followed him – particularly on the east coast at [[Muscat]], [[Sohar]], and [[Khor Fakkan]].{{sfnp|Heard-Bey|1996|p=282}}

The southern coast of the Persian Gulf was known to the  as the "[[History of the |Pirate Coast]]", as boats of the Al Qawasim federation harassed -flagged shipping from the 17th century into the 19th. The charge of piracy is disputed by modern  historians, including the current ruler of Sharjah, [[Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi|Sheikh Sultan Al Qasimi]], in his 1986 book ''The Myth of Arab Piracy in the Gulf''.

 expeditions to protect their  trade routes led to campaigns against Ras Al Khaimah and other harbours along the coast, including the [[Persian Gulf campaign of 1809]] and the more successful [[Persian Gulf campaign of 1819|campaign of 1819]]. The following year, Britain and a number of local rulers signed a [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820|maritime truce]], giving rise to the term [[Trucial States]], which came to define the status of the coastal emirates. A further treaty was signed in 1843 and in 1853, the [[Perpetual Maritime Truce]] was agreed. To this was added the 'Exclusive Agreements', signed in 1892, which made the [[Trucial States]] a  protectorate.

Under the 1892 treaty, the trucial sheikhs agreed not to dispose of any territory except to the  and not to enter into relationships with any foreign government other than the  without their consent. In return, the  promised to protect the Trucial Coast from all aggression by sea and to help in case of land attack.  maritime policing meant that pearling fleets could operate in relative security. However, the  prohibition of the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] meant an important source of income was lost to some sheikhs and merchants.

In 1869, the Qubaisat tribe settled at [[Khor Al Adaid]] and tried to enlist the support of the Ottomans. Khor Al Adaid was claimed by Abu Dhabi at that time, a claim supported by the . In 1906, the  Political Resident, [[Percy Cox]], confirmed in writing to the ruler of Abu Dhabi, [[Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan]] ('Zayed the Great'), that Khor Al Adaid belonged to his sheikhdom.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[Pearl hunting|pearling industry]] thrived, providing both income and employment to the people of the Persian Gulf. The [[World War I|First World War]] had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the [[economic depression]] of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the [[cultured pearl]], that wiped out the trade. The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the [[World War II|Second World War]], when the newly independent [[Government of ]] imposed heavy taxation on imported pearls. The decline of pearling resulted in extreme economic hardship in the Trucial States.

In 1922, the  government secured undertakings from the rulers of the Trucial States not to sign concessions with foreign companies without their consent. Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a -led oil company, the [[ Petroleum Company]] (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC, later to become [[BP| Petroleum]], or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC. APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the [[Red Line Agreement]], which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=mid|-deep}} bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of £1 million.

The  set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates. The seven [[sheikh]]s of the [[Emirates of the |emirates]] then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office. In 1952, they formed the Trucial States Council, and appointed [[Adi Bitar|Adi Al Bitar]], Dubai's [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]]'s legal advisor, as secretary general and legal advisor to the council. The council was terminated once the  was formed. The tribal nature of society and the lack of definition of borders between emirates frequently led to disputes, settled either through mediation or, more rarely, force. The [[Trucial  Scouts]] was a small military force used by the  to keep the peace.

In 1953, a subsidiary of [[BP]], D'Arcy Exploration Ltd, obtained an offshore concession from the ruler of Abu Dhabi. BP joined with [[Total SE|Compagnie Française des Pétroles]] (later [[Total SE|Total]]) to form operating companies, Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Ltd (ADMA) and Dubai Marine Areas Ltd (DUMA). A number of undersea oil surveys were carried out, including one led by the famous marine explorer [[Jacques Cousteau]]. In 1958, a floating platform rig was towed from [[Hamburg]], [[]], and positioned over the [[Umm Shaif oil field|Umm Shaif]] pearl bed, in Abu Dhabi waters, where drilling began. In March, it struck oil in the Upper Thamama rock formation. This was the first commercial discovery of the Trucial Coast, leading to the first exports of oil in 1962. ADMA made further offshore discoveries at Zakum and elsewhere, and other companies made commercial finds such as the [[Fateh Oil Field|Fateh oilfield]] off Dubai and the Mubarak field off Sharjah (shared with ).

Meanwhile, onshore exploration was hindered by territorial disputes. In 1955, the [[]] represented Abu Dhabi and  in their dispute with  over the [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Buraimi Oasis]]. A 1974 agreement between Abu Dhabi and  seemed to have settled the Abu Dhabi- [[Territorial dispute|border dispute]], but this has not been ratified. The UAE's border with  was ratified in 2008.

PDTC continued its onshore exploration away from the disputed area, drilling five more bore holes that were also dry. However, on 27 October 1960, the company discovered oil in commercial quantities at the Murban No. 3 well on the coast near Tarif. In 1962, PDTC became the [[Abu Dhabi Petroleum Company]]. As oil revenues increased, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], undertook a massive construction program, building schools, housing, hospitals, and roads. When Dubai's oil exports commenced in 1969, Sheikh [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], the ruler of Dubai, was able to invest the revenues from the limited reserves found to spark the diversification drive that would create the modern [[global city]] of Dubai.

By 1966, it had become clear that the  government could no longer afford to administer and protect the [[Trucial States]], what is now the .  [[Member of Parliament ()|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) debated the preparedness of the [[Royal Navy]] to defend the [[sheikhdom]]s. On 24 January 1968,  Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] announced the government's decision, reaffirmed in March 1971 by Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]], to end the treaty relationships with the seven trucial sheikhdoms. Days after the announcement, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], fearing vulnerability, tried to persuade the  to honour the protection treaties by offering to pay the full costs of keeping the [[ Armed Forces]] in the Emirates. The  [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government rejected the offer. After [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Goronwy Roberts, Baron Goronwy-Roberts|Goronwy Roberts]] informed Sheikh Zayed of the news of  withdrawal, the nine Persian Gulf sheikhdoms attempted to form a union of Arab emirates, but by mid-1971 they were still unable to agree on terms of union even though the  treaty relationship was to expire in December of that year.

Fears of vulnerability were realised the day before independence. An  destroyer group broke formation from an exercise in the lower Gulf, sailing to the [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs|Tunb islands]]. The islands were [[Seizure of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs|taken by force]], civilians and Arab defenders alike allowed to flee. A  warship stood idle during the course of the invasion. A destroyer group approached the island of [[Abu Musa]] as well. But there, [[Khalid bin Muhammad Al Qasimi|Sheikh Khalid bin Muhammad Al Qasimi]] had already negotiated with the  shah, and the island was quickly leased to  for $3 million a year. Meanwhile,  laid claim to swathes of Abu Dhabi. It was not until 1974 that a [[Treaty of Jeddah (1974)|border agreement]] was signed with , formally demarcating the frontiers between the UAE and . The UAE's sense of threat from  influenced its financial support for [[Ba'athist |]] during the [[– War]].

Originally intended to be part of the proposed Federation of Arab Emirates,  became independent in August, and  in September 1971. When the -Trucial Sheikhdoms treaty expired on 1 December 1971, both emirates became fully independent. On 2 December 1971, six of the emirates (Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Sharjah, and Umm Al Quwain) agreed to enter into a union named the . [[Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah|Ras al-Khaimah]] joined later, on 10 January 1972. In February 1972, the [[Federal National Council]] (FNC) was created; it was a 40-member consultative body appointed by the seven rulers. The UAE joined the [[Arab League]] on 6 December 1971 and the [[United Nations]] on 9 December. It was a founding member of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] in May 1981, with Abu Dhabi hosting the first [[GCC Summit|GCC summit]].

In January 2006, Sheikh [[Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], the prime minister of the UAE and the ruler of Dubai, died, and Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]] assumed both roles.

The first ever national elections were held on 16 December 2006. A number of voters chose half of the members of the [[Federal National Council]]. The UAE has largely escaped the [[Arab Spring]], which other countries have experienced; however, 60  activists from [[Al Islah ()|Al Islah]] were apprehended for an alleged coup attempt and the attempt of the establishment of an [[Islamism|Islamist]] state in the UAE. Mindful of the protests in nearby , in November 2012 the UAE outlawed online mockery of its government or attempts to organise public protests through social media.

Two months later, in March, the government announced the closure of shopping malls, schools, and places of worship, in addition to imposing a 24-hour curfew, and suspending all [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] passenger flights. This resulted in a major economic downturn, which eventually led to the merger of more than 50% of the UAE's [[:Category: federal entities|federal agencies]].

The [[Settlement of the Americas|first inhabitants of North America]] are generally hypothesized to have migrated from [[Siberia]] by way of the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] and arrived at least 14,000 years ago. The [[Paleo-]] archeological sites at [[Old Crow Flats]] and [[Bluefish Caves]] are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in . The [[Technological and industrial history of #The Stone Age: Fire (14,000 BC – AD 1600)|characteristics of Indigenous societies]] included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations. [[Indigenous peoples in |Indigenous peoples in present-day ]] include the [[First Nations in |First Nations]], [[Inuit]], and [[Métis people in |Métis]], the last being of [[mixed-blood|mixed descent]] who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and their offspring subsequently developed their own identity.[[File:Indigenous population by census division.svg|upright=1.3|thumb|A map of  showing the percent of [[Population of #Indigenous peoples|self-reported indigenous identity]] (First Nations, Inuit, Métis) by census division, according to the [[2021  census]]]]

The [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous population]] at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million, with a figure of 500,000 accepted by 's [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]]. As a consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent. The decline is attributed to several causes, including the [[Columbian exchange|transfer of European diseases]], to which they had no natural immunity, conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.

Although not without conflict, [[European ]]' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of [[Former colonies and territories in |European colonies in ]], particularly for their role in assisting European [[coureur des bois|coureurs des bois]] and [[voyageurs]] in their explorations of the continent during the [[North  fur trade]]. These early European interactions with First Nations would change from [[Peace and Friendship Treaties|friendship and peace treaties]] to the [[Numbered Treaties|dispossession of Indigenous lands through treaties]]. From the late 18th century, European  forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a western  society. [[Settler colonialism in |Settler colonialism]] reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A period of redress began with the formation of a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission of |reconciliation commission]] by the [[Government of ]] in 2008. This included acknowledgment of [[ genocide of Indigenous peoples|cultural genocide]], [[ Residential Schools Settlement Agreement|settlement agreements]], and betterment of racial discrimination issues, such as addressing the plight of [[missing and murdered Indigenous women]].

It is believed that the first documented European to explore the east coast of  was [[Vikings|Norse]] explorer [[Leif Erikson]]. In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] on the northern tip of [[Newfoundland]]. No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when seafarer [[John Cabot]] explored and claimed 's [[Atlantic |Atlantic coast]] in the name of [[Henry VII of England]]. In 1534,  explorer Jacques Cartier explored the [[Gulf of  Lawrence]] where, on July 24, he planted a {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} cross bearing the words, "long live the King of ", and took possession of the territory New  in the name of [[Francis I of |King Francis I]]. The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the [[Basques|Basque]] and [[ discoveries|]] establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast. In general, early settlements during the [[Age of Discovery]] appear to have been [[Population of #Ephemeral European settlements|short-lived]] due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia.

In 1583, Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]], by the [[royal prerogative]] of Queen [[Elizabeth I]], founded [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's, Newfoundland]], as the first North  [[ overseas possessions| seasonal camp]]. In 1600, the  established their first seasonal trading post at [[Tadoussac]] along the  Lawrence.  explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at [[Port-Royal (Acadia)|Port Royal]] (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608). Among the [[ colonization of the Americas|colonists]] of New , ''[[ |Canadiens]]'' extensively settled the  Lawrence River valley and [[Acadians]] settled the present-day [[The Maritimes|Maritimes]], while fur traders and [[Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery|Catholic missionaries]] explored the [[Great Lakes]], [[Hudson Bay]], and the [[Mississippi watershed]] to [[Louisiana (New )|Louisiana]]. The [[Beaver Wars]] broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North  fur trade.

The  established additional settlements in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in 1610 along with settlements in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to the south. A series of [[ and  Wars|four wars]] erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North  theatre of the [[Seven Years' War]]. Mainland [[Nova Scotia]] came under  rule with the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]] and  and most of New  came under  rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War.

The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] established First Nation treaty rights, created the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]] out of New , and annexed [[Cape Breton Island]] to Nova Scotia. St John's Island (now [[Prince Edward Island]]) became a separate colony in 1769. To avert conflict in [[Quebec]], the  Parliament passed the [[Quebec Act]] 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and [[Ohio River|Ohio Valley]]. More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against  rule. It re-established the  language, Catholic faith, and [[Law of | civil law]] there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies. The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti- sentiment in the years prior to the [[ Revolution]].

After the successful  War of Independence, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]] recognized the independence of the newly formed [[]] and set the terms of peace, ceding [[ North America]]n territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country. The  war of independence also caused a large out-migration of [[Loyalists]], the settlers who had fought against  independence. Many moved to , particularly Atlantic , where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. [[New Brunswick]] was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the incorporation of [[ John, New Brunswick]], as 's first city. To accommodate the influx of -speaking Loyalists in Central , the [[Constitutional Act 1791|Constitutional Act of 1791]] divided the province of  into -speaking Lower  (later [[Quebec]]) and -speaking Upper  (later [[Ontario# West (1841–1867)|Ontario]]), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.

The  were the main front in the [[War of 1812]] between the  and the [[ of Great Britain and |]]. Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed. Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over {{formatnum:960000}} arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850. New arrivals included refugees escaping the [[Great  Famine]] as well as [[ Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking Scots displaced by the [[Highland Clearances]]. Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to  before 1891.

The desire for [[responsible government]] resulted in the abortive [[Rebellions of 1837]]. The [[Durham Report]] subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of   into  culture. The [[Act of Union 1840]] merged the  into a united Province of  and responsible government was established for all provinces of  North America east of Lake Superior by 1855. The signing of the [[Oregon Treaty]] by Britain and the  in 1846 ended the [[Oregon boundary dispute]], extending the border westward along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]]. This paved the way for  colonies on [[Colony of Vancouver Island|Vancouver Island (1849)]] and in [[Colony of  Columbia (1858–1866)| Columbia (1858)]]. The Anglo- [[Treaty of  Petersburg (1825)]] established the border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US [[Alaska Purchase]] of 1867, disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska–Yukon and Alaska– Columbia border.

===Confederation and expansion===
[[File: provinces evolution 2.gif|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Refer to caption|Animated map showing [[Territorial evolution of |the growth and change of 's provinces and territories]] since Confederation in 1867]]

Following three constitutional conferences, the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867| North America Act, 1867]]'' officially proclaimed  Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: [[Ontario]], Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.  assumed control of [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] to form the [[Northwest Territories]], where the Métis' grievances ignited the [[Red River Rebellion]] and the creation of the province of [[Manitoba]] in July 1870.  Columbia and Vancouver Island (which [[Colony of  Columbia (1866–1871)|had been united]] in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years, while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873. In 1898, during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory. [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] became provinces in 1905. Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the  population emigrated south to the US.

To open [[Western |the West]] and encourage European immigration, the Government of  sponsored the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the [[ Pacific Railway]]), passed the ''[[Dominion Lands Act]]'' to regulate settlement and established the [[North-West Mounted Police]] to assert authority over the territory. This [[Post-Confederation  (1867–1914)#Expansion|period of westward expansion]] and [[National Policy|nation building]] resulted in the displacement of many [[Plains |Indigenous peoples of the  Prairies]] to "[[ reserve]]s", clearing the way for ethnic European [[block settlement]]s. This caused the collapse of the [[History of bison conservation in #Plains bison|Plains Bison in western ]] and the introduction of European [[Agriculture in |cattle farms and wheat fields]] dominating the land. The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands. The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves. During this time,  introduced the ''[[ Act]]'' extending its control over the First Nations to education, government and legal rights.

Because Britain still maintained control of 's foreign affairs under the  North America Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought [[Military history of  during World War I| into the First World War]]. Volunteers sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] later became part of the [[ Corps]], which played a substantial role in the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] and other major engagements of the war. The [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]] erupted when the [[Unionist Party ()|Unionist]] Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with [[conscription]] was met with vehement objections from -speaking Quebecers. In 1919,  joined the [[League of Nations]] independently of Britain, and the ''[[Statute of Westminster, 1931]]'', affirmed 's independence.

The [[Great Depression in ]] during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country. In response to the downturn, the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a [[welfare state]] (as pioneered by [[Tommy Douglas]]) in the 1940s and 1950s. On the advice of Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], [[Declaration of war by #Nazi |war with  was declared]] effective September 10, 1939, by King [[George VI]], seven days after the . The delay underscored 's independence.

The first  Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million  served in the armed forces during the [[Second World War]].  troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 [[Dieppe Raid]], the [[Allied invasion of ]], the [[Normandy landings]], the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]], and the [[Battle of the Scheldt]] in 1944.  provided asylum for the [[ monarchy]] while that country was [[Reichskommissariat Niederlande|occupied]] and is credited by the  for major contributions to [[Liberation Day ()|its liberation]] from [[Nazi ]]. Despite another [[Conscription Crisis of 1944|conscription crisis in Quebec in 1944]],  finished the war with a large army and strong economy.

===Contemporary era===
The financial crisis of the Great Depression led the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a [[Crown colony]] ruled by a  governor. After two [[1948 Newfoundland referendums|referendums]], Newfoundlanders voted to join  in 1949 as a province.

's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new [[ identity]], marked by the adoption of the [[Flag of |maple leaf flag]] in 1965, the implementation of [[official bilingualism]] ( and ) in 1969, and the institution of [[Multiculturalism#|official multiculturalism]] in 1971. [[Socially democratic]] programs were also instituted, such as [[Medicare ()|Medicare]], the [[ Pension Plan]], and [[Student financial aid in | Student Loans]]; though, provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.

In 1999, [[Nunavut]] became 's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government.

At the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s, giving birth to a secular [[Quebec nationalism|nationalist]] movement. The radical [[Front de libération du Québec]] (FLQ) ignited the [[October Crisis]] with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970, and the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|{{Not a typo|sovereigntist}}]] [[Parti Québécois]] was elected in 1976, organizing an [[1980 Quebec referendum|unsuccessful referendum]] on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the [[Meech Lake Accord]] failed in 1990. This led to the formation of the [[Bloc Québécois]] in Quebec and the invigoration of the [[Reform Party of ]] in the West. A [[1995 Quebec referendum|second referendum]] followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent. In 1997, the [[Supreme Court of |Supreme Court]] ruled [[Reference Re Secession of Quebec|unilateral secession]] by a province would be unconstitutional, and the [[Clarity Act]] was passed by Parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation.

In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook  society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of [[Air  Flight 182]] in 1985, the largest mass murder in  history; the [[École Polytechnique massacre]] in 1989, a [[School shooting|university shooting]] targeting female students; and the [[Oka Crisis]] of 1990, the first of a number of violent confrontations between provincial governments and Indigenous groups.  joined the [[Gulf War]] in 1990 and was active in [[List of  peacekeeping missions|several peacekeeping missions]] in the 1990s, including operations in the [[Balkans]] during and after the [[Yugoslav Wars]], and in [[]], resulting in an incident that has been described as "[[ affair|the darkest era in the history of the  military]]".  sent [[ in the War in |troops to  in 2001]], resulting in the largest amount of [[ Forces casualties in | deaths]] for any single military mission since the [[ in the  War| War]] in the early 1950s.

The [[Germanic peoples]] are thought to have [[Ethnogenesis|emerged]] from the [[Jastorf culture]] during the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] or early [[Pre-Roman Iron Age|Iron Age]]. From southern [[Scandinavia]] and [[northern ]], they expanded south, east, and west, coming into contact with the [[Celts|Celtic]], [[ peoples|]], [[Balts|Baltic]], and [[Early Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. Southern  was inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, who belonged to the wider [[La Tène culture]]. They were later assimilated by the Germanic conquerors.

Under [[Augustus]], the [[Roman Empire]] began to invade lands inhabited by the Germanic tribes, creating a short-lived Roman province of [[Germania Antiqua|Germania]] between the Rhine and [[Elbe]] rivers. In 9 AD, three [[Roman legion]]s were [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|defeated]] by [[Arminius]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. The outcome of this battle dissuaded the Romans from their ambition of conquering [[Germania]] and is thus considered one of the most important events in [[European history]].{{sfn|Murdoch|2004|p=57}} By 100 AD, when [[Tacitus]] wrote ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the [[Limes Germanicus]]), occupying most of modern .

Around 260, Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands. After the invasion of the [[Huns]] in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest: the Franks established the [[Frankish Kingdom]] and pushed east to subjugate [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]].

In 996, [[Pope Gregory V|Gregory V]] became the first  Pope, appointed by his cousin [[Otto III]], whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern  and [[Burgundy (historical region)|Burgundy]] under the [[Salian]] emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the [[Investiture Controversy]].

Under the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors (1138–1254),  princes encouraged  settlement to the south and east ({{lang|de|[[Ostsiedlung]]}}).{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp= 19–20}} Members of the [[Hanseatic League]], mostly north  towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp= 13–24}} The population declined starting with the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|Great Famine]] in 1315, followed by the [[Black Death]] of 1348–1350. The [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]] issued in 1356 provided the constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven [[prince-elector]]s.{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|p= 27}}

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, laying the basis for the [[democratization of knowledge|democratisation of knowledge]]. In 1517, [[Martin Luther]] incited the Protestant Reformation and [[Luther Bible|his translation of the Bible]] began the standardisation of the language; the 1555 [[Peace of Augsburg]] tolerated the "Evangelical" faith ([[Lutheranism]]), but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects ({{lang|la|[[cuius regio, eius religio]]}}). From the [[Cologne War]] through the [[Thirty Years' War]]s (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated  lands and significantly reduced the population.

The [[Peace of Westphalia]] ended religious warfare among the [[Imperial Estate]]s. The legal system initiated by a series of [[Imperial Reform]]s (approximately 1495–1555) provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]. The [[House of Habsburg]] held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] in 1740. Following the [[War of the  Succession]] and the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], Charles VI's daughter [[Maria Theresa]] ruled as [[Queen consort|empress consort]] when her husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], became emperor.

[[File: Confederation (1815).svg|thumb|The  Confederation in 1815]]
Following the fall of [[Napoleon]], the [[Congress of Vienna]] founded the  Confederation, a loose league of [[States of the  Confederation|39 sovereign states]]. The appointment of the [[emperor of ]] as the permanent president reflected the Congress's rejection of [[Prussia]]'s rising influence. Disagreement within [[Concert of Europe|restoration]] politics partly led to the rise of [[Liberalism in |liberal]] movements, followed by new measures of repression by  statesman [[Klemens von Metternich]]. The {{lang|de|[[Zollverein]]}}, a tariff union, furthered economic unity. In light of [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movements in Europe]], intellectuals and commoners started the [[ revolutions of 1848–1849|revolutions of 1848 in the  states]], raising the  question. King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] was offered the title of emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, a temporary setback for the movement.

[[File:Berlin Nationaldenkmal Kaiser Wilhelm mit Schloss 1900.jpg|thumb|right|[[Berlin Palace]], the main residence of the Kings of Prussia and  Emperors]]
King [[William I,  Emperor|William I]] appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]] as the [[Minister President of Prussia]] in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded the [[Second Schleswig War|war with  in 1864]]; the subsequent decisive Prussian victory in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866 enabled him to create the [[North  Confederation]] which excluded [[ Empire|]]. After the defeat of  in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the  princes proclaimed the founding of the  Empire in 1871. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the King of Prussia ruled as its [[ Emperor|Emperor]] ({{lang|de|Kaiser}}), and Berlin became its capital.

The [[Nazi Party]] led by Adolf Hitler became the largest party in the Reichstag after the [[July 1932  federal election|election of July 1932]], and [[President Hindenburg]] appointed Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933.{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp=155–158, 172–177}} After the [[Reichstag fire]], [[Reichstag Fire Decree|a decree]] abrogated basic [[civil rights]], and the first [[Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]] opened.

=== East and West  ===
{{Main|History of  (1945–1990)|Allied-occupied |West |East }}

[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|The [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989 was one of the first developments in the end of the [[Cold War]], leading ultimately to the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]].]]

After the surrender of Nazi , the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] ''[[de jure]]'' [[Berlin Declaration (1945)|abolished the  state]] and partitioned Berlin and 's remaining territory into four occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by , the [[]], and the [[]], were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of  (FRG) ({{langx|de|Bundesrepublik Deutschland}}); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the  Democratic Republic (GDR) ({{lang|de|Deutsche Demokratische Republik}}; DDR). They were informally known as West  and East . East  selected [[East Berlin]] as its capital, while West  chose [[Bonn]] as a provisional capital to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was temporary.

West  was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a [[social market economy]]. In 1948, West  became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the  [[Marshall Plan]]. [[Konrad Adenauer]] was elected the first [[Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of |federal chancellor of ]] in 1949. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth ({{lang|de|[[Wirtschaftswunder]]}}) beginning in the early 1950s. West  joined [[NATO]] in 1955 and was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]]. On 1 January 1957, the [[Saar Protectorate|Saarland]] joined West .

East  was an [[Eastern Bloc]] state under political and military control by the [[Soviet Union]] via occupation forces and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Although East  claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members ({{lang|de|[[Politburo|Politbüro]]}}) of the communist-controlled [[Socialist Unity Party of ]], supported by the {{lang|de|[[Stasi]]|italic=no}}, an immense secret service. While [[Communist propaganda|East  propaganda]] was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged threat of a West  invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity. The [[Berlin Wall]], built in 1961, prevented East  citizens from escaping to West , becoming a symbol of the [[Cold War]].

Tensions between East and West  were reduced in the late 1960s by Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]'s {{lang|de|[[Ostpolitik]]}}. In 1989,  decided to dismantle the [[Iron Curtain]] and [[Removal of 's border fence with |open its border with ]], causing the emigration of thousands of East  to West  via  and . This had devastating effects on the GDR, where [[Monday demonstrations in East |regular mass demonstrations]] received increasing support. In an effort to help retain East  as a state, the East  authorities eased border restrictions, but this actually led to an acceleration of the {{lang|de|Wende}} reform process, culminating in the ''[[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to |Two Plus Four Treaty]]'' under which  regained full sovereignty. This permitted [[ reunification]] on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the [[New states of |five re-established states]] of the former GDR. The [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989 became a symbol of the [[fall of Communism]], the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]],  reunification and {{lang|de|[[Die Wende]]}} ("the turning point").

Based on the [[Berlin/Bonn Act]] (1994), [[Berlin]] again became the [[capital of ]], while [[Bonn]] obtained the unique status of a {{lang|de|Bundesstadt}} (federal city), retaining some federal ministries. The relocation of the government was completed in 1999, and modernisation of the East  economy was scheduled to last until 2019.

Since reunification,  has taken a more active role in the [[European Union]], signing the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in 1992 and the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007, and co-founding the [[eurozone]].  sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the [[1999 NATO bombing in Yugoslavia|Balkans]] and sent [[Bundeswehr| troops]] to [[]] as part of a NATO effort to provide [[War in  (2001–2021)|security in that country]] after the ousting of the [[Taliban]].

In the [[2005  federal election|2005 elections]], [[Angela Merkel]] became the first female chancellor. In 2009, the  government approved a €50&nbsp;billion stimulus plan.

{{See also|Megalithic Temples of |Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum|Għar Dalam}}

 has been inhabited from at least {{Circa|6500 BC}}, with the arrival of [[Mesolithic]] hunter-gatherers likely originating from Sicily. Discoveries at [[Latnija Cave]] led by the  archaeologist Eleanor Scerri included the remains of hearths, stone tools and an abundant and diverse range of animal bones. These included indigenous red deer that are now extinct, fish and marine mammals, as well as abundant edible marine [[gastropods]]. To arrive on , these hunter-gatherers had to cross around 100&nbsp;km of open water, documenting the longest yet-known sea crossing by hunter-gatherers in the Mediterranean. The extinction of the [[Hippopotamus melitensis|dwarf hippos]], [[Cygnus falconeri|giant swans]] and [[Palaeoloxodon falconeri|dwarf elephants]] has historically been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on . However this seems unlikely since recent work suggests these animals went extinct many thousands of years before the arrival of the first people, and no such animals were found in association with the earliest known Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. The claim for an earlier occupation of the island by [[Neanderthal]]s is widely rejected. <sup>Supplementary Information</sup> [[Early European Farmers|Neolithic Farmers]], also originating from Sicily, are thought to have arrived on the islands by around 5400 BC. Prehistoric farming settlements dating to the [[Early Neolithic]] include the [[Għar Dalam]] cave site in the uppermost layers associated with domesticated animals. The Neolithic population on  grew [[cereals]], raised livestock and, in common with other ancient Mediterranean cultures, worshipped a [[mother goddess|fertility figure]].

[[File:Ggantija Temples, Xaghra, Gozo.jpg|thumb|[[Ġgantija]] [[megalith]]ic temple complex]]
A culture of [[megalith]]ic temple builders then either supplanted or arose from this early period. Around 3500 BC, these people built some of the oldest existing free-standing structures in the world in the form of the megalithic [[Ġgantija]] temples on [[Gozo]]; other early temples include those at [[Ħaġar Qim]] and [[Mnajdra]]. The temples have distinctive architecture, typically a complex [[trefoil]] design, and were used from 4000 to 2500 BC. Tentative information suggests that [[animal sacrifice]]s were made to the goddess of fertility, whose statue is now in the National Museum of Archaeology in Valletta. Another archaeological feature of the  Islands often attributed to these ancient builders is equidistant uniform grooves dubbed "cart tracks" or "cart ruts", which can be found in several locations throughout the islands, with the most prominent being those found in [[Misraħ Għar il-Kbir|Misraħ Għar il-Kbir ("Clapham Junction")]]. These may have been caused by wooden-wheeled carts eroding soft limestone. The culture apparently disappeared from the islands around 2500 BC, possibly due to famine or disease.

After 2500 BC, the  Islands were depopulated for several decades until an influx of [[Bronze Age]] immigrants, a culture that [[Cremation|cremated]] its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called [[dolmen]]s. They are claimed to belong to a population certainly different from that which built the previous megalithic temples. It is presumed the population arrived from [[Sicily]] because of the similarity of  dolmens to some small constructions found there.

Their seat of government was apparently at [[Mdina]], which shared the island's name;{{sfnp|Culican|1992}}{{sfnp|Filigheddu|2006}} the primary port was at [[Cospicua]] on the [[Grand Harbour]], which they called Maleth. After the [[Siege of Tyre (332 BC)|fall of Phoenicia]] in 332 BC, the area came under the control of [[Carthage]]. During this time, the people on  mainly cultivated [[olive]]s and [[Ceratonia siliqua|carob]] and produced textiles.

During the [[First Punic War]], the island was conquered after harsh fighting by [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]]. After the failure of his expedition, the island fell back in the hands of Carthage, only to be [[Capture of  (218 BC)|conquered again]] during the [[Second Punic War]] in {{nowrap|218 BC}} by the [[Roman consul]] [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 218 BC)|Tiberius Sempronius Longus]].  became a {{lang|la|[[Civitas|Foederata Civitas]]}}, a designation that meant it was exempt from paying [[tribute]] or the rule of [[Roman law]], and fell within the jurisdiction of the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]]. Its capital at [[Mdina]] was renamed {{lang|la|[[Melita (ancient city)|Melita]]|italic=no}} after the  and Roman name for the island. Punic influence, however, remained vibrant on the islands with [[Cippi of Melqart]], pivotal in deciphering the [[Punic language]], dedicated in the second {{nowrap|century BC.}} Local Roman coinage, which ceased in the first {{nowrap|century BC,}} indicates the slow pace of the island's Romanisation: the last locally minted coins still bear inscriptions in [[Ancient ]] and Punic motifs, showing the resistance of the  and Punic cultures.

In the second century, Emperor [[Hadrian]] upgraded the status of  to a {{nowrap|[[municipium]]}} or free town: the island's local affairs were administered by four [[duumviri|duumvirs]] and a municipal senate, while a Roman [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]] living in [[Mdina]] represented the [[proconsul]] of Sicily. In {{nowrap|AD 58,}} [[Paul the Apostle]] and [[Luke the Evangelist]] were shipwrecked on the islands. Paul remained for three months, preaching the [[Early Christianity|Christian faith]]. The island is mentioned at the [[Acts of the Apostles]] as Melitene ({{langx|grc|Μελιτήνη}}).

In 395, when the [[Division of the Roman Empire|Roman Empire was divided for the last time]] at the death of [[Theodosius I]], , following Sicily, fell under the control of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. During the [[Migration Period]] as the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|Western Roman Empire declined]],  was conquered or occupied a number of times. From 454 to 464 the islands were subdued by the [[Vandals]], and after 464 by the [[Ostrogoths]]. In 533, [[Belisarius]], on his way to conquer the [[Vandal Kingdom]] in North Africa, reunited the islands under Imperial ([[Byzantine Empire|Eastern]]) rule. Little is known about the [[Byzantine |Byzantine rule in ]]: the island depended on the [[Sicily (theme)|theme of Sicily]] and had  governors and a small  garrison. While the bulk of population continued to be constituted by the old, [[Latin Church|Latinized]] dwellers, during this period its religious allegiance oscillated between the Pope and the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]]. The Byzantine rule introduced [[|]] families to the  collective.  remained under the [[Byzantine Empire]] until 870, when it was conquered by the [[Arabs]].

 became involved in the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]], and the conquest of  is closely linked with [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|that of Sicily]] that began in 827 after [[Euphemius (Sicily)|Admiral Euphemius]]' betrayal of his fellow Byzantines, requesting that the [[Aghlabids]] invade the island. The [[Muslims|Muslim]] chronicler and geographer [[Kitab al-Rawd al-Mitar|al-Himyari]] recounts that in 870, following [[Siege of Melite (870)|a violent struggle]] against the defending Byzantines, the Arab invaders, first led by Halaf al-Hadim, and later by Sawada ibn Muhammad, pillaged the island, destroying the most important buildings, and leaving it practically uninhabited until it was recolonised by the Arabs from Sicily in 1048–1049. It is uncertain whether this new settlement resulted from demographic expansion in Sicily, a higher [[standard of living]] in Sicily (in which case the recolonisation may have taken place a few decades earlier), or a civil war that broke out among the Arab rulers of Sicily in 1038. The [[Arab Agricultural Revolution]] introduced new irrigation, cotton, and some fruits. The [[Siculo-Arabic]] language was adopted on the island from Sicily; it eventually evolved into the [[ language]].

The [[Normans]] attacked  in 1091, as part of their [[Norman conquest of Sicily|conquest of Sicily]]. The Norman leader, [[Roger I of Sicily]], was welcomed by Christian captives, though contrary to myth he did not tear off a portion of his checkered red-and-white banner and present it to the [[ people|]] in gratitude for having fought on his behalf, forming the basis of the modern [[flag of ]].

The [[Catholic Church]] was reinstated as the state religion, with  under the [[See of Palermo]], and some [[Norman architecture]] sprang up around , especially in its ancient capital [[Mdina]]. [[King Tancred]] made  a [[fief]] of the kingdom and installed a [[Count of ]] in 1192. As the islands were much desired due to their strategic importance, it was during this time that the men of  were militarised to fend off attempted conquest; early Counts were skilled [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] [[privateer]]s.

The kingdom passed on to the [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty from 1194 until 1266. As [[Emperor Frederick II]] began to reorganise his Sicilian kingdom, Western culture and religion started to exert their influence more intensely.  was declared a county and a [[Marquess|marquisate]], but its trade was totally ruined. For a long time it remained solely a fortified [[garrison]].

A mass expulsion of Arabs occurred in 1224, and the entire Christian male population of [[Celano]] in Abruzzo was deported to  in the same year. In 1249 [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], decreed that all remaining Muslims be expelled from  or compelled to convert.

For a brief period, the kingdom passed to the [[Capetian House of Anjou]], but high taxes made the dynasty unpopular in , due in part to [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]]'s war against the Republic of Genoa, and the island of [[Gozo]] was sacked in 1275.

 was ruled by the [[House of Barcelona]], the ruling dynasty of the [[Crown of Aragon]], from 1282 to 1409, with the Aragonese aiding the  insurgents in the [[Sicilian Vespers]] in [[Battle of  (1283)|the naval battle]] in [[Grand Harbour]] in 1283.

Relatives of the [[kings of Aragon]] ruled the island until 1409 when it formally passed to the Crown of Aragon. Early on in the Aragonese ascendancy, the sons of the monarchs received the title [[Count of ]]. During this time much of the local nobility was created. By 1397, however, the bearing of the comital title reverted to a feudal basis, with two families fighting over the distinction. This led King [[Martin I of Sicily]] to abolish the title. The dispute over the title returned when the title was reinstated a few years later and the , led by the local nobility, rose up against Count [[Gonsalvo Monroy]]. Although they opposed the Count, the  voiced their loyalty to the [[List of monarchs of Sicily|Sicilian Crown]], which so impressed [[Alfonso V of Aragon|King Alfonso V]] that he did not punish the people for their rebellion. Instead, he promised never to grant the title to a third party and incorporated it back into the crown. The city of [[Mdina]] was given the title of ''Città Notabile''.

In September&nbsp;1429, [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsid]] Saracens [[Siege of  (1429)|attempted to capture ]] but were repelled by the . The invaders pillaged the countryside and took about 3,000&nbsp;inhabitants as [[Slavery in |slaves]].

On 23 March 1530, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], gave the islands to the [[Knights Hospitaller]] under the leadership of Frenchman [[Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam]], in perpetual lease for which they had to pay an annual [[Tribute of the  Falcon|tribute of a single  Falcon]]. These knights, a military religious order also known as the Order of St John and later as the Knights of , had been driven out of [[Rhodes]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1522.

[[Knights Hospitaller|The Knights Hospitaller]] ruled  and Gozo between 1530 and 1798. During this period, the strategic and military importance of the island grew greatly as the small yet efficient fleet of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of  John]] launched their attacks from this new base targeting the shipping lanes of the Ottoman territories around the Mediterranean Sea.

In 1551, the population of the island of [[Gozo]] (around 5,000 people) were [[Barbary slave trade|enslaved]] by [[Barbary pirates]] and taken to the [[Barbary Coast]] in North Africa.

The knights, led by Frenchman [[Jean Parisot de Valette]], withstood the [[Great Siege of ]] by the Ottomans in 1565. The knights, with the help of ,  and  forces, repelled the attack. After the siege they decided to increase 's [[fortification]]s, particularly in the inner-harbour area, where the new city of [[Valletta]], named in honour of Valette, was built. They also established [[watchtower]]s along the coasts&nbsp;– the [[Wignacourt towers|Wignacourt]], [[Lascaris towers|Lascaris]] and [[De Redin towers]]&nbsp;– named after the Grand Masters who ordered the work. The Knights saw the completion of many architectural and cultural projects, including the embellishment of Città Vittoriosa (modern [[Birgu]]) and the construction of new cities including Città Rohan (modern [[Ħaż-Żebbuġ]]). However, by the late 1700s the power of the Knights had declined.

The Knights' reign ended when [[Napoleon I of |Napoleon]] captured  on his way to [[]] during the [[ Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1798| Revolutionary Wars]] in 1798. During 12–18 June 1798, Napoleon resided at the [[Palazzo Parisio (Valletta)|Palazzo Parisio]] in Valletta. He reformed national administration with the creation of a Government Commission, twelve municipalities, a public finance administration, the abolition of all feudal rights and privileges, the [[Abolitionism in |abolition of slavery]] and the granting of freedom to all [[ people|]] and [[Jews|Jewish]] slaves. On the judicial level, a family code was framed and twelve judges were nominated. [[Public education]] was organised along principles laid down by Bonaparte himself, providing for primary and secondary education. He then sailed for , leaving a substantial garrison in .

The  forces left behind became unpopular with the , due particularly to the  forces' hostility towards Catholicism and pillaging of local churches to fund war efforts.  financial and religious policies so angered the  that they rebelled, forcing the  to depart. Great Britain, along with the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], sent ammunition and aid to the , and Britain also sent [[Royal Navy|its navy]], which blockaded the islands.

On 28 October 1798, Captain Sir [[Alexander Ball]] successfully completed negotiations with the  garrison on Gozo for a surrender and transfer of the island to the . The  transferred the island to the locals that day, and it was administered by Archpriest [[Saverio Cassar]] on behalf of [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand III of Sicily]]. [[Gozo (independent state)|Gozo remained independent]] until Cassar was removed by the  in 1801.

General [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois]] surrendered his  forces in 1800.  leaders presented the main island to Sir Alexander Ball, asking that the island become a  [[Dominion]]. The  people created a [[ Protectorate#Declaration of Rights|Declaration of Rights]] in which they agreed to come "under the protection and sovereignty of the King of the free people, His Majesty the King of the  of Great Britain and ". The Declaration also stated that "his Majesty has no right to cede these Islands to any power...if he chooses to withdraw his protection, and abandon his sovereignty, the right of electing another sovereign, or of the governing of these Islands, belongs to us, the inhabitants and aborigines alone, and without control."

On 7 June 1919, the  public rioted in response to a [[cost-of-living crisis]];  troops eventually managed to suppress the riots, killing four in the process. The event, known as [[Sette Giugno]] ("7 June"), is commemorated every year and is one of five National Days. Until the [[Second World War]],  politics was dominated by the [[Language Question ()|Language Question]] fought out by [[Italophone]] and [[Anglophone]] parties.

Before the Second World War, Valletta was the location of the Royal Navy's Mediterranean fleet headquarters; however, despite [[Winston Churchill]]'s objections, the command was moved to [[Alexandria]], , in 1937 out of fear that it was too susceptible to air attacks from Europe.

=== Prehistory and Iberian peoples ===
{{Main|Prehistoric Iberia}}

[[File:2014 Castro de Santa Trega. Galiza-2.jpg|thumb|Celtic castro in Galicia]]
Archaeological research at [[Archaeological site of Atapuerca|Atapuerca]] indicates the Iberian Peninsula was populated by [[hominid]]s 1.3&nbsp;million years ago.

[[Human|Modern humans]] first arrived in Iberia from the north on foot about 35,000 years ago. The best-known artefacts of these prehistoric human settlements are the paintings in the [[Altamira (cave)|Altamira cave]] of Cantabria in northern Iberia, which were created from 35,600 to 13,500 [[Before Common Era|BCE]] by [[Cro-Magnon]]. Archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the Iberian Peninsula acted as one of several major refugia from which northern Europe was repopulated following the end of the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]].

The two largest groups inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula before the Roman conquest were the [[Iberians]] and the [[Celts]]. The Iberians inhabited the Mediterranean side of the peninsula. The Celts inhabited much of the interior and Atlantic sides of the peninsula. [[Basques]] occupied the western area of the Pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas. Phoenician-influenced [[Tartessos|Tartessians]] flourished in the southwest. [[Lusitanians]] and [[Vettones]] occupied areas in the central west. Several cities were founded along the coast by [[Phoenicia]]ns. Trading outposts and colonies were established by [[ colonisation|]] in the East. Eventually, Phoenician-[[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] expanded inland towards the meseta. Due to the bellicose inland tribes, the Carthaginians settled on the coasts of the Iberian Peninsula.

=== Roman Hispania and the Visigothic Kingdom ===
{{Main|Hispania|Visigothic Kingdom}}

During the [[Second Punic War]], roughly between 210 and 205&nbsp;BCE, the expanding [[Roman Republic]] captured Carthaginian trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast. It took the Romans nearly two centuries to complete the [[Roman conquest of the Iberian peninsula|conquest of the Iberian Peninsula]]. They retained control of it for over six centuries. Roman rule was bound together by law, language, and the [[Roman road]]. The cultures of the pre-Roman populations were gradually [[Romanization of Hispania|Romanised]] (Latinised) at different rates depending on what part of the peninsula they lived in, with local leaders being admitted into the Roman aristocratic class.{{efn|The ''[[latifundia]]'' (sing., ''latifundium''), large estates controlled by the aristocracy, were superimposed on the existing Iberian landholding system.}}

Hispania, the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula, served as a granary for the Roman market, and its harbours exported gold, [[wool]], [[olive oil]], and wine. Agricultural production increased with the introduction of irrigation projects, some of which remain in use. Emperors [[Hadrian]], [[Trajan]], [[Theodosius I]], and the philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] were born in Hispania.{{efn|The poets [[Martial]], [[Quintilian]] and [[Lucan]] were also born in Hispania.}} Christianity was introduced into Hispania in the 1st century CE, and it became popular in the cities in the 2nd century. Most of 's present languages and religions, as well as the basis of its laws, originate from this period. Starting in 170 CE, incursions of North-African [[Mauri]] in the province of [[Hispania Baetica|Baetica]] took place.

The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]], together with the [[Sarmatian]] [[Alans]], entered the peninsula after 409, weakening the Western Roman Empire's jurisdiction over Hispania. The Suebi established a kingdom in north-western Iberia. The Vandals established themselves in the south of the peninsula by 420, before crossing over to North Africa in 429. As the western Roman empire disintegrated, the social and economic base became greatly simplified. The successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire, including Christianity and assimilation into the evolving Roman culture.

The [[Byzantine]]s established an occidental province, [[Spania]], in the south, with the intention of reviving Roman rule throughout Iberia. Eventually, however, Hispania was reunited under [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic rule]].

=== Muslim era and ''Reconquista'' ===
{{See also|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Al-Andalus|Reconquista}}
From 711 to 718, as part of the expansion of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] which had [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|conquered North Africa]] from the [[Byzantine Empire]], nearly all of the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by Muslims from across the Strait of Gibraltar, resulting in the collapse of the Visigothic Kingdom. Only a small area in the mountainous north of the peninsula stood out of the territory seized during the initial invasion. The [[Kingdom of Asturias|Kingdom of Asturias-León]] consolidated upon this territory. Other Christian kingdoms, such as [[kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] in the mountainous north, eventually surged upon the consolidation of counties of the Carolingian ''[[Marca Hispanica]]''. For several centuries, the fluctuating frontier between the Muslim and Christian-controlled areas of the peninsula was along the [[Ebro]] and [[Douro]] valleys.

Conversion to [[Islam]] proceeded at an increasing pace. The ''[[Muwallad|muladíes]]'' (Muslims of ethnic Iberian origin) are believed to have formed the majority of the population of Al-Andalus by the end of the 10th century. A series of [[Viking]] incursions raided the coasts of the Iberian Peninsula in the 9th and 10th centuries. The first recorded [[Viking raid on Seville|Viking raid on Iberia took place in 844]]. Seville was pillaged. It ended in failure with many Vikings killed by the Galicians' [[ballista]]s. Seventy of the Vikings' longships captured on the beach and burned by the troops of King [[Ramiro I of Asturias]]. In the 11th century, the Caliphate of Córdoba collapsed, fracturing into a series of petty kingdoms (''[[Taifa]]s''), often subject to the payment of a form of [[protection racket|protection money]] (''[[Parias]]'') to the Northern Christian kingdoms, which otherwise undertook a southward territorial expansion. The capture of the strategic city of [[Toledo, |Toledo]] in 1085 marked a significant shift in the balance of power in favour of the Christian kingdoms. The arrival from North Africa of the Islamic ruling sects of the [[Almoravids]] and the [[Almohads]] achieved temporary unity upon the Muslim-ruled territory, with a stricter, less tolerant application of Islam, and partially reversed some Christian territorial gains.

[[File:Ferdinand of Aragon, Isabella of Castile (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Catholic Monarchs of ]]]]

The [[Kingdom of León]] was the strongest Christian kingdom for centuries. In 1188, the first form (restricted to the bishops, the magnates, and 'the elected citizens of each city') of modern parliamentary session in Europe was held in [[León ()|León]] ([[Cortes of León]]). The [[Kingdom of Castile]], formed from Leonese territory, was its successor as the strongest kingdom. The kings and the nobility fought for power and influence in this period. The example of the Roman emperors influenced the political objective of the Crown, while the nobles benefited from [[feudalism]].

Muslim strongholds in the [[Guadalquivir Valley]] such as Córdoba (1236) and [[Seville]] (1248) fell to Castile in the 13th century. The [[County of Barcelona]] and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] entered in a dynastic union and gained territory and power in the Mediterranean. In 1229, [[Mallorca]] was conquered, as was [[Valencia]] in 1238. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the North-African [[Marinid]]s established some enclaves around the Strait of Gibraltar. Upon the conclusion of the [[Granada War]], the [[Kingdom of Granada|Nasrid Sultanate of Granada]] (the remaining Muslim-ruled polity in the Iberian Peninsula after 1246) capitulated in 1492 to the military strength of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], and it was integrated from then on in the Crown of Castile.

===  Empire ===
{{Main| Empire}}

[[File:La sevilla del sigloXVI.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Late 16th-century Seville, the harbor enjoying the exclusive right to trade with the New World]]
In 1469, the crowns of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon were united by the marriage of their monarchs, Isabella I and Ferdinand II, respectively. In 1492, as part of the [[ Inquisition]], Jews were forced to choose between conversion to Catholicism or expulsion; as many as 200,000 Jews were [[Expulsion of Jews from |expelled from Castile and Aragon]]. The year 1492 also marked the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the [[New World]], during a voyage funded by Isabella. Columbus's first voyage crossed the Atlantic and reached the Caribbean Islands, beginning the European exploration and conquest of the Americas.

The [[Treaty of Granada]] guaranteed religious tolerance towards Muslims, for a few years before Islam was outlawed in 1502 in Castile and 1527 in Aragon, leading the remaining Muslim population to become nominally Christian ''[[Morisco]]s''. About four decades after the [[War of the Alpujarras]] (1568–1571), over 300,000 [[Expulsion of the Moriscos|''moriscos'' were expelled]], settling primarily in North Africa.

[[File: Empire (diachronic).svg|thumb|upright=1.2|A diachronic map of the  Empire]]
The unification of the crowns of Aragon and Castile by the marriage of their sovereigns laid the basis for modern  and the  Empire, although each kingdom of  remained a separate country socially, politically, legally, and in currency and language.

[[Habsburg ]] was one of the leading world powers throughout the 16th century and most of the 17th century, a position reinforced by trade and wealth from colonial possessions and became the world's leading [[ Navy|maritime power]]. It reached its apogee during the reigns of the first two  Habsburgs—[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V/I]] (1516–1556) and [[Philip II of |Philip II]] (1556–1598). This period saw the [[ conquest of the Aztec Empire| conquest of the Aztec]] and [[ conquest of the Inca Empire|Inca]] empires, the [[ Wars]], the [[Schmalkaldic War]], the [[ Revolt]], the [[War of the  Succession]], clashes with the [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|Ottomans]], intervention in the [[ Wars of Religion]], and the [[Anglo- War (1585–1604)|Anglo- War]].

[[File:Principales Rutas Comerciales del Imperio Español.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Main trade routes of the  Empire]]
Through exploration and conquest or royal marriage alliances and inheritance, the [[ Empire]] expanded across vast areas in the Americas, the Indo-Pacific, Africa as well as the European continent, including holdings in the  Peninsula, the [[Low Countries]] and the [[Franche-Comté]]. The so-called [[Age of Discovery]] featured explorations by sea and by land, the opening-up of new [[trade route]]s across oceans, conquests and the beginnings of European [[colonialism]]. [[Precious metal]]s, spices, luxuries, and previously unknown plants brought to the metropole played a leading part in transforming the European understanding of the globe. 
[[File:Plaza Mayor de Madrid 06.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Plaza Mayor of Madrid built in 1619 during the reign of Philip III.]]
The cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the [[ Golden Age]]. The expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the Americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from Europe devastated  indigenous populations. The rise of [[humanism]], the [[Counter-Reformation]] and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the [[School of Salamanca]], which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as [[international law]] and human rights.
's 16th-century maritime supremacy was demonstrated by the victory over the [[Ottoman Empire]] at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571 and over  at the [[Battle of Vila Franca do Campo|Battle of Ponta Delgada]] in 1582, and then after the setback of the [[ Armada]] in 1588, in a series of victories against [[England]] in the [[Anglo- War (1585–1604)|Anglo- War of 1585–1604]]. In the middle decades of the 17th century, 's maritime power went into a long decline with mounting defeats against the [[ Republic]] ([[Battle of the Downs]]) and then England in the [[Anglo- War (1654–1660)|Anglo- War of 1654–1660]]. By the 1660s,  was struggling to defend its overseas possessions from pirates and privateers.

The [[Protestant Reformation]] increased 's involvement in religiously charged wars, forcing ever-expanding military efforts across Europe and in the Mediterranean. By the middle decades of a war- and [[Great Plague of Seville|plague]]-ridden 17th-century Europe, the  Habsburgs had enmeshed  in continent-wide religious-political conflicts. These conflicts drained  of resources and undermined the economy generally.  managed to hold on to most of the scattered Habsburg empire, and help the imperial forces of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] reverse a large part of the advances made by Protestant forces.

 was finally forced to recognise the [[ Restoration War|separation of ]] and the United Provinces ( Republic), and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to  in the latter stages of the immensely destructive, Europe-wide [[Thirty Years' War]]. In the latter half of the 17th century,  went into a gradual decline, during which it surrendered several small territories to  and England; however, it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire, which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century.

====18th century====
[[File:La familia de Felipe V (Van Loo).jpg|thumb|[[The Family of Philip V (1743)|The family of Philip V]]. During the [[Enlightenment in ]] a new royal family reigned, the [[House of Bourbon]].]]
The decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne, which consumed the first years of the 18th century. The [[War of the  Succession]] was a wide-ranging international conflict combined with a civil war, and cost the kingdom its European possessions and its position as a leading European power.

During this war, a new dynasty originating in , the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], was installed. The Crowns of Castile and Aragon had been long united only by the Monarchy and the common institution of the Inquisition's [[ Inquisition|Holy Office]]. A number of reform policies, the so-called [[Bourbon Reforms]], were pursued by the Monarchy with the overarching goal of centralised authority and administrative uniformity. They included the abolishment of many of the old regional privileges and laws, as well as the customs barrier between the Crowns of Aragon and Castile in 1717, followed by the introduction of new property taxes in the Aragonese kingdoms.

The 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the  empire. The predominant economic policy was an interventionist one, and the State also pursued policies aiming towards infrastructure development as well as the abolition of internal customs and the reduction of export tariffs. Projects of agricultural colonisation with new settlements took place in the south of mainland .{{Sfn|Martínez Shaw|2016|pp=14; 23}} [[Enlightenment in |Enlightenment]] ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom's elite and monarchy.

=== Liberalism and nation state ===

In 1793,  went to war against the revolutionary new [[First  Republic| Republic]] as a member of [[War of the First Coalition|the first Coalition]]. The subsequent [[War of the Pyrenees]] polarised the country in a reaction against the [[Francization|gallicised]] elites and following defeat in the field, peace was made with  in 1795 at the [[Peace of Basel]] in which  lost control over two-thirds of the island of [[Hispaniola]]. In 1807, a secret treaty between [[Napoleon I of |Napoleon]] and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against Britain and .  troops entered the country to invade  but instead occupied 's major fortresses. The  king abdicated and a puppet kingdom satellite to the  Empire was installed with [[Joseph Bonaparte]] as king.

The [[Dos de Mayo Uprising|2 May 1808 revolt]] was one of many uprisings across the country against the  occupation. These revolts marked the beginning of a devastating [[Peninsular War|war of independence]] against the Napoleonic regime.{{sfn|Gates|2001|p=20}} Further military action by  armies, [[guerrilla]] warfare and an Anglo- allied army, combined with [[Napoleon's Invasion of |Napoleon's failure on the  front]], led to the retreat of  imperial armies from the Iberian Peninsula in 1814, and the return of [[Ferdinand VII of |King Ferdinand VII]].{{sfn|Gates|2001|p=467}}

During the war, in 1810, a revolutionary body, the [[Cortes of Cádiz]], was assembled to coordinate the effort against the Bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution. It met as one body, and its members represented the entire  empire. In 1812, a [[ Constitution of 1812|constitution]] for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared, but after the fall of the Bonapartist regime, the  king dismissed the Cortes Generales, set on ruling as an [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]].

The  occupation of mainland  created an opportunity for overseas [[Criollo people|''criollo'']] elites who resented the privilege towards [[Peninsulars|Peninsular elites]] and demanded [[retroversion of the sovereignty to the people]]. Starting in 1809 the  colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence, leading to the [[  wars of independence]] that put an end to the metropole's grip over the [[ Main]]. [[Reconquista ( America)|Attempts to re-assert control]] proved futile with opposition not only in the colonies but also in the Iberian peninsula and army revolts followed. By the end of 1826, the only  colonies  held were [[Captaincy General of |]] and [[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]]. The Napoleonic War left  economically ruined, deeply divided and politically unstable. In the 1830s and 1840s, [[Carlism]] (a reactionary legitimist movement supportive of an alternative Bourbon branch), fought against the government forces supportive of Queen [[Isabella II of |Isabella II]]'s dynastic rights in the [[Carlist Wars]]. Government forces prevailed, but the conflict between [[Progressive Party ()|''progressives'']] and ''[[Moderate Party ()|moderates]]'' ended in a weak early constitutional period. The 1868 [[Glorious Revolution ()|Glorious Revolution]] was followed by the 1868–1874 progressive ''[[Sexenio Democrático]]'' (including the short-lived [[First  Republic]]), which yielded to a stable monarchic period, the [[Restoration ()|Restoration]] (1875–1931).

In the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the  and . In 1895 and 1896 the [[ War of Independence]] and the [[ Revolution]] broke out and eventually<!--For whatever reasons; it is not for here to go into long explanations!--> the  became involved. The [[– War]] was fought from April to August 1898 and resulted in  losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of North Africa. ''El Desastre'' (the Disaster), as the war became known in , gave added impetus to the [[Generation of '98]]. Although the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity, the 20th century brought little social peace.  played a minor part in the [[scramble for Africa]]. It remained neutral [[ during World War I|during World War I]]. The heavy losses suffered by the colonial troops in conflicts in northern  against Riffians forces brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy.

Industrialisation, the development of railways and incipient capitalism developed in several areas of the country, particularly in [[Barcelona]], as well as [[labour movement]] and socialist and anarchist ideas. The [[1870 Barcelona Workers' Congress]] and the [[1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition]] are good examples of this. In 1879, the [[ Socialist Workers' Party]] was founded. A trade union linked to this party, [[Unión General de Trabajadores]], was founded in 1888. In the anarcho-syndicalist trend of the labour movement in , [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] was founded in 1910 and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] in 1927. Catalanism and Vasquism, alongside other nationalisms and regionalisms in , arose in that period: the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] formed in 1895 and [[Regionalist League of Catalonia]] in 1901. Political corruption and repression weakened the democratic system of the constitutional monarchy of a two-parties system. The July 1909 [[Tragic Week ()|Tragic Week]] events and repression exemplified the social instability of the time. The [[La Canadiense strike]] in 1919 led to the first law limiting the working day to eight hours.

After a period of Crown-supported dictatorship from 1923 to 1931, the first elections since 1923, largely understood as a plebiscite on Monarchy, took place: the [[1931  local elections|12 April 1931 municipal elections]]. These gave a resounding victory to the Republican-Socialist candidacies in large cities and provincial capitals, with a majority of monarchist councilors in rural areas. The king left the country and the proclamation of the Republic on 14 April ensued, with the formation of a provisional government. A [[ Constitution of 1931|constitution]] for the country was passed in October 1931 following the [[1931  general election|June 1931 Constituent general election]], and a series of cabinets presided by [[Manuel Azaña]] supported by republican parties and the [[ Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] followed. In the election held in 1933 the right triumphed and in 1936, the left. During the [[Second  Republic|Second Republic]] there was a great political and social upheaval, marked by a sharp radicalisation of the left and the right. Instances of political violence during this period included the burning of churches, the [[Sanjurjada|1932 failed coup d'état led by José Sanjurjo]], the [[Revolution of 1934]] and numerous attacks against rival political leaders. On the other hand, it is also during the Second Republic when important reforms to modernise the country were initiated: a democratic constitution, agrarian reform, restructuring of the army, political decentralisation and [[Women's suffrage|women's right to vote]].

=== Civil War and Francoist dictatorship ===
{{Main| Civil War| Revolution of 1936|Francoist }}

[[File:Reemplazo republicano.jpg|thumb|Republican volunteers at [[Teruel]], 1936]]
[[File:Meeting at Hendaye (en.wiki).jpg|thumb|right| leader [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] at the [[Meeting at Hendaye]], 1940]]

The  Civil War broke out in 1936: on 17 and 18 July, part of the military [[ coup of July 1936|carried out a coup d'état]] that triumphed in only part of the country. The situation led to a civil war, in which the territory was divided into two zones: one [[Republican faction ( Civil War)|under the authority of the Republican government]], that counted on outside support from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[]] (and from [[International response to the  Civil War#International Brigades|International Brigades]]), and the other controlled by the putschists (the [[Nationalist faction ( Civil War)|Nationalist or rebel faction]]), most critically supported by [[Nazi ]] and [[Fascist  (1922–1943)|Fascist ]]. The Republic was not supported by the Western powers due to the -led policy of [[non-intervention]]. General [[Francisco Franco]] was sworn in as the supreme leader of the rebels on 1 October 1936. An uneasy relationship between the Republican government and the grassroots anarchists who had initiated a partial [[ Revolution of 1936|social revolution]] also ensued.

The civil war was viciously fought and there were [[ Civil War#Atrocities|many atrocities committed by all sides]]. The [[ Civil War|war]] claimed the lives of over 500,000 people and caused the flight of up to a half-million citizens from the country. On 1 April 1939, five months before the beginning of [[World War II]], the rebel side led by Franco emerged victorious, imposing a dictatorship over the whole country. Thousands were imprisoned after the civil war in [[Francoist concentration camps]].

The regime remained nominally "[[neutrality (international relations)|neutral]]" for much of the Second World War, although it was [[ in World War II|sympathetic]] to [[Axis Powers|the Axis]] and provided the Nazi [[Wehrmacht]] with [[Blue Division| volunteers in the Eastern Front]]. The only legal party under Franco's dictatorship was the [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS]] (FET y de las JONS), formed in 1937 upon the merging of the Fascist [[Falange Española de las JONS]] and the Carlist traditionalists and to which the rest of right-wing groups supporting the rebels also added. The name of "[[Movimiento Nacional]]", sometimes understood as a wider structure than the FET y de las JONS proper, largely imposed over the later's name in official documents along the 1950s.

After the war  was politically and economically isolated, and was kept out of the United Nations. This changed in 1955, during the [[Cold War]] period, when it became strategically important for the US to establish a military presence on the Iberian Peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the Soviet Union into the Mediterranean basin. US Cold War strategic priorities included the dissemination of  educational ideas to foster modernisation and expansion. In the 1960s,  registered an [[ miracle|unprecedented rate of economic growth]] which was propelled by [[ miracle#Industrialization|industrialisation]], a mass internal migration from rural areas to [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and the creation of a mass tourism industry. Franco's rule was also characterised by [[Francoist #Fascism and authoritarianism|authoritarianism]], [[Francoist # nationalism|promotion of a unitary national identity]], [[National Catholicism]], and [[Language policies of Francoist |discriminatory language policies]].

=== Restoration of democracy ===
{{Main| transition to democracy| society after the democratic transition}}

In 1962, a group of politicians involved in the opposition to Franco's regime inside the country and in exile met in the congress of the [[European Movement]] in Munich, where they made a resolution in favour of democracy. With Franco's death in November 1975, [[Juan Carlos I of |Juan Carlos]] succeeded to the position of [[King of ]] and [[head of state]] in accordance with the Francoist law. With the approval of the new [[ Constitution of 1978]] and the [[ transition to democracy|restoration of democracy]], the State [[devolution|devolved]] much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on [[autonomous communities of |autonomous communities]]. The [[ 1977 Amnesty Law]] let people of Franco's regime continue inside institutions without consequences, even perpetrators of some crimes during transition to democracy like the [[Massacre of 3 March 1976 in Vitoria]] or [[1977 Massacre of Atocha]].<!-- The 'founding chairman' of the current leading political party in , the [[People's Party ()|People's Party]], was [[Manuel Fraga Iribarne|Manuel Fraga]] who had been a minister in Franco's government and yet continued with his political career until shortly before his death in 2012.-->

In the Basque Country, moderate [[Basque nationalism]] coexisted with a [[Basque Conflict|radical nationalist movement]] led by the armed organisation [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] until the latter's dissolution in May 2018. The group was formed in 1959 during Franco's rule but had continued to wage its violent campaign even after the restoration of democracy and the return of a large measure of regional autonomy.

On 23 February 1981, rebel elements among the security forces seized the Cortes in an attempt to impose [[23-F|a military-backed government]]. King Juan Carlos took personal command of the military and successfully ordered the coup plotters, via national television, to surrender.

During the 1980s the democratic restoration made possible a growing open society. New cultural movements based on freedom appeared, like [[La Movida Madrileña]]. In May 1982  joined [[NATO]], followed by [[1986  NATO membership referendum|a referendum]] after a strong social opposition. That year the [[ Socialist Workers Party]] (PSOE) came to power, the first left-wing government in 43 years. In 1986  joined the [[European Economic Community]], which later became the [[European Union]]. The PSOE was replaced in government by the [[People's Party ()|Partido Popular]] (PP) in 1996 after scandals around participation of the government of [[Felipe González]] in the [[GAL (paramilitary group)|Dirty war against ETA]].

===Economic prosperity and crash===

On 1 January 2002,  fully adopted the [[euro]], and  experienced strong economic growth, well above the EU average during the early 2000s. However, well-publicised concerns issued by many economic commentators at the height of the boom warned that extraordinary property prices and a high foreign trade deficit were likely to lead to a painful economic collapse.

In 2002, the [[Prestige oil spill]] occurred with big ecological consequences along 's Atlantic coastline. In 2003 [[José María Aznar]] supported US president [[George W. Bush]] in the [[ War]], and a strong movement against war rose in  society. In March 2004 a local [[Islamist]] terrorist group inspired by [[Al-Qaeda]] carried out the largest terrorist attack in Western European history when they killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800 others by [[2004 Madrid train bombings|bombing commuter trains]] in Madrid. Though initial suspicions focused on the Basque terrorist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], evidence of Islamist involvement soon emerged. Because of the proximity of the [[2004  general election]], the issue of responsibility quickly became a political controversy, with the main competing parties PP and PSOE exchanging accusations over the handling of the incident. The PSOE won the election, led by [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]].

In the early 2000s, the proportion of [[Immigration to #Currently|'s foreign born population]] increased rapidly during its economic boom but then declined due to the [[2008 financial crisis]]. In 2005, the  government legalised [[Same-sex marriage in |same sex marriage]], becoming the third country worldwide to do so. Decentralisation was supported with much resistance of Constitutional Court and conservative opposition, so did gender politics like quotas or the law against gender violence. Government talks with ETA happened, and the group announced its permanent cease of violence in 2010.

The bursting of the [[ property bubble]] in 2008 led to the [[2008–2014  financial crisis]]. High levels of unemployment, cuts in government spending and corruption in [[Royal family]] and [[People's Party ()|People's Party]] served as a backdrop to the [[2011–12  protests]]. [[Catalan independentism]] also rose. In 2011, [[Mariano Rajoy]]'s conservative [[People's Party ()|People's Party]] won the election with 44.6% of votes. As prime minister, he implemented austerity measures for EU bailout, the EU Stability and Growth Pact. On 19 June 2014, the monarch, Juan Carlos, abdicated in favour of his son, who became [[Felipe VI]].

===Constitutional issues===
[[File:01.10.2017 Referendum 1-OCT (4).jpg|thumb|right|Catalans casting their votes in [[Barcelona]] during the [[2017 Catalan independence referendum]]]] 

In October 2017 a [[2017 Catalan independence referendum|Catalan independence referendum]] was held and the [[Catalan parliament]] voted to unilaterally declare [[2017 Catalonia declaration of independence|independence from ]] to form a Catalan Republic on the day the [[Senate of | Senate]] was discussing approving direct rule over Catalonia as called for by the  Prime Minister. On the same day the Senate granted the power to impose direct rule and Rajoy dissolved the Catalan parliament and called a new election. No country recognised Catalonia as a separate state.

In June 2018, the [[Congress of Deputies]] passed a [[2018 vote of no confidence in the government of Mariano Rajoy|motion of no-confidence against Rajoy]] and replaced him with the PSOE leader [[Pedro Sánchez (politician)|Pedro Sánchez]]. In 2019, the first ever coalition government in  was formed, between PSOE and Unidas Podemos. Between 2018 and 2024,  faced an [[2018–2023  institutional crisis|institutional crisis]] surrounding the mandate of the [[General Council of the Judiciary]] (CGPJ), until finally the mandate got renovated. In January 2020, the [[COVID-19]] virus was confirmed to have [[COVID-19 pandemic in |spread to ]], causing life expectancy to drop by more than a year. The European Commission economic recovery package [[Next Generation EU]] was created to support the EU member states to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, and will be in use in the period 2021–2026. In March 2021,  became the sixth nation in the world to make [[Legality of euthanasia|active euthanasia legal]]. 

Following the [[2023  general election|general election on 23 July 2023]], Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez once again formed a coalition government, this time with [[Sumar (electoral platform)|Sumar]] (successors of [[Unidas Podemos]]).
In 2024, the first non-independentist Catalan regional president in over a decade, [[Salvador Illa]], was elected, normalising the constitutional and institutional relations between the national and the regional administrations. According to latest polls, only 17.3% of Catalans feel themselves as "only Catalan". 46% of Catalans would answer "as  as Catalan", while 21.8% "more Catalan than ". Accordind to a 2024 poll of University of Barcelona, over 50% of Catalans would vote against independence, while less than 40% would vote in favour.

===Pre-colonial period===

The earliest known inhabitants of  were pre-ceramic, pre-agricultural peoples who arrived as early as 3000 BCE. These groups, often referred to as "Archaic people," were hunter-gatherers who migrated down the archipelago from [[Florida]]. Due to the absence of pottery and other durable artifacts, their cultural affiliations remain uncertain. Around 100 BCE, the islands saw the arrival of the [[Saladoid]] people, a ceramic-using, agricultural society that migrated northward from the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]] region in present-day [[]]. They introduced agriculture and pottery to the islands and established settled communities.

By approximately 800 CE, the [[Igneri]] people, associated with the [[Arawak]] linguistic group, had settled on the islands. The Igneri were known for their peaceful nature and religious practices, and they continued the agricultural traditions of their predecessors.

Around 1300 CE, the [[Kalinago]] people, also known as the [[Kalinago|Island Caribs]], migrated to . Renowned for their seafaring skills and warrior culture, the Kalinago displaced the Igneri and established dominance over the islands. They named [[ Kitts]] "Liamuiga," meaning "fertile land," and [[Nevis]] "Oualie," meaning "land of beautiful waters."

===European arrival and early colonial period (1493–1700)===
[[Christopher Columbus]] was the first European to sight the islands in 1493. The first settlers were the  in 1623, led by [[Thomas Warner (explorer)|Thomas Warner]], who established a settlement at [[Old Road Town]] on the west coast of St Kitts after achieving an agreement with the Carib chief [[Ouboutou Tegremante]].{{rp|15–18}} The  later also settled on St Kitts in 1625 under [[Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc]]. As a result, both parties agreed to partition the island into  and  sectors. From 1628 onward the  also began settling on Nevis.

The  and , intent on exploitation of the island's resources, encountered resistance from the native Caribs (Kalinago), who waged war during the first three years of the settlements' existence. The Europeans resolved to rid themselves of this problem. An ideological campaign was waged by colonial chroniclers, dating back to the , as they produced literature which denied the Kalinagos' humanity (a literary tradition carried through the late-seventeenth century by such authors as [[Jean-Baptiste du Tertre]] and Pere Labat). In 1626 the Anglo- settlers joined forces to [[Kalinago Genocide of 1626|massacre the Kalinago]] at a place that became known as [[Bloody Point]], allegedly to preempt a Carib plan to expel or kill all European settlers. Thereafter, the  and  established large sugar plantations which were worked by imported African slaves. This made the planter-colonists rich, but drastically altered the islands' demographics as black slaves soon came to outnumber Europeans.{{rp|26–31}}

A  expedition of 1629 sent to enforce  claims [[Battle of St. Kitts (1629)|destroyed the  and  colonies]] and deported the settlers back to their respective countries. As part of [[Anglo- War (1625-1630)|the war]] settlement in 1630, the  permitted the re-establishment of the  and  colonies.{{rp|19–23}}  later formally recognised Britain's claim to St Kitts with the [[Treaty of Madrid (1670)]], in return for  cooperation in the fight against piracy.

As  power declined,  Kitts became a key base for  and  expansion in the Caribbean. From St Kitts the  settled the islands of [[Antigua]], [[Montserrat]], [[Anguilla]] and [[Tortola]], and the  settled [[Martinique]], the [[Guadeloupe]] archipelago and [[ Barthélemy]]. During the late 17th century,  and England fought for control over St Kitts and Nevis, fighting wars in [[Battle of Nevis|1667]],{{rp|41–50}} [[Nine Years' War#Asia and the Caribbean|1689–90]]{{rp|51–55}} and [[War of the  Succession|1701–13]]. The  renounced their claim to the islands with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713.{{rp|55–60}} The islands' economy, already shattered by war, was further harmed by natural disasters: In 1690 an earthquake destroyed Jamestown, capital of Nevis, forcing the construction of a new capital at [[Charlestown, Nevis|Charlestown]]. Further damage was caused by a hurricane in 1707.{{rp|105–108}}

=== colonial period (1700–1983)===
The colony had recovered by the turn of the 18th century, and St Kitts had become the richest  Crown Colony per capita in the Caribbean as result of its slave-based [[sugar industry]] by the close of the 1700s. The 18th century also saw Nevis, formerly the richer of the two islands, being eclipsed by St Kitts in economic importance.{{rp|75}}{{rp|126,137}} [[Alexander Hamilton]], the future U.S. secretary of the Treasury, was born on Nevis in 1755 or 1757.

[[File:BrimstoneHill01.jpg|thumb|right|The fortress on Brimstone Hill, focus of the successful  invasion of 1782]]
As Britain became embroiled in [[ Revolutionary War|war with its  colonies]], the  decided to use the opportunity to [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|re-capture St Kitts]] in 1782; however St Kitts was given back and recognised as  territory in the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)]].

The African slave trade was terminated within the  Empire in 1807, and slavery outlawed completely in 1834. A four-year "apprenticeship" period followed for each slave, in which they worked for their former owners for wages. On Nevis 8,815 slaves were freed, while St Kitts freed 19,780.{{rp|174}}{{rp|110,114–117}}

, along with Anguilla, were federated in 1882. In the first few decades of the 20th century economic hardship and lack of opportunities led to the growth of a labour movement; [[the Great Depression]] prompted sugar workers to go on strike in 1935. The 1940s saw the founding of the [[ Labour Party|St Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla Labour Party]] (later renamed the  Labour Party, or SKNLP) under [[Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw]]. Bradshaw later became Chief Minister and then Premier of the colony from 1966 to 1978; he sought to gradually bring the sugar-based economy under greater state control.{{rp|151–152}} The more conservative-leaning [[People's Action Movement]] party (PAM) was founded in 1965.

After a brief period as part of the [[West Indies Federation]] (1958–62), the islands became an [[ Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla|associated state]] with full internal autonomy in 1967. Residents of Nevis and Anguilla were unhappy with St Kitts's domination of the federation, and Anguilla unilaterally declared independence in 1967. In 1971 Britain resumed full control of Anguilla, but it was formally separated in 1980.{{rp|147–149}} Attention then focused on Nevis, with the [[Nevis Reformation Party]] seeking to safeguard the smaller island's interests in any future independent state. Eventually it was agreed that the island would have a degree of autonomy with its own [[Premier of Nevis|Premier]] and [[Nevis Island Assembly|Assembly]], as well as the constitutionally-protected right to unilaterally secede if a referendum on independence resulted in a two-thirds majority in favour.

===Post independence era (1983–present)===
[[File:TimothyHarris.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Timothy Harris, Prime Minister 2015–2022]]
St Kitts and Nevis achieved full independence on 19 September 1983. [[Kennedy Simmonds]] of the PAM, Premier since 1980, duly became the country's first [[List of Prime Ministers of |Prime Minister]]. St Kitts and Nevis opted to remain within the [[ Commonwealth]], at that time retaining Queen Elizabeth as [[Monarchy of St Kitts and Nevis|Monarch]], represented locally by a [[Governor-General of |Governor-General]].
Kennedy Simmonds went on to win elections in [[1984  general election|1984]], [[1989  general election|1989]] and [[1993  general election|1993]], before being unseated when the SKNLP returned to power in 1995 under [[Denzil Douglas]].

In Nevis, growing discontent with their perceived marginalisation within the federation led to a [[Nevis independence referendum, 1998|referendum to separate]] from St Kitts in 1998, which though resulting a 62% vote to secede, fell short of the required two-thirds majority to be legally enacted.

In late-September 1998, [[Hurricane Georges]] caused approximately $458,000,000 in damages and limited GDP growth for the year and beyond. Meanwhile, the sugar industry, in decline for years and propped up only by government subsidies, was closed completely in 2005.

In 2012,  was declared free of [[malaria]], according to the [[World Health Organization]].

The [[2015  general election]] was won by [[Timothy Harris]] and his recently formed [[People's Labour Party ()|People's Labour Party]], with backing from the PAM and the Nevis-based [[Concerned Citizens' Movement]] under the '[[Team Unity ()|Team Unity]]' banner.

In June 2020, Team Unity coalition of the incumbent government, led by Prime Minister Timothy Harris, won general [[2020  general election|elections]] by defeating  Labour Party (SKNLP).

[[File:Rock Art .jpg|thumb|left|Rock art in the [[Sahara Desert]]]]
The ancient tribes of  were [[Berbers|Berber]], [[– languages|-]], and [[Bafour]] peoples. The Bafour were among the first Saharan peoples to abandon their previously nomadic lifestyle and adopt a primarily agricultural one. In response to the gradual desiccation of the [[Sahara]], they eventually migrated southward. Many of the Berber tribes have claimed to have [[]]i (and sometimes other [[Arabs|Arab]]) origins. Little evidence supports those claims; however, a 2000 [[DNA]] study of the  people suggested some ancient connection might exist between the peoples.

The [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyads]] were the first [[Arab Muslims]] to enter . During the [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic conquests]], they made incursions into  and were present in the region by the end of the seventh century. Many [[Berbers|Berber]] tribes in  fled the arrival of the Arabs to the [[Gao]] region in [[]].

Other peoples also migrated south past the Sahara and into [[West Africa]]. In the 11th century, several nomadic Berber confederations in the desert regions overlapping present-day  joined to form the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] movement. They expanded north and south, spawning an important empire that stretched from the Sahara to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in [[Europe]]. According to a disputed Arab tradition, the Almoravids traveled south and conquered the ancient and extensive [[ Empire]] around 1076.

From 1644 to 1674, the indigenous peoples of the area that is modern  made what became their final effort to repel the  [[Maqil]] Arabs who were invading their territory. This effort, which was unsuccessful, is known as the [[Char Bouba war|Char Bouba War]]. The invaders were led by the [[Beni Ḥassān|Beni Hassan]] tribe. The descendants of the Beni Hassan warriors became the [[hassane|upper stratum]] of [[Moors|Moorish]] society. [[Hassaniya Arabic|Hassaniya]], a bedouin [[Varieties of Arabic|Arabic dialect]] named for the Beni Hassan, became the dominant language among the largely [[nomad]]ic population.

In 1901, [[Xavier Coppolani]] took charge of the imperial mission. Through a combination of strategic alliances with [[Zawaya]] tribes and military pressure on the [[Hassane]] warrior nomads, he managed to extend  rule over the  [[emirate]]s. Beginning in 1903 and 1904, the  armies succeeded in occupying [[Emirate of Trarza|Trarza]], [[Brakna Region|Brakna]], and [[Tagant Region|Tagant]]. However the northern emirate of [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar]] held out longer; the emirate was aided by the anticolonial rebellion (or ''[[jihad]]'') of ''shaykh'' [[Ma al-'Aynayn|Maa al-Aynayn]] and by insurgents from Tagant and the other occupied regions. In 1904,  organized the territory of , and it became part of [[ West Africa]], first as a [[protectorate]] and later as a colony. In 1912, the  armies defeated Adrar, and incorporated it into the territory of .

 rule brought legal prohibitions against slavery and an end to interclan warfare. During the colonial period 90% of the population remained nomadic.

Ould Taya moderated 's previous pro- stance, and re-established ties with [[]] during the late 1980s. He deepened these ties during the late 1990s and early 2000s, as part of 's drive to attract support from Western states and Western-aligned Arab states. Its position on the [[Western Sahara conflict]] has been, since the 1980s, one of strict neutrality.

The [[– Border War]] started as a result of a conflict in [[Diawara, |Diawara]] between Moorish  herders and [[Demographics of |]] farmers over grazing rights. On 9 April 1989,  guards killed two .

Following the incident, several [[riot]]s erupted in [[Bakel, |Bakel]], [[Dakar]] and other towns in [[]], directed against the mainly Arabized  who dominated the local retail business.

On 3 August 2005, a military coup led by Colonel [[Ely Ould Mohamed Vall]] ended President [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya]]'s 21 years of rule. Taking advantage of Ould Taya's attendance at the funeral of  [[Fahd of |King Fahd]], the military, including members of the presidential guard (BASEP), seized control of key points in the capital [[Nouakchott]]. The coup proceeded without loss of life. Calling themselves the [[Military Council for Justice and Democracy]], the officers released the following statement:

<blockquote>The national armed forces and security forces have unanimously decided to put a definitive end to the oppressive activities of the defunct authority, which our people have suffered from during the past years.</blockquote>

The Military Council later issued another statement naming Colonel Ould Mohamed Vall as president and director of the national police force, the ''Sûreté Nationale''. Vall, once regarded as a firm ally of the now-ousted president, had aided Ould Taya in the coup that had originally brought him to power, and had later served as his Security Chief. Sixteen other officers were listed as members of the council.

Though cautiously watched by the international community, the coup came to be generally accepted, with the military ''junta'' organizing elections within a promised two-year timeline.

{{Main|2008  coup d'état}}
On 6 August 2008, the head of the presidential guards took over the president's palace in Nouakchott, a day after 48 lawmakers from the ruling party resigned in protest of President Abdallahi's policies. The Army surrounded key government facilities, including the state television building, after the president fired senior officers, one of them the head of the presidential guards. The President, Prime Minister [[Yahya Ould Ahmed El Waghef|Yahya Ould Ahmed Waghef]], and Mohamed Ould R'zeizim, Minister of Internal Affairs, were arrested.

The coup was coordinated by General [[Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz]], former chief of staff of the  Army and head of the presidential guard, who had recently been fired. 's presidential spokesman, Abdoulaye Mamadouba, said the President, Prime Minister, and Interior Minister had been arrested by renegade senior  army officers and were being held under house arrest at the presidential palace in the capital.

In the apparently successful and bloodless coup, Abdallahi's daughter, Amal Mint Cheikh Abdallahi, said: "The security agents of the BASEP (Presidential Security Battalion) came to our home and took away my father." The coup plotters, all dismissed in a presidential decree shortly beforehand, included Ould Abdel Aziz, General [[Mohamed Ould Ghazouani|Muhammad Ould Al-Ghazwani]], General Philippe Swikri, and Brigadier General (Aqid) Ahmed Ould Bakri.

A  lawmaker, Mohammed Al Mukhtar, claimed that many of the country's people supported the takeover of a government that had become "an authoritarian regime" under a president who had "marginalized the majority in parliament". However, Abdel Aziz's regime was isolated internationally, and became subject to diplomatic sanctions and the cancellation of some aid projects. Domestically, a group of parties coalesced around Abdallahi to continue protesting the coup, which caused the junta to ban demonstrations and crack down on opposition activists. International and internal pressure eventually forced the release of Abdallahi, who was instead placed under house arrest in his home village. The new government broke off relations with .

After the coup, Abdel Aziz insisted on holding new presidential elections to replace Abdallahi; however, Aziz was forced to reschedule them due to internal and international opposition. During the spring of 2009, the [[Military junta|junta]] negotiated an understanding with some opposition figures and international parties. As a result, Abdallahi formally resigned under protest, as it became clear that some opposition forces had defected from him and most international players, notably including  and , now aligned with Abdel Aziz. The  continued to criticize the coup, but did not actively oppose the elections.

Abdallahi's resignation allowed the [[2009  presidential election|election]] of Abdel Aziz as civilian president, on 18 July, by a 52% majority.

Many of Abdallahi's former supporters criticized this as a political ploy and refused to recognize the results. Despite complaints, the elections were almost unanimously accepted by Western, Arab and African countries, which lifted sanctions and resumed relations with . By late summer, Abdel Aziz appeared to have secured his position and to have gained widespread international and internal support. Some figures, such as Senate chairman [[Messaoud Ould Boulkheir]], continued to refuse the new order and call for Abdel Aziz's resignation.

In February 2011, the waves of the [[Arab Spring]] spread to , where thousands of people took to the streets of the capital.

In November 2014,  was invited as a non-member guest nation to the G20 summit in [[Brisbane]].

In June 2021, former president Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz was arrested amidst a corruption probe into allegations of embezzlement. In December 2023, Aziz was sentenced to 5 years in prison for corruption.

In early 2024, a sudden increase of the number of refugees arriving on the [[Canary Islands]] by boat prompted a visit from [[European Commission]] president [[Ursula von der Leyen]] and  prime minister [[Pedro Sánchez]].

[[File:Codex aureus Epternacensis folio 24 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Text page from the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]], an important surviving codex, was produced in the [[Abbey of Echternach]] in the 11th century.]]

The first traces of settlement in what is now  are dated back to the [[Paleolithic Age]], about 35,000 years ago. From the 6th century BC, [[Celtic tribes]] settled in the region between the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Meuse]].

Six centuries later the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] named the Celtic tribes inhabiting these exact regions collectively as the ''[[Treveri]]''. Many examples of archaeological evidence proving their existence in  have been discovered, the most famous being the Oppidum of [[Titelberg]].

In around 58 to 51 BC, the Romans invaded the country when [[Julius Caesar]] [[Gallic Wars|conquered Gaul]] and part of [[Germania]] up to the Rhine border, thus the area of what is now  became part of the [[Roman Empire]] for the next 450 years, living in relative peace under the [[Pax Romana]].

Similar to those in Gaul, the Celts of  adopted Roman culture, language, morals and a way of life, effectively becoming what historians later described as [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman civilization]]. Evidence from that period includes the [[Dalheim Ricciacum]] and the [[Vichten|Vichten mosaic]], on display at the [[National Museum of History and Art]] in  City.

The territory was infiltrated by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Franks]] from the 4th century, and was abandoned by Rome in AD 406,{{rp|page = 65}} after which it became part of the [[Kingdom of the Franks]]. The Salian Franks who settled in the area are often described as the ones having brought the Germanic language to present-day , since the [[Frankish language|old Frankish]] language spoken by them is considered by linguists to be a direct forerunner of the [[Moselle Franconian language|Moselle Franconian dialect]], which later evolved into, among others, the modern-day [[| language]].{{rp|page=70}}

The [[Christianization]] of  is usually dated back to the end of the 7th century. The most famous figure in this context is [[Willibrord]], a [[Northumbria]]n missionary , who together with other monks established the [[Abbey of Echternach]] in AD 698, and is celebrated annually in the [[dancing procession of Echternach]]. For a few centuries the abbey would become one of northern Europe's most influential abbeys. The [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]], an important surviving codex written entirely in gold ink, was produced here in the 11th century. The so-called [[Emperor's Bible]] and the [[Golden Gospels of Henry III]] were also produced in Echternach at this time.

=== Emergence and expansion (963–1312) ===

[[File:Charles IV-John Ocko votive picture-fragment.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], the 14th-century Holy Roman Emperor and King of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] from the [[House of ]]]]

When the [[Carolingian Empire]] was divided many times starting with the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843, today's  territory became successively part of the [[Kingdom of Middle Francia]] (843–855), the [[Kingdom of Lotharingia]] (855–959) and finally of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] (959–1059), which itself had become a state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

The recorded history of  begins with the acquisition of ''Lucilinburhuc'' (today [[ Castle]]) situated on the [[Bock ()|Bock]] rock by [[Siegfried of |Siegfried, Count of the Ardennes]], in 963 through an exchange act with [[St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier]]. Around this [[Fortifications|fort]], a town gradually developed, which became the center of a state of great strategic value within the Duchy of Lorraine. Over the years, the fortress was extended by Siegfried's descendants and by 1083, one of them, [[Conrad I, Count of |Conrad I]], was the first to call himself a "[[Count of ]]", and with it effectively creating the independent [[County of ]] (which was still a state within the Holy Roman Empire).

By the middle of the 13th century, the counts of  had managed to gain considerable wealth and power and had expanded their territory from the river [[Meuse]] to the [[Moselle]]. By the time of the reign of [[Henry V, Count of |Henry V the Blonde]], [[Bitburg]], [[La Roche-en-Ardenne]], [[Durbuy]], [[Arlon]], [[Thionville]], [[Marville, Meuse|Marville]], [[Longwy]], and in 1264 the competing [[County of Vianden]] (and with it [[St Vith]] and [[Schleiden]]) had either been incorporated directly or become [[vassal states]] to the [[County of ]]. The only major setback during their rise in power came in 1288, when [[Henry VI, Count of |Henry VI]] and his three brothers died at the [[Battle of Worringen]] while trying unsuccessfully to add the [[Duchy of Limburg]] to their realm. But despite the defeat, the Battle of Worringen helped the Counts of  to achieve military glory, which they had previously lacked, as they had mostly enlarged their territory by means of inheritances, marriages and fiefdoms.

The ascension of the Counts of  culminated when [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] became [[King of the Romans]], [[King of ]] and finally, in 1312, [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

With the ascension of Henry VII as Emperor, the dynasty of the [[House of ]] not only began to rule the [[Holy Roman Empire]], but rapidly began to exercise growing influence over other parts of Central Europe as well.

Henry's son, [[John the Blind]], in addition to being Count of , also became [[King of Bohemia]]. He remains a major figure in  history and [[folklore]] and is considered by many historians the epitome of [[chivalry]] in medieval times. He is also known for having founded the [[Schueberfouer]] in 1340 and for his heroic death at the [[Battle of Crécy]] in 1346. John the Blind is considered a [[Folk hero|national hero]] in .

In the 14th and early 15th centuries, three more members of the House of  reigned as Holy Roman Emperors and Bohemian Kings: John's descendants [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] (who also was [[King of |King of  and ]]), and [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia|Wenceslaus IV]]. Charles IV created the long-lasting [[Golden Bull of 1356]], a decree which fixed important aspects of the constitutional structure of the Empire.  remained an independent fief (county) of the Holy Roman Empire, and in 1354, Charles IV elevated it to the status of a [[duchy]] with his half-brother [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of |Wenceslaus I]] becoming the first [[Duke of ]]. While his kin were occupied ruling and expanding their power within the Holy Roman Empire and elsewhere, Wenceslaus, annexed the [[County of Chiny]] in 1364, and with it, the territories of the new [[Duchy of ]] reached its greatest extent.

During these 130 years, the House of  was contending with the [[House of Habsburg]] for supremacy within the Holy Roman Empire and Central Europe. It all came to end in 1443, when the House of  suffered a succession crisis, precipitated by the lack of a male heir to assume the throne. Since Sigismund and [[Elizabeth of Görlitz]] were both heirless, all possessions of the  Dynasty were redistributed among the European aristocracy. The Duchy of  become a possession of [[Philip the Good]], [[Duke of Burgundy]].

As the House of  had become extinct and  now became part of the [[Burgundian ]], this would mark the start of nearly 400 years of foreign rule over .

=== Habsburg rule and  invasions (1444–1794) ===
{{See also|Fortress of }}

In 1482, [[Philip the Handsome]] inherited all of what became then known as the [[Habsburg ]], and with it the Duchy of . For nearly 320 years  would remain a possession of the mighty House of Habsburg, at first under  rule (1506–1556), then under [[ | rule (1556–1714)]], before going back again to [[ | rule (1714–1794)]].<br />
With having become a Habsburg possession, the Duchy of  became, like many countries in Europe at the time, heavily involved in the many conflicts for dominance of Europe between the Habsburg-held countries and the [[Kingdom of ]].

In 1542, the [[King of ]], [[Francis I of |François I]], invaded  twice, but the Habsburgs under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] managed to reconquer the Duchy each time.

Under the Treaty,  ceded the  fortresses of [[Stenay]], Thionville, and [[Montmédy]], and the surrounding territory to , effectively reducing the size of  for the first time in centuries.

In context of the [[Nine Years' War]] in 1684, [[Siege of  (1684)| invaded  again]], conquering and occupying the Duchy until 1697 when it was returned to the  to garner support for the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] cause during the prelude to the [[War of the  Succession]]. When the war broke out in 1701  and the   were administered by the pro- faction under the governor [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]] and sided with the Bourbons. The duchy was subsequently occupied by the pro- allied forces during the conflict and was awarded to  at its conclusion in 1714.

As the Duchy of  repeatedly passed back and forth from  and  to  rule, each of the conquering nations contributed to strengthening and expanding the [[Fortress of |Fortress]] that the Castle of  had become over the years. One example of this includes  military engineer [[Marquis de Vauban]] who advanced the fortifications around and on the heights of the city, fortification walls that are still visible today.

During the [[War of the First Coalition]], [[First  Republic|Revolutionary ]] invaded the  , and with it, . In the years 1793 and 1794 most of the Duchy was conquered relatively quickly and the [[ Revolutionary Army]] committed many atrocities and pillages against the  civilian population and abbeys, the most infamous being the massacres of [[Differdange]] and [[Dudelange]], as well as the destruction of the abbeys of [[Clairefontaine Abbey|Clairefontaine]], [[Abbey of Echternach|Echternach]] and [[Orval Abbey|Orval]]. However the Fortress of  [[Siege of  (1794–95)|resisted for nearly 7 months]] before the  forces holding it surrendered. 's long defence led [[Lazare Carnot]] to call  "the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar", giving rise to the city's nickname ''the Gibraltar of the North''.

 was annexed by , becoming the [[Forêts|''département des forêts'']] (department of forests), and the incorporation of the former Duchy as a ''département'' into  was formalized at the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] in 1797.
From the start of the occupation the new  officials in , who spoke only , implemented many republican reforms, among them the principle of [[laicism]], which led to an outcry in strongly Catholic . Additionally  was implemented as the only official language and  people were barred access to all civil services. When the  Army introduced military duty for the local population, riots broke out which culminated in 1798 when  peasants started a rebellion. Even though the  managed to rapidly suppress this revolt called ''[[Peasants' War (1798)|Klëppelkrich]]'', it had a profound effect on the historical memory of the country and its citizens.

However, many republican ideas of this era continue to have a lasting effect on ; one of the many examples features the implementation of the Napoleonic [[Napoleonic Code|Code Civil]] which was introduced in 1804 and is still valid today.

=== National awakening (1815–1890) ===
{{See also| question}}
After the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|defeat]] of [[Napoleon]] in 1815, the [[Congress of Vienna]] decided to restore the Duchy of . However, as the territory had been part of the Holy Roman Empire as well as the Habsburgian  in the past, both the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the newly formed [[ of the ]], which included both the present Kingdom of the  and , now claimed possession of the territory. Thus the great powers decided that  would become a member state of the newly formed [[ Confederation]], but at the same time would be joined with the  in [[personal union]] under [[King William I of the ]], the son of the last Stadtholder of the  Republic, William V, Prince of Orange. To satisfy Prussia, it was decided that not only would the [[Fortress of ]] be manned by [[Prussian Army|Prussian troops]], but also that large parts of  territory (mainly the areas around Bitburg and St. Vith) would become Prussian possessions. This marked the second time that the Duchy of  was reduced in size and is generally known as the [[Partitions of |Second Partition of ]]. To compensate the Duchy for this loss, it was decided to elevate the Duchy to a [[Grand Duchy]], thus giving the  monarchs the additional title of [[Grand Duke of ]]. However, from 1816 to 1830, [[William I of the |William I]] ignored the Duchy's sovereignty, treating  as a conquered nation while subjecting  to high taxes.

After  became an independent country following the victorious [[ Revolution| Revolution of 1830–1831]], it claimed the entire Grand-Duchy of  as being part of . However, neither the  King, who was also Grand Duke of , nor Prussia wanted to lose their grip on the mighty fortress of  and therefor did not agree with the  claims. The dispute would be resolved at the [[Treaty of London (1839)|1839 Treaty of London]], where the [[Partitions of |Third Partition of ]] was decided. This time the territory was reduced by more than half, as the predominantly [[francophone]] [[ ()|western part of the country]] (but also the then -speaking part of [[Arelerland]]) was transferred to the new Kingdom of  under [[Leopold I of ]], thereby giving  its modern-day borders. The treaty of 1839 also established full independence of the remaining Germanic-speaking Grand-Duchy of .

In 1842,  joined the  Customs Union (''[[Zollverein]]''). This resulted in the opening of the  market, the development of [[Steel industry in |'s steel industry]], and expansion of [[Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois|'s railway network]] from 1855 to 1875.

After the [[ Crisis]] of 1866 nearly led to war between Prussia and , as both were unwilling to see the other taking influence over  and its mighty fortress, the Grand Duchy's independence and neutrality were reaffirmed by the [[Treaty of London, 1867|Second Treaty of London]] and Prussia was finally willing to withdraw its troops from the Fortress of  under the condition that the fortifications would be dismantled. That happened the same year. At the time of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] in 1870, 's neutrality was respected, and neither  nor  invaded the country.

As a result of the recurring disputes between the major European powers, the people of  gradually developed a consciousness of independence and a national awakening took place in the 19th century. The people of  began referring to themselves as ''[[]]'', rather than being part of one of the larger surrounding nations. This consciousness of ''[[Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinn]]'' ("''We want to remain what we are")'' culminated in 1890, when the last step towards full independence was finally taken: due to a succession crisis the [[ monarchy]] ceased to hold the title Grand-Duke of . Beginning with [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of |Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg]], the Grand-Duchy would have [[Nassau-Weilburg|its own monarchy]], thus reaffirming its full independence.

In August 1914, during [[World War I]], [[Imperial ]] violated 's [[Neutral country|neutrality]] by invading it to defeat . Nevertheless, despite the [[ occupation of  during World War I| occupation]],  was allowed to maintain much of its independence and political mechanisms. Unaware of the fact that  secretly planned to annex the Grand-Duchy in case of a  victory (the [[Septemberprogramm]]), the  government continued to pursue a policy of strict neutrality. However, the  population did not believe  had good intentions, fearing that it would annex . Around 1,000  served in the  army; their sacrifices have been commemorated at the [[Gëlle Fra]].

After the war, Grand-Duchess [[Marie-Adélaïde, Grand Duchess of |Marie-Adélaïde]] was seen by many people (including the  and  governments) as having collaborated with the  and calls for her abdication and the establishment of a Republic became louder.

In January 1919, a company of the [[ Army]] rebelled, declaring itself to be the army of the new republic, but  troops intervened and put an end to the rebellion. Nonetheless, the disloyalty shown by her own armed forces was too much for Marie-Adélaïde, who abdicated in favour of her sister [[Grand Duchess Charlotte|Charlotte]] 5 days later. The same year, in a [[1919  referendum|popular referendum]], 77.8% of the  population declared in favour of maintaining monarchy and rejected the establishment of a republic. During this time,  pushed for an annexation of . However, all such claims were ultimately dismissed at the [[Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)|Paris Peace Conference]], thus securing 's independence.

In 1939, the  army increased to 425 due to Nazi  presence. On May 9, 1940  closed the defensive [[Schuster Line|Schuster line]] with ; one day later, 's neutrality was violated again when [[Nazi ]]'s ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' [[Invasion of |entered the country]] "entirely without justification". In contrast to the First World War, under the [[ occupation of  during World War II]], the country was treated as  territory and informally annexed to the adjacent province of [[Nazi ]], [[Gau Moselland]]. This time,  did not remain neutral as 's [[ government-in-exile|government in exile]] based in London supported the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], sending a small group of volunteers who participated in the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]], and multiple [[ Resistance|resistance groups]] formed inside the occupied country.

With 2.45% of its prewar population killed, and a third of all buildings in  being destroyed or heavily damaged (mainly due to the [[Battle of the Bulge]]),  suffered the highest such loss in Western Europe, but its commitment to the Allied war effort was never questioned. Around 1,000–2,500 of 's Jews were murdered in [[the Holocaust in |the Holocaust]].

[[File:Emperor Jimmu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Legend]]ary {{Nihongo|[[Emperor Jimmu]]|神武天皇|Jinmu-tennō}}]]
Modern humans arrived in  around 38,000 years ago (~36,000 BC), marking the beginning of the [[ Paleolithic]]. Around 14,500&nbsp;BC (the start of the [[Jōmon period]]), a [[Mesolithic]] to [[Neolithic]] semi-sedentary [[hunter-gatherer]] culture characterized by [[pit dwelling]] and rudimentary agriculture emerged. [[Jōmon pottery|Clay vessels]] from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery. The [[Japonic]]-speaking [[Yayoi people]] later entered the archipelago from the  Peninsula, intermingling with the [[Jōmon people]]. The [[Yayoi period]] saw the introduction of innovative practices including [[Paddy field|wet-rice farming]], a new [[Yayoi pottery|style of pottery]], and metallurgy from  and . According to legend, [[Emperor Jimmu]] (descendant of [[Amaterasu]]) founded a kingdom in central  in 660 BC, beginning [[Imperial House of |a continuous imperial line]].

 first appears in written history in the  ''[[Book of Han]]'', completed in 111 AD, where it is described as having a hundred small kingdoms. A century later, the ''[[Book of Wei]]'' records that the kingdom of [[Yamatai]] (which may refer to [[Yamato Kingship|Yamato]]) unified most of these kingdoms. [[Buddhism]] was introduced to  from [[Baekje]] (a  kingdom) in 552, but the development of [[ Buddhism]] was primarily influenced by . Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like [[Prince Shōtoku]], and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the [[Asuka period]] (592–710).

In 645, the government led by [[Prince Naka no Ōe]] and [[Fujiwara no Kamatari]] devised and implemented the far-reaching [[Taika Reform]]s. The Reform began with land reform, based on Confucian ideas and [[ philosophy|philosophies]] from [[]]. It nationalized all land in , to be [[Equal-field system|distributed equally]] among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation. The true aim of the reforms was to bring about greater centralization and to enhance the power of the imperial court, which was also based on the governmental structure of . Envoys and students were dispatched to  to learn about  writing, politics, art, and religion. 

The [[Jinshin War]] of 672, a bloody conflict between [[Prince Ōama]] and his nephew [[Prince Ōtomo]], became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms. These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the [[Taihō Code]], which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments. These legal reforms created the {{transliteration|ja|[[ritsuryō]]}} state, a system of -style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.

The [[Nara period]] (710–784) marked the emergence of a  state centered on the Imperial Court in [[Heijō Palace|Heijō-kyō]] (modern [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent [[ literature|literary culture]] with the completion of the {{transliteration|ja|[[Kojiki]]}} (712) and {{transliteration|ja|[[Nihon Shoki]]}} (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and [[Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara|architecture]]. A [[735–737  smallpox epidemic|smallpox epidemic in 735–737]] is believed to have killed as much as one-third of 's population. In 784, [[Emperor Kanmu]] moved the capital, settling on [[Heian-kyō]] (modern-day [[Kyoto]]) in 794. This marked the beginning of the [[Heian period]] (794–1185), during which a distinctly indigenous  culture emerged. [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' and the lyrics of 's national anthem {{transliteration|ja|"[[Kimigayo]]"}} were written during this time.

's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the [[samurai]]. In 1185, following the defeat of the [[Taira clan]] by the [[Minamoto clan]] in the [[Genpei War]], samurai [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] established a [[military government]] at [[Kamakura]]. After Yoritomo's death, the [[Hōjō clan]] came to power as regents for the {{transliteration|ja|shōgun}}. The [[Zen]] school of Buddhism was introduced from  in the [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class. 

The [[Kamakura shogunate]] repelled [[Mongol invasions of |Mongol invasions]] in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually [[Kenmu Restoration|overthrown]] by [[Emperor Go-Daigo]]. Go-Daigo was defeated by [[Ashikaga Takauji]] in 1336, beginning the [[Muromachi period]] (1336–1573). The succeeding [[Ashikaga shogunate]] failed to control the feudal warlords ({{transliteration|ja|daimyō}}) and [[Ōnin War|a civil war]] began in 1467, opening the century-long [[Sengoku period]] ("Warring States").

During the 16th century,  traders and [[Jesuit]] missionaries reached  for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between  and the West (see [[Nanban trade]] and [[Nanban art]]). [[Oda Nobunaga]] used European technology and firearms to conquer many other {{transliteration|ja|daimyō}}; his consolidation of power began what was known as the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]]. After [[Honnō-ji Incident|the death of Nobunaga]] in 1582, his successor, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], unified the nation in the early 1590s and launched [[ invasions of  (1592–98)|two unsuccessful invasions of  in 1592 and 1597]].

[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] served as regent for Hideyoshi's son [[Toyotomi Hideyori]] within the [[Council of Five Elders]] and used his position to gain political and military support. When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600. He was appointed {{transliteration|ja|shōgun}} by [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]] in 1603 and established the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] at [[Edo]] (modern Tokyo). The shogunate enacted measures including {{transliteration|ja|[[buke shohatto]]}}, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous {{transliteration|ja|daimyō}}, and in 1639 the isolationist {{transliteration|ja|[[sakoku]]}} ("closed country") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the [[Edo period]] (1603–1868). Modern 's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads ([[Kaidō]]) and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as [[futures contract]]s, banking and insurance of the [[Osaka rice brokers]]. The study of Western sciences ({{transliteration|ja|[[rangaku]]}}) continued through contact with the  enclave in [[Nagasaki]]. The Edo period gave rise to {{transliteration|ja|[[kokugaku]]}} ("national studies"), the study of  by the .

The [[ Navy]] sent Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] to force the opening of  to the outside world. Arriving at [[Uraga, Kanagawa|Uraga]] with four "[[Black Ships]]" in July 1853, the [[Perry Expedition]] resulted in the March 1854 [[Convention of Kanagawa]]. Subsequent similar treaties with other Western countries brought economic and political crises. The resignation of the {{transliteration|ja|shōgun}} led to the [[Boshin War]] and the establishment of a [[Abolition of the han system|centralized state]] nominally unified under the emperor (the [[Meiji Restoration]]). Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the [[Cabinet of |Cabinet]] organized the [[Privy Council ()|Privy Council]], introduced the [[Meiji Constitution]] (November 29, 1890), and assembled the [[National Diet|Imperial Diet]]. 

During the [[Meiji period]] (1868–1912), the [[Empire of ]] emerged as the most developed state in [[Asia]] and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence. After victories in the [[First Sino- War]] (1894–1895) and the [[Russo- War]] (1904–1905),  gained control of Taiwan,  and the southern half of [[Sakhalin]], and annexed  in 1910. The  population doubled from 35&nbsp;million in 1873 to 70&nbsp;million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization.

The early 20th century saw a period of [[Taishō period|Taishō democracy]] (1912–1926) overshadowed by increasing [[expansionism]] and [[ militarism|militarization]].

The 1920s saw a political shift towards [[Statism in Shōwa |statism]], a period of lawlessness following the 1923 [[Great Tokyo Earthquake]], the passing of [[Peace Preservation Law|laws against political dissent]], and a series of [[May 15 Incident|attempted coups]]. 

This process accelerated in the 1930s, spawning several radical nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931,  [[ invasion of Manchuria|invaded  and occupied Manchuria]], which led to the establishment of [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932; following [[Lytton Report|international condemnation of the occupation]], it resigned from the [[League of Nations]] in 1933.

Throughout areas occupied by  during the war, [[ war crimes|numerous abuses]] were committed against local inhabitants. Many women were forced into [[Comfort women|sexual slavery]].

The war cost  millions of lives and many of its [[Territorial conquests of the Empire of |conquered territories]], including ''[[de jure]]'' parts of  such as [[ under  rule|]], [[Taiwan under  rule|Taiwan]], [[Karafuto]], and the [[Kurils]]. The Allies, led by the , repatriated millions of [[ diaspora| settlers]] from their former colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the [[Empire of ]] and its influence over the territories it conquered.

This enabled the transition from [[Paleo-|paleo-]] hunter-gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around 5000 BC. The formative period of Mesoamerica is considered one of the six independent [[cradles of civilization]], this era saw the origin of distinct cultural traits such as religious and symbolic traditions, maize cultivation, artistic and architectural complexes as well as a [[vigesimal]] (base 20) numeric system that spread from the  cultures to the rest of the [[Mesoamerica]]n cultural area. In this period, villages became more dense in terms of population, becoming socially stratified with an artisan class, and developing into [[chiefdom]]s. The most powerful rulers had religious and political power, organizing the construction of large ceremonial centers.

The earliest complex civilization in  was the [[Olmec]] culture, which flourished on the Gulf Coast from around 1500 BC. Olmec cultural traits diffused through  into other formative-era cultures in Chiapas, Oaxaca, and the Valley of . In the subsequent [[Mesoamerican chronology|pre-classical period]], the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] civilizations developed complex centers at [[Calakmul]] and [[Monte Albán]], respectively. During this period the first true [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] were developed in the [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]] and Zapotec cultures. The Mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the Classic [[Maya Script|Maya Hieroglyphic script]], the earliest written histories date from this era. The tradition of writing was important after the  conquest in 1521, with indigenous scribes learning to write their languages in alphabetic letters, while also continuing to create pictorial texts.

In Central , the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy of [[Teotihuacan|Teotihuacán]], which formed a military and commercial empire. Teotihuacan, with a population of more than 150,000 people, had some of the largest [[Mesoamerican pyramid|pyramidal structures]] in the pre-Columbian Americas. After the collapse of Teotihuacán around 600 AD, competition ensued between several important political centers in central  such as [[Xochicalco]] and [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]]. At this time, during the Epi-Classic, [[Nahua people]]s began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North, and became politically and culturally dominant in central , as they displaced speakers of [[Oto-Manguean languages]]. During the early post-classic era (ca. 1000–1519 AD), Central  was dominated by the [[Toltec]] culture, [[Oaxaca]] by the [[Mixtec civilization|Mixtec]], and the lowland Maya area had important centers at [[Chichén Itzá]] and [[Mayapán]]. Toward the end of the post-Classic period, the [[Aztecs]] (or [[Mexica]]) established dominance, establishing a [[Aztec Empire|political and economic empire]] based in the city of [[Tenochtitlan]] (modern [[ City]]), extending from central  to the border with .

=== conquest and colonial era (1519–1821)===
{{Main| conquest of |New }}Although the [[ Empire]] had established colonies in the [[Caribbean]] starting in 1493 the  first learned of  during the [[Juan de Grijalva]] expedition of 1518. The [[ conquest of the Aztec Empire]] began in February 1519 when [[Hernán Cortés]] founded the  city of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]]. The 1521 [[capture of Tenochtitlan]] and posterior founding of the  capital [[ City]] on its ruins was the beginning of a 300-year-long colonial era during which  was known as {{lang|es|Nueva España}} ([[New ]]). Two factors made  a jewel in the  Empire: the existence of large, hierarchically organized Mesoamerican populations that rendered tribute and performed obligatory labor and the discovery of vast silver deposits in northern . 
[[File:Guanaguato_at_night.jpg|thumb|[[Guanajuato (city)|Guanajuato]] was one of the richest and most opulent cities in [[New ]]]]

The [[Kingdom of New ]] was created from the remnants of the Aztec empire. The two pillars of  rule were the State and the Roman Catholic Church, both under the authority of the  crown. In 1493 the pope granted [[Patronato real|sweeping powers]] to the  monarchy for its overseas empire, with the proviso that the crown spread Christianity in its new realms. In 1524, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I]] created the [[Council of the Indies]] based in  to oversee State power in its overseas territories. In New  the crown established a high court in  City, the {{lang|es|[[Real Audiencia]]}} ('royal audience' or 'royal tribunal').

In 1535, the crown created the [[Viceroyalty of New ]]. The viceroy was the highest official of the State. In the religious sphere, the Diocese of  was created in 1530 and elevated to the [[Archdiocese of ]] in 1546, with the archbishop as the head of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Castilian  was the language of rulers. The Catholic faith was the only one permitted, with non-Catholics and Catholics (excluding ) holding unorthodox views being subject to the [[ Inquisition]], established in 1571.

 military forces, sometimes accompanied by native allies, led expeditions to conquer territory or quell rebellions through the colonial era. Notable Amerindian revolts in sporadically populated northern New  include the [[Chichimeca War]] (1576–1606), the [[Tepehuán Revolt]] (1616–1620), and the [[Pueblo Revolt]] (1680). The [[Tzeltal Rebellion of 1712]] was a regional Maya revolt. Most rebellions were small-scale and local, posing no major threat to the ruling elites. To protect  from the attacks of , , and  [[pirate]]s and protect the Crown's monopoly of revenue, only two ports were open to foreign trade—Veracruz on the Atlantic, connecting to [[]], and Acapulco on the Pacific, connecting to the [[]]. Among the best-known pirate attacks are the 1663 [[Sack of Campeche (1663)|Sack of Campeche]] and the 1683 [[Attack on Veracruz]].

Of greater concern to the crown was the issue of foreign invasion, especially after Britain seized in 1762 the  ports of [[Havana]] and [[Manila]] in the [[Seven Years' War]]. It created a standing military, increased coastal fortifications, and expanded the northern [[presidio]]s and [[ missions in California|missions]] into [[Alta California]]. The volatility of the urban poor in  City was evident in the 1692 riot in the Zócalo. The riot over the price of maize escalated to a full-scale attack on the seats of power, with the viceregal palace and the archbishop's residence attacked by the mob.

[[File:Plaza de Dolores.JPG|thumb|[[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]]'s [[Cry of Dolores]] on 16 September 1810, by J.J. del Moral. The call to arms marks the beginning of 's War of Independence against  colonial rule.]]

On 16 September 1810, [[Secular clergy|secular priest]] [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] declared against "bad government" in the small town of [[Dolores Hidalgo|Dolores]], Guanajuato. This event, known as the [[Cry of Dolores]] ({{langx|es|Grito de Dolores}}) is commemorated each year, on 16 September, as 's independence day. The upheaval in the  Empire that resulted in the independence of most of its New World territories was due to [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s invasion of  in 1808. Hidalgo and some of his soldiers were eventually captured, Hidalgo was defrocked, and they were [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] on 31 July 1811. The first 35 years after 's independence were marked by political instability and the changing of the  state from a [[First  Empire|transient monarchy]] to a fragile federated republic. There were military coups d'état, foreign invasions, ideological conflict between [[Conservative Party ()|Conservatives]] and [[Liberal Party ()|Liberals]], and [[economic history of |economic stagnation]].

Former Royal Army General [[Agustín de Iturbide]] became regent, as newly independent  sought a [[first  Empire|constitutional monarch]] from Europe. When no member of a European royal house desired the position, Iturbide himself was declared Emperor Agustín I. The  was the first country to recognize 's independence, sending an ambassador to the court and sending a message to Europe via the [[Monroe Doctrine]] not to intervene in . The emperor's rule was short (1822–1823) and he was overthrown by army officers in the [[Plan of Casa Mata]].

After the forced abdication of the monarch, Central America and [[Chiapas]] left the union to form the [[Federal Republic of Central America]]. In 1824, the [[First  Republic]] was established. Former insurgent General [[Guadalupe Victoria]] became the first president of the republic — the first of many army generals to hold the presidency. In 1829, former insurgent general and fierce Liberal [[Vicente Guerrero]], a signatory of the [[Plan of Iguala]] that achieved independence, became president in a disputed election. During his short term in office, from April to December 1829, he abolished slavery. His Conservative vice president, former Royalist General [[Anastasio Bustamante]], led a coup against him and Guerrero was [[judicial murder|judicially murdered]].

's ability to maintain its independence and establish a viable government was in question.  [[ attempts to reconquer |attempted to reconquer]] its former colony during the 1820s but eventually recognized its independence.  attempted to recoup losses it claimed for its citizens during 's unrest and blockaded the Gulf Coast during the so-called [[Pastry War]] of 1838–1839. General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] emerged as a national hero because of his role in both these conflicts; Santa Anna came to dominate the politics for the next 25 years, often known as the "Age of Santa Anna", until his overthrow in 1855.

 also contended with indigenous groups that controlled the territory that  claimed in the north. For example, the [[Comanche]] controlled a [[comancheria|huge territory]] in sparsely populated central and northern Texas. Wanting to stabilize and develop that area — and as few people from central  had chosen to resettle to this remote and hostile territory — the  government encouraged [[Anglo-|Anglo-]] immigration into present-day Texas, a region that bordered that .  by law was a Catholic country; the Anglo- were primarily Protestant  speakers from the southern . Some brought their black slaves, which after 1829 was contrary to  law.

In 1835, Santa Anna sought to centralize government rule in , suspending the 1824 constitution and promulgating the [[Siete Leyes|Seven Laws]], which placed power in his hands. As a result, civil war spread across . Three new governments declared independence: the [[Republic of Texas]], the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]] and the [[Republic of Yucatán]].{{rp|129–137}} The largest blow to  was the U.S. invasion of  in 1846 in the [[– War]].  lost much of its sparsely populated northern territory, sealed in the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. Despite that disastrous loss, Santa Anna returned to the presidency yet again before being ousted and exiled in the Liberal [[Revolution of Ayutla]].

===Liberal era (1855–1911)===
{{Main|Second  Republic|La Reforma|Second  Empire|Restored Republic ()|Porfiriato}}
[[File:Photograph_of_Benito_Juarez.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Liberal President [[Benito Juárez]]. Known for his efforts to modernize , defend its sovereignty, and promote liberal reforms, especially during the mid-19th century.]]

The overthrow of Santa Anna and the establishment of a civilian government by Liberals allowed them to enact laws that they considered vital for 's economic development. The [[La Reforma|Liberal Reform]] attempted to modernize 's economy and institutions along liberal principles. They promulgated a new [[constitution|Constitution of 1857]], separating Church and State, stripping the Church and the military of their special privileges ({{lang|es|[[fueros]]}}); mandating the sale of Church-owned property and sale of indigenous community lands, and secularizing education. Conservatives revolted, touching off [[war of the Reform|civil war]] between rival Liberal and Conservative governments (1858–1861).

The Liberals defeated the Conservative army on the battlefield, but Conservatives sought another solution to gain power via foreign intervention by the , asking Emperor [[Napoleon III]] to place a European monarch as head of state in . The  Army defeated the  Army and placed [[Maximilian I of |Maximilian Habsburg]] on the [[second  Empire|newly established throne]] of , supported by  Conservatives and propped up by the  Army.

The Liberal Republic under [[Benito Juárez]] was a government in internal exile, but with the end of the Civil War in the  in April 1865, the Reunified U.S. government began aiding the  Republic. Two years later, the  Army withdrew its support, but Maximilian remained in . Republican forces captured him and he was executed. The "Restored Republic" saw the return of Juárez, "the personification of the embattled republic," as president.

The Conservatives had been not only defeated militarily but also discredited politically for their collaboration with the  invaders and Liberalism became synonymous with patriotism. The  Army that had its roots in the colonial royal army and then the army of the early republic was destroyed and new military leaders had emerged from the War of the Reform and the conflict with the , most notably [[Porfirio Díaz]], a hero of the {{lang|es|[[Battle of Puebla|Cinco de Mayo]]}}, who now sought civilian power and challenged Juárez on his re-election in 1867.

Díaz then rebelled but was crushed by Juárez. Having won re-election, Juárez died in office in July 1872. Liberal [[Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada]] became president, declaring a "religion of the state" for the rule of law, peace, and order. When Lerdo ran for re-election, Díaz rebelled against the civilian president, issuing the [[Plan of Tuxtepec]]. Díaz had more support and waged guerrilla warfare against Lerdo. On the verge of Díaz's victory on the battlefield, Lerdo fled from office into exile.

After the turmoil in  from 1810 to 1876, the 35-year rule of Liberal General [[Porfirio Díaz]] (r.1876–1911) allowed  to rapidly modernize in a period characterized as one of "[[Positivism|order and progress]]". The [[Porfiriato]] was characterized by economic stability and growth, significant foreign investment and influence, an expansion of the [[rail transport in |railroad network]] and telecommunications, and investments in the arts and sciences. Díaz ruled with a group of advisors that became known as the {{lang|es|[[científico]]s}} ('scientists'). The most influential {{lang|es|científico}} was Secretary of Finance [[José Yves Limantour]].

The Porfirian regime was influenced by [[positivism]]. They rejected theology and [[idealism]] in favor of scientific methods being applied towards national development. An integral aspect of the liberal project was secular education. The Díaz government led a protracted [[Yaqui Wars|conflict against the Yaqui]] that culminated with the forced relocation of thousands of [[Yaqui]] to Yucatán and Oaxaca. As the centennial of independence approached, Díaz gave an [[James Creelman|interview]] where he said he was not going to run in the 1910 elections, when he would be 80. Political opposition had been suppressed and there were few avenues for a new generation of leaders. But his announcement set off a frenzy of political activity, including the unlikely candidacy of the scion of a rich landowning family, [[Francisco I. Madero]]. Madero won a surprising amount of political support when Díaz changed his mind and ran in the election, jailing Madero. The September centennial celebration of independence was the last celebration of the [[Porfiriato]]. The  Revolution starting in 1910 saw a decade of civil war, the "wind that swept ."

=== Revolution (1910–1920)===
{{Main| Revolution}}
[[File:Francisco_I_Madero.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Francisco I. Madero]], who challenged Díaz in the fraudulent 1910 election and was elected president when Díaz was forced to resign in May 1911]]

The [[ Revolution]] was a decade-long transformational conflict. It began with scattered uprisings against President Díaz after the fraudulent 1910 election, his resignation in May 1911, demobilization of rebel forces, an interim presidency of a member of the old guard and the democratic election of a rich, civilian landowner, [[Francisco I. Madero]] in fall 1911. In [[Ten Tragic Days|February 1913]], a military coup d'état overthrew Madero's government, with the support of the U.S., resulting in Madero's murder by agents of [[Federal Army]] General [[Victoriano Huerta]]. During the Revolution, the U.S. Republican administration of [[William Howard Taft|Taft]] supported the Huerta coup against Madero, but when Democrat [[Woodrow Wilson]] was inaugurated as president in March 1913, Wilson refused to recognize Huerta's regime and allowed arms sales to the Constitutionalists. Wilson ordered troops to [[ occupation of Veracruz|occupy]] the strategic port of Veracruz in 1914, which was lifted. A coalition of anti-Huerta forces in the North, the [[Constitutional Army]] led by [[Governor of Coahuila]] [[Venustiano Carranza]], and a peasant army in the South under [[Emiliano Zapata]] defeated the Federal Army in 1914, leaving only revolutionary forces.

Following the revolutionaries' victory against Huerta, they sought to broker a peaceful political solution, but the coalition splintered, plunging  again into a civil war. Constitutionalist general [[Pancho Villa]], commander of the Division of the North, broke with Carranza and allied with Zapata. Carranza's best general [[Alvaro Obregón]] defeated Villa, his former comrade-in-arms, in the [[Battle of Celaya]] in 1915, and Villa's northern forces melted away. Carranza became the de facto head of , and the U.S. recognized his government while Zapata's forces in the south reverted to guerrilla warfare. After Pancho Villa was defeated by revolutionary forces in 1915, he led an incursion raid into [[Columbus, New ]], prompting the U.S. to send [[Pancho Villa Expedition|10,000 troops]] led by General [[John J. Pershing]] in an unsuccessful attempt to capture Villa. Carranza pushed back against U.S. troops being in northern . The expeditionary forces withdrew as the U.S. entered World War I. Although often viewed as an internal conflict, the revolution had significant international elements:  attempted to get  to side with it, sending a coded [[Zimmermann Telegram|telegram]] in 1917 to incite war between the U.S. and , with  to regain the territory it lost in the - War but  remained neutral in the conflict.

In 1916, the winners of the  revolution met at a constitutional convention to draft the [[Constitution of 1917]], which was ratified in February 1917. The Constitution empowered the government to expropriate resources including land, gave rights to labor, and strengthened anticlerical provisions of the 1857 Constitution. With amendments, it remains the governing document of . It is estimated that the revolutionary war killed 900,000 people out of 's 15 million population at the time. Consolidating power, President Carranza had peasant leader Emiliano Zapata assassinated in 1919. Carranza had gained the support of the peasantry during the Revolution, but once in power, he did little to institute land reform, which had motivated many to fight in the Revolution. Carranza returned some confiscated land to their original owners. President Carranza's best general, Obregón, served briefly in his administration but returned to his home state of Sonora to position himself to run in the 1920 presidential election. Since Carranza could not run for re-election, he chose a civilian to succeed him, intending to remain the power behind the presidency. Obregón and two other Sonoran revolutionary generals drew up the [[Plan of Agua Prieta]], overthrowing Carranza, who died fleeing  City in 1920. General [[Adolfo de la Huerta]] became interim president, followed by the election of General [[Álvaro Obregón]].

The first quarter-century of the post-revolutionary period (1920–1946) was characterized by revolutionary generals serving as [[Presidents of ]], including [[Álvaro Obregón]] (1920–24), [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] (1924–28), [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] (1934–40), and [[Manuel Avila Camacho]] (1940–46). The post-revolutionary project of the  government sought to bring order to the country, end military intervention in politics, and create organizations of interest groups. Workers, peasants, urban office workers, and even the army for a short period were incorporated as sectors of the single party that dominated  politics from its founding in 1929. Obregón instigated land reform and strengthened the power of organized labor. He gained recognition from the  and took steps to [[- Claims Commission|settle claims]] with companies and individuals that lost property during the Revolution. He imposed his fellow former Sonoran revolutionary general, Calles, as his successor, prompting an unsuccessful military revolt. As president, Calles provoked a [[Cristero War|major conflict]] with the [[Catholic Church in |Catholic Church]] and Catholic guerrilla armies when he strictly enforced anticlerical articles of the 1917 Constitution which ended with an agreement. Although the constitution prohibited the reelection of the president, Obregón wished to run again and the constitution was amended to allow non-consecutive re-election; he won the 1928 elections but was assassinated by a Catholic activist, causing a political crisis of succession. Calles could not become president again, so he sought to set up a structure to manage presidential succession, founding the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], which went on to dominate  for the rest of the 20th century.

Despite not holding the presidency, Calles remained the key political figure during the period known as the [[Maximato]] (1929–1934), that ended during the presidency of [[Lázaro Cárdenas]], who expelled Calles from the country and implemented many economic and social reforms. This included the [[ oil expropriation]] in March 1938, which nationalized the U.S. and Anglo- oil company known as the [[ Eagle Petroleum Company]], which would result in the creation of the state-owned [[Pemex]].

Cárdenas's successor, [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]] (1940–1946) was more moderate, and relations between the U.S. and  vastly improved during [[World War II]], when  was a significant ally. From 1946 the election of [[Miguel Alemán Valdés|Miguel Alemán]], the first civilian president in the post-revolutionary period,  embarked on an aggressive program of economic development, known as the [[ miracle]], which was characterized by industrialization, urbanization, and the increase of inequality between urban and rural areas. The [[Green Revolution]], a technological movement that led to a significant worldwide increase in crop production, began in the [[Yaqui Valley]] of Sonora in the middle of the 20th century.

With robust economic growth,  sought to showcase it to the world by hosting the [[1968 Summer Olympics]]. The government poured huge resources into building new facilities, prompting political unrest among university students and others. Demonstrations in central  City went on for weeks before the planned opening of the games, with the government of [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz]] cracking down. The culmination was the [[Tlatelolco Massacre]], which killed around 300 protesters based on conservative estimates and perhaps as many as 800. Although the economy continued to flourish for some, [[distribution of wealth|social inequality]] remained a factor of discontent. PRI rule became increasingly authoritarian and at times oppressive in what is now referred to as the [[ Dirty War]].

From left to right: (standing) President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] (), President [[George H. W. Bush]] (U.S.), and Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] ().]]

In the 1980s the first cracks emerged in the PRI's complete political dominance. In [[Baja California]], the [[Ernesto Ruffo Appel|PAN candidate]] was elected as governor. When De la Madrid chose [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] as the candidate for the PRI, and therefore a foregone presidential victor, [[Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas]], son of former President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]], broke with the PRI and challenged Salinas in the 1988 elections. In 1988 there was massive [[electoral fraud]], with results showing that Salinas had won the election by the narrowest percentage ever. There were massive protests in  City over the stolen election. Salinas took the oath of office on 1 December 1988. In 1990 the PRI was famously described by [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] as the "perfect dictatorship", but by then there had been major challenges to the PRI's hegemony.

Salinas embarked on a program of [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] reforms that fixed the exchange rate of the peso, controlled inflation, opened  to foreign investment, and began talks with the U.S. and  to join their [[free-trade agreement]], which culminated in the [[North  Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) on 1 January 1994; the same day, the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN) in Chiapas began armed peasant rebellion against the federal government, which captured a few towns but brought world attention to the situation in . The armed conflict was short-lived and has continued as a non-violent opposition movement against [[neoliberalism]] and [[globalization]]. In 1994, following the assassination of the PRI's presidential candidate [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]], Salinas was succeeded by victorious PRI candidate [[Ernesto Zedillo]]. Salinas left Zedillo's government to deal with the [[ peso crisis]], requiring a $50 billion [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] bailout. Major macroeconomic reforms were started by Zedillo, and the economy rapidly recovered and growth peaked at almost 7% by the end of 1999.

[[File:Vicente Fox flag (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright |[[Vicente Fox]] won the [[2000  general election|2000 general election]] and became the first president not from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] since 1929, and the first elected from an opposition party since [[Francisco I. Madero]] in 1911.]]

After 71 years of rule, the incumbent PRI lost the [[2000  general election|2000 presidential election]] to [[Vicente Fox]] of the opposing conservative [[National Action Party ()|National Action Party]] (PAN). In the [[2006  general election|2006 presidential election]], [[Felipe Calderón]] from the PAN was declared the winner, with a very narrow margin (0.58%) over leftist politician [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]] of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]] (PRD). López Obrador, however, [[Controversies of the 2006  general election|contested the election]] and pledged to create an "alternative government".

After twelve years, in the [[2012  general election|2012 presidential election]], the PRI again won the presidency with the election of [[Enrique Peña Nieto]]. However, he won with a plurality of around 38% and did not have a legislative majority.

During the twenty-first century,  has contended with [[Crime in |high crime rates]], [[Corruption in |bureaucratic corruption]], [[ drug war|narcotrafficking]], and a stagnant economy. Many state-owned industrial enterprises were privatized starting in the 1990s with [[neoliberal]] reforms, but [[Pemex]], the state-owned petroleum company is only slowly being privatized, with exploration licenses being issued. In a push against government corruption, the ex-CEO of Pemex, [[Emilio Lozoya Austin]], was arrested in 2020.

After founding the new political party [[National Regeneration Movement|MORENA]], Andrés Manuel López Obrador (commonly known as AMLO) won the 2018 presidential election with over 50% of the vote. His political coalition, led by his left-wing party founded after the 2012 elections, included parties and politicians from across the political spectrum. The coalition also won a majority in both the upper and lower Congress chambers. His success is attributed to the country's opposing political forces exhausting their chances as well as AMLO's adoption of a moderate discourse with a focus on reconciliation. The first confirmed case of [[COVID-19 pandemic in |COVID-19 in ]] occurred on 28 February 2020. The [[COVID-19 vaccination in ]] began in December 2020.

[[Claudia Sheinbaum]], López Obrador's political successor, won the [[2024  general election|2024 presidential election]] in a landslide and upon taking office in October became the first woman to lead the country in 's history. She was sworn in as 's president on 1 October 2024.

=== Prehistory and ancient history ===
{{main|Prehistoric North Africa|North Africa during Antiquity}}
[[File:Djemila7.jpg|left|thumb|Roman ruins at [[Djémila]]]]
Around ~1.8-million-year-old stone artifacts from Ain Hanech () were considered to represent the oldest archaeological materials in North Africa. Stone artifacts and cut-marked bones that were excavated from two nearby deposits at Ain Boucherit are estimated to be ~1.9&nbsp;million years old, and even older stone artifacts to be as old as ~2.4&nbsp;million years. Hence, the Ain Boucherit evidence shows that ancestral hominins inhabited the Mediterranean fringe in northern Africa much earlier than previously thought. The evidence strongly argues for early dispersal of stone tool manufacture and use from East Africa, or a possible multiple-origin scenario of stone technology in both East and North Africa.

Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] and [[Mousterian]] styles (43,000 BC) similar to those in the [[Levant]].  was the site of the highest state of development of [[Middle Paleolithic]] [[Flake tool]] techniques. Tools of this era, starting about 30,000 BC, are called [[Aterian]] (after the archaeological site of [[Bir el Ater]], south of [[Tébessa|Tebessa]]).

The earliest blade industries in North Africa are called [[Iberomaurusian]] (located mainly in the [[Oran]] region). This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the [[Maghreb]] between 15,000 and 10,000 BC. [[neolithic|Neolithic civilisation]] (animal domestication and agriculture) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghreb perhaps as early as 11,000 BC or as late as between 6000 and 2000 BC. This life, richly depicted in the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] paintings, predominated in  until the classical period. The mixture of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called [[Berber people|Berbers]], who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa.
[[File:L'arc de timgade (2).jpg|thumb|The [[Arch of Trajan (Timgad)|Arch of Trajan]] in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ruins of [[Timgad]]]]
From their principal center of power at [[Carthage]], the [[Carthaginians]] expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a [[Phoenicia]]n presence existed at [[Tipasa]], east of [[Cherchell]], [[Hippo Regius]] (modern [[Annaba]]) and [[Rusicade]] (modern [[Skikda]]). These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.

As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. Berber civilisation was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organisation supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.

[[File:GM Massinissa.png|thumb|left|[[Masinissa]] ({{Circa}}&nbsp;238–148&nbsp;BC), first king of Numidia]]
By the early 4th century BC, The north is divided into two [[Masaesyli|Masaesyli kingdom]] in west led by [[Syphax]] and [[Massylii|Massylii kingdom]] in east. Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army. In the [[Mercenary War|Revolt of the Mercenaries]], Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]]. They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name , used in  to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]].

In 146 BC, the city of [[Carthage]] was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay [[Mauretania]], which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in modern-day [[]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilisation, unequalled until the coming of the [[Almohads]] and [[Almoravids]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC.
[[File:Justinian555AD.png|thumb|right| The lands which make up modern-day  were part of [[Byzantine North Africa]] (The empire in 555 under [[Justinian the Great]], at its greatest extent since the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] ([[vassal state|vassals]] in pink))]]
After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Masinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].

For several centuries  was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region.  is home to the second-largest number of Roman sites and remains after . Rome, after getting rid of its powerful rival Carthage in the year 146 BC, decided a century later to include Numidia to become the new master of North Africa. They built more than 500 cities. Like the rest of North Africa,  was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products. [[Augustine of Hippo| Augustine]] was the bishop of [[Hippo Regius]] (modern-day Annaba, ), located in the Roman province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. The Germanic [[Vandals]] of [[Geiseric]] moved into North Africa in 429, and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia.When the Byzantines arrived, [[Leptis Magna]] was abandoned and the Msellata region was occupied by the indigenous [[Amazigh|Laguatan]] who  facilitated an [[Amazigh]] political, military and cultural revival. During the rule of the Romans, Byzantines, Vandals, Carthaginians, and Ottomans the Berber people were  one of the few in North Africa who remained independent. The Berber people were so resistant that even during the Muslim conquest of North Africa they still had control and possession over their mountains.

The collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] led to the establishment of a native Kingdom based in [[Altava]] (modern-day ) known as the [[Mauro-Roman Kingdom]]. It was succeeded by another Kingdom based in Altava, the [[Kingdom of Altava]]. During the reign of [[Kusaila]] its territory extended from the region of modern-day [[Fez, |Fez]] in the west to the western [[Aurès]] and later [[Kairouan|Kairaouan]] and the interior of Ifriqiya in the east.

=== Middle Ages ===
{{main|Medieval Muslim }}
After negligible resistance from the locals, [[Muslims|Muslim]] [[Arabs]] of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] conquered  in the early 8th century.

Large numbers of the indigenous Berber people converted to Islam. Christians, Berber and Latin speakers remained in the great majority in  until the end of the 9th century and Muslims only became a vast majority some time in the 10th. After the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate, numerous local dynasties emerged, including the [[Rustamids]], [[Aghlabids]], [[Fatimids]], [[Zirids]], [[Hammadids]], [[Almoravids]], [[Almohads]] and the [[Abdalwadid|Zayyanids]]. The Christians left in three waves: after the initial conquest, in the 10th century and the 11th. The last were evacuated to [[Sicily]] by the [[Normans]] and the few remaining died out in the 14th century.

[[File:Statue of Dyhia in Khenchela ().jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dihya]] memorial in [[Khenchela]], ]]
During the [[Middle Ages]], North Africa was home to the Jewish scholar [[Judah ibn Kuraishi]], the first grammarian to write about Semitic and Berber languages, as well as the  [[Sufism|Sufi]] masters [[Abu Madyan|Sidi Boumediene (Abu Madyan)]] and [[Sidi El Houari]], and the Emirs [[Abd al-Mu'min|Abd Al Mu'min]] and [[Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan|Yāghmūrasen]]. It was during this time that the [[Fatimids]] or children of [[Fatima]], daughter of [[Muhammad]], came to the [[Maghreb]]. These "Fatimids" went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, [[Hejaz]] and the [[Levant]], boasting a secular inner government, as well as a powerful army and navy, made up primarily of [[Arabs]] and [[Levant]]ines extending from  to their capital state of [[Cairo]]. The [[Fatimid caliphate]] began to collapse when its governors the [[Zirids]] seceded. To punish them the Fatimids sent the Arab [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] against them. The resultant war is recounted in the epic [[Taghribat Bani Hilal|Tāghribāt]]. In Al-Tāghrībāt the Amazigh Zirid Hero [[Khalifa al-Zanati|Khālīfā Al-Zānatī]] asks daily, for duels, to defeat the Hilalan hero [[Abu Zayd al-Hilali|Ābu Zayd al-Hilalī]] and many other Arab knights in a string of victories. The [[Zirid]]s, however, were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of Arab customs and culture. The indigenous [[Berber people|Amazigh]] tribes, however, remained largely independent, and depending on tribe, location and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times unifying it (as under the Fatimids). The Fatimid Islamic state, also known as [[Fatimid Caliphate]] made an Islamic empire that included North Africa, Sicily, [[ (region)|]], [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], the [[Red Sea]] coast of Africa, Tihamah, [[Hejaz]] and [[]]. Caliphates from Northern Africa traded with the other empires of their time, as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the Islamic Era.

The [[Berber people]] historically consisted of several tribes. The two main branches were the Botr and Barnès tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, [[Sanhadja]], [[Houara]], [[Zenata]], [[Masmuda|Masmouda]], [[Kutama]], Awarba, and [[Berghwata]]). All these tribes made independent territorial decisions.

Several [[Berber people|Amazigh]] dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in the Maghreb and other nearby lands. [[Ibn Khaldun]] provides a table summarising the Amazigh dynasties of the Maghreb region, the [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]], [[Emirate of Tlemcen|Ifranid]], [[Maghrawid Dynasty|Maghrawa]], [[Almoravid]], [[Hammadid]], [[Almohad]], [[Merinid]], [[Zayyanid dynasty|Abdalwadid]], [[Wattasid]], [[Meknassa]] and [[Hafsid]] dynasties. Both of the [[Hammadid]] and [[Zirid]] empires as well as the [[Fatimid]]s established their rule in all of the Maghreb countries. The [[Zirid dynasty|Zirids]] ruled land in what is now , , , , ,  and . The [[Hammadid dynasty|Hammadids]] captured and held important regions such as Ouargla, Constantine, Sfax, Susa, Algiers, Tripoli and Fez establishing their rule in every country in the Maghreb region. The [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] which was created and established by the Kutama Berbers conquered all of North Africa as well as Sicily and parts of the Middle East.

[[File:Maghrawa dynasty - dynastie maghraoua.jpg|thumb|Territories controlled by the [[Maghrawid Dynasty|Maghrawa]]]]
Following the Berber revolt numerous independent states emerged across the Maghreb. In  the [[Rustamid dynasty|Rustamid Kingdom]] was established. The Rustamid realm stretched from Tafilalt in  to the Nafusa mountains in  including south, central and western  therefore including territory in all of the modern day Maghreb countries, in the south the Rustamid realm expanded to the modern borders of [[]] and included territory in [[]].

Once extending their control over all of the Maghreb, part of  and briefly over Sicily, originating from modern , the [[Zirids]] only controlled modern [[Ifriqiya]] by the 11th century. The Zirids recognised nominal suzerainty of the Fatimid caliphs of Cairo. [[Al-Mu'izz ibn Badis|El Mu'izz]] the Zirid ruler decided to end this recognition and declared his independence. The Zirids also fought against other Zenata Kingdoms, for example the [[Maghrawa]], a Berber dynasty originating from  and which at one point was a dominant power in the Maghreb ruling over much of  and western  including Fez, [[Sijilmasa]], [[Aghmat]], [[Oujda]], most of the Sous and Draa and reaching as far as M'sila and the Zab in .

As the Fatimid state was at the time too weak to attempt a direct invasion, they found another means of revenge. Between the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]] were living [[Bedouin]] nomad tribes expelled from [[Arabia]] for their disruption and turbulency. The [[Banu Hilal]] and the [[Banu Sulaym]] for example, who regularly disrupted farmers in the [[Nile Valley]] since the nomads would often loot their farms. The then [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] vizier decided to destroy what he could not control, and broke a deal with the chiefs of these Bedouin tribes. The Fatimids even gave them money to leave.

Whole tribes set off with women, children, elders, animals and camping equipment. Some stopped on the way, especially in [[Cyrenaica]], where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in [[Ifriqiya]] by the [[Gabès Governorate|Gabe]]s region, arriving 1051. The [[Zirid]] ruler tried to stop this rising tide, but with each encounter, the last under the walls of [[Kairouan]], his troops were defeated and the Arabs remained masters of the battlefield. The Arabs usually did not take control over the cities, instead looting them and destroying them.
[[File:Mosquée de Mansourah, Tlemcen, 2024.jpg|thumb|[[Mansourah Mosque]], Tlemcen]]
The invasion kept going, and in 1057 the Arabs spread on the high plains of [[Constantine, |Constantine]] where they encircled the [[Beni Hammad Fort|Qalaa of Banu Hammad]] (capital of the [[Hammadid dynasty|Hammadid Emirate]]), as they had done in Kairouan a few decades ago. From there they gradually gained the upper [[Algiers]] and [[Oran]] plains. Some of these territories were forcibly taken back by the [[Almohads]] in the second half of the 12th century. The influx of [[Bedouin]] tribes was a major factor in the linguistic, cultural [[Arabization|Arabisation]] of the Maghreb and in the spread of [[nomad]]ism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant. [[Ibn Khaldun]] noted that the lands ravaged by the [[Banu Hilal]] tribes had become completely arid desert.

The [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] originating from modern day , although founded by a man originating from modern day  known as [[Abd al-Mu'min]] would soon take control over the Maghreb. During the time of the Almohad Dynasty [[Abd al-Mu'min]]'s tribe, the Koumïa, were the main supporters of the throne and the most important body of the empire. Defeating the weakening [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid Empire]] and taking control over  in 1147, they pushed into  in 1152, taking control over Tlemcen, Oran, and Algiers, wrestling control from the Hilian Arabs, and by the same year they defeated Hammadids who controlled Eastern .

Following their decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] in 1212, the Almohads began to collapse. In 1235, the governor of modern-day western , [[Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan]], declared independence and established the [[Kingdom of Tlemcen]] under the [[Zayyanid dynasty]]. After warring with the Almohads for 13 years, the Zayyanids decisively defeated them in 1248 by ambushing and killing the Almohad caliph near Oujda.

[[File:Maghreb 15th Century.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Kingdom of Tlemcen|Zayyanid kingdom]] of Tlemcen in the fifteenth century and its neighbours]]
The Zayyanids retained control over much of  for the next three centuries. While eastern  largely fell under the [[Hafsid dynasty]], the [[Hafsids of Bejaïa|Emirate of Bejaia]], which encompassed the Hafsid territories in , was at times independent from central  authority. At their peak, the Zayyanids held  as a western vassal expanded eastward as far as [[Tunis]], which was captured during the reign of Abu Tashfin.

Following several conflicts with local [[Barbary pirates]] sponsored by the Zayyanid sultans,  launched a campaign to invade  and defeat the Kingdom of Tlemcen. In 1505,  forces [[Capture of Mers-el-Kébir (1505)|invaded and captured Mers el Kébir]], and in 1509, they [[ conquest of Oran (1509)|conquered Oran]] after a deadly siege. Following their decisive victories over the  in the western-coastal areas of , the  expanded their campaign across the western  coast. In 1510, they captured Bejaia after [[Capture of Bejaia (1510)|a major siege]], launched an assault on Algiers, and besieged Tlemcen. In 1511, they seized [[Cherchell]] and [[Jijel]], and attacked [[Mostaganem]], which they failed to conquer but succeeded in forcing into tribute.

=== Early modern era ===
{{main|Regency of Algiers}}
[[File:Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hayreddin Barbarossa]]]]
In 1516, the  privateer brothers [[Aruj]] and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], who operated successfully under the [[Hafsids]], moved their base of operations to Algiers. They succeeded in conquering Jijel and Algiers from the [[|Spaniards]] with help from the locals who saw them as liberators from the Christians, but the brothers eventually assassinated the local noble Salim al-Tumi and took control over the city and the surrounding regions. Their state is known as the [[Regency of Algiers]]. When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his [[Fall of Tlemcen (1518)|invasion of Tlemcen]], [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Hayreddin]] succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|sultan]] gave him the title of [[beylerbey]] and a contingent of some 2,000 [[janissaries]]. With the aid of this force and native , Hayreddin conquered the whole area between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in  hands until 1792).

The next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son [[Hasan Pasha (son of Barbarossa)|Hasan]], who assumed the position in 1544. He was a [[Kouloughlis|Kouloughli]] or of mixed origins, as his mother was an  Mooresse. Until 1587 Beylerbeylik of Algiers was governed by Beylerbeys who served terms with no fixed limits. Subsequently, with the institution of a regular administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by an autonomous janissary unit, known in  as the [[Odjak of Algiers|Ojaq]] who were led by an [[Agha of the Janissaries|agha]]. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.

[[Plague (disease)|Plague]] had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost between 30,000 and 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21, and had high fatalities in 1654–57, 1665, 1691 and 1740–42.[[File:North Africa, from the "Physical And Political Map Of Africa ... 1822".png|left|thumb|Map of the Regency of Algiers in early 19th century]]
The [[Barbary pirates]] preyed on Christian and other non-Islamic shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea. The pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as [[slavery|slaves]]. They also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives. According to Robert Davis, from the 16th to 19th century, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25&nbsp;million Europeans as slaves. They often made raids on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell at [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|slave markets]] in North Africa and other parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1544, for example, [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] captured the island of [[Ischia]], taking 4,000 prisoners, and enslaved some 9,000 inhabitants of [[Lipari]], almost the entire population. In 1551, the Ottoman governor of Algiers, [[Turgut Reis]], enslaved the entire population of the  island of [[Gozo]]. Barbary pirates often attacked the [[Balearic Islands]]. The threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of [[Formentera]]. The introduction of broad-sail ships from the beginning of the 17th century allowed them to branch out into the Atlantic.

In July 1627 two pirate ships from Algiers under the command of [[ people|]] pirate [[Jan Janszoon]] sailed as far as [[History of |]], [[ Abductions|raiding and capturing slaves]]. Two weeks earlier another pirate ship from [[Sale, |Salé]] in [[Saadi dynasty|]] had also raided in . Some of the slaves brought to Algiers were later ransomed back to , but some chose to stay in . In 1629, pirate ships from  raided the [[Faroe Islands]].

[[File:Niels simonsen Alger 2.jpg|left|thumb|Algiers, by [[Niels Simonsen]]]]
In 1659, the Janissaries stationed in Algiers, known as the [[Odjak of Algiers|Odjak]] of Algiers, joined a company of corsair captains called the Reis in overthrowing the Ottoman [[viceroy]]. A new local leader was installed known as the "Agha"; the position became the "[[Dey]]" in 1671, who would be selected by the [[divan]], a council of some sixty military senior officers. Thus, Algiers became a sovereign military republic. The odjak initially dominated the system, but by the 18th century were the dey's instrument. Although Algiers remained nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, in reality it acted independently from the rest of the Empire, and often had wars with other Ottoman subjects and territories such as the [[Beylik of Tunis]].

The [[dey]] was in effect a constitutional autocrat. Though elected for a life term, over the next 159 years (1671–1830), fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of the Deylikal government was remarkably orderly. Although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest. Autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regency's authority was seldom applied in the [[Kabylie|Kabylia]], although in 1730 the Regency was able to take control of the [[Kingdom of Kuku]] in western Kabylia. Many cities in the northern  desert paid taxes to Algiers or one of its Beys.

Barbary raids in the Mediterranean continued to attack  merchant shipping, resulting in the [[ Empire]] attempting to [[Invasion of Algiers (1775)|invade Algiers in 1775]]. The [[ Navy]] bombarded the city in [[Bombardment of Algiers (1783)|1783]] but failed to pacify it; a subsequent bombing campaign in [[Bombardment of Algiers (1784)|1784]] was joined by the naval forces of other traditional enemies of Algiers, including [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of |]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of ]]. Over 20,000 cannonballs were fired, but the effort ultimately failed;  sued for peace in 1786 and paid 1&nbsp;million pesos to the Dey. In 1792, Algiers recaptured the two remaining  strongholds at Oran and Mers el Kébir. In the same year, they conquered the  [[Rif]] and [[Oujda]], which they then abandoned in 1795.

In the 19th century,  pirates remained a formidable force in the Mediterranean, even forging affiliations with Caribbean powers, paying a "license tax" in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels. Attacks on  merchantmen resulted in the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]]s, which ended the targeting of U.S. ships in 1815. A year later, a combined [[ of Great Britain and |Anglo]]-[[ of the |]] fleet, under the command of [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]], [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|bombarded Algiers]] to stop similar attacks on European fishermen. These efforts proved successful, although  piracy would continue until the [[ conquest of | conquest]] in 1830.

Under the pretext of a slight to their consul, the [[July Monarchy|]] invaded and [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830|captured Algiers]] in 1830. According to several historians, the methods used by the  to establish control over  reached [[ genocide|genocidal]] proportions. Historian [[Ben Kiernan]] wrote on the  conquest of : "By 1875, the  conquest was complete. The war had killed approximately 825,000 indigenous  since 1830".  losses from 1831 to 1851 were 92,329 dead in the hospital and only 3,336 killed in action. In 1872, The  population stood at about 2.9&nbsp;million.{{unreliable source?|date=November 2018}}  policy was predicated on "civilising" the country. The slave trade and piracy in  ceased following the  conquest. The [[ conquest of |conquest of ]] by the  took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed. A combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]]  population to decline by nearly one-third from 1830 to 1872.{{unreliable source?|date=February 2013}} On 17 September 1860, [[Napoleon III]] declared "Our first duty is to take care of the happiness of the three million Arabs, whom the fate of arms has brought under our domination." During this time, only Kabylia resisted, the Kabylians were not colonised until after the [[Mokrani Revolt]] in 1871.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] wrote and never completed an unpublished essay outlining his ideas for how to transform  from an occupied tributary state to a colonial regime, wherein he advocated for a mixed system of "total domination and total colonisation" whereby  military would wage total war against civilian populations while a colonial administration would provide rule of law and property rights to settlers within  occupied cities.

From 1848 until independence,  administered the whole Mediterranean region of  as an integral part and ''département'' of the nation. One of 's longest-held overseas territories,  became a destination for hundreds of thousands of [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigrants, who became known as ''colons'' and later, as ''[[Pied-Noir]]s.'' Between 1825 and 1847, 50,000  people emigrated to . These settlers benefited from the  government's confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land. Many Europeans settled in [[Oran]] and [[Algiers]], and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities.

During the late 19th and early 20th century, the [[White Africans of European ancestry|European share]] was almost a fifth of the population. The  government aimed at making  an assimilated part of , and this included substantial educational investments especially after 1900. The indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency, but in contrast to the other colonised countries' path in central Asia and [[Caucasus]],  kept its individual skills and a relatively human-capital intensive agriculture.

During the [[Second World War]],  came under [[Vichy |Vichy control]] before being liberated by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in [[Operation Torch]], which saw the first large-scale deployment of [[Military history of the  during World War II| troops]] in the [[North African campaign]].

Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, which lacked political and economic status under the colonial system, gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from [[Provisional Government of the  Republic|]]. In May 1945, the uprising against the occupying  forces was suppressed through what is now known as the [[Sétif and Guelma massacre]]. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the [[ War]] began after the publication of the [[Declaration of 1 November 1954]]. Historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 [[Harki]]s and their dependents were killed by the [[National Liberation Front ()|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) or by [[lynching|lynch]] mobs in . The [[National Liberation Front ()|FLN]] used hit and run attacks in  and  as part of its war, and the  conducted [[Torture during the  War of Independence|severe reprisals]]. In addition, the  destroyed over 8,000 villages and relocated over 2 million  to [[Internment camps in # War|concentration camps]].

The war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of  and hundreds of thousands of injuries. Historians, like [[Alistair Horne]] and [[Raymond Aron]], state that the actual number of  Muslim war dead was far greater than the original FLN and official  estimates but was less than the 1&nbsp;million deaths claimed by the  government after independence. Horne estimated  casualties during the span of eight years to be around 700,000. The war uprooted more than 2&nbsp;million .

The war against  rule concluded in 1962, when  gained complete independence following the March 1962 [[Evian agreements]] and the July 1962 [[ self-determination referendum, 1962|self-determination referendum]].

The number of European ''[[Pied-Noir]]s'' who fled  totalled more than 900,000 between 1962 and 1964. The exodus to mainland  accelerated after the [[Oran massacre of 1962]], in which hundreds of militants entered European sections of the city and began attacking civilians.

's first president was the Front de Libération Nationale ([[FLN ()|FLN]]) leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. 's claim to [[Greater |portions of western ]] led to the [[Sand War]] in 1963. Ben Bella was [[1965  coup d'état|overthrown in 1965]] by [[Houari Boumédiène]], his former ally and defence minister. Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly [[Socialism|socialist]] and authoritarian; Boumédienne continued this trend. However, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role. He [[collective farming|collectivised]] agriculture and launched a massive industrialisation drive. [[Extraction of petroleum|Oil extraction]] facilities were nationalised. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international [[1973 oil crisis]].

Boumédienne's successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], introduced some liberal economic reforms. He promoted a policy of [[Arabisation]] in  society and public life. Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread conventional Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to Orthodox Islam.

The  economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the [[1980s oil glut]]. Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in  social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system. Political parties developed, such as the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS), a broad coalition of Muslim groups.

In December 1991 the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] dominated the first of two rounds of [[ legislative election, 1991|legislative elections]]. Fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992, cancelling the elections. Bendjedid resigned and a [[High Council of State ()|High Council of State]] was installed to act as the Presidency. It banned the FIS, triggering a civil [[insurgency]] between the Front's armed wing, the [[Armed Islamic Group of |Armed Islamic Group]], and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 people are thought to have died. The Islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of [[List of massacres during the  Civil War|civilian massacres]].{{Failed verification|date=November 2023|reason=Graphic description of one massacre, but no mention of 100k or a "campaign"}} At several points in the conflict, the situation in  became a point of international concern, most notably during the crisis surrounding [[Air  Flight 8969]], a hijacking perpetrated by the Armed Islamic Group. The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October 1997.

 held [[ presidential election, 1999|elections in 1999]], considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups which were won by President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]]. He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a "Civil Concord" initiative, approved in a [[ Civil Concord referendum, 1999|referendum]], under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000. The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly. The [[Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat]] (GSPC), a splinter group of the Armed Islamic Group, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.

Bouteflika was re-elected in the [[ presidential election, 2004|April 2004 presidential election]] after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation. The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation. It also included a second amnesty initiative, the [[Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation]], which was approved in a [[ national reconciliation referendum, 2005|referendum in September 2005]]. It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.

In November 2008, the [[ Constitution]] was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents. This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the [[ presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]], and he was re-elected in April 2009. During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.

A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010, inspired by similar [[Arab Spring|protests across the Middle East and North Africa]]. On 24 February 2011, the government lifted 's 19-year-old [[state of emergency]]. The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties, the electoral code, and the representation of women in elected bodies. In April 2011, Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform. However, elections are routinely criticised by opposition groups as unfair and international human rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue.

On 2 April 2019, Bouteflika resigned from the presidency after [[2019–2020  protests|mass protests]] against his candidacy for a fifth term in office.

In December 2019, [[Abdelmadjid Tebboune]] became 's president, after winning the first round of the [[2019  presidential election|presidential election]] with a record abstention rate – the highest of all presidential elections since 's democracy in 1989. Tebboune is accused of being close to the military and being loyal to the deposed president. Tebboune rejects these accusations, claiming to be the victim of a witch hunt. He also reminds his detractors that he was expelled from the Government in August 2017 at the instigation of oligarchs languishing in prison. In [[2024  presidential election|September 2024]], President Tebboune won a second term with a landslide 84.3 percent of the vote, although his opponents called the results fraud.

=== Antiquity ===
 was home to [[Dilmun]], an important [[Bronze Age]] trade centre linking [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]].  was later ruled by the [[Sumer|Sumerians]] and [[Babylonia]]ns. From the 6th to 3rd century BC,  was part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. By about 250 BC, [[Parthia]] brought the Persian Gulf under its control and extended its influence as far as . The Parthians established garrisons along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf to control trade routes.

During the [[classical era]],  was referred to by the [[ancient ]]s as ''[[Tylos]]'', the centre of pearl trading, when the  admiral [[Nearchus]] serving under [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] landed on .{{sfn|Larsen|1983|p=13}} Nearchus is believed to have been the first of Alexander's commanders to visit the island, and he found a verdant land that was part of a wide trading network; he recorded: "That on the island of Tylos, situated in the Persian Gulf, are large plantations of cotton trees, from which are manufactured clothes called ''sindones'', of strongly differing degrees of value, some being costly, others less expensive. The use of these is not confined to , but extends to Arabia." The  historian [[Theophrastus]] states that much of  was covered by these cotton trees and that  was famous for exporting walking canes engraved with emblems that were customarily carried in Babylon. Alexander had planned to settle  colonists in , and although it is not clear that this happened on the scale he envisaged,  became very much part of the [[Hellenization|Hellenised]] world: the language of the upper classes was  (although [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] was in everyday use). Local coinage shows a seated Zeus, who may have been worshipped there as a syncretised form of the Arabian sun-god [[Shams (deity)|Shams]]. Tylos was also the site of  athletic contests.

The  historian [[Strabo]] believed the [[Phoenicians]] originated from . [[Herodotus]] also believed that the homeland of the Phoenicians was . This theory was accepted by the 19th-century  classicist [[Arnold Heeren]] who said "In the  geographers, for instance, we read of two islands, named Tyrus or Tylos, and [[Arad, |Aradus]], which boasted that they were the mother country of the Phoenicians, and exhibited relics of Phoenician temples." The people of [[Tyre, |Tyre]] in particular have long maintained [[Persian Gulf]] origins, and the similarity in the words "Tylos" and "Tyre" has been commented upon. However, there is little evidence of any human settlement at all on  during the time when such migration had supposedly taken place.[[File:Bellin - Karte von der Küste von Arabien c.1745 (crop).png|thumb|A 1745 [[Jacques-Nicolas Bellin|Bellin]] map of the historical region of ]]

There are an estimated 350,000 burial mounds.]]The name Tylos is thought to be a Hellenisation of the Semitic ''Tilmun'' (from [[Dilmun]]). The term Tylos was commonly used for the islands until [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' when the inhabitants are referred to as Thilouanoi. Some place names in  go back to the Tylos era; for instance the name of Arad, a residential suburb of [[Muharraq]], is believed to originate from "Arados", the ancient  name for Muharraq.{{sfn|Larsen|1983|p=13}}

For many centuries after ''Tylos'',  was known as ''Awal''. By the 5th century,  became a centre for [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christianity]], with the village [[Samahij]] as the seat of bishops. In 410, according to the Oriental Syriac Church synodal records, a bishop named Batai was excommunicated from the church in . As a sect, the Nestorians were often persecuted as heretics by the [[Byzantine Empire]], but  was outside the empire's control, offering some safety. The names of several [[Muharraq]] villages today reflect 's Christian legacy, with [[Al Dair]] meaning "the monastery".

's pre-Muslim population consisted of [[Arab Christians|Christian Arabs]] (mostly [[Abd al-Qays]]), Persians ([[Zoroastrians]]), [[History of the Jews in #Early history|Jews]], and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]-speaking agriculturalists. According to [[Robert Bertram Serjeant]], the [[Baharna]] may be the [[Arabization|Arabised]] "descendants of converts from the original population of Christians (Aramaeans), Jews and Persians inhabiting the island and cultivated coastal provinces of [[Eastern Arabia]] at the time of the [[Early Muslim conquests|Muslim conquest]]". The sedentary people of pre-Muslim  were [[Aramaic language#Geographic distribution|Aramaic speakers]] and to some degree Persian speakers, while [[Syriac language|Syriac]] functioned as a [[Sacred language|liturgical language]].

He had received news that some tribes were assembling an army in  and preparing to attack the mainland, but the tribesmen retreated when they learned Muhammad was leading an army to do battle with them.[[File:Persia 600ad.jpg|thumb| The [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire in the Sassanid era]] on the eve of the Arab conquest, c. 600 AD]]

Traditional Muslim accounts state that [[Al-Ala'a Al-Hadrami]] was sent as an envoy during the [[Expedition of Zayd ibn Harithah (Hisma)]] to the [[Eastern Arabia| region]] by [[Muhammad]] in AD&nbsp;628 and that [[Munzir ibn Sawa Al Tamimi]], the local ruler, responded to his mission and converted the entire area.

In the year 899, the [[Qarmatians]], a [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] Muslim sect, seized , seeking to create a [[utopia]]n society based on reason and redistribution of property among initiates. Thereafter, the Qarmatians demanded [[tribute]] from the caliph in [[Baghdad]], and in 930 [[Sack of Mecca|sacked]] [[Mecca]], bringing the sacred [[Black Stone]] back to their base in [[ (historical region)|Ahsa]], in medieval , for ransom. According to historian [[Al-Juwayni]], the stone was returned 22 years later in 951 under mysterious circumstances. Wrapped in a sack, it was thrown into the [[Great Mosque of Kufa]] in , accompanied by a note saying "By command we took it, and by command, we have brought it back." The theft and removal of the Black Stone caused it to break into seven pieces.

Following their defeat in the year 976 by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], the Qarmatians were overthrown by the Arab [[Uyunid dynasty]] of [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|al-Hasa]], who took over the entire  region in 1076. The Uyunids controlled  until 1235, when the archipelago was briefly occupied by the Persian ruler of [[Fars province|Fars]]. In 1253, the [[Usfurids]] brought down the Uyunid dynasty, thereby gaining control over eastern [[Arabia]], including the islands of . In 1330, the archipelago became a tributary state of the rulers of [[Ormus|Hormuz]], though locally the islands were controlled by the Shia [[Jarwanids|Jarwanid]] dynasty of [[Qatif]].
In the mid-15th century, the archipelago came under the rule of the [[Jabrids]], a Bedouin dynasty also based in [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Ahsa]] that ruled most of eastern Arabia.

For the next two centuries, Persian rulers retained control of the archipelago, interrupted by the 1717 and 1738 invasions of the [[Ibadi]]s of . During most of this period, they resorted to governing  indirectly, either through the city of [[Bushehr]] or through [[immigration|immigrant]] Sunni Arab clans. The latter were tribes returning to the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf from Persian territories in the north who were known as ''[[Huwala]]''. In 1753, the Huwala clan of [[Nasr Al-Madhkur]] invaded  on behalf of the  [[Zand dynasty|Zand]] leader [[Karim Khan Zand]] and restored direct  rule.

Belgrave brought a number of reforms such as establishment of the country's first modern school in 1919 and the abolition of [[Arab slave trade|slavery]] in 1937. At the same time, the pearl diving industry developed at a rapid pace.

In 1927, [[Rezā Shāh]], then [[Shah of ]], demanded sovereignty over  in a letter to the [[League of Nations]], a move that prompted Belgrave to undertake harsh measures including encouraging conflicts between [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and Sunni Muslims to bring down the uprisings and limit the  influence. Belgrave even went further by suggesting to rename the [[Persian Gulf]] to the "Arabian Gulf"; however, the proposal was refused by the  government. Britain's interest in 's development was motivated by concerns over  and  ambitions in the region.

In the early 1930s,  Airport was developed. [[Imperial Airways]] flew there, including the [[Handley Page HP42]] aircraft. Later in the same decade, the  Maritime Airport was established, for flying boats and seaplanes.

On 19 October 1940, four  [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.82|SM.82s]] bombers [[Bombing of  in World War II|bombed ]] alongside [[Dhahran]] oilfields in , attacking Allied-operated oil refineries. Although minimal damage was caused in both locations, the attack forced the Allies to upgrade 's defences, an action which further stretched Allied military resources.

After World War II, increasing sentiments against  occupation spread throughout Arab countries and led to protests in . The protests focused on the Jewish community. In 1948, following [[1947 Manama riots|rising hostilities and looting]], most members of 's Jewish community abandoned their properties and fled to [[Bombay]], later settling in  ([[Pardes Hanna-Karkur]]) and the . {{As of|2008}}, 37 Jews remained in the country. In the 1950s, the [[National Union Committee]], formed by reformists following sectarian clashes, demanded an elected popular assembly, removal of Belgrave and carried out a number of protests and general strikes. In 1965 a month-long [[March Intifada|uprising]] broke out after hundreds of workers at the  Petroleum Company were laid off.

The oil boom of the 1970s benefited  greatly, although the subsequent downturn hurt the economy. The country had already begun diversification of its economy and benefited further from the [[ Civil War]] in the 1970s and 1980s, when  replaced [[Beirut]] as the Middle East's financial hub after 's large banking sector was driven out of the country by the war.

In 1981, following the [[1979 revolution in ]], the  Shia population orchestrated a [[1981  coup attempt|failed coup]] attempt under the auspices of a front organisation, the [[Islamic Front for the Liberation of ]]. The coup would have installed a Shia cleric exiled in , [[Hujjat al-Islam|Hujjatu l-Islām]] [[Hadi al-Modarresi|Hādī al-Mudarrisī]], as supreme leader heading a [[theocracy|theocratic government]]. In December 1994, a group of youths threw stones at female runners for running bare-legged during an international marathon. The resulting clash with police soon grew into civil unrest.

A [[1990s uprising in |popular uprising]] occurred between 1994 and 2000 in which leftists, liberals and fundamentalists joined forces. The event resulted in approximately forty deaths and ended after Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa became the Emir of  in 1999. He instituted elections for parliament, gave women the right to vote, and released all political prisoners. A referendum on 14–15 February 2001 massively supported the [[National Action Charter of |National Action Charter]]. As part of the adoption of the National Action Charter on 14 February 2002,  changed its formal name from the State (''dawla'') of  to the Kingdom of . At the same time, the title of the Head of State, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, was changed from Emir to King.

The country participated in [[War in  (2001–2021)|military action]] against the [[Taliban]] in October 2001 by deploying a [[frigate]] in the Arabian Sea for rescue and humanitarian operations. As a result, in November of that year,  president [[George W.

Relations improved with neighbouring [[]] after the border dispute over the [[Hawar Islands]] was resolved by the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[The Hague]] in 2001. Following the political liberalisation of the country,  negotiated a [[– Free Trade Agreement|free trade agreement]] with America in 2004.

{{Main|2011  uprising|-led intervention in }}

Inspired by the regional [[Arab Spring]], 's Shia population [[Day of Rage ()|started]] large protests against its Sunni rulers in early 2011. The government initially allowed [[March of loyalty to martyrs|protests]] following a [[Bloody Thursday ()|pre-dawn raid]] on protesters camped in [[Pearl Roundabout]]. A month later it requested security assistance from  and other [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] countries and declared a three-month state of emergency. The government then launched a crackdown on the opposition that included conducting thousands of arrests and [[Torture during the  uprising (2011–present)|systematic torture]]. Almost daily clashes between protesters and security forces led to [[Casualties of the 2011  uprising and its aftermath|dozens of deaths]]. Protests, sometimes staged by opposition parties, were ongoing. More than 80 civilians and 13 policemen have been killed {{as of|2014|March|lc=y}}.
According to [[Physicians for Human Rights]], 34 of these deaths were related to government usage of [[tear gas]] originally manufactured by America-based [[Federal Laboratories]]. The lack of coverage by Arab media in the Persian Gulf, as compared to other [[Arab Spring]] uprisings, has sparked several controversies. 

According to [[Amnesty International]], "Ten years after 's popular uprising, systemic injustice has intensified and political repression targeting dissidents, human rights defenders, clerics and independent civil society have effectively shut any space for the peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression or peaceful activism".  remains militarily and financially dependent on  and the UAE, though this is changing with the economic reforms being implemented by the government.

The first human settlement on  dates back to the [[Oldowan]] period in the early [[Lower Paleolithic]]. About 2 million years ago, representatives of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' migrated to the [[Taman Peninsula]] in southern . [[Flint]] tools, some 1.5 million years old, have been discovered in the [[North Caucasus]]. [[Radiocarbon dated]] specimens from [[Denisova Cave]] in the [[Altai Mountains]] estimate the oldest [[Denisovan]] specimen lived 195–122,700 years ago. Fossils of ''[[Denny (hybrid hominin)|Denny]]'', an [[archaic human]] hybrid that was half [[Neanderthal]] and half Denisovan, and lived some 90,000 years ago, was also found within the latter cave.  was home to some of the last surviving Neanderthals, from about 45,000 years ago, found in [[Mezmaiskaya cave]].

The first trace of an [[Ust'-Ishim man|early modern human]] in  dates back to 45,000 years, in [[Western Siberia]]. The discovery of high concentration cultural remains of [[Human|anatomically modern humans]], from at least 40,000 years ago, was found at [[Kostyonki–Borshchyovo]], and at [[Sungir]], dating back to 34,600 years ago—both in [[European |western ]]. Humans reached [[Far North ()|Arctic ]] at least 40,000 years ago, in [[Mamontovaya Kurya]]. [[Ancient North Eurasian]] populations from Siberia genetically similar to [[Mal'ta–Buret' culture]] and [[Afontova Gora]] were an important genetic contributor to [[Ancient Beringian|Ancient Native ]] and [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]]s.

The [[Kurgan hypothesis]] places the Volga-Dnieper region of southern  and [[]] as the [[urheimat]] of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. Early [[Indo-European migrations]] from the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]] of  and  spread [[Yamnaya culture|Yamnaya]] ancestry and [[Indo-European languages]] across large parts of Eurasia. [[Nomadic pastoralism]] developed in the Pontic–Caspian steppe beginning in the [[Chalcolithic]]. Remnants of these steppe civilisations were discovered in places such as [[Ipatovo kurgan|Ipatovo]], [[Sintashta]], [[Arkaim]], and [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk]], which bear the earliest known traces of [[horses in warfare]]. The genetic makeup of speakers of the [[Uralic language family|Uralic]] language family in northern Europe was shaped by migration from [[Siberia]] that began at least 3,500 years ago.

In the 3rd to 4th centuries AD, the [[Goths|Gothic]] kingdom of [[Oium]] existed in southern , which was later overrun by [[Huns]]. Between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD, the [[Bosporan Kingdom]], which was a Hellenistic [[polity]] that succeeded the  colonies, was also overwhelmed by nomadic invasions led by warlike tribes such as the Huns and [[Pannonian Avars|Eurasian Avars]]. The [[Khazars]], who were of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic origin]], ruled the steppes between the Caucasus in the south, to the east past the Volga river basin, and west as far as Kyiv on the Dnieper river until the 10th century. After them came the [[Pechenegs]] who created a large confederacy, which was subsequently taken over by the [[Cumans]] and the [[Kipchaks]].

The ancestors of [[]] are among the [[List of ancient Slavic peoples|Slavic tribes]] that separated from the Proto-Indo-Europeans, who appeared in the northeastern part of Europe {{Circa|1500}} years ago. The East Slavs gradually settled western  (approximately between modern [[Moscow]] and [[-Petersburg]]) in two waves: one moving from [[Kyiv|Kiev]] towards present-day [[Suzdal]] and [[Murom]] and another from [[Polotsk]] towards [[Novgorod]] and [[Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast|Rostov]]. Prior to Slavic migration, that territory was populated by [[Finno-Ugrian]] peoples. From the 7th century onwards, the incoming East Slavs slowly assimilated the native Finno-Ugrians.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}}

The establishment of the first East Slavic states in the 9th century coincided with the arrival of [[Varangians]], the [[Vikings]] who ventured along the waterways extending from the eastern Baltic [[From the Varangians to the |to the Black]] and [[Volga trade route|Caspian]] Seas.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} According to the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', a Varangian from the [[Rus' people]], named [[Rurik]], was elected ruler of [[Novgorod]] in 862. In 882, his successor [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]] ventured south and conquered [[Kiev]], which had been previously paying tribute to the [[Khazars]].{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} Rurik's son [[Igor of Kiev|Igor]] and Igor's son [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav]] subsequently subdued all local [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] tribes to Kievan rule, destroyed the Khazar Khaganate, and launched several military expeditions to [[Sviatoslav's invasion of |]], [[Paphlagonian expedition of the Rus'|Byzantium]] and [[Caspian expeditions of the Rus'|Persia]].

In the 10th to 11th centuries, Kievan Rus' became one of the largest and most prosperous states in Europe. The reigns of [[Vladimir the Great]] (980–1015) and his son [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–1054) constitute the [[Golden Age]] of Kiev, which saw [[Christianisation of Kievan Rus'|the acceptance of]] Orthodox Christianity from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], and the creation of the first East Slavic written [[legal code]], the ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]''.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} The age of [[feudalism]] and decentralisation had come, marked by constant in-fighting between members of the [[Rurik dynasty]] that ruled Kievan Rus' collectively. Kiev's dominance waned, to the benefit of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] in the north-east, the [[Novgorod Republic]] in the north, and [[Galicia-Volhynia]] in the south-west.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2.

Led by Prince [[Alexander Nevsky]], Novgorodians repelled the invading [[Swedes]] in the [[Battle of the Neva]] in 1240, as well as the [[Northern Crusades|Germanic crusaders]] in the [[Battle on the Ice]] in 1242.

Kievan Rus' finally fell to the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Mongol invasion]] of 1237–1240, which resulted in the [[Siege of Kiev (1240)|sacking of Kiev]] and other cities, as well as the death of a major part of the population.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2.

The tsar [[Promulgation|promulgated]] a new code of laws ([[Sudebnik of 1550]]), established the first  feudal representative body (the [[Zemsky Sobor]]), revamped the military, curbed the influence of the clergy, and reorganised local government.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} During his long reign, Ivan nearly doubled the already large  territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates: [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] along the [[Volga]], and the [[Khanate of Sibir]] in southwestern Siberia. Ultimately, by the end of the 16th century,  expanded east of the [[Ural Mountains]].

The death of Ivan's sons marked the end of the ancient [[Rurik dynasty]] in 1598, and in combination with the disastrous [[ famine of 1601–03|famine of 1601–1603]], led to a civil war, the rule of pretenders, and foreign intervention during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the early 17th century. The [[– Commonwealth]], taking advantage, occupied parts of , extending into the capital Moscow. In 1612, the Poles were forced to retreat by the  volunteer corps, led by merchant [[Kuzma Minin]] and prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]]. The [[Romanov dynasty]] acceded to the throne in 1613 by the decision of the Zemsky Sobor, and the country started its gradual recovery from the crisis.

In 1654, the  leader, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to place  under the protection of the  tsar, [[Alexis of |Alexis]], whose acceptance of this offer led to another [[Russo- War (1654–1667)|Russo- War]]. Ultimately,  was split along the [[Dnieper]], leaving the eastern part, ([[Left-bank ]] and [[Kiev]]) under  rule. In the east, the rapid  exploration and colonisation of vast Siberia continued, hunting for valuable furs and ivory. [[List of  explorers| explorers]] pushed eastward primarily along the [[Siberian River Routes]], and by the mid-17th century, there were  settlements in eastern Siberia, on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur River]], and on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.

Following [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's death]] in 1924, a [[List of Troikas in the Soviet Union|troika]] was designated to take charge. Eventually [[Joseph Stalin]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], managed to suppress all opposition factions and consolidate power in his hands to become the country's dictator by the 1930s. [[Leon Trotsky]], the main proponent of [[world revolution]], was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1929, and Stalin's idea of [[Socialism in One Country]] became the official line. The continued internal struggle in the Bolshevik party culminated in the [[Great Purge]].

====Stalinism and modernisation====
[[File:Telegram Stalin STZ.jpg|thumb|Congratulations sent by [[Joseph Stalin]] on the opening of the [[Volgograd Tractor Plant|Stalingrad Tractor Plant]]]]
Under Stalin's leadership, the government launched a [[command economy]], [[Industrialization in the USSR|industrialisation of the largely rural country]], and [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivisation]] of [[Agriculture in the USSR|its agriculture]]. During this period of rapid economic and social change, millions of people were sent to [[Gulag|penal labour camps]], including many political convicts for their suspected or real opposition to Stalin's rule, and millions were [[population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported and exiled]] to remote areas of the Soviet Union. The transitional disorganisation of the country's agriculture, combined with the harsh state policies and a drought, led to the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933]], which killed 5.7 to 8.7 million, 3.3 million of them in the  SFSR. The Soviet Union, ultimately, made the costly transformation from a largely agrarian economy to a major industrial powerhouse within a short span of time.

Subsequently, the  were dealt major defeats first at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in the winter of 1942–1943, and then in the [[Battle of Kursk]] in the summer of 1943. Another  failure was the [[Siege of Leningrad]], in which the city was fully blockaded on land between 1941 and 1944 by  and  forces, and suffered starvation and more than a million deaths, but never surrendered. Soviet forces steamrolled through Eastern and Central Europe in 1944–1945 and [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] in May 1945. In August 1945, the Red Army [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invaded Manchuria]] and [[Soviet– War|ousted the ]] from Northeast Asia, contributing to the Allied victory over .

The 1941–1945 period of World War&nbsp;II is known in  as the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]. The Soviet Union, along with the , the  and  were considered the Big Four of Allied powers in World War II, and later became the [[Four Policemen]], which was the foundation of the [[United Nations Security Council]].{{rp|27}} During the war, [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|Soviet civilian and military death were about 26–27 million]], accounting for about half of all [[World War&nbsp;II casualties]].{{rp|295}} The [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economy]] and infrastructure suffered massive devastation, which caused the [[Soviet famine of 1946–1947]]. However, at the expense of a large sacrifice, the Soviet Union emerged as a global superpower.

====Superpower and Cold War====
[[File:Yalta Conference (Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin) (B&W).jpg|thumb|The "[[Grand Alliance (World War II)|Big Three]]" at the [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945, [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]]]
After World War II, according to the [[Potsdam Conference]], the [[Red Army]] occupied parts of Eastern and Central Europe, including [[East ]] and the eastern regions of [[]]. Dependent communist governments were installed in the [[Eastern Bloc]] satellite states. After becoming the world's second [[ and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear power]], the Soviet Union established the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance, and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the [[Cold War]], with the rivalling  and [[NATO]].

====Khrushchev Thaw reforms and economic development====
After [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|Stalin's death]] in 1953 and a short period of [[Collective leadership|collective rule]], the new leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] denounced [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Stalin]] and launched the policy of [[de-Stalinization]], releasing many political prisoners from the [[Gulag]] labour camps. The general easement of repressive policies became known later as the [[Khrushchev Thaw]]. At the same time, Cold War tensions reached its peak when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the  [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter missiles]] in  and Soviet [[ Missile Crisis|missiles in ]].

In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial [[satellite]], ''[[Sputnik&nbsp;1]]'', thus starting the [[Space Age]].  [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first human to orbit the Earth, aboard the ''[[Vostok&nbsp;1]]'' crewed spacecraft on [[Cosmonautics Day|12 April 1961]].

====Period of developed socialism or Era of Stagnation====
Following the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, another period of [[Collectivity of leadership|collective rule]] ensued, until [[Leonid Brezhnev]] became the leader. The era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was later designated as the [[Era of Stagnation]]. The 1965 [[Kosygin reform]] aimed for partial [[decentralisation]] of the [[Soviet economy]]. In 1979, after a [[Saur Revolution|communist-led revolution]] in , Soviet forces invaded the country, ultimately starting the [[Soviet– War]]. In May 1988, the [[Soviet withdrawal from |Soviets started to withdraw from ]], due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens.

====Perestroika, democratisation and  sovereignty====
[[File:President Ronald Reagan greets a young boy while touring Red Square during the Moscow Summit in the USSR.jpg|thumb|Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and US President [[Ronald Reagan]] in [[Red Square]] during the [[Moscow Summit (1988)|Moscow Summit]], 31 May 1988]]
From 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring) in an attempt to end the [[Era of Stagnation|period of economic stagnation]] and to [[Demokratizatsiya (Soviet Union)|democratise the government]]. This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements across the country. Prior to 1991, the Soviet economy was the world's second-largest, but during its final years, it went into a crisis.

By 1991, economic and political turmoil began to boil over as the [[Baltic states]] chose to secede from the Soviet Union. On 17 March, a [[1991 Soviet Union referendum|referendum]] was held, in which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into a [[New Union Treaty|renewed federation]]. In June 1991, [[Boris Yeltsin]] became the first directly elected [[President of |President]] in  history when he was [[1991  presidential election|elected]] President of the  SFSR. In August 1991, [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|a coup d'état attempt]] by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led to the end of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. On 25 December 1991, following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], along with contemporary , fourteen other [[post-Soviet states]] emerged.

====Transition to a market economy and political crises====
[[File:Vladimir Putin taking the Presidential Oath, 7 May 2000.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vladimir Putin]] takes the oath of office as president on his [[First inauguration of Vladimir Putin|first inauguration]], with [[Boris Yeltsin]] looking over, 2000]]
The economic and political collapse of the Soviet Union led  into a deep and prolonged depression. During and after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, wide-ranging reforms including [[Privatization in |privatisation]] and [[free trade|market and trade liberalisation]] were undertaken, including radical changes along the lines of "[[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]". The privatisation largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government, which led to the rise of [[ oligarchs]]. Many of the newly rich moved billions in cash and assets outside of the country in an enormous [[capital flight]]. The depression of the economy led to the collapse of social services—the [[birth rate]] plummeted while the [[death rate]] skyrocketed, and millions plunged into poverty, while extreme corruption, as well as criminal gangs and organised crime rose significantly.

In late 1993, tensions between Yeltsin and the  parliament culminated in [[1993  constitutional crisis|a constitutional crisis]] which ended violently through military force. During the crisis, Yeltsin was backed by Western governments, and over 100 people were killed.

==== Modern liberal constitution, international cooperation and economic stabilisation ====
In December, a [[1993  constitutional referendum|referendum]] was held and approved, which introduced a new constitution, giving the president enormous powers. The 1990s were plagued by armed conflicts in the [[North Caucasus]], both local ethnic skirmishes and separatist [[Islamist]] insurrections. From the time [[Chechnya|Chechen]] separatists declared independence in the early 1990s, an [[First Chechen War|intermittent guerrilla war]] was fought between the rebel groups and  forces. [[Terrorism in |Terrorist attacks against civilians]] were carried out by Chechen separatists, claiming the lives of thousands of  civilians.{{efn|Most notably the [[Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis]], the [[ apartment bombings]], the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]], and the [[Beslan school siege]]}}

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union,  assumed responsibility for settling the latter's external debts. In 1992, most consumer price controls were eliminated, causing extreme inflation and significantly devaluing the rouble. High budget deficits coupled with increasing capital flight and inability to pay back debts, caused the [[1998  financial crisis]], which resulted in a further GDP decline.

====Movement towards a modernised economy, political centralisation and democratic backsliding====
{{Further|Putinism}}
On 31 December 1999, President Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned, handing the post to the recently appointed prime minister and his chosen successor, [[Vladimir Putin]]. Putin then won the [[2000  presidential election|2000 presidential election]], and defeated the Chechen insurgency in the [[Second Chechen War]].

Putin won a [[2004  presidential election|second presidential term]] in 2004. [[Price of petroleum|High oil prices]] and a rise in foreign investment saw the [[ economy]] and living standards improve significantly. Putin's rule increased stability, while transforming  into an [[Authoritarianism#Examples|authoritarian state]]. In 2008, Putin took the post of prime minister, while [[Dmitry Medvedev]] was [[2008  presidential election|elected President]] for one term, to hold onto power despite legal [[term limit]]s; this period has been described as a "[[Medvedev–Putin tandemocracy|tandemocracy]]".
Following a [[2008 Russo- diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis]] with neighbouring [[ (country)|]], the [[Russo- War]] took place during 1–12 August 2008, resulting in  recognising two separatist states in the territories that it [[occupied territories of |occupies in ]]. It was the first [[List of conflicts in Europe|European war]] of the 21st century. The [[2008 amendments to the Constitution of |2008 constitutional amendments]] saw the terms of the president extend to six years and the lower house (State Duma) to five years. Putin then went on to win the [[2012  presidential election|2012 presidential election]], which fueled the "[[2011–2013  protests|Snow Revolution]]" protests.

====Invasion of ====
{{Main| invasion of }}
[[File:Annexation of Southern and Eastern .svg|thumb|[[-occupied territories of ]] as of 30 September 2022 at the time their [[ annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts|annexation was declared]]]]
In early 2014, following [[Revolution of Dignity|a pro-Western revolution]] in neighbouring ,  [[Annexation of Crimea by the  Federation|annexed Crimea]] after a [[2014 Crimean status referendum|disputed referendum]] on the status of Crimea was staged under [[ occupation of Crimea| occupation]]. The annexation generated an insurgency in the [[Donbas]] region of , supported by  military intervention as part of [[Russo- War|an undeclared war against ]].  mercenaries and military forces, with the support of local separatist militias, waged a [[War in Donbas|war in eastern ]] against the new  government after the  government fostered anti-government and [[2014 pro- unrest in |pro- protests]] in the region, although most residents had opposed secession from . Amidst [[2017–2018  protests|nationwide protests against corruption]], Putin was re-elected for his second consecutive term in the [[2018  presidential election|2018 presidential election]].

In a major escalation of the conflict,  launched a full-scale [[ invasion of |invasion of ]] on 24 February 2022. The invasion marked the largest [[conventional warfare|conventional war]] in Europe since World War&nbsp;II, and was met with [[Reactions to the 2022  invasion of |international condemnation]], as well as [[International sanctions during the 2022  invasion of |expanded sanctions]] against .

As a result,  was expelled from the [[Council of Europe]] in March, and was suspended from the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in April. In September, following successful  counteroffensives, Putin announced a "[[2022  mobilization|partial mobilisation]]", 's first mobilisation since [[Operation Barbarossa]]. In the end of September, Putin proclaimed the [[Annexation of southeastern  by the  Federation|annexation of four partially-occupied  regions]], the largest annexation in Europe since World War&nbsp;II. Putin and -installed leaders signed treaties of accession, internationally unrecognised and widely [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/4|denounced as illegal]]. As a result of the invasion, hundreds of thousands of people are [[Casualties of the Russo- War|estimated to have been killed or injured]], while  has been accused of [[War crimes in the  invasion of |numerous war crimes]].

However, after negotiations between Wagner and the  government, the rebellion was called off. The leader of the rebellion, [[Yevgeny Prigozhin]], was later [[2023 Wagner Group plane crash|killed in a plane crash]]. Putin won his third consecutive term in the [[2024  presidential election|2024 presidential election]], by winning 88% of the vote, the highest percentage in a presidential election in post-Soviet .

The oldest human ([[Neanderthal]]) traces in the , believed to be about 250,000 years old, were found near [[Maastricht]]. At the end of the [[Weichselian glaciation|Ice Age]], the [[nomadic]] late [[Upper Paleolithic|Upper Palaeolithic]] [[Hamburg culture]] (13,000–10,000 BC) hunted [[reindeer]] in the area, using spears. The later [[Ahrensburg culture]] (11,200–9,500 BC) used [[bow and arrow]]. From [[Mesolithic Europe|Mesolithic]] [[Maglemosian culture|Maglemosian-like tribes]] (c. 8000 BC), the world's [[Pesse canoe|oldest canoe]] was found in [[Drenthe]].

Indigenous late Mesolithic [[hunter-gatherer]]s from the [[Swifterbant culture]] (c. 5600 BC), related to the southern Scandinavian [[Ertebølle culture]], were strongly linked to rivers and open water. Between 4800 and 4500 BC, the Swifterbant people started to adopt from the neighbouring [[Linear Pottery culture]] the practice of [[animal husbandry]], and between 4300 and 4000 BC agriculture. The [[Funnelbeaker culture]] (4300–2800 BC) erected the [[dolmens]], large stone grave monuments found in [[Drenthe]]. There was a quick transition from the Funnelbeaker [[Early European Farmers|farming culture]] to the pan-European [[Corded Ware]] [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]] culture (c. 2950 BC). In the southwest, the [[Seine-Oise-Marne culture]]—related to the [[Vlaardingen culture]] (c. 2600 BC)—survived well into the [[Neolithic]] period, until it too was succeeded by the Corded Ware culture.

The subsequent [[Beaker culture|Bell Beaker culture]] (2700–2100 BC) introduced metalwork in copper, gold and later bronze and opened new international trade routes, reflected in [[Copper Age Europe|copper artefacts]]. Finds of rare bronze objects suggest that Drenthe was a trading centre in the Bronze Age (2000–800 BC). The Bell Beaker culture developed locally into the Barbed-Wire Beaker culture (2100–1800 BC) and later the [[Elp culture]] (1800–800 BC), a Middle Bronze Age culture marked by [[earthenware]] pottery. The southern region became dominated by the related [[Hilversum culture]] (1800–800 BC).

===Celts, Germanic tribes and Romans (800 BC–410 AD)===
{{Main|Iron Age Europe|Celts|Germanic peoples| in the Roman era}}

From 800 BC onwards, the [[Iron Age Europe|Iron Age]] Celtic [[Hallstatt culture]] became influential, replacing the [[Hilversum culture]]. Iron ore brought a measure of prosperity and was available throughout the country. [[Blacksmith|Smiths]] travelled from settlement to settlement with bronze and iron, fabricating tools on demand. The [[Vorstengraf (Oss)|King's grave of Oss]] (700 BC) was found in a burial mound, the largest of its kind in Western Europe.

The deteriorating climate in Scandinavia from 850 BC and 650 BC might have triggered the migration of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes from the North. By the time this migration was complete, around 250 BC, a few general cultural and linguistic groups had emerged. The [[North Sea Germanic]] [[Ingaevones]] inhabited the northern part of the [[Low Countries]]. They would later develop into the [[Frisii]] and the early [[Saxons]]. The [[Weser–Rhine Germanic]] (or [[Istvaeones]]) extended along the middle Rhine and [[Weser]] and inhabited the Low Countries south of the great rivers. These tribes would eventually develop into the [[Salian Franks]]. The [[Celts|Celtic]] [[La Tène culture]] (c. 450 BC to the Roman conquest) expanded over a wide range, including the southern area of the [[Low Countries]]. Some scholars have speculated that even a third ethnic identity and language, neither Germanic nor Celtic, survived in the  until the Roman period, the [[Nordwestblock]] culture.

[[File:Germania 70.svg|thumb|The Rhine frontier around 70 AD]]
The first author to describe the coast of [[Holland]] and [[Flanders]] was the geographer [[Pytheas]], who noted in c. 325 BC that in these regions, "more people died in the struggle against water than in the struggle against men." During the [[Gallic Wars]], the area south and west of the [[Rhine]] was conquered by [[Roman Empire|Roman forces]] under [[Julius Caesar]] from 57 BC to 53 BC. Caesar describes two main Celtic tribes living in what is now the southern : the [[Menapii]] and the [[Eburones]]. Under [[Augustus]], the [[Roman Empire]] conquered the entirety of the modern day , incorporating it into the province of [[Germania Antiqua]] in 7 BC, and was repelled back across the Rhine after the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|Battle of Teutoburg Forest]] in AD 9; the Rhine became fixed as Rome's permanent northern frontier about AD 12. Notable towns would arise along the [[Limes Germanicus]]: [[Nijmegen]] and [[Voorburg]]. In the first part of [[Gallia Belgica]], the area south of the Limes became part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Germania Inferior]]. The area to the north of the Rhine, inhabited by the Frisii, remained outside Roman rule, while the Germanic border tribes of the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]] and [[Cananefates]] served in the [[Ala (Roman allied military unit)|Roman cavalry]]. The Batavi rose against the Romans in the [[Revolt of the Batavi|Batavian rebellion]] of AD 69 and were defeated. The Batavi later merged with other tribes into the confederation of the Salian Franks, whose identity emerged in the first half of the third century. Salian Franks appear in Roman texts as both allies and enemies. They were forced by the confederation of the Saxons from the east to move over the Rhine into Roman territory in the fourth century. From their new base in [[West Flanders]] and the Southwest , they were raiding the [[ Channel]]. Roman forces pacified the region but did not expel the Franks, who continued to be feared at least until the time of [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]] (358) when Salian Franks were allowed to settle as ''[[foederati]]'' in [[Texandria]].

===Early Middle Ages (411–1000)===
{{Main|Frankish Kingdom|Frisian Kingdom}}
[[File:Frisia 716-la.svg|thumb|upright|[[Franks]], [[Frisians]] and [[Saxons]], c. 716 AD]]
After the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] government in the area collapsed in roughly the year 406, the Franks expanded their territories into numerous kingdoms. By the 490s, [[Clovis I]] had conquered and united all these territories in the southern  in one [[Frankish kingdom]], and from there continued his conquests into [[Gaul]]. During this expansion, Franks migrating to the south (modern territory of  and Walloon part of ) eventually adopted the [[Vulgar Latin]] of the local population. A widening cultural divide grew with the Franks remaining in their original homeland in the north (i.e. the southern  and Flanders), who kept on speaking [[Old Frankish]], which by the ninth century had evolved into Old Low Franconian or Old . A - language boundary hence came into existence.
[[File:Franks expansion.gif|thumb|left|Frankish expansion (481 to 870 AD)]]
To the north of the Franks, climatic conditions improved, and during the [[Migration Period]] [[Saxons]], the closely related [[Angles (tribe)|Angles]], [[Jutes]], and [[Frisii]] settled the coast. Many moved on to England and came to be known as [[Anglo-Saxons]], but those who stayed would be referred to as [[Frisians]] and their language as [[Frisian languages|Frisian]]. Frisian was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast. By the seventh century, a [[Frisian Kingdom]] (650–734) under King [[Aldegisel]] and King [[Redbad, King of the Frisians|Redbad]] emerged with [[Traiectum (Utrecht)|Traiectum]] ([[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]) as its centre of power, while [[Dorestad]] was a flourishing trading place. Between 600 and around 719 the cities were often fought over between the Frisians and the Franks. In 734, at the [[Battle of the Boarn]], the Frisians were defeated after a [[Frisian–Frankish wars|series of wars]]. With the approval of the Franks, the [[Anglo-Saxon mission|Anglo-Saxon]] missionary [[Willibrord]] converted the Frisian people to Christianity and established the [[Archdiocese of Utrecht (695–1580)|Archdiocese of Utrecht]]. However, his successor [[Boniface]] was murdered by the Frisians in 754.

[[File:Rorik by H. W. Koekkoek.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rorik of Dorestad]], [[Viking]] ruler of [[Friesland]] (romantic 1912 depiction)]]
The Frankish [[Carolingian empire]] controlled much of Western Europe. In 843, it was divided into three parts—[[East Francia|East]], [[Middle Francia|Middle]], and [[West Francia]]. Most of present-day  became part of Middle Francia, which was a weak kingdom and subject to numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours. It comprised territories from [[Frisia]] in the north to the [[Kingdom of  (medieval)|Kingdom of ]] in the south. Around 850, [[Lothair I]] of Middle Francia acknowledged the Viking [[Rorik of Dorestad]] as ruler of most of Frisia. When the kingdom of Middle Francia was partitioned in 855, the lands north of the [[Alps]] passed to [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] and subsequently were named [[Lotharingia]]. After he died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned, into [[Upper Lotharingia|Upper]] and [[Lower Lotharingia]], the latter comprising the Low Countries that became part of [[East Francia]] in 870. Around 879, another Viking expedition led by [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]], raided the Frisian lands. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result, and that laid the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into semi-independent states. One of these local nobles was [[Gerolf of Holland]], who assumed lordship in Frisia, and Viking rule came to an end.

===High Middle Ages (1000–1384)===
{{Main|History of urban centres in the Low Countries}}
[[File:Graftombe Ridder Arnold van der Sluijs.jpg|thumb|A medieval tomb of the Brabantian knight Arnold van der Sluijs]]

The [[Holy Roman Empire]] ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century but was not able to maintain political unity. Powerful local nobles turned their cities, counties and duchies into private kingdoms that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor. [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Duchy of Gelre|Gelre]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], and [[Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] were in a state of almost continual war or paradoxically formed personal unions. As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant, the area quickly became Old Low Franconian (or Old ).

Around 1000 AD, agrarian conditions started to improve, which led to increase in population, reclamation of wasteland by farmers, and steady growth of trade and industry. Towns grew around [[monasteries]] and [[castles]], and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas, especially in Flanders, and later Brabant. Wealthy cities started to buy certain [[City rights in the Low Countries|privileges]] for themselves from the sovereign.

Around 1100 AD, farmers from [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western , making the emergence of the County of Holland as the centre of power possible. The title of [[Count of Holland]] was fought over in the [[Hook and Cod Wars]] between 1350 and 1490. The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities, while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen. These noblemen invited Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy to conquer Holland.

Most of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] and [[ in the Middle Ages|]] fiefs in what is now the  and  were united in a [[personal union]] by Philip the Good in 1433. The [[House of Valois-Burgundy]] and their [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heirs would rule the Low Countries from 1384 to 1581. The new rulers defended  trading interests. The fleets of the [[County of Holland]] defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. [[Amsterdam]] grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the [[Baltic region]]. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of , Northern  and England. This trade was vital because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the [[peat]] of the former [[wetland]]s to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.

Under Habsburg [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], all fiefs in the current  region were united into the [[Seventeen Provinces]], which included most of present-day , , and parts of  and . In 1568, under [[Philip II of |Phillip II]], the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the Provinces and their [[ Empire|]] ruler began. The level of ferocity exhibited by both sides can be gleaned from a  chronicler's report:
<blockquote>On more than one occasion men were seen hanging their own brothers, who had been taken prisoners in the enemy's ranks... A Spaniard had ceased to be human in their eyes. On one occasion, a surgeon at Veer cut the heart from a  prisoner, nailed it on a vessel's prow, and invited the townsmen to come and fasten their teeth in it, which many did with savage satisfaction.</blockquote>

The [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] attempted to suppress the Protestant movement in the . Netherlanders were "burned, strangled, beheaded, or buried alive" by his "[[Council of Troubles|Blood Council]]" and  soldiers. Bodies were displayed along roads to terrorise the population into submission. Alba boasted of having executed 18,600; this figure does not include those who perished by war and famine.

The first great siege was Alba's effort to capture [[Haarlem]] and thereby cut Holland in half. It dragged on from December 1572 to the next summer, when Haarlemers finally surrendered on 13 July upon the promise that the city would be spared from being sacked. It was a stipulation [[Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo, 4th Duke of Alba|Don Fadrique]] was unable to honour, when his soldiers mutinied, angered over pay owed and the miserable conditions of the campaign. On 4 November 1576,  [[tercio]]s seized [[Antwerp]] and subjected it to the worst pillage in the ' history. The citizens resisted but were overcome; seven thousand were killed and a thousand buildings were torched.

When the next large-scale battle occurred at [[Gembloux]] in 1578, the  forces won easily. In light of the [[Battle of Gembloux (1578)|defeat at Gembloux]], the southern states of the Seventeen Provinces distanced themselves from the rebels in the north with the 1579 [[Union of Arras]]. Opposing them, the northern half of the Seventeen Provinces forged the [[Union of Utrecht]] in which they committed to support each other against the . The Union of Utrecht is seen as the foundation of the modern .

 troops sacked [[Maastricht]] in 1579, killing over 10,000 civilians. In 1581, the northern provinces adopted the [[Act of Abjuration]], the declaration of independence in which the provinces officially deposed Philip II. Against the rebels Philip could draw on the resources of the [[ Empire]]. Elizabeth I sympathised with the  struggle and sent an army of 7,600 soldiers to aid them.  forces faced the  in the  under the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]] in a series of largely indecisive actions that tied down significant numbers of  troops and bought time for the  to reorganise their defences. The war continued until 1648, when  under King [[Philip IV of |Philip IV]] recognised the independence of the seven north-western provinces in the [[Peace of Münster]]. Parts of the southern provinces became ''de facto'' colonies of the new republican-mercantile empire.

After the declaration of independence, the provinces of [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Zeeland|Zeeland]], [[Lordship of Groningen|Groningen]], [[Lordship of Friesland|Friesland]], [[Lordship of Utrecht|Utrecht]], [[Lordship of Overijssel|Overijssel]], and [[Duchy of Gelderland|Gelderland]] entered into a [[confederation]]. All these duchies, lordships and counties enjoyed a significant degree of autonomy and were governed by their own administrative bodies known as the [[States-Provincial]]. The confederal government, known as the [[States General of the |States General]], was headquartered in [[The Hague]] and comprised representatives from each of the seven provinces. The sparsely populated region of [[Lordship of Drenthe|Drenthe]] was part of the republic, albeit not considered a province in its own right. Moreover, during the [[Eighty Years' War]], the Republic came to occupy a number of [[Generality Lands]] in [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]]. These areas were primarily inhabited by Roman Catholics and lacked a distinct governmental structure of their own. They were utilized as a buffer zone between the Republic and the -controlled [[Southern ]].

In the [[ Golden Age]], spanning much of the 17th century, the [[ Empire]] grew to become one of the major seafaring and economic powers. Science, military and art (especially [[ Golden Age painting|painting]]) were among the most acclaimed in the world. By 1650, the  owned 16,000 merchant ships. The [[ East  Company]] and the [[ West  Company]] established [[ colonial empire|colonies]] and [[trading post]]s all over the world.

Many economic historians regard the  as the first thoroughly capitalist country. In early modern Europe, it had the wealthiest trading city in [[Amsterdam]], and the first full-time [[Euronext Amsterdam|stock exchange]]. The inventiveness of the traders led to insurance and retirement funds as well as phenomena such as the [[Boom and bust|boom-bust cycle]], the world's first [[Asset price inflation|asset-inflation bubble]], the [[tulip mania]] of 1636–1637, and the world's first [[bear raid]]er, [[Isaac le Maire]]. In 1672 – known in  history as the [[Rampjaar]] (Disaster Year) – the  Republic was attacked by , England and two  bishoprics simultaneously, in what would become known as the [[Franco- War]]. [[Third Anglo- War|At sea]], it could successfully prevent the  and  navies from blockading the western shores.

From 1672 to 1712, the Republic, led by [[William III of England|William III of Orange]] and [[Anthonie Heinsius]] would regularly clash with  in what some historians have come to call the ''Forty Years' War''. In the [[Nine Years' War]] and the [[War of the  Succession]], the Republic was at the centre of anti- coalitions. The  ultimately successfully defended the [[ ]], established a [[Barrier Treaty|barrier]] there, and their troops proved central to the alliance which halted  territorial expansion in Europe until a new cycle began in 1792 with the [[ Revolutionary Wars]].{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2020|p=354}} However, the wars left them effectively bankrupt, and inflicted permanent damage on the  merchant navy; while they remained the dominant economic power in the Far East, Britain took over as the pre-eminent global commercial and maritime power.{{sfn|Elliott|2014|p=8}} Between 1590 and 1713, the [[ States Army| army]] had been one of Europe's largest and most capable armies. However, after the [[Peace of Utrecht|conclusion of the War of the  Succession]], other major powers, such as Prussia, , Britain, and , significantly expanded their military forces. The Republic struggled to match these developments, and gradually assumed the status of a mid-tier power. However, historians have sometimes overstated the extent of this decline, especially when considering the period up to the 1750s.{{sfn||1995|pp=985–986}}

===Batavian Republic and Kingdom (1795–1890)===
{{Main|Batavian Republic|Kingdom of Holland|Sovereign Principality of the United | of the |Kingdom of the }}

In the 18th century the  Republic had seen a state of a general decline, with economic competition from England and long-standing rivalries between the two main factions in  society, the republican [[ States Party|''Staatsgezinden'']] and the supporters of the [[stadtholder]] the [[Orangism ()|''Prinsgezinden'']] as main political factions. With the armed support of [[ Revolution|revolutionary ]], [[Patriots ( Republic)| republicans]] proclaimed the [[Batavian Republic]], modelled after the [[ First Republic| Republic]] and rendering the  a [[unitary state]] on 19 January 1795. The stadtholder [[William V of Orange]] had fled to England. From 1806 to 1810, the [[Kingdom of Holland]] was set up by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] as a puppet kingdom governed by his brother [[Louis Bonaparte]]. However, King Louis Bonaparte tried to serve  interests instead of his brother's, and he was forced to abdicate on 1 July 1810. The Emperor sent in an army and the  [[Incorporation ()|became part of the  Empire]] until November 1813, when Napoleon was defeated in the [[Battle of Leipzig]].

[[William I of the |William Frederick]], son of the last stadtholder, returned to the  in 1813 and proclaimed himself [[Sovereign Principality of the United |Sovereign Prince]]. Two years later, the [[Congress of Vienna]] added the southern  to the north to create a strong country on the northern border of . William Frederick raised this [[ of the |United ]] to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself as [[William I of the |King William I]] in 1815. William became hereditary [[Grand Ducal Family of |Grand Duke of ]] in exchange for his  possessions. However, the Southern  had been culturally separate from the north since 1581, and [[ Revolution|rebelled]]. The south gained independence in 1830 as  (recognised by the Northern  in 1839 as the Kingdom of the  was created by decree), while the [[personal union]] between  and the  was severed in 1890, when [[William III of the |William III]] died with no surviving male heirs. [[Salic Law|Ascendancy laws]] prevented his daughter [[Wilhelmina of the |Queen Wilhelmina]] from becoming the next Grand Duchess.

The  Revolution and the [[Java War]] in the  East Indies brought the  to the brink of bankruptcy. However, the [[Cultivation System]] was introduced in 1830; in the  East Indies, 20% of village land had to be devoted to government crops for export. The policy brought the  enormous wealth and made the colony self-sufficient. The  abolished slavery in its colonies in 1863. Enslaved people in [[]] would be fully free only in 1873.

In 1993, the former two were incorporated into the [[European Union]].

Government-encouraged emigration efforts to reduce population density prompted some 500,000 [[ people|]] to leave the country after the war.

[[Neanderthal]] remains dating to around 150,000 years ago, or the [[Middle Paleolithic]], are some of the earliest traces of human activity in the lands of modern . Remains from ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' found there are dated {{Circa|47,000 [[years BP]]}}. This result represents the earliest arrival of modern humans in Europe. The [[Karanovo culture]] arose {{Circa|6,500 BC}} and was one of several [[Neolithic]] societies in the region that thrived on [[agriculture]]. The [[Copper Age]] [[Varna culture]] (fifth millennium BC) is credited with inventing [[Goldsmith|gold metallurgy]]. The associated [[Varna Necropolis]] treasure contains the oldest golden jewellery in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years. The treasure has been valuable for understanding social hierarchy and stratification in the earliest European societies.

The [[Thracians]], one of the three primary ancestral groups of modern [[]], appeared on the [[Balkan Peninsula]] some time before the 12th century BC.{{Sfn|Crampton|1987|page=1}} The Thracians excelled in [[metallurgy]] and gave the [[Ancient |]] the [[Orpheus|Orphean]] and [[Dionysus|Dionysian]] cults, but remained tribal and stateless. The Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] conquered parts of present-day  (in particular eastern ) in the 6th century BC and retained control over the region until [[Second Persian invasion of |479 BC]].{{sfn|Roisman|2011|pages=135–138, 343–345}} The invasion became a catalyst for Thracian unity, and the bulk of their tribes united under king [[Teres I|Teres]] to form the [[Odrysian kingdom]] in the 470s BC.{{sfn|Roisman|2011|pages=135–138, 343–345}} It was weakened and vassalised by [[Philip II of Macedon]] in 341 BC, attacked [[Tylis|by Celts]] in the 3rd century, and finally [[Thracia|became a province]] of the [[Roman Empire]] in AD 45.

By the end of the 1st century AD, Roman governance was established over the entire Balkan Peninsula and [[Christianity]] began spreading in the region around the 4th century. The [[Gothic Bible]]—the first [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] book—was created by [[Goths|Gothic]] bishop [[Ulfilas]] in what is today northern  around 381. The region came under [[Byzantine]] control after the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]] in 476. The Byzantines were engaged in prolonged warfare against Persia and could not defend their Balkan territories from barbarian incursions. This enabled the [[Early Slavs|Slavs]] to enter the Balkan Peninsula as marauders, primarily through an area between the Danube River and the Balkan Mountains known as [[Moesia]]. Gradually, the interior of the peninsula became a country of the [[Sclaveni|South Slavs]], who lived under a [[democracy]]. The Slavs assimilated the partially [[Hellenistic period#Balkans|Hellenised]], [[Thraco-Romans|Romanised]], and [[Thracian Goths|Gothicised]] Thracians in the rural areas.{{Sfn|MacDermott|1998|page=19}}

Their horde was a remnant of [[Old Great ]], an extinct tribal confederacy situated north of the Black Sea in what is now  and southern . Asparukh attacked Byzantine territories in Moesia and conquered the Slavic tribes there in 680. A peace treaty with the [[Byzantine Empire]] was signed in 681, marking the foundation of the [[First  Empire]]. The minority Bulgars formed a close-knit ruling caste.

Succeeding rulers strengthened the  state throughout the 8th and 9th centuries. [[Krum]] introduced a written code of law and checked a major Byzantine incursion at the [[Battle of Pliska]], in which Byzantine emperor [[Nicephorus I]] was killed. [[Boris I of |Boris I]] abolished paganism in favour of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] in 864. The [[Christianization of |conversion]] was followed by a Byzantine recognition of the [[ Orthodox Church| church]] and the adoption of the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic alphabet]], developed in the capital, [[Preslav]].{{Sfn|Crampton|2007|pages=12–13}} The common language, religion and script strengthened central authority and gradually fused the Slavs and Bulgars into a unified people speaking a single [[Slavic languages|Slavic language]].{{Sfn|Crampton|2007|pages=12–13}} A [[Golden Age of |golden age]] began during the 34-year rule of [[Simeon the Great]], who oversaw the largest territorial expansion of the state.{{Sfn|The First Golden Age}} The literature produced in Old  soon spread north from  and became the [[lingua franca]] of the Balkans and Eastern Europe. The political, cultural, and spiritual power of the  Empire during the [[Krum's dynasty]] turned  into one of the [[List of medieval great powers|three superpowers]] in Europe at that time, alongside the Byzantine Empire and the [[Carolingian Empire]] of the [[Franks]], which would later become the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

After Simeon's death,  was weakened by wars with [[Magyars]] and [[Pechenegs]] and the spread of [[Bogomilism]]. Simeon's successor [[Peter I of |Peter I]] negotiated a favourable [[Byzantine– Treaty of 927|peace treaty]]. The Byzantines agreed to recognise him as Emperor of  and the [[ Orthodox Church]] as an independent Patriarchate, as well as to pay an annual tribute. The peace was reinforced with a marriage between Peter and Romanos's granddaughter [[Irene Lekapene]]. This agreement ushered in a period of 40 years of peaceful relations between the two powers. During the first years of his reign, Peter I faced revolts by two of his three brothers, John in 928 and [[Mihail of |Michael]] in 930, but both were quelled. During most of the reign of Emperor Peter I, the empire enjoyed a period of political consolidation, economic expansion, and cultural activity.

[[Veliki Preslav|Preslav]] was seized by the Byzantine army in 971 after consecutive [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] and Byzantine invasions. The empire briefly recovered from the attacks under [[Samuel of |Samuil]], but this ended when Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] defeated the  army at [[battle of Kleidion|Klyuch]] in 1014. Samuil died shortly after the battle, and by 1018 the Byzantines [[Byzantine conquest of |had conquered the First  Empire]].{{Sfn|Crampton|1987|page=4}} After the conquest, Basil II prevented revolts by retaining the rule of local nobility, integrating them in [[Byzantine bureaucracy and aristocracy]], and relieving their lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold, allowing [[tax in kind]] instead.

Byzantine domestic policies changed after Basil's death and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, [[ uprising against the Byzantine Empire (1040–1041)|the largest]] being led by [[Peter Delyan]]. The empire's authority declined after a catastrophic military [[Battle of Manzikert|defeat at Manzikert]] against [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] invaders, and was further disturbed by the [[Crusades]]. This prevented Byzantine attempts at [[Hellenisation]] and created fertile ground for further revolt. In 1185, [[Asen dynasty]] nobles [[Ivan Asen I]] and [[Peter IV of |Peter IV]] organised a [[Uprising of Asen and Peter|major uprising]] and succeeded in re-establishing the  state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second  Empire with its capital at [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]].

[[Kaloyan]], the third of the Asen monarchs, extended his dominion to [[Belgrade]] and [[Ohrid]]. He acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of [[the pope]] and received a royal crown from a [[papal legate]]. The empire reached its zenith under [[Ivan Asen II]] (1218–1241), when its borders expanded as far as the coast of [[]],  and [[Epirus]], while commerce and culture flourished. Ivan Asen's rule was also marked by a shift away from Rome in religious matters.{{Sfn|Crampton|1987|page=6}}

The Asen dynasty became extinct in 1257. Internal conflicts and incessant Byzantine and  attacks followed, enabling the [[Golden Horde|Mongols]] to [[Mongol invasion of  and |establish suzerainty]] over the weakened  state.{{Sfn|Crampton|1987|page=6}} In 1277, swineherd [[Ivaylo of |Ivaylo]] led a [[Uprising of Ivaylo|great peasant revolt]] that expelled the Mongols from  and briefly made him emperor. He was overthrown in 1280 by [[boyars|the feudal landlords]], whose factional conflicts caused the Second  Empire to disintegrate into small feudal dominions by the 14th century. These fragmented [[rump state]]s—two tsardoms at [[Tsardom of Vidin|Vidin]] and [[Second  Empire#Ivan Alexander and fall of |Tarnovo]] and the [[Despotate of Dobruja|Despotate of Dobrudzha]]—became easy prey for a new threat arriving from the Southeast: the [[Ottoman Turks]].

[[File:Battle of Nicopolis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Battle of Nicopolis in 1396 marked the end of medieval  statehood.]]

The Ottomans were employed as mercenaries by the Byzantines in the 1340s, but later became invaders in their own right. Sultan [[Murad I]] took [[Adrianople]] from the Byzantines in 1362; [[Sofia]] fell in 1382, followed by [[Shumen]] in 1388. The Ottomans completed their conquest of  lands in 1393 when Tarnovo was sacked after a three-month siege and the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] which brought about the fall of the [[Tsardom of Vidin|Vidin Tsardom]] in 1396. [[Sozopol]] was the last  settlement to fall, in 1453. The  nobility was subsequently eliminated and the peasantry was [[Serfdom|enserfed]] to Ottoman masters, while much of the educated clergy fled to other countries.

 were subjected to heavy taxes (including [[Devshirme]], or ''blood tax''), their culture was suppressed, and they experienced partial [[Islamisation]]. Ottoman authorities established a religious administrative community called the [[Rum Millet]], which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population then gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying only by its faith. The clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept their ethnic identity alive, enabling its survival in remote rural areas,{{Sfn|Crampton|1987|page=8}} and in the militant [[Catholic Church in |Catholic community]] in the northwest of the country.

As Ottoman power began to wane, [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg ]] and  saw  Christians as potential allies. The [[Habsburg monarchy|]] first backed an [[First Tarnovo Uprising|uprising in Tarnovo in 1598]], then [[Second Tarnovo Uprising|a second one in 1686]], the [[Chiprovtsi Uprising]] in 1688 and finally [[Karposh's rebellion]] in 1689. The [[ Empire]] also asserted itself as a protector of Christians in Ottoman lands with the [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]] in 1774.

The Western European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in the 18th century influenced the initiation of a [[national awakening of ]]. It restored national consciousness and provided an ideological basis for the liberation struggle, resulting in the [[April Uprising of 1876]]. Up to 30,000  were killed as Ottoman authorities put down the rebellion. The massacres prompted the [[Great Powers#History|Great Powers]] to take action.{{Sfn|The Final Move to Independence}} They convened the [[Constantinople Conference]] in 1876, but their decisions were rejected by the Ottomans. This allowed the  Empire to seek a military solution without risking confrontation with other Great Powers, as had happened in the [[Crimean War]].{{Sfn|The Final Move to Independence}} In 1877, [[Russo- War (1877–1878)| declared war]] on the Ottomans and defeated them with the help of [[Opalchentsi| rebels]], particularly during the crucial [[Battle of Shipka Pass]] which secured  control over the main road to [[Constantinople]].

The [[Treaty of San Stefano]] was signed on 3 March 1878 by [[ Empire|]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The other [[Great Powers#History|Great Powers]] immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the [[Balkans]] might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]], signed on 13 July.

The  principality won [[Serbo- War|a war against ]] and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of [[Eastern Rumelia]] in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908.{{Sfn|Crampton|2007|page=174}} In the years following independence,  increasingly militarised and was often referred to as "the Balkan [[Prussia]]".

[[Christopher Columbus]] began exploring the [[Caribbean]] for  in 1492, leading to [[ Empire|-speaking settlements and missions]] from what are now [[Puerto Rico]] and [[ Florida|Florida]] to [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|New ]] and [[Alta California|California]]. The first  colony in the present-day continental  was [[ Florida]], chartered in 1513. After several settlements failed there due to hunger and disease, 's first permanent town, [[ Augustine, Florida| Augustine]], was founded in 1565. 

 established its own settlements in [[ Florida]] in 1562, but they were either abandoned (Charlesfort, 1578) or destroyed by  raids ([[Fort Caroline]], 1565). [[New |Permanent  settlements]] were founded much later along the [[Great Lakes]] ([[Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit|Fort Detroit]], 1701), the [[Mississippi River]] ( Louis, 1764) and especially the [[Gulf of ]] ([[New Orleans]], 1718). Early European colonies also included the thriving  colony of [[New Nederland]] (settled 1626, present-day New York) and the small  colony of [[New ]] (settled 1638 in what became Delaware). [[ colonization of the Americas| colonization]] of the [[East Coast of the |East Coast]] began with the [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia Colony]] (1607) and the [[Plymouth Colony]] (Massachusetts, 1620).

The [[Mayflower Compact]] in Massachusetts and the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]] established precedents for local representative [[self-governance]] and [[constitutionalism]] that would develop throughout the  colonies. While European settlers in what is now the  experienced conflicts with Native , they also engaged in trade, exchanging European tools for food and animal pelts.{{efn|From the late 15th century, the [[Columbian exchange]] had been catastrophic for native populations throughout the Americas. It is estimated [[Virgin soil epidemic|that up to 95 percent of the Indigenous populations]], especially in the Caribbean, [[Native  disease and epidemics|perished from infectious diseases during the years following European colonization]]; remaining populations were often displaced by European expansion.{{sfn|Joseph|2016 |page=590}}}} Relations ranged from close cooperation to warfare and massacres.

[[File:Declaration independence.jpg|alt=See caption|thumb|The ''[[Declaration of Independence (painting)|Declaration of Independence]]'' portrait depicts the 
[[Committee of Five]] presenting [[ Declaration of Independence|the Declaration]] to the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] on June 28, 1776, in [[Philadelphia]].]]
Following their victory in the [[ and  War]], Britain began to assert greater control over local colonial affairs, resulting in [[ Revolution|colonial political resistance]]; one of the primary colonial grievances was a denial of their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]], particularly the right to [[No taxation without representation|representation in the  government that taxed them]]. To demonstrate their dissatisfaction and resolve, the [[First Continental Congress]] met in 1774 and passed the [[Continental Association]], a colonial boycott of  goods enforced by local "[[Committee of safety ( Revolution)|committees of safety]]" that proved effective. The  attempt to then disarm the colonists resulted in the 1775 [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], igniting the [[ Revolutionary War]]. At the [[Second Continental Congress]], the colonies appointed [[George Washington]] commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]], and created [[Committee of Five|a committee]] that named [[Thomas Jefferson]] to draft the [[ Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Two days after passing the [[Lee Resolution]] to create an independent nation the Declaration was adopted on July 4, 1776. The [[ Enlightenment|political values of the  Revolution]] included [[liberty]], [[Natural rights and legal rights|inalienable individual rights]]; and the [[Popular sovereignty|sovereignty of the people]]; supporting [[Republicanism in the |republicanism]] and rejecting [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]], and all hereditary political power; [[civic virtue]]; and vilification of [[political corruption]]. The [[Founding Fathers of the ]], who included Washington, Jefferson, [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Jay]], [[James Madison]], [[Thomas Paine]], and many others, were inspired by [[Classical republicanism#Classical antecedents|Classical]], [[Renaissance philosophy|Renaissance]], and [[Age of Enlightenment#Politics|Enlightenment]] philosophies and ideas.

Though in practical effect since its drafting in 1777, the [[Articles of Confederation]] was ratified in 1781 and formally established a decentralized government that operated until 1789. After the  surrender at the [[siege of Yorktown]] in 1781,  sovereignty was internationally recognized by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] (1783), through which the U.S. gained territory stretching west to the Mississippi River, north to present-day , and south to [[ Florida]]. The [[Northwest Ordinance]] (1787) established the precedent by which the country's territory would expand with the [[Admission to the Union|admission of new states]], rather than the expansion of existing states. 

The [[Constitution of the |U.S. Constitution]] was drafted at the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention ()|Constitutional Convention]] to overcome the limitations of the Articles. It went into effect in 1789, creating a [[federal republic]] governed by [[Separation of powers under the  Constitution|three separate branches]] that together formed a system of [[checks and balances]].{{sfn|Foner|2020|p=524}} George Washington [[1788–89  presidential election|was elected]] the country's first president under the Constitution, and the [[ Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] was adopted in 1791 to allay skeptics' concerns about the power of the more centralized government.{{sfn|Foner|2020|pp=538-540}} [[George Washington's resignation as commander-in-chief|His resignation as commander-in-chief]] after the Revolutionary War and his later refusal to run for a third term as the country's first president established a precedent for the supremacy of civil authority in the  and the [[Peaceful transition of power|peaceful transfer of power]].

[[File:U.S. Territorial Acquisitions.png|upright=1.3|thumb|[[Territorial evolution of the |Territorial expansion of the ]]|alt=Historical territorial expansion of the ]]
In the late 18th century,  settlers began to [[Territorial evolution of the |expand westward]] in larger numbers, many with a sense of [[manifest destiny]].{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=41–46}} The [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803 from  nearly doubled the territory of the . [[Origins of the War of 1812|Lingering issues with Britain remained]], leading to the [[War of 1812]], which was fought to a draw. [[Adams–Onís Treaty| ceded Florida]] and its Gulf Coast territory in 1819.

The [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820, which admitted [[Missouri]] as a [[Slave states and free states|slave state]] and [[Maine#Statehood|Maine]] as a free state, attempted to balance the desire of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery into new territories with that of southern states to extend it there. Primarily, the compromise prohibited slavery in all other lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the [[parallel 36°30′ north|36°30′ parallel]].

As  expanded further into territory inhabited by Native , the [[Federal  Policy|federal government implemented policies]] of [[ removal]] or [[Cultural assimilation of Native |assimilation]]. The most significant such legislation was the [[ Removal Act| Removal Act of 1830]], a key policy of President [[Andrew Jackson]]. It resulted in the [[Trail of Tears]] (1830–1850), in which an estimated 60,000 Native  living east of the [[Mississippi River]] were forcibly removed and displaced to lands far to the west, causing 13,200 to 16,700 deaths along the forced march.{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=45}} Settler expansion as well as this influx of Indigenous peoples from the East resulted in the [[  Wars]] west of the Mississippi.

During the colonial period, [[Slavery in the colonial history of the |slavery became legal in all the Thirteen colonies]], but by 1770 it provided the main labor force in the [[Plantation complexes in the Southern |large-scale]], [[Antebellum South#Economic structure|agriculture-dependent economies]] of the [[Southern Colonies]] from Maryland to . The practice began to be significantly questioned during the  Revolution, {{sfnm|1a1=Walker Howe|1y=2007|1p=52–54|2a1=Wright|2y=2022}} and spurred by an active [[abolitionism in the |abolitionist movement]] that had reemerged in the 1830s, states in [[Northern |the North]] enacted laws to prohibit slavery within their boundaries.{{sfnm|1a1=Walker Howe|1y=2007|1p=52–54|2a1=Rodriguez|2y=2015|2p=XXXIV|3a1=Wright|3y=2022}} At the same time, [[Pro-slavery ideology in the |support for slavery had strengthened in Southern states]], with widespread use of inventions such as the [[cotton gin]] (1793) having made slavery immensely profitable for [[Planter class|Southern elites]].{{sfn|Walker Howe|2007|p=478, 481–482, 587–588}} 

The  [[Texas annexation|annexed the Republic of Texas]] in 1845, and the 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]] led to U.S. control of the present-day [[Northwestern | Northwest]]. Dispute with  over Texas led to the [[– War]] (1846&ndash;1848). After the victory of the U.S.,  recognized U.S. sovereignty over Texas, [[New ]], and [[California]] in the 1848 [[ Cession]]; the cession's lands also included the future states of [[Nevada]], [[Colorado]] and [[Utah]]. The [[California gold rush]] of 1848–1849 spurred a huge migration of white settlers to the Pacific coast, leading to even more confrontations with Native populations. One of the most violent, the [[California genocide]] of thousands of Native inhabitants, lasted into the mid-1870s. Additional western territories and states were created.

[[File:US SlaveFree1858.gif|thumb|upright=1.3|left|[[Slave states and free states]] in 1858]]

Throughout the 1850s, the [[Slave states and free states|sectional conflict regarding slavery]] was further inflamed by national legislation in the U.S. Congress and decisions of the Supreme Court. In Congress, the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] mandated the forcible return to their owners in the South of slaves taking refuge in non-slave states, while the [[Kansas&ndash;Nebraska Act]] of 1854 effectively gutted the anti-slavery requirements of the Missouri Compromise. In its [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott decision]] of 1857, the Supreme Court ruled against a slave brought into non-slave territory, simultaneously declaring the entire Missouri Compromise to be unconstitutional. These and other [[Origins of the  Civil War|events exacerbated tensions between North and South]] that would culminate in the [[ Civil War]] (1861–1865).

Beginning with [[South Carolina]], 11 slave-state governments voted to [[Secession in the |secede from the ]] in 1861, joining to create the [[Confederate States of America]]. All other state governments remained loyal to [[Union ( Civil War)|the Union]].{{efn|The Confederate States of America was formed by the following states, each state government of which formally declared its [[Secession in the |secession]] from the : [[South Carolina in the  Civil War|South Carolina]], [[Mississippi in the  Civil War|Mississippi]], [[Florida in the  Civil War|Florida]], [[Alabama in the  Civil War|Alabama]], [[ in the  Civil War|]], [[Louisiana in the  Civil War|Louisiana]], [[Texas in the  Civil War|Texas]], [[Virginia in the  Civil War|Virginia]], [[Arkansas in the  Civil War|Arkansas]], [[Tennessee in the  Civil War|Tennessee]], and [[North Carolina in the  Civil War|North Carolina]].}}{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=236}} War broke out in April 1861 after the Confederacy [[Battle of Fort Sumter|bombarded Fort Sumter]].{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=273–274}} Following the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on January 1, 1863, many freed slaves joined the [[Union army]].

Efforts toward [[Reconstruction era|reconstruction in the secessionist South]] had begun as early as 1862,{{sfn|Dubois|1935|p=163}} but it was only after [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln's assassination]] that the three [[Reconstruction Amendments]] to the Constitution were ratified [[Civil rights movement (1865–1896)|to protect civil rights]]. The amendments codified nationally the abolition of slavery and involuntary servitude except as punishment for crimes, promised equal protection under the law for all persons, and prohibited discrimination on the basis of race or previous enslavement.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=66-7, 251-261, 446-449}} As a result, African  took an active political role in ex-Confederate states in the decade following the Civil War.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=xxv}}{{sfn|Dubois|1935|p=381-727}} The former Confederate states were readmitted to the Union, beginning with Tennessee in 1866 and ending with  in 1870.

National infrastructure, including [[First transcontinental telegraph|transcontinental telegraph]] and [[First transcontinental railroad|railroads]], spurred growth in the [[ frontier]]. This was accelerated by the [[Homestead Acts]], through which nearly 10 percent of the total land area of the  was given away free to some 1.6 million homesteaders. From 1865 through 1917, an unprecedented stream of [[immigrants]] arrived in the , including 24.4 million from Europe. Most came through the [[Port of New York and New Jersey|Port of New York]], and New York City and other large cities on the [[East Coast of the |East Coast]] became home to large [[History of the Jews in the |Jewish]], [[ |]], and [[ |]] populations. Many [[Northern Europe|Northern Europeans]] as well as significant numbers of [[ |]] and other [[Central Europe|Central Europeans]] moved to the [[Midwestern |Midwest]].

[[Alaska Purchase|Alaska was purchased]] from [[ Empire|]] in 1867.

The [[Compromise of 1877]] is generally considered the end of the Reconstruction era, as it resolved the electoral crisis following the [[1876  presidential election|1876 presidential election]] and led President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] to reduce the role of federal troops in the South.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=xxvii, 575-587}} Immediately, the [[Redeemers]] began evicting the [[Carpetbaggers]] and quickly regained local control of Southern politics in the name of [[white supremacy]]. African  endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the [[nadir of  race relations]]. A series of Supreme Court decisions, including ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', emptied the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the  Constitution|Fourteenth]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the  Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]s of their force, allowing [[Jim Crow laws]] in the South to remain unchecked, [[sundown town]]s in the Midwest, and [[Racial segregation in the |segregation in communities across the country]], which would be reinforced by the policy of [[redlining]] later adopted by the federal [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]].

Evidence of [[rock carvings]] along the [[Nile]] and in surrounding oases indicates early habitation. In the [[10th millennium BCE]], a culture of [[hunter-gatherer]]s and [[fishing|fishers]] was replaced by a [[cereal|grain]]-grinding culture. Climate changes or [[overgrazing]] around 8000 [[before common era|BCE]] began to desiccate the pastoral lands of , forming the [[Sahara]]. Early [[tribal people]]s migrated to the Nile River where they developed a settled agricultural [[Economic system|economy]] and more centralised society.

By about 6000 BCE, a [[Neolithic]] culture took root in the Nile Valley. During the Neolithic era, several predynastic cultures developed independently in [[Upper and Lower ]]. The [[Badarian]] culture and the successor [[Naqada]] series are generally regarded as precursors to [[Ancient |dynastic ]]. The earliest known Lower  site, Merimda, predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years. Contemporaneous Lower  communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years, remaining culturally distinct, but maintaining frequent contact through trade. The earliest known evidence of [[ hieroglyphs| hieroglyphic]] inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery vessels, dated to about 3200 BCE.

Around {{circa|3150}} BCE, King [[Menes]] unified , establishing a succession of [[List of  dynasties|dynasties]] that ruled for three millennia. [[Culture of | civilisation]] thrived with distinctive achievements in [[Ancient  religion|religion]], [[Art of Ancient |art]], and [[ language|writing]]. The [[Old Kingdom]] ({{circa|2700–2200}} BCE) saw the construction of the [[ pyramids|pyramids]], including those at [[Giza Necropolis|Giza]]. A brief [[First Intermediate Period of |interregnum]] followed, succeeded by the [[Middle Kingdom of |Middle Kingdom]] ({{circa|2040}} BCE), a phase of renewed stability and prosperity under rulers such as [[Amenemhat III]].

This era marked 's height as a major power in the region, extending influence into [[]] and the [[Levant]]. It produced many of 's most renowned [[Pharaoh]]s, [[Hatshepsut]], [[Thutmose III]], [[Akhenaten]], [[Tutankhamun]], and [[Ramesses II]], and witnessed the rise of [[Atenism]], one of the earliest forms of [[monotheism]]. Despite later invasions by [[Ancient |]], [[Kingdom of Kush|Nubians]], and [[Assyria]]ns, native dynasties eventually reasserted control.

Although several revolts occurred,  remained under Persian control until briefly regaining independence before falling again in 343 BCE. The [[Thirtieth dynasty of |Thirtieth Dynasty]] was the last native royal house.

The [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] was a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] state from southern  to [[Cyrene, |Cyrene]] and south to , with [[Alexandria]] as its capital and a centre of [[|]] culture and trade. The Ptolemies adopted pharaonic traditions to legitimize their rule, appearing on monuments in  style and participating in local religious life. The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]], built c. 280 BCE, was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], later destroyed by earthquakes. The last ruler, [[Cleopatra VII]], committed suicide after [[Octavian]] captured Alexandria, ending the dynasty and paving the way for Roman annexation. Native rebellions and dynastic disputes weakened the kingdom, facilitating its annexation by Rome.

 was a wealthy imperial province of the [[Roman Empire]], supplying grain and hosting the major city of Alexandria. Governed with Roman administration and Hellenistic culture, its population primarily spoke [[Koine |]] in major cities and [[Coptic language|Coptic ]] in rural areas. Christianity reached  in the 1st century, brought by [[ Mark the Evangelist]]. During [[Diocletian]]'s reign (284–305 CE), the [[New Testament]] had been translated into  and many  Christians were persecuted. By CE 451, a distinct [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] was firmly established.

The Byzantines regained control of  after a brief [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanid Persian]] invasion early in the 7th century, until 639–42, when the country was conquered by Arab Muslim forces under [[Amr ibn al-As]]. The Arabs defeated the Byzantine armies, bringing [[Islam]] to . Alexandria briefly returned to Byzantine control in 645 but fell again to the Arabs in 646. In 654, an invasion fleet sent by [[Constans II]] was repulsed. The Arabs founded [[Fustat]], later replaced by Cairo in 969.

Under the [[Abbasid]] caliphate,  was governed through deputies residing in Baghdad. Revolts occurred frequently, including the  revolt of 828 and the uprising of 831 when Copts joined Muslims against the government. Semi-independent dynasties arose, including the [[Tulunid dynasty]] (868–905) and [[Ikhshidid dynasty]] (935–969), which maintained Abbasid allegiance while exercising local authority.

The [[Fatimid Caliphate]] ruled  from the 10th century, with [[Cairo]] as their capital. After the Fatimids, the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] governed until 1250, when the [[Mamluk]]s, a military caste of [[Turkic people|Turco]]-[[Circassians|Circassian]] origin, took control. The Mamluks ruled  for the next three centuries and maintained control over parts of the Levant. By the late 13th century,  linked trade routes connecting the Red Sea with , Malaya, and the East Indies. The mid-14th century [[Black Death]] killed about 40% of 's population.

The Mamluks, who had dominated 's military and political life for centuries, retained influence under Ottoman rule, creating a semi-autonomous power structure. The Ottomans faced repeated challenges in maintaining control, while plagues and famines weakened the economy and civil society. Between 1687 and 1731,  experienced six major famines, including the 1784 famine that killed roughly one-sixth of the population.

In 1798, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] invaded , defeating the Mamluks at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]]. The  occupation was short-lived, but it destabilized the region and set the stage for Muhammad Ali Pasha's rise. After the  were expelled, power struggles ensued between the Ottomans, the Mamluks, and  mercenaries in Ottoman service, leaving  politically fragmented.

In 1805, [[Muhammad Ali of |Muhammad Ali Pasha]] seized power, massacring the remaining Mamluks and establishing a dynasty that would rule  until 1952. He reorganized the army along European lines, introduced conscription, and developed a centralized administration. At the same time, he promoted cash-crop agriculture, especially long-staple cotton, to integrate  into global markets. His successors, including [[Ibrahim Pasha of |Ibrahim Pasha]], [[Abbas I of |Abbas I]], [[Sa'id of |Sa'id]], and [[Isma'il Pasha of |Isma'il Pasha]], continued reforms in agriculture, science, and industry, and abolished slavery.

Muhammad Ali expanded 's control over [[Northern ]] (1820–1824), [[]] (1833), and parts of [[Arabia]] and [[]], but European powers intervened in 1841, forcing him to relinquish most of his conquests. He modernized 's infrastructure, built factories and irrigation networks, and strengthened the military, while broader education remained largely limited to military and technical training. The centralization of power and focus on military and economic modernization laid the foundation for 's transformation into a regional power.

=== Monarchical  (1867–1952) ===
{{Main|Khedivate of  {{!}} Khedivate of  (1867–1914|Sultanate of  {{!}} Sultanate of  (1914–1922)|Kingdom of  (1922–1953)}}

In 1867,  was formally granted autonomous status as a [[Khedivate of |vassal state]] of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Suez Canal]], completed in 1869 with  assistance, became a key strategic and commercial asset. Financial mismanagement and mounting debts led Isma'il Pasha to sell 's shares in the canal to Britain in 1875, increasing European influence. Rising discontent culminated in the [[Urabi revolt]], after which Britain occupied  in 1882, establishing a de facto protectorate while maintaining nominal Ottoman sovereignty. The Anglo- Condominium Agreement of 1899 placed  under joint  and  administration, though Britain retained real control. Incidents such as the [[Denshawai incident]] in 1906 intensified nationalist sentiment, laying the groundwork for political movements that challenged both Ottoman and European dominance.

[[File:Cairo-Demonstrations1919.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Female nationalists demonstrating in [[Cairo]], 1919|304x304px]]
In 1914, as the [[Ottoman Empire]] joined World War I alongside the Central Powers, Khedive [[Abbas II of |Abbas II]] declared support for the Ottoman side. In response, the  deposed him and installed his brother [[Hussein Kamel of |Hussein Kamel]], who assumed the title of [[Sultanate of |Sultan of ]].  was formally declared independent from the Ottoman Empire but remained under  protection.

After [[World War I]], nationalist sentiments surged. [[Saad Zaghlul]] and the [[Wafd Party]] secured popular support, but the  exiled Zaghlul and his colleagues to  on 8 March 1919, prompting the [[ revolution of 1919|first modern revolution]]. This uprising pressured the UK to issue a [[Unilateral Declaration of  Independence|declaration of independence]] on 22 February 1922. Sultan [[Fuad I of |Fuad I]] then assumed the title of King of . Despite nominal independence, Britain retained military presence and political influence.
[[File:Fuad I of , Edward VIII, & Mohamed Sa'id Paşa.jpg|thumb|[[Fuad I of ]] with [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]], 1932|left|223x223px]]
In 1923, a new constitution established a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] government. The Wafd Party won a decisive victory in the 1923–24 elections, with [[Saad Zaghloul]] becoming prime minister. The [[Anglo- Treaty of 1936|1936 treaty]] led to  troop withdrawal from most of , except the Suez Canal. The treaty left the status of [[Anglo- |]] unresolved, as real control remained with Britain.

During [[World War II]],  served as a strategic base for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] operations, particularly in [[North Africa]]. Although  declared martial law and severed diplomatic relations with [[Axis powers]], the  army did not engage directly. Political tensions persisted, highlighted by the 1942 [[Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942|Abdeen Palace Incident]], in which  forces pressured King Farouk to install a Wafd-coalition government.
[[File:1stAlameinBritDefense.jpg|thumb| infantry near [[First Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]], 17 July 1942|right|200x200px]]
After the war, nationalist and anti- sentiments intensified.  troops largely withdrew in 1947, leaving a residual presence around the Suez Canal. 's defeat in the [[First Arab- War]] fueled anti-monarchy feeling. The Wafd Party's 1950 election victory forced King Farouk to appoint [[Mostafa El-Nahas]] as prime minister. In 1951,  unilaterally renounced the [[Anglo- treaty of 1936|1936 treaty]] and demanded  troop withdrawal. The situation around the Suez Canal escalated, culminating in violent confrontations that led to the killing of 43  policemen in 1952 by  troops. The Ismailia incident outraged  and led to the subsequent [[Cairo fire|Black Saturday]] anti- riots, which saw widespread destruction in Cairo.

These events precipitated the [[ Revolution of 1952|Free Officers Movement coup]] on 22–23 July 1952, led by [[Muhammad Naguib]] and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. King Farouk abdicated in favor of his infant son, [[Fuad II of |Fuad II]], but real power rested with the [[ Revolutionary Command Council]]. By 18 June 1953, the monarchy was formally abolished, the 1923 constitution suspended, and  was declared a republic, with Naguib as president and Nasser as prime minister.

Following the [[ revolution of 1952|1952 Revolution]] led by the [[Free Officers Movement ()|Free Officers Movement]],  came under military control, and all political parties were banned. On 18 June 1953, the [[Republic of  (1953–1958)|Republic of ]] was officially declared, with [[Muhammad Naguib]] serving as the first President. His presidency lasted less than a year and a half, as [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], a [[Pan-Arabist]] and the principal architect of the 1952 movement, gradually consolidated power. Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 and placed under [[house arrest]]. The presidency remained vacant until Nasser was formally elected in 1956.

In October 1954,  and the  agreed to end the [[Anglo- |Anglo- Condominium Agreement]] of 1899, granting  full independence, which came into effect on 1 January 1956. In June 1956, Nasser assumed the presidency and immediately became the central figure in 's domestic and foreign policy.  forces completed their withdrawal from the Suez Canal Zone on 13 June 1956. Later that year, on 26 July, Nasser [[nationalised]] the Suez Canal, provoking the [[Suez Crisis]] when , with support from  and the , invaded the Sinai Peninsula and targeted the Canal. The conflict ended following diplomatic pressure from the  and the Soviet Union, restoring the pre-war status quo.

In 1958,  formed a political union with , creating the [[United Arab Republic]]. The union, also loosely connected with [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of |North ]] in the [[United Arab States]], was short-lived;  seceded in 1961. During this period,  became heavily involved in the [[North  Civil War]], with military interventions and peace conferences ultimately leading to a prolonged stalemate.
In May 1967, tensions with  escalated after warnings from the Soviet Union, deployment of  forces to Sinai, expulsion of UN peacekeepers, and closure of the [[Straits of Tiran]]. These measures precipitated the [[Third Arab- War|Six-Day War]], during which  captured the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Gaza Strip]]. In response to the conflict, an [[Emergency law in |Emergency Law]] was enacted, greatly expanding police powers, restricting constitutional rights, and legalising censorship; it remained in force until 2012, except for a brief break in 1980–81.

Socially and economically, Nasser's policies transformed . At the time of the monarchy's fall, less than half a million  were considered upper class, four million were middle class, and seventeen million were lower class or poor. Education was expanded, with school enrolment more than doubling from 1953 to 1966. Land reforms, industrial support, and growth in public-sector employment created a larger middle class, including doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, and journalists. However, by the late 1960s, the  economy faced stagnation, political freedoms had declined, and Nasser's personal popularity began to wane.

After the death of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] in 1970, [[Anwar Sadat]] assumed the presidency of . Sadat consolidated his power by marginalising Nasserist and leftist factions, while controlling opposition both secular and religious. He shifted 's Cold War alignment from the Soviet Union to the , expelling Soviet advisors in 1972, and renamed the country the Arab Republic of  in 1971. Sadat launched the [[Infitah]] ("open door") economic reforms. Some measures of this economic liberalization caused social tensions, most notably the removal of food subsidies in 1977 which sparked widespread [[1977  bread riots|bread riots]].
[[File:Begin, Carter and Sadat at Camp David 1978.jpg|thumb|Celebrating the signing of the 1978 [[Camp David Accords]]: [[Menachem Begin]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Anwar Sadat]]]]
In 1973, Sadat coordinated with  in the [[Fourth Arab- War]] to reclaim the [[Sinai Peninsula]] from  occupation. Though militarily mixed, the war restored Arab morale and strengthened Sadat's domestic legitimacy. His historic 1977 visit to Jerusalem led to the 1979 [[– peace treaty|- peace treaty]], with  withdrawing from Sinai and  recognizing  as a sovereign state. This initiative provoked widespread controversy across the Arab world, resulting in 's temporary expulsion from the [[Arab League]], but remained popular domestically. Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by an Islamic extremist opposed to his domestic policies and peace initiative.

[[Hosni Mubarak]] succeeded Sadat in a 1981 referendum in which he was the sole candidate. He maintained 's peace treaty with  and improved relations with Arab neighbors. Domestically, he faced widespread poverty, high unemployment, and urban overcrowding. The 1986 Security Police riots, sparked by reports of extended military service, led to violent protests, destruction of businesses, and 107 deaths.

Terrorist attacks, particularly by Islamist groups like [[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]], targeted government officials, foreigners, and Christian [[Copts]], devastating tourism, 's primary source of hard currency. The political scene was dominated by the [[National Democratic Party ()|NDP]], which curtailed freedoms of association, expression, and political participation through laws such as the 1993 Syndicates Law, 1995 Press Law, and 1999 NGOs Law.
[[File:Cairo north.JPG|thumb|Cairo grew into a [[metropolitan area]] with a population of over 22 million.]]
In 1997, the [[Luxor massacre]] left 62 dead, mostly tourists, highlighting the continuing threat to security and the economy. In 2005, limited reforms allowed multi-candidate presidential elections, but restrictions on candidates and alleged government interference ensured Mubarak's easy reelection. Voter turnout was less than 25%, and opposition leader [[Ayman Nour]] was subsequently imprisoned.

[[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]] reported widespread human rights abuses, including torture, arbitrary detention, and the use of  as an international "torture hub" in the context of the [[war on terror]]. Constitutional changes in 2007 further expanded presidential powers, restricted religious parties, and broadened police authority.  remained under strong military influence, described by officials as a "pharaonic" system, with democracy as a distant aspiration.

On 25 January 2011, [[2011  revolution|widespread protests]] erupted against President Hosni Mubarak's government, triggered by demands for political freedom, social justice, and the end of long-standing corruption. Demonstrations rapidly spread across major cities, particularly in [[Cairo]]'s [[Tahrir Square]], capturing global attention. After 18 days of escalating unrest, Mubarak resigned on 11 February 2011 and fled Cairo. The [[ military]] assumed control, with [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]], chairman of the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]], acting as interim head of state. On 13 February, the military dissolved parliament and suspended the constitution. A constitutional referendum followed on 19 March 2011. Later that year,  held its first parliamentary elections since the previous regime, with high voter turnout and no major reported irregularities.

[[Mohamed Morsi]], affiliated with the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], won the [[2012  presidential election|presidency]] on 24 June 2012 and was sworn in on 30 June. His cabinet, announced in August 2012, included significant representation from the Muslim Brotherhood, prompting liberal and secular groups to withdraw from the [[Constituent Assembly of ]] over concerns of imposing strict Islamic law. In November 2012, Morsi issued a decree granting immunity to his decisions and protecting the constituent assembly's work, sparking [[2012–2013  protests|mass protests and violent clashes]] across the country. Tensions escalated, with the largest confrontations between Islamist supporters and opponents since the 2011 revolution occurring on 5 December 2012. Morsi refused to cancel the December 2012 [[2012  constitutional referendum|constitutional referendum]].

Following growing public discontent, the [[2013  coup d'état|military removed Morsi]] on 3 July 2013, dissolved the [[Senate ()|Shura Council]], and installed [[Adly Mansour]], chief justice of the [[Supreme Constitutional Court ()|Supreme Constitutional Court]], as interim president. Authorities cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood, jailing thousands and conducting mass trials. Violence during [[Rabaa massacre|dispersals of pro-Morsi camps]] left hundreds dead. A new [[Constitution of |constitution]] was approved by referendum on 18 January 2014 with 98.1% voting in favour.

[[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] won the [[2014  presidential election|presidential elections]] in June 2014 with 96.1% of the vote and was sworn in on 8 June. Under his rule,  intensified security on the Gaza border, dismantled tunnels between Sinai and Gaza, and consolidated political power. Presidential terms were extended to six years in 2019, allowing El-Sisi to run for a third term in 2024. Parliamentary elections in 2020 confirmed a pro-El-Sisi majority for the [[Nation's Future Party|Mostaqbal Watan Party]]. The constitutional reforms and strengthened military authority under El-Sisi have been described as a return to authoritarianism.

The collapse of the [[Mycenaean |Mycenaean civilisation]] ushered in the [[ Dark Ages]], from which written records are absent. The end of the Dark Ages is traditionally dated to 776 BC, the year of the first [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. The ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the foundational texts of [[Western literature]], are believed to have been composed by [[Homer]] in the 7th or 8th centuries BC. [[Ancient  literature|Poetry]] shaped beliefs to the [[ mythology|Olympian gods]], but [[ancient  religion]] had no priestly class or systematic dogmas and encompassed other currents, such as popular cults, like [[Cult of Dionysus|that of Dionysus]], [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]] and [[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]. At this time, many kingdoms and [[city-state]]s emerged across the  peninsula, some of which went on to establish [[ colonisation|a number of colonies]] in [[|Asia Minor]], the shores of the [[Black Sea]], and [[southern ]] (also known as [[Magna Grecia]]). The  city-states reached great prosperity that resulted in an unprecedented cultural boom, that of [[classical ]], expressed in [[Architecture of ancient |architecture]], [[Theatre of ancient |drama]], [[Ancient  science|science]], [[ mathematics|mathematics]] and [[Ancient  philosophy|philosophy]]. In 508 BC, [[Cleisthenes]] instituted the world's first [[Athenian democracy|democratic]] system of government in [[Athens]].

Attempts by  city-states of Asia Minor to overthrow Persian rule [[Ionian Revolt|failed]], and Persia [[First Persian invasion of |invaded the states of mainland ]] in 492 BC, but was forced to withdraw after defeat at the [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490 BC. In response, the  city-states formed the Hellenic League in 481 BC, led by [[Sparta]], which was the first recorded union of  states since the mythical union of the [[Trojan War]]. The [[second Persian invasion of ]] was decisively defeated in 480&ndash;479 BC, at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] and [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]], marking the eventual withdrawal of the Persians from all their European territories. The  victories in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] are a pivotal moment in history, as the 50 years of peace afterwards are known as the [[Fifth-century Athens|Golden Age of Athens]], a seminal period that laid many foundations of Western civilisation. Lack of political unity resulted in frequent conflict between  states. The most devastating intra- war was the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431–404 BC), which marked the demise of the [[Delian League|Athenian Empire]] and the emergence of [[Spartan hegemony|Spartan]] and later [[Theban hegemony]].{{Sfn|Worthington|2015|pp=42–43}} Weakened by constant wars among them during the 4th century BC, the  ''poleis'' were subjugated to the [[Rise of Macedon|rising power]] of the [[kingdom of Macedon]] under king [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] into an alliance known as the [[League of Corinth|Hellenic League]].

After Philip's assassination in 336 BC, his son and [[king of Macedon]], [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], established himself as leader of a [[Panhellenism|Panhellenic]] [[Wars of Alexander the Great|campaign]] against the [[Persian Empire]] and abolished it. Undefeated in battle, he marched, until his untimely death in 323 BC, to the banks of the [[Indus]]. Alexander's empire fragmented, inaugurating the [[Hellenistic period]]. After [[Wars of the Diadochi|fierce conflict]] amongst themselves, the [[Diadochi|generals that succeeded Alexander and their successors]] founded large personal kingdoms in the areas he had conquered, such as that of the [[Ptolemies]] in [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|]] and of the [[Seleucids]] in [[ (region)|]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ plateau|]]. The newly founded ''poleis'' of these kingdoms, such as [[Alexandria]] and [[Antioch]], were settled by  as members of a ruling minority.

The Roman Empire in the east, following the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century, is known as the [[Byzantine Empire]], but called "Kingdom of the Romans" in its own time. With its capital in [[Constantinople]], its language and culture were  and its religion was predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christian]].

The Empire's Balkan territories, including , suffered from the dislocation of [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]]; raids by [[Goths]] and [[Huns]] in the 4th and 5th centuries and the [[South Slavs|Slavic]] invasion in the 7th century resulted in a collapse in imperial authority in the  [[peninsula]].{{Sfn | Fine | 1991 | pp = 35–36}} The imperial government retained control of only the islands and coastal areas, particularly the populated walled cities such as Athens, Corinth and Thessalonica.{{Sfn | Fine | 1991 | pp = 35–36}}{{Sfn | Fine | 1991 | pp = 63–66}} However, the view that  underwent decline, fragmentation and depopulation is considered outdated, as cities show institutional continuity and prosperity between the 4th and 6th centuries. In the early 6th century,  had approximately 80 cities according to the [[Synecdemus|Synekdemos]] chronicle, and the 4th to the 7th century is considered one of high prosperity.

Until the 8th century almost all of modern  was under the jurisdiction of the [[Holy See]] of [[Rome]]. Byzantine [[Emperor Leo III]] moved the border of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] westward and northward in the 8th century. The Byzantine recovery of lost provinces during the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]] began in the 8th century and most of the  peninsula came under imperial control again.{{Sfn|Fine|1991|pp=79–83}} This process was facilitated by a large influx of  from Sicily and Asia Minor to the  peninsula, while many Slavs were captured and re-settled in Asia Minor.{{Sfn|Fine|1991|pp=63–66}} During the 11th and 12th centuries the return of stability resulted in the  peninsula benefiting from economic growth. The [[ Orthodox Church]] was instrumental in the spread of  ideas to the wider [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox world]].

[[Sack of Constantinople|Constantinople was captured]] by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204 becoming the capital of the [[Latin Empire]], which briefly ruled much of the former Byzantine lands. Three  rump states –the [[Despotate of Epirus]], the [[Empire of Nicaea]], and the [[Empire of Trebizond]]– were established by fleeing Byzantine aristocrats who rivaled the [[Frankokratia|Latin rule]]. The [[Reconquest of Constantinople|recapture of Constantinople]] as the imperial capital in 1261 by the Empire of Nicaea was accompanied by the empire's recovery of much of the  peninsula, while the islands remained under Genoese and Venetian control. During the [[Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty|Paleologi dynasty]] (1261–1453) a new era of  patriotism emerged accompanied by a turning back to ancient . In the 14th century much of the  peninsula was lost by the Byzantine Empire to the [[Serbs]] and then the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople fell]] to the Ottomans in 1453 and by 1460, the Ottoman conquest of mainland  was complete.

During the 15th to early 19th centuries, while much of [[Geography of |mainland ]] and the [[Aegean Islands|Aegean islands]] fell under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control, [[Venice]] retained several key territories. Notably, [[Crete]] remained under [[Venetian rule in the Ionian Islands|Venetian rule]] until 1669, and the [[Ionian Islands]] were governed by Venice until 1797. These islands were subsequently ceded to [[First  Empire|]] and later [[ Empire|]] control.{{sfn|Clogg|1992|p=10}} While some  in the Ionian islands and [[Constantinople]] lived in prosperity, and  of Constantinople ([[Phanariots]]) achieved power within the Ottoman administration,{{sfn|Clogg|1992|p=23}} much of  suffered the economic consequences of Ottoman conquest. Heavy taxes were enforced, and in later years the Ottoman Empire enacted a policy of creation of hereditary estates, effectively turning the rural  populations into [[serfdom|serfs]], while the Ottoman conquest had cut  off from European historical developments.{{Sfn|Clogg|1992|pages=3}}

The [[ Orthodox Church]] and the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] were considered by the Ottoman governments as the ruling authorities of the entire [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] population of the Ottoman Empire, whether ethnically  or not. Although the Ottoman state did not force non-Muslims to convert to [[Islam]], Christians faced discrimination. Discrimination, particularly when combined with harsh treatment by local Ottoman authorities, led to conversions to Islam, if only superficially. In the 19th century, many "[[Crypto-Christianity|crypto-Christians]]" returned to their old religious allegiance.{{sfn|Clogg|1992|p=14}}

The nature of Ottoman administration of  varied, though it was invariably arbitrary and often harsh.{{Sfn|Clogg|1992|p=14}} Some cities had governors appointed by the [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]], while others, like Athens, were self-governed municipalities. Mountainous regions in the interior and many islands remained effectively autonomous from the central Ottoman state for centuries. The 16th and 17th centuries are regarded as a "dark age" in  history.{{Sfn|Clogg|1992|page=15}} However, prior to the  Revolution of 1821, there had been wars which saw  fight against the Ottomans, such as the  participation in the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571,{{sfn|Clogg|1992|p=15}} the [[Morean War]] of 1684–1699, and the [[ Empire|]]-instigated [[Orlov revolt]] in 1770. These uprisings were put down by the Ottomans with great bloodshed. Many  were conscripted as Ottoman subjects to serve in the Ottoman army and especially the navy, while the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, responsible for the Orthodox, remained in general loyal to the Empire.

In the 18th century,  merchants came to dominate trade within the Ottoman Empire, established communities throughout the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and Europe,{{Sfn|Clogg|1992|pages=21, 23}} and used their wealth to fund educational activities that brought younger generations into contact with Western ideas.{{Sfn|Clogg|1992|page=25, 26, 27}} In the 18th century, an increase in learning during the [[Modern  Enlightenment]] led to the emergence among [[Westernization|Westernised]] -speaking [[elite]]s of the [[ nationalism|notion of a  nation]]. A secret organisation formed in this milieu was the [[Filiki Eteria]], in 1814. They engaged [[traditional society|traditional strata]] of the  Orthodox world in their [[liberal nationalism|liberal nationalist]] cause.

The first revolt began on 6 March 1821 in the [[Danubian Principalities]], but was put down by the Ottomans. This spurred the  of the [[Peloponnese]] and on 17 March the [[Maniots]] declared war on the Ottomans. By October 1821 the  had captured [[Tripoli, |Tripolitsa]].

The [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] negotiated with [[Mehmet Ali of ]], who agreed to send his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of |Ibrahim Pasha]] with an army, in return for territorial gain. By the end of 1825, most of the Peloponnese was under  control. Three [[great powers]], [[Bourbon Restoration in |]], [[ Empire]], and the [[]], each sent a navy.

In 1827, [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], was chosen by the [[Third National Assembly at Troezen]] as the first governor of the [[First Hellenic Republic]]. Kapodistrias established state, economic and military institutions. Tensions appeared between him and local interests and, following his assassination in 1831 and the [[London Conference of 1832]], Britain,  and  installed Bavarian Prince [[Otto of |Otto von Wittelsbach]] as [[Kingdom of  (Wittelsbach)|monarch]].

In 1843 an [[3 September 1843 Revolution|uprising]] forced Otto to grant a [[ Constitution of 1844|constitution]] and [[Hellenic Parliament|representative assembly]].

Despite the [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]] of Otto's reign, it proved instrumental in developing institutions which are still the bedrock of  administration and education. Reforms were taken in education, maritime and postal communications, effective civil administration and the [[legal code]].{{sfn|Great  Encyclopedia|page=50–51}} [[Historical revisionism]] took the form of de-[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantinification]] and de-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottomanisation]], in favour of promoting Ancient  heritage.{{sfn|Roudometof|2001|pp=101–113}} The capital was moved from [[Nafplio]], where it had been since 1829, to [[Athens]], then a smaller town.

Otto [[23 October 1862 Revolution|was deposed]] in 1862 because of the Bavarian-dominated government, heavy taxation, and a failed attempt to annex Crete from the Ottomans. He was replaced by Prince Wilhelm of , who took the name [[George I of |George I]] and brought with him the Ionian Islands as a coronation gift from Britain. A [[ Constitution of 1864|new Constitution in 1864]] changed 's form of government from [[constitutional monarchy]] to the more democratic [[crowned republic]].{{sfn|Great  Encyclopedia|page=239|loc="Διὰ τοῦ Συντάγματος τοῦ 1864 καθιερώθει ὡς πολίτευμα διὰ τὴν Ἑλλάδα ἡ κοινοβουλευτικὴ μοναρχία, ἣ, ὅπως ἄλλως ἐχαρακτηρίσθη, ἡ «βασιλευομένη δημοκρατία» ἣ «δημοκρατικὴ βασιλεία»" [Through the Constitution of 1864, constitutional monarchy, or, as it had been described, "crowned democracy", or "democratic monarchy", was consolidated as the form of government in ]}} In 1875 [[parliamentary majority]] as a requirement for government was introduced, curbing the power of the monarchy to appoint [[minority government]]s.

By 1913, 's territory and population had doubled, annexing Crete, [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], and [[ ()|]]. The struggle between [[Constantine I of |King Constantine I]] and charismatic Venizelos over foreign policy on the eve of the First World War dominated politics and divided the country into [[National Schism|two opposing groups]]. During parts of the war,  had two governments: A royalist [[Central Powers|pro-]] one in [[Athens]] and a [[Venizelism|Venizelist]] pro-[[Triple Entente|Entente]] one in [[Thessaloniki]]. They united in 1917, when  entered the war on the side of the Entente.

After the war,  attempted expansion into [[Asia Minor]], a region with a large native  population, but was defeated in the [[Greco- War (1919–1922)]], contributing to a flight of [[Ottoman |Asia Minor ]]. These events overlapped, happening during the [[ genocide]] (1914–22), when Ottoman and  officials contributed to the death of several hundred thousand Asia Minor , along with similar numbers of [[Assyrian genocide|Assyrians]] and a larger number of [[ genocide|]]. The resultant  exodus from Asia Minor was made permanent, and expanded, in an official [[population exchange between  and ]], as part of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] which ended the war. The following era was marked by instability, as over 1.5&nbsp;million propertyless  refugees from  (some of whom could not speak ) had to be integrated into  society. The refugees made a dramatic population boost, as they were more than a quarter of 's prior population.

Following the catastrophic events in Asia Minor, the monarchy was abolished [[ republic referendum, 1924|via a referendum]] in 1924 and the [[Second Hellenic Republic]] declared. In 1935, a royalist general-turned-politician [[Georgios Kondylis]] took power after a coup and abolished the republic, holding [[ monarchy referendum, 1935|a rigged referendum]], after which [[George II of |King George II]] was restored to the throne.
