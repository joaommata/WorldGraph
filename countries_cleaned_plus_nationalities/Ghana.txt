The earliest kingdoms to emerge in  were [[Bono state|Bonoman]] in the south and the [[Kingdom of Dagbon]] in the north, with Bonoman existing in the area during the 11th century. From the 17th century, different Akan states began to emerge from what is believed to have been the Bonoman area, mainly based on gold trading. These states included Bonoman (Brong-Ahafo region), [[Adansi]] and [[Asante Empire|Asante]] ([[Ashanti Region]]), [[Denkyira]] ([[Central Region ()|Western North region]]), [[Mankessim Kingdom]] ([[Western Region ()|Central region]]), [[Akyem]] and [[Akwamu]] [[Eastern Region ()|(Eastern region)]]. By the 19th century, the territory of the southern part of  was included in the [[Ashanti Empire|Asante Kingdom]]. The government of the Ashanti Empire operated first as a loose network and eventually as a centralised kingdom with a specialised bureaucracy centred in the capital city of [[Kumasi]]. Prior to Akan contact with Europeans, the Akan people created an economy based on principally gold and [[gold bar]] precious metals, which were traded with other states in Africa.

The Ga-Dangme and Ewe migrated westward from south-western [[]]. The Ewe, formerly known as Dogbo, migrated from Oyo area with their Gbe-speaking kinsmen (Adja, Fon, Phla/Phera and Ogun/Gun) and, in transition, settled at Ketou in  Republic, Tado in , and Dogbo Nyigbo in  Republic, with Nortsie (a walled town in present-day ) as their final dispersal point. Their dispersal from Nortsie was necessitated by the high-handed rule of King Agorkorli (Agɔ Akɔli), who was the reigning monarch of the tribe at that time. The Ewe in  speak three principal dialects: Anlo (along the coast), Tongu (along the Volta river) and Ewedome (in the hill country side). The [[Ga-Adangbe people|Ga-Dangme]] occupy the Greater Accra Region and parts of the Eastern Region, while the Ewe are found in the [[Volta Region]] as well as the neighbouring ,  Republic and  (around Badagry area).{{citation needed|date=April 2025}}

===European contact and colonialism===

Akan trade with European states began after contact with the [[ Empire|]] in the 15th century. European contact was by the [[ people]], who came to the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast region]] in the 15th century to trade. The  then established the [[ Gold Coast]] (Costa do Ouro), focused on the availability of gold. The  built a trading lodge at a coastal settlement called Anomansah (the perpetual drink), which they renamed [[Elmina|São Jorge da Mina]]. In 1481, King [[John II of ]] commissioned [[Diogo de Azambuja]] to build the [[Elmina Castle]], which was completed in three years. By 1598, the [[ people|]] had joined the  in the gold trade, establishing the [[ Gold Coast]] (''Nederlandse Bezittingen ter Kuste van '' – ' properties at the  coast') and building forts at [[Fort Komenda]] and Kormantsi. In 1617, the  captured the Elmina Castle from the  and [[Axim]] in 1642 ([[Fort Saint Anthony|Fort St Anthony]]).

European traders had joined in gold trading by the 17th century, including the [[Swedes]], establishing the [[ Gold Coast]] (''Svenska Guldkusten''), and [[–]], establishing the [[ Gold Coast]] (''Danske Guldkyst'' or ''Dansk ''). European traders participated in the [[Atlantic slave trade]] in this area. More than 30 forts and castles were built by the merchants. The Germans established the [[Brandenburger Gold Coast]] or Groß Friedrichsburg. In 1874, Great Britain established control over some parts of the country, assigning these areas the status of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|British Gold Coast]]. [[Military]] engagements occurred between British colonial powers and Akan nation-states. The Kingdom of [[Ashanti Empire|Ashanti]] defeated the British some times in the 100-year-long [[Anglo-Ashanti wars]] and eventually lost with the [[War of the Golden Stool]] in 1900. In the late 19th century, cocoa cultivation spread through the tropical forests, with the British administration actively supporting the growth of the commercial cocoa industry.

In 1947, the newly formed [[United Gold Coast Convention]] led by [[The Big Six ()|"The Big Six"]] called for "self-government within the shortest possible time" following the [[1946 Gold Coast general election|1946 Gold Coast legislative election]]. [[Kwame Nkrumah]], a  nationalist who led  from 1957 to 1966 as the country's first [[Prime Minister of |prime minister]] and [[President of |president]], formed the [[Convention People's Party]] in 1949 with the motto "self-government now". The party initiated a "positive action" campaign involving non-violent protests, strikes and non-cooperation with the British authorities. Nkrumah was arrested and sentenced to one year imprisonment during this time. In the Gold Coast's [[1951 Gold Coast general election|1951 general election]], he was elected to Parliament and was released from prison. He became prime minister in 1952 and began a policy of Africanization.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

In 1964, a [[1964  constitutional referendum|constitutional amendment]] made  a [[one-party state]], with Nkrumah as [[president for life]] of both the nation and its party. Nkrumah was the first African head of state to promote the concept of [[Pan-Africanism]], which he had been introduced to during his studies at [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]], Pennsylvania in the , at the time when [[Marcus Garvey]] was known for his "Back to Africa Movement". He merged the teachings of Garvey, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and the naturalised  scholar [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] into the formation of 1960s . Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, as he became known, played an instrumental part in the founding of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], and in establishing the [[Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute]] to teach his ideologies of [[communism]] and [[socialism]].

{{main|History of  (1966–1979)}}
The government of Nkrumah was subsequently overthrown in a coup by the [[ Armed Forces]], codenamed "Operation Cold Chop". This occurred while Nkrumah was abroad with [[Zhou Enlai]] in the People's Republic of , on a mission to [[Hanoi]], , to help end the [[ War]]. The coup took place on 24 February 1966, led by Colonel [[Emmanuel Kwasi Kotoka]] and Brigadier Akwasi Afrifa. The [[National Liberation Council]] was formed, chaired by Lieutenant General [[Joseph Arthur Ankrah|Joseph A. Ankrah]].

A series of alternating military and civilian governments, often affected by economic instabilities, ruled  from 1966, ending with the ascent to power of [[Flight lieutenant|Flight Lieutenant]] [[Jerry Rawlings|Jerry John Rawlings]] of the [[Provisional National Defence Council]] in 1981. These changes resulted in the suspension of the [[Constitution of |constitution]] in 1981 and the banning of [[List of political parties in |political parties]]. The economy soon declined, so Rawlings negotiated a structural adjustment plan, changing many old economic policies, and growth recovered during the mid-1980s. A new constitution restoring [[multi-party system]] politics was promulgated in the [[1992  presidential election|presidential election of 1992]], in which Rawlings was elected, and again in the [[1996  general election|general election of 1996]].
