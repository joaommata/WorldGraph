 first emerged from the sea during the [[Oligocene]] Epoch approximately 27 million years ago, making it one of the last Caribbean islands to be formed by [[Volcanism|volcanic activity]].{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

=== Pre-colonial period and early European contact ===

's precolonial indigenous inhabitants were the [[Island Carib]] people, who are thought to have driven out the previous [[Arawak]] population. However, this may be a partial misconception as ancestral Kalinago narratives mention the two groups coexisting and intermarrying. The Arawak were not the primary indigenous group. It is believed that before them were a group of paleo- who arrived towards the end of the late Pleistocene period.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

In 1493, [[Christopher Columbus]] first spotted the island during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|second voyage]] to the Americas. Because he saw the island on a Sunday (November 3, 1493), Columbus named the island  (Latin for 'Sunday'). Some  colonisers settled there. But, as European explorers and settlers entered the region, indigenous refugees from surrounding islands settled in  and pushed out the  settlers. The  instead settled other areas that were easier to control.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

 had little success in colonising . In 1632, the  [[Compagnie des Îles de l'Amérique]] claimed it and other ''"Petites Antilles"'' for [[Kingdom of |]], but no physical occupation took place. Between 1642 and 1650,  missionary [[Raymond Breton]] became the first regular European visitor to the island.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

In 1660, the  and  agreed that  and [[  (island)|St. ]] should not be settled, but instead left to the Carib people as neutral territory. However, its natural resources attracted expeditions of  and  foresters, who began harvesting timber. In 1690, the  established their first permanent settlements.  woodcutters from [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]] began to set up timber camps to supply the  islands with wood, and they gradually became permanent settlers. They brought the first enslaved Africans from West Africa to ''Dominique'', as they called it in .{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

In 1715, a revolt of "poor white" smallholders in the north of Martinique, known as La Gaoulé, caused settlers to migrate to southern Dominique, where they set up [[smallholding]]s. Meanwhile,  families and others from Guadeloupe settled in the north. In 1727, the first  commander, [[M. Le Grand]], took charge of the island with a basic  government. Dominique formally became a [[colony]] of , and the island was divided into districts or "quarters". The  had already developed plantation agriculture on Martinique and Guadeloupe, where they cultivated [[sugarcane]] with enslaved African workers. In Dominique they gradually developed coffee plantations. Because of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the general population came to consist primarily of black-African slaves.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

In 1761, during the [[Seven Years' War]] in Europe, a [[ expedition against ]], led by [[Andrew Rollo, 5th Lord Rollo|Andrew Rollo]], conquered the island and several other Caribbean islands. In 1763,  lost the war and ceded the island to Great Britain in 1763 under the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]]. The same year, the  established a [[legislative assembly]], with only European colonists represented.  remained the official language, but [[Antillean Creole]], which had developed from it, was spoken by most of the population.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

In 1778 the , with the active co-operation of the population, began the [[Invasion of  (1778)|re-capture of ]]. This was ended in 1783 by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|second Treaty of Paris]], which returned the island to  control, but the island population, especially those considered {{Lang|fr|gens de couleur libres}} ({{Lit|free people of colour}}), resisted  restrictions. The  retained control throughout  invasions in 1795 and 1805, the first taking place during the period of the [[ Revolution]], which gained the independence of  (formerly -Domingue, 's richest Caribbean colony).{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

Great Britain established a small colony in 1805. It used  as part of the [[Atlantic slave trade|Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade]], by which slaves were imported and sold as labour in the islands as part of a trade that included producing and shipping sugar and coffee as commodity crops to Europe. The best documented slave plantation on the island is Hillsborough Estate, which had 71 male and 68 female slaves.  The [[Quarry Bank Mill|Greg]] family were notable: Thomas Hodgson, a brother-in-law, owned a slave ship, and Thomas Greg and his son John Greg were part-owners of [[sugar plantation]]s in .  In January 1814, 20 slaves absconded from Hillsborough. They were recorded as recaptured and punished with 100 lashes applied to the males and 50 for the females. The slaves reportedly said that one of their people had died in the plantation hospital, and they believed he had been poisoned.

In 1831, reflecting a liberalisation of official  racial attitudes, the Brown Privilege Bill conferred political and social rights on [[free black]]s (mostly [[free people of colour]], who generally were of [[mixed race]], with African and European ancestry). With the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]], Britain ended the institution of slavery throughout [[ Empire|its empire]], except in .

With freedom came enfranchisement. In 1835, the first three men of African descent were elected to the legislative assembly of . Many slaves from the neighbouring  colonial islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique fled to . In 1838,  became the first colony of the [[ West Indies]] to have an elected legislature controlled by an ethnic African majority. Most of these legislators had been free people of colour and smallholders or merchants before the abolition of slavery. Their economic and social views were different from the interests of the small, wealthy  [[plantation|planter]] class. Reacting to a perceived threat to their power, the planters lobbied for more direct  rule.

In 1865, after much agitation and tension, the colonial office replaced the elective assembly with one made up of one-half members who were elected and one-half who were appointed. Planters, who were allied with colonial administrators, outmanoeuvred the elected legislators on many occasions. In 1871,  became part of the [[ Leeward Islands]]. The political power of the elected assembly progressively eroded. [[Crown colony]] government was re-established in 1896.

In [[World War I]], many , mainly the sons of small farmers, volunteered to fight in Europe for the  Empire. After the war, an upsurge of political consciousness throughout the Caribbean led to the formation of the [[List of historical autonomist and secessionist movements# West Indies|Representative Government Association]]. Marshalling public frustration with the lack of a voice in the government of , this group won one-third of the popularly elected seats of the legislative assembly in 1924, and one-half in 1936. In 1940, administration of  was transferred from the [[ Leeward Islands]] to the [[ Windward Islands]]. During [[World War II]], some  volunteered in  and Caribbean forces. Thousands of [[Free ]] refugees from Martinique and Guadeloupe escaped to  from the [[Vichy |Vichy]]-controlled  islands, staying in [[Roseau]] and other villages.

Until 1958,  was governed as part of the [[ Windward Islands]]. Caribbean islands sought independence from 1958 to 1962, and  became a province of the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]] in 1958. After the federation dissolved in 1962,  became an associated state of the  in 1967, and formally took responsibility for its internal affairs. On 3 November 1978,  was granted independence as a [[republic]], led by Prime Minister [[Patrick John]].

=== Post-independence ===
In mid-1979, political discontent with founding prime minister Patrick John's administration climaxed in a civilian coup and ended in the passage of a [[motion of no confidence]] against John in the House of Assembly, 's legislature, collapsing his administration. An Interim Government was formed under 's second Prime Minister [[Oliver Seraphin]]; Seraphin's main task was to prepare the country for fresh general elections constitutionally due in 1980, hence the unofficial title "Interim Prime Minister". Seraphin organised and led a splinter of the  Labour Party—the Democratic Labour Party—into the 1980 general election and lost mainly because his nearly 13 month-long premiership was dominated by the effects of Category Five [[Hurricane David]], which caused 56 deaths and untold damage across the island. [[Hurricane Allen]] the following year caused further damage. After the [[1980  general election|1980 election]], Seraphin's government was replaced by one led by the [[ Freedom Party]] (DFP) under Prime Minister [[Eugenia Charles]]; she was the Caribbean's first female prime minister.

In 1981, Charles's government was threatened with two attempted coups. The first was led by [[Frederick Newton]], commander of the [[Military of ]], who organised an attack on the police headquarters in Roseau which resulted in the death of a police officer. Newton and five other soldiers were found guilty in the attack and sentenced to death in 1983; the sentences of the five accomplices were later commuted to life in prison, but Newton was executed in 1986. A second occurred later in the year when the country was threatened with a takeover by [[mercenaries]], led by [[Mike Perdue]] and [[Wolfgang Droege]] in [[Operation Red Dog]]. They tried to overthrow Charles as prime minister and reinstate ex-prime minister John in exchange for control over the country's development. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was tipped off, and the ship hired to transport the mercenaries never left dock. The mercenaries lacked formal military experience or training, and most of the crew had been misled into joining by the ringleader Mike Perdue. [[White supremacy|White supremacist]] [[Don Black (white nationalist)|Don Black]] was jailed for his part in the attempted coup, which violated US [[Neutrality Act of 1794|neutrality]] laws.

The Charles government supported the 1983  [[invasion of ]], earning  praise from the US government of [[Ronald Reagan]], and an increase in financial aid.

By the middle of the 1980s, the economy had begun to recover, before weakening again due to a decrease in [[banana]] prices. Eugenia Charles won the [[1985  general election|1985]] general election, becoming the first incumbent  Prime Minister to be popularly re-elected. The continuing downturn in the economy and the tight grip by Eugenia Charles on  politics gave rise to a self-titled "Third Force" political formation in 1988, which disrupted the traditional two-party arrangement of governing DFP and opposition DLP. The formation soon formalised as the [[UWP ()|United Workers' Party]] (UWP) and selected as its leader [[Edison James]], the former general manager of the  Banana Marketing Company. This was a strategic selection: he had prestige among banana farmers, and support from his origins in the East Coast, which had begun to feel alienated by the West Coast elites in Roseau, 's capital. Eugenia Charles again won the [[1990  general election|1990]] general election, the first incumbent  prime minister to win three consecutive general elections, but the UWP's emergence had reduced her party's majority in Parliament to one. It was, therefore, no great surprise when Eugenia Charles gave up political leadership of the  Freedom Party in 1993 and did not contest the 1995 general election in any capacity. No longer benefitting from her leadership, the  Freedom Party lost the [[1995  general election|1995 election]] to the UWP, and James became prime minister. He attempted to diversify the  economy away from over-reliance on bananas. The crop was largely destroyed by [[Hurricane Luis]] in 1995, and James was unable to restore the banana industry to its former selling price and prestige. Moreover, his administration became embroiled in opposition charges of official corruption.

In the [[2000  general election|31 January 2000 general election]], the UWP were defeated by a coalition of the DLP, led by left-leaning [[Rosie Douglas|Roosevelt B. "Rosie" Douglas]], and the DFP led by former trade union leader [[Charles Savarin]]; Douglas became prime minister. One UWP member of the House of Assembly [[Crossing the floor|crossed the floor]], joining the DLP–DFP coalition government. Douglas died on 1 October 2000 after only a few months in office, and was replaced by [[Pierre Charles ( politician)|Pierre Charles]], who died in office on 6 January 2004. [[Roosevelt Skerrit]], also of the DLP, replaced Pierre Charles as prime minister, becoming the world's youngest head of government at the age of 31. Under Skerrit's leadership, the DLP won [[2005  general election|elections in May 2005]] that gave the party 12 seats in the 21-seat Parliament. The UWP won 8 seats and Ronald Toulon, who was an independent candidate at that time, won the remaining seat. Later, Toulon joined the government. With his 2005 election win, Skerrit became only the second incumbent prime minister to be popularly re-elected.

In the [[2009  general election|2009 election]], the DLP won 18 of 21 seats. The UWP claimed campaign improprieties and embarked on a wide range of protest actions, including boycott of Parliament. UWP's boycott caused at least three unauthorised absences from Parliament for two of their three elected representatives in violation of Parliamentary procedure, leading to their two seats being declared vacant and by-elections called to fill them in July 2010 The UWP held both seats. The DLP under Skerrit went on to win the [[2014  general election]].

On 17 September 2012 [[Eliud Williams|Eliud Thaddeus Williams]] was sworn in as president (a largely ceremonial role), replacing [[Nicholas Liverpool|Dr. Nicholas Liverpool]] who was reportedly removed from office due to ill health. On 30 September 2013 former trade union leader and former DFP leader [[Charles Savarin]] was elected president, having only days before resigned as a minister of government. He is 's eighth president.

Early estimates of damage suggested 90% of the buildings on the island had been destroyed, with infrastructure left in ruins. The UK,  and the  set up shipping and air lifts to take aid to the island, the scale of destruction having left most people homeless.
