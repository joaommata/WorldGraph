=== Prehistory and antiquity ===
The area of present-day  has been inhabited since at least [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic times]], beginning sometime between 190,000 and 90,000&nbsp;BC. A recent publication has suggested that there is evidence for even earlier human habitation of the area: ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' fossils that had been discovered in the late 2000s near the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]] in [[Jebel Irhoud]] were recently dated to roughly 315,000 years ago. During the [[Upper Paleolithic]], the [[Maghreb]] was more fertile than it is today, resembling a [[savanna]], in contrast to its modern arid landscape.

DNA studies of [[Iberomaurusian]] peoples at [[Taforalt]],  dating to around 15,000 years ago have found them to have a distinctive Maghrebi ancestry formed from a mixture of [[Near East]]ern and African ancestry, which is still found as a part of the genome of modern Northwest Africans. Later during the [[Neolithic]], from around 7,500 years ago onwards, there was a migration into Northwest Africa of [[Early European Farmers|European Neolithic Farmers]] from the Iberian Peninsula (who had originated in [[Anatolia]] several thousand years prior), as well as pastoralists from the [[Levant]], both of whom also significantly contributed to the ancestry of modern Northwest Africans. The [[Proto-Berber language|proto-Berber]] tribes evolved from these prehistoric communities during the late [[Bronze Age|Bronze]]- and early [[Iron Age|Iron]] ages.

In the early part of [[Classical Antiquity]], Northwest Africa and  were slowly drawn into the wider emerging [[Mediterranean]] world by the [[Phoenicians]], who established trading colonies and settlements there, the most substantial of which were [[Chellah]], [[Lixus (ancient city)|Lixus]], and [[Mogador]]. Mogador was established as a Phoenician colony as early as the 6th century BC.{{page needed|date=February 2013}}

 later became a realm of the Northwest African civilisation of [[ancient Carthage]], and part of the Carthaginian empire. The earliest known independent  state was the [[Mauretania|Berber kingdom of Mauretania]], under King [[Baga (king)|Baga]]. This ancient kingdom (not to be confused with the modern state of [[]]) flourished around 225&nbsp;BC or earlier. [[Mauretania]] became a [[Client state|client]] kingdom of the [[Roman Empire]] in 33 BC. Emperor [[Claudius]] annexed Mauretania directly in 44 AD, making it a [[Roman province]] ruled by an imperial [[governor]] (either a ''procurator Augusti'', or a ''legatus Augusti pro praetore'').

[[Christianity]] in  appeared during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, when it was practiced by [[Berber Christians]] in Roman [[Mauretania Tingitana]]. During the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], parts of Mauretania were reconquered by Berbers. By the late 3rd century, direct Roman rule had become confined to a few coastal cities, such as Septum ([[Ceuta]]) in [[Mauretania Tingitana]] and [[Cherchell]] in [[Mauretania Caesariensis]]. When, in 429 AD, the area was devastated by the [[Vandals]], the Roman Empire lost its remaining possessions in Mauretania, and local [[Mauro-Roman kingdom|Mauro-Roman kings]] assumed control of them. In the 530s, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], under Byzantine control, re-established direct imperial rule of Septum and [[Tingi]], fortified Tingis and erected a church.

The [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]] that had begun during the mid-7th century was completed under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] by 709. The caliphate introduced both [[Islam]] and the Arabic language to the area; this period also saw the beginning of a trend of [[Arab migration to the Maghreb]] which would last for centuries and effect a demographic shift in the region. While constituting part of the larger empire,  was initially organised as a subsidiary province of [[Ifriqiya]], with the local governors appointed by the Muslim governor in [[Kairouan]].

The indigenous Berber tribes adopted Islam, but retained their [[customary law]]s. They also paid taxes and tribute to the new Muslim administration. The first independent Muslim state in the area of modern  was the [[Kingdom of Nekor]], an emirate in the [[Rif Mountains]]. It was founded by [[Salih I ibn Mansur]] in 710, as a client state to the Umayyad Caliphate. After the outbreak of the [[Berber Revolt]] in 739, the Berbers formed other independent states such as the [[Miknasa]] of [[Sijilmasa]] and the [[Barghawata]].

The founder of the [[Idrisid dynasty]] and the great-grandson of [[Hasan ibn Ali]], [[Idris ibn Abdallah]], had fled to  after the massacre of his family by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] in the [[Hejaz]]. He convinced the Awraba Berber tribes to break their allegiance to the distant Abbasid caliphs and he founded the Idrisid dynasty in 788. The Idrisids established [[Fes, |Fes]] as their capital and  became a centre of Muslim learning and a major [[regional power]]. The Idrisids were ousted in 927 by the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] and their Miknasa allies. After Miknasa broke off relations with the Fatimids in 932, they were removed from power by the [[Maghrawa]] of Sijilmasa in 980.

From the 11th century onward, a series of Berber dynasties arose. Under the [[Sanhaja]] [[Almoravid dynasty]] and the [[Masmuda]] [[Almohad dynasty]],  dominated the Maghreb, [[al-Andalus]] in [[Iberia]], and the western Mediterranean region. From the 13th century onward the country saw a [[Arab migration to the Maghreb|massive migration]] of the [[Banu Hilal]] Arab tribes. In the 13th and 14th centuries the [[Zenata]] Berber [[Marinids]] held power in  and strove to replicate the successes of the Almohads through military campaigns in  and . They were followed by the [[Wattasids]]. In the 15th century, the [[Reconquista]] ended Muslim rule in Iberia and many Muslims and [[History of the Jews in |Jews]] fled to . [[|]] efforts to control the Atlantic sea trade in the 15th century did not greatly affect the interior of  even though they managed to control some possessions on the  coast but not venturing further afield inland.

In 1549, the region fell to successive Arab dynasties claiming descent from the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]: first the [[Saadi dynasty]] who ruled from 1549 to 1659, and then the [[Alawi dynasty]], who have remained in power since the 17th century.  faced aggression from [[]] in the north, and the Ottoman Empire's allies pressing westward.

Under the Saadis, the sultanate [[ succession crisis of 1580|ended the  Aviz dynasty]] in 1578 at the [[Battle of Alcácer Quibir]]. The reign of [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] brought new wealth and prestige to the Sultanate, and a [[Saadian invasion of the Songhai Empire|large expedition]] to West Africa inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[Songhay Empire]] in 1591. However, managing the territories across the [[Sahara]] proved too difficult. Upon the death of al-Mansur, the country was divided among his sons.

After a period of political fragmentation and conflict during the decline of the Saadi dynasty,  was finally reunited by the Alawi sultan [[Al-Rashid of |al-Rashid]] in the late 1660s, who took Fez in 1666 and Marrakesh in 1668.{{Rp|230}}{{Rp|225}} The 'Alawis succeeded in stabilising their position, and while the kingdom was smaller than previous ones in the region, it remained quite wealthy. Against the opposition of local tribes [[Ismail Ibn Sharif]] (1672–1727) began to create a unified state. With his [[Rif]]fian army, he re-occupied [[ Tangier|Tangier]] from the  who had abandoned it in 1684 and drove the  from [[Larache]] in 1689. The  abandoned [[Mazagan|Mazagão]], their last territory in , in 1769. However, the [[Siege of Melilla (1774)|siege of Melilla]] against the  ended in defeat in 1775.

 was the first nation to recognise the fledgling  as an independent nation in 1777. In the beginning of the [[ Revolution]],  merchant ships in the Atlantic Ocean were subject to attacks by other fleets. On 20 December 1777, 's Sultan [[Mohammed ben Abdallah|Mohammed III]] declared that  merchant ships would be under the protection of the sultanate and could thus enjoy safe passage. The 1786 [[– Treaty of Friendship]] stands as the ' oldest unbroken friendship treaty.

As Europe industrialised, Northwest Africa was increasingly prized for its potential for colonisation.  showed a strong interest in  as early as 1830, not only to protect the border of its  territory, but also because of the strategic position of  with coasts on the Mediterranean and the open Atlantic. In 1860, a dispute over 's Ceuta enclave led  to declare war. Victorious  won a further enclave and an enlarged Ceuta in the settlement. In 1884,  created a protectorate in the coastal areas of .

In 1904,  and  carved out zones of influence in . Recognition by the [[]] of 's [[sphere of influence]] provoked a strong reaction from the [[ Empire]]; and a crisis loomed in 1905. The matter was resolved at the [[Algeciras Conference]] in 1906. The [[Agadir Crisis]] of 1911 increased tensions between European powers. The 1912 [[Treaty of Fez]] made  a [[protectorate]] of , and triggered the [[1912 Fez riots]].  continued to operate its coastal protectorate. By the same treaty,  assumed the role of [[protecting power]] over the northern coastal and southern [[Sahara]]n zones.

Tens of thousands of colonists entered . Some bought up large amounts of rich agricultural land, while others organised the exploitation and modernisation of mines and harbours. Interest groups that formed among these elements continually pressured  to increase its control over  – with some  tribes allying with the  against other competing tribes from early on in its conquest. The  colonial administrator, Governor general Marshal [[Hubert Lyautey]], sincerely admired  culture and succeeded in imposing a joint - administration, while creating a modern school system. Several divisions of  soldiers ([[Goumier]]s or regular troops and officers) served in the [[ army]] in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and in the  [[Francoism|Nationalist Army]] in the [[ Civil War]] and after (''[[Regulares]]''). The institution of [[slavery in |slavery]] was abolished in 1925.

Between 1921 and 1926, an [[Rif War|uprising]] in the [[Rif]] Mountains, led by [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd el-Krim]], led to the establishment of the [[Republic of the Rif]]. The  used anti-civilian bombing raids and mustard gas to prevent the Rif republic from gaining independence. They lost more than 13,000 soldiers at [[Battle of Annual|Annual]] in July–August 1921 alone. The Riffi were eventually suppressed by 1927 by the Franco- military. The casualties on the - side were 52,000 and from the Riffi 10,000 died.

In 1943, the [[Istiqlal Party]] (Independence Party) was founded to press for independence, with discreet US support.  nationalists drew heavily on [[Revolution of the King and the People|transnational activist networks]] for lobbying to end colonial rule, primarily at the United Nations. The Istiqlal Party subsequently provided most of the leadership for the nationalist movement.

's exile of Sultan [[Mohammed V of |Mohammed V]] in 1953 to [[]] and his replacement by the unpopular [[Mohammed Ben Aarafa]] sparked active opposition to the  and  protectorates. The most notable violence occurred in [[Oujda]] where Moroccans attacked  and other European residents in the streets.  allowed Mohammed V to return in 1955, and the negotiations that led to  independence began the following year. In March 1956  regained its independence from  as the Kingdom of . A month later  forsook its protectorate in Northern  to the new state but kept its two coastal enclaves ([[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]) on the Mediterranean coast which dated from earlier conquests, but over which  still claims [[sovereignty]] to this day.

However, Hassan declared a state of emergency and suspended parliament in 1965. In 1971 and 1972, there were two failed attempts to depose the king and establish a republic. A truth commission set up in 2005 to investigate human rights abuses during his reign confirmed nearly 10,000 cases, ranging from death in detention to forced exile. Some 592 people were recorded killed during Hassan's rule according to the truth commission.

In 1963, the [[Sand War]] was fought between  and  troops over  claims to parts of  territory. A formal peace agreement was signed in February 1964; however, relations remained strained between the two countries following the conflict. The  [[enclave]] of [[Ifni]] in the south was returned to  in 1969.

The [[Polisario movement]] was formed in 1973, with the aim of establishing an independent state in the  Sahara. On 6 November 1975, King Hassan asked for volunteers to cross into the  Sahara. Some 350,000 civilians were reported as being involved in the "[[Green March]]". A month later,  agreed to leave the  Sahara, soon to become Western Sahara, and to transfer it to joint - control, despite the objections and threats of military intervention by .  forces occupied the territory.

 and  troops [[Western Sahara War|soon clashed in Western Sahara]].  and  divided up Western Sahara. Fighting between the  military and Polisario forces continued for many years. The prolonged war was a considerable financial drain on . In 1983, Hassan cancelled planned elections amid political unrest and economic crisis. In 1984,  left the Organisation of African Unity in protest at the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|SADR]]'s admission to the body. Polisario claimed to have killed more than 5,000  soldiers between 1982 and 1985.  authorities have estimated the number of [[Sahrawi refugees]] in  to be 165,000. Diplomatic relations with  were restored in 1988. In 1991, a UN-monitored ceasefire began in Western Sahara, but the territory's status remains undecided and ceasefire violations are reported. The following decade saw much wrangling over a [[Houston Agreement|proposed referendum]] on the future of the territory but the deadlock was not broken.

Political reforms in the 1990s resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature with 's first opposition-led government coming to power. King Hassan II died in 1999 and was succeeded by his son, [[Mohammed VI of |Mohammed VI]]. He is a cautious moderniser who has introduced some economic and social liberalisation. Mohammed VI paid a controversial visit to the Western Sahara in 2002.  unveiled an autonomy blueprint for Western Sahara to the United Nations in 2007. The Polisario rejected the plan and put forward its own proposal.  and the Polisario Front held UN-sponsored talks in New York City but failed to come to any agreement. In 2010, security forces stormed a protest camp in the Western Sahara, triggering violent demonstrations in the regional capital [[El Aaiún]].

There were renewed tensions in 2005, as dozens of African migrants stormed the borders of the  enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta. In response,  deported dozens of the illegal migrants to  from Melilla. In 2006, the  Premier [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero|Zapatero]] visited  enclaves. He was the first  leader in 25 years to make an official visit to the territories. The following year,  King [[Juan Carlos I]] visited Ceuta and Melilla, further angering  which demanded control of the enclaves.

During the [[2011–2012  protests]], thousands of people rallied in Rabat and other cities calling for political reform and a new constitution curbing the powers of the king. In July 2011, the King won a landslide victory in a [[2011  constitutional referendum|referendum]] on a reformed constitution he had proposed to placate the [[Arab Spring]] protests. In the first [[2011  general election|general elections]] that followed, the moderate Islamist [[Justice and Development Party ()|Justice and Development Party]] won a plurality of seats, with [[Abdelilah Benkirane]] being designated as head of government per the new constitution. Despite the reforms made by Mohammed VI, demonstrators continued to call for deeper reforms. Hundreds took part in a trade union rally in Casablanca in May 2012. Participants accused the government of failing to deliver on reforms.
