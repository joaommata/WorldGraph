===Prehistory===
{{further|Prehistory of the Levant}}
The [[Ubeidiya prehistoric site]] in northern  shows the [[Early expansions of hominins out of Africa|presence of archaic humans]] around 1.5 million years ago. The second-oldest evidence of [[anatomically modern human]]s [[Recent African origin of modern humans|outside Africa]] is a 200,000-year-old fossil from [[Misliya Cave]] on Mount Carmel. The [[Natufian culture]] ({{circa}} 10,000 BCE) may be linked to the [[Proto-Afroasiatic language]] and is notable for adopting [[sedentism]] before the [[Origins of agriculture in West Asia|advent of agriculture]] and the [[Neolithic Revolution]].

Early references to "[[Canaan]]" and "Canaanites" appear in ancient [[Ancient Near East|Near Eastern]] and [[Ancient |]] texts ({{Circa}} 2000 BCE); these populations were structured as politically independent [[city-state]]s. During the [[Late Bronze Age]] (1550–1200 BCE), large parts of Canaan formed [[vassal state]]s of the [[New Kingdom of ]]. As a result of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]], Canaan fell into chaos, and  control over the region collapsed. Ancestors of the [[Israelites]] are thought to have included [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] native to this area.{{rp|78–79}} Modern archaeological accounts suggest that the Israelites and their culture branched out of the Canaanite peoples through the development of a distinct [[Monolatry|monolatristic]]—and later [[Monotheism|monotheistic]]—religion centered on [[Yahweh]]. They spoke an archaic form of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], known as [[Biblical Hebrew]]. Around the same time, the [[Philistines]] settled on the southern [[ coastal plain|coastal plain]].{{sfn|Killebrew|2005|p=230}}{{sfn|Shahin|2005|p=6}}

Most modern scholars agree that the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] narrative in the [[Torah]] and [[Old Testament]] did not take place as depicted; however, some elements of these traditions do have [[Historicity of the Bible|historical roots]]. There is debate about the earliest existence of the [[History of ancient  and Judah|Kingdoms of  and Judah]] and their extent and power. While it is unclear if there was a [[Kingdom of  (united monarchy)| of ]], historians and archaeologists agree that the northern [[Kingdom of  (Samaria)|Kingdom of ]] existed by {{Abbr|ca.|circa}} 900 BCE{{rp|169–195}} and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] by {{Abbr|ca.|circa}} 850 BCE. The Kingdom of  was the more prosperous of the two and soon developed into a regional power, with a capital at [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]]; during the [[Omrides|Omride dynasty]], it controlled [[Samaria]], [[Galilee]], the upper [[ Valley]], the [[Sharon plain|plain of Sharon]] and large parts of [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]].

The Kingdom of  was conquered around 720 BCE by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]. The Kingdom of Judah, under [[Davidic line|Davidic]] rule with its capital in [[Jerusalem]], later became a [[client state]] of first the Neo-Assyrian Empire and then the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]. It is estimated that [[Demographic history of Palestine (region)|the region's population]] was around 400,000 in the [[Iron Age II]]. In 587/6 BCE, following a [[Judah's revolts against Babylon|revolt in Judah]], King [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|besieged and destroyed Jerusalem]] and [[Solomon's Temple]], dissolved the kingdom and [[Babylonian captivity|exiled much of the Judean elite to Babylon]].

=== Classical antiquity ===
{{Main|Second Temple period}}
After [[Fall of Babylon|capturing Babylon]] in 539 BCE, [[Cyrus the Great]], founder of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], issued [[Edict of Cyrus|a proclamation]] allowing the exiled Judean population to return. The construction of the [[Second Temple]] was completed {{Circa|520 BCE}}. The Achaemenids ruled the region as the province of [[Yehud Medinata]]. In 332 BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the region as part of his [[Wars of Alexander the Great|campaign against the Achaemenid Empire]]. After his death, the area was controlled by the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] and [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] empires as a part of [[Coele-]]. Under the Hellenistic kingdoms, ongoing [[Hellenization]] generated cultural tensions among the Jewish population that culminated under [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]], whose decrees outlawed Jewish practices and triggered the [[Maccabean Revolt]] in 167 BCE. The revolt weakened Seleucid control over Judea; by 142/141 BCE the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmoneans]] had secured autonomy and soon established an [[Hasmonean Judea|independent Jewish kingdom]] that, in the late 2nd–early 1st century BCE, expanded into neighboring territories.

[[File:-2013-Aerial 21-Masada.jpg|thumb|upright|View of the [[Masada]] fortress overlooking the [[Dead Sea]], which is the location of a [[Siege of Masada|1st-century Roman siege]]]]
The [[Roman Republic]] invaded the region in 63 BCE, first [[Third Mithridatic War|taking control of ]], and then intervening in the [[Hasmonean civil war]]. [[Roman–Parthian Wars|The struggle]] between pro-Roman and pro-[[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] factions in Judea led to the installation of [[Herod the Great]] as a [[Herodian dynasty|dynastic vassal]] of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. In 6 CE, the area was annexed as the [[Judaea (Roman province)|Roman province of Judaea]]; tensions with Roman rule led to a series of [[Jewish–Roman wars]], resulting in widespread destruction. The [[First Jewish–Roman War]] (66–73 CE) resulted in the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple]] and a sizable portion of the population being killed or displaced.

A second uprising known as the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] (132–136 CE) initially allowed the Jews to form an independent state, but the Romans brutally crushed the rebellion, devastating and depopulating Judea's countryside. Jerusalem was rebuilt as a [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colony]] ([[Aelia Capitolina]]), and the province of Judea was renamed [[ Palaestina]]. Jews were expelled from the districts surrounding Jerusalem. Nevertheless, there was a continuous small Jewish presence, and Galilee became its religious center.

=== Late antiquity and the medieval period ===
{{further|Byzantine Palestine|Bilad al-Sham|Kingdom of Jerusalem}}
[[File:Ruins of the Ancient Synagogue at Bar'am.jpg|thumb|3rd-century [[Kfar Bar'am synagogue]] in the Galilee]]
During the [[Byzantine Palestine|Byzantine period]], [[Early Christianity]] displaced [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman paganism]] in the 4th century CE, with [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] embracing and promoting the Christian religion and [[Theodosius I]] making it [[Christianity as the Roman state religion|the state religion]]. A series of laws were passed that discriminated against Jews and Judaism, and Jews were persecuted by both the church and the authorities. Many Jews had emigrated to flourishing [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] communities, while locally there was both Christian immigration and local conversion. By the middle of the 5th century, there was a Christian majority. Towards the end of the 5th century, [[Samaritan revolts]] erupted, continuing until the late 6th century and resulting in a large decrease in the Samaritan population. After the [[Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem]] and the short-lived [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius]] in 614 CE, the Byzantine Empire [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628|reconsolidated control of the area]] in 628.

In 634–641 CE, the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|conquered the Levant]]. Caliph [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] ({{Reign|634|644}}) lifted the Christian ban on Jews entering [[Jerusalem]] and permitted them to worship there. Over the next six centuries, control of the region transferred between the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]], [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]], and [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] caliphates, and subsequently the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] and [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] dynasties. The population drastically decreased during the following several centuries, dropping from an estimated 1 million during Roman and Byzantine periods to about 300,000 by the early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman period]], and there was steady [[Arabization|Arabisation]] and [[Islamization|Islamisation]]. The end of the 11th century brought the [[Crusades]], [[Pope|papally]]-sanctioned incursions of Christian crusaders intent on wresting Jerusalem and the [[Holy Land]] from Muslim control and establishing [[crusader states]]. The Ayyubids pushed back the crusaders before Muslim rule was fully restored by the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk sultans of ]] in 1291.

=== Modern period and the emergence of Zionism ===

[[File:Jews at Western Wall by Felix Bonfils, 1870s.jpg|thumb|Jews at the [[Western Wall]] in the 1870s]]
In 1516, the Ottoman Empire conquered the region and ruled it as part of [[Ottoman ]]. Two violent incidents took place against Jews, the [[1517 Safed attacks]] and the [[1517 Hebron attacks]], after the  Ottomans ousted the [[Mamluk]]s during the [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–1517)|Ottoman–Mamluk War]]. Under the Ottoman Empire, the Levant was fairly cosmopolitan, with religious freedoms for [[People of the Book|Christians, Muslims, and Jews]]. In 1561 the [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Ottoman sultan]] invited [[Sephardic Jews]] escaping the [[ Inquisition]] to settle in and rebuild the city of [[Tiberias]].

Under the Ottoman Empire's [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]], Christians and Jews were considered ''[[dhimmi]]'' ("protected") under [[Ottoman law]] in exchange for loyalty to the state and payment of the ''[[jizya]]'' tax. Non-Muslim Ottoman subjects faced geographic and lifestyle restrictions, though these were not always enforced. The millet system organised non-Muslims into autonomous communities on the basis of religion.

[[File:THEODOR HERZL AT THE FIRST ZIONIST CONGRESS IN BASEL ON 25.8.1897. תאודור הרצל בקונגרס הציוני הראשון - 1897.8.25.jpg|thumb|The [[First Zionist Congress]] (1897) in [[Basel]], ]]
The [[Return to Zion|concept of an eventual return to Zion]] remained a symbol within religious Jewish belief which emphasised that their return should be determined by [[Divine providence in Judaism|Divine Providence]] rather than human action.{{sfn|Avineri|2017}} The Jewish population of Palestine from the Ottoman rule to the beginning of the Zionist movement, known as the [[Old Yishuv]], comprised a minority and fluctuated in size. During the 16th century, Jewish communities struck roots in the [[Four Holy Cities]]—Jerusalem, Tiberias, [[Hebron]], and [[Safed]]—and in 1697, Rabbi Yehuda Hachasid led 1,500 Jews to Jerusalem. A 1660 [[Druze power struggle (1658–1667)# and Galilee campaign|Druze revolt]] against the Ottomans destroyed [[1660 destruction of Safed|Safed]] and [[1660 destruction of Tiberias|Tiberias]]. In the second half of the 18th century, Eastern European Jews who were [[Misnagdim|opponents]] of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]], known as the [[Perushim]], settled in Palestine.

In the late 18th century, local Arab Sheikh [[Zahir al-Umar]] created a de facto independent emirate in the Galilee. Ottoman attempts to subdue the sheikh failed. After Zahir's death the Ottomans regained control of the area. In 1799, governor [[Jazzar Pasha]] repelled an [[Siege of Acre (1799)|assault on Acre]] by [[Napoleon]]'s troops, prompting the  to abandon the  campaign. In 1834, a [[Peasants' revolt in Palestine|revolt by Palestinian Arab peasants]] against  conscription and taxation policies under [[Muhammad Ali of |Muhammad Ali]] was suppressed; Muhammad Ali's army retreated and Ottoman rule was restored with British support in 1840. The [[Tanzimat]] reforms were implemented across the Ottoman Empire.

The first wave of modern Jewish migration to [[Southern |Ottoman-ruled Palestine]], known as the [[First Aliyah]], began in 1881, as Jews fled [[pogrom]]s in Eastern Europe. The 1882 [[May Laws]] increased economic discrimination against Jews, and restricted where they could live. In response, political [[Zionism]] took form, a movement that sought to establish a [[Jewish state]] in Palestine, thus offering a solution to the [[Jewish question]] of the European states.{{sfn|Herzl|1946|p=11}}{{better source needed|date=September 2024}} Antisemitism, pogroms and official policies in tsarist  led to the emigration of three million Jews in the years between 1882 and 1914, only 1% of whom went to Palestine. Those who went to Palestine were driven primarily by ideas of self-determination and Jewish identity, rather than as a response to pogroms or economic insecurity.{{sfn|Avineri|2017}}

The [[Second Aliyah]] (1904–1914) began after the [[Kishinev pogrom]]; some 40,000 Jews settled in Palestine, although nearly half left eventually. Both the first and second waves of migrants were mainly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]]. The Second Aliyah included [[Labor Zionism|Zionist socialist]] groups who established the ''[[kibbutz]]'' movement based on the idea of establishing a separate Jewish economy based exclusively on Jewish labour.{{sfn|Romano|2003|p=30}} Those of the Second Aliyah who became leaders of the [[Yishuv]] in the coming decades believed that the Jewish settler economy should not depend on Arab labour. This would be a dominant source of antagonism with the Arab population, with the new Yishuv's nationalist ideology overpowering its socialist one. Though the immigrants of the Second Aliyah largely sought to create communal Jewish agricultural settlements, [[Tel Aviv]] was established as the first planned Jewish town in 1909. Jewish armed militias emerged during this period, the first being [[Bar-Giora (organization)|Bar-Giora]] in 1907. Two years later, the larger [[Hashomer]] organisation was founded as its replacement.

=== British Mandate for Palestine ===
{{main|Mandatory Palestine}}
{{further|Yishuv|Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine|1948 Palestine war}}
{{see also|Jewish land purchase in Palestine}}

[[Chaim Weizmann]]'s efforts to garner British support for the Zionist movement eventually secured the [[Balfour Declaration]] of 1917, stating Britain's support for the creation of a Jewish "[[Homeland for the Jewish people|national home]]" in Palestine. Weizmann's interpretation of the declaration was that negotiations on the future of the country were to happen directly between Britain and the Jews, excluding Arabs. [[Islamic–Jewish relations|Jewish-Arab relations]] in Palestine deteriorated dramatically in the following years.

In 1918, the [[Jewish Legion]], primarily Zionist volunteers, assisted in the British [[Sinai and Palestine campaign|conquest of Palestine]]. In 1920, the territory was divided between Britain and  under the [[League of Nations mandate|mandate system]], and the British-administered area (including modern ) was named [[Mandatory Palestine]]. Arab opposition to British rule and Jewish immigration led to the [[1920 Nebi Musa riots|1920 Palestine riots]] and the formation of a Jewish militia known as the [[Haganah]] as an outgrowth of Hashomer, from which the [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] paramilitaries later split. In 1922, the [[League of Nations]] granted Britain the [[Mandate for Palestine]] under terms which included the Balfour Declaration with its promise to the Jews and with similar provisions regarding the Arab Palestinians. The [[Demographic history of Palestine (region)|population of the area]] was predominantly Arab and Muslim, with Jews accounting for about 11% and Arab Christians about 9.5% of the population.
[[File:"Jews and Arabs in Grim Struggle for Holy Land" article (1938).jpg|thumb|"Jews and Arabs in Grim Struggle for Holy Land", article from 1938]]

The [[Third Aliyah|Third]] (1919–1923) and [[Fourth Aliyah]]s (1924–1929) brought an additional 100,000 Jews to Palestine. The [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|rise of Nazism]] and the increasing persecution of Jews in 1930s Europe led to the [[Fifth Aliyah]], with an influx of a quarter of a million Jews. This was a major cause of the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab revolt of 1936–39]], which was suppressed by British security forces and Zionist militias. Several hundred British security personnel and Jews were killed; 5,032 Arabs were killed, 14,760 wounded, and 12,622 detained. An estimated ten percent of the adult male [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arab]] population was killed, wounded, imprisoned, or exiled.

The British introduced restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine with the [[White Paper of 1939]]. With countries around the world turning away Jewish refugees fleeing [[the Holocaust]], a clandestine movement known as [[Aliyah Bet]] was organised to bring Jews to Palestine. By the end of [[World War II]], 31% of the population of Palestine was Jewish. The UK found itself facing a [[Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine|Jewish insurgency]] over immigration restrictions and continued conflict with the Arab community over limit levels. The Haganah joined Irgun and Lehi in an armed struggle against British rule.{{sfn|Fraser|2004|p=27}} The Haganah attempted to bring tens of thousands of Jewish refugees and [[Holocaust survivors]] to Palestine by ship. Most of the ships were intercepted by the [[Royal Navy]] and the refugees placed in detention camps in [[Atlit detainee camp|Atlit]] and [[ internment camps|]].

On 22 July 1946, Irgun [[King David Hotel bombing|bombed the British administrative headquarters]] for Palestine, killing 91. The attack was a response to [[Operation Agatha]] (a series of raids, including one on the [[Jewish Agency for |Jewish Agency]], by the British) and was the deadliest directed at the British during the Mandate era. The Jewish insurgency continued throughout 1946 and 1947 despite concerted efforts by the British military and [[Palestine Police Force]] to suppress it.

British efforts to mediate with Jewish and Arab representatives were not successful as the Jews were unwilling to accept any solution that did not involve a Jewish state and suggested a partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, while the Arabs were adamant that a Jewish state in any part of Palestine was unacceptable and that the only solution was a unified Palestine under Arab rule. In February 1947, the British referred the Palestine issue to the newly formed [[United Nations]]. On 15 May 1947, the [[General Assembly of the United Nations|UN General Assembly]] resolved that a [[United Nations Special Committee on Palestine|Special Committee]] be created "to prepare ... a report on the question of Palestine". The Report of the Committee [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|proposed a plan]] to replace the British Mandate with "an independent Arab State, an independent Jewish State, and the City of Jerusalem [...] the last to be under an International Trusteeship System".

Meanwhile, the Jewish insurgency continued and peaked in July 1947, with a series of widespread guerrilla raids culminating in [[the Sergeants affair]], in which the Irgun took two British sergeants hostage as attempted leverage against the planned execution of three Irgun operatives. After the executions were carried out, the Irgun killed the two British soldiers, hanged their bodies from trees, and left a booby trap at the scene which injured a British soldier. The incident caused widespread outrage in the UK. In September 1947, the British cabinet decided to evacuate Palestine as the Mandate was no longer tenable.

[[File:UN Palestine Partition Versions 1947.jpg|thumb|upright|[[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|UN Map]], "Palestine plan of partition with economic union"]]

On 29 November 1947, the General Assembly adopted [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|Resolution 181 (II)]]. The plan attached to the resolution was essentially that proposed in the report of 3 September. The Jewish Agency, the recognised representative of the Jewish community, accepted the plan, which assigned 55–56% of Mandatory Palestine to the Jews. At the time, the Jews were about a third of the population and owned around 6–7% of the land. Arabs constituted the majority and owned about 20% of the land, with the remainder held by the Mandate authorities or foreign landowners.

The [[Arab League]] and [[Arab Higher Committee]] of Palestine rejected the partition plan on the basis that the partition plan privileged European interests over those of the Palestinians, and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|pp=40–41}} On 1 December 1947, the Arab Higher Committee proclaimed a three-day strike, and [[1947 Jerusalem riots|riots broke out in Jerusalem]]. The situation spiralled into [[1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine|a civil war]]. Colonial Secretary [[Arthur Creech Jones]] announced that the British Mandate would end on 15 May 1948, at which point the British would evacuate. As Arab militias and gangs attacked Jewish areas, they were faced mainly by the Haganah as well as the smaller Irgun and Lehi. In April 1948, the Haganah moved onto the offensive.{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=77–78}}

The latter engaged in clandestine operations in countries, particularly in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, where the lives of Jews were in danger and exit was difficult. Mossad LeAliyah Bet was disbanded in 1953. The immigration was in accordance with the [[One Million Plan]]. Some immigrants held Zionist beliefs or came for the promise of a better life, while others moved to escape persecution or were expelled from their homes.

An [[Aliyah#Early statehood (1948–1960)|influx of Holocaust survivors]] and [[Jewish exodus from the Muslim world|Jews from Arab and Muslim countries]] to  during the first three years increased the number of Jews from 700,000 to 1,400,000. By 1958, the population had risen to two million. Between 1948 and 1970, approximately 1,150,000 Jewish refugees relocated to . Some immigrants arrived as refugees and were housed in temporary camps known as ''[[ma'abarot]]''; by 1952, over 200,000 people were living in these tent cities. [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jews of European background]] were often treated more favourably than Jews from [[Mizrahi Jews|Middle Eastern]] and [[Sephardi Jews|North African]] countries—housing units reserved for the latter were often re-designated for the former, so Jews newly arrived from Arab lands generally ended up staying longer in transit camps.{{sfn|Segev|2007|pp=155–157}} During this period, food, clothes and furniture were rationed in what became known as the [[Austerity in |austerity period]]. The need to solve the crisis led Ben-Gurion to sign a [[Reparations Agreement between  and the Federal Republic of |reparations agreement with West ]] that triggered mass protests by Jews angered at the idea that  could accept monetary compensation for the Holocaust.{{sfn|Shindler|2002|pp=49–50}}

Later that year,  President [[Anwar El Sadat]] made a trip to  and spoke before the [[Knesset]] in what was the first recognition of  by an Arab head of state.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|pp=171–174}} Sadat and Begin signed the [[Camp David Accords]] (1978) and the [[– peace treaty]] (1979).{{sfn|Bregman|2002|pp=186–187}} In return,  withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula and agreed to enter negotiations over autonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|pp=186–187}}

On 11 March 1978, a PLO guerilla raid from  led to the [[Coastal Road massacre]].  responded by launching an [[1978 South  conflict|invasion of southern ]] to destroy PLO bases. Begin's government meanwhile provided incentives for [[ settlement|Israelis to settle]] in the [[ occupation of the West Bank|occupied West Bank]], increasing friction with the Palestinians there.

The 1980 [[Jerusalem Law]] was believed by some to reaffirm 's 1967 annexation of Jerusalem by government decree and [[UN Security Council Resolution 478|reignited international controversy]] over the [[Status of Jerusalem|status of the city]]. No  legislation has defined the territory of , and no act specifically included East Jerusalem therein. In 1981  [[Golan Heights Law|effectively annexed]] the Golan Heights. The international community largely rejected these moves, with the UN Security Council declaring both the Jerusalem Law and the Golan Heights Law null and void. Several waves of [[Beta | Jews]] [[Aliyah from |immigrated to ]] since the 1980s, while between 1990 and 1994, [[1990s post-Soviet aliyah|immigration from the post-Soviet states]] increased 's population by twelve percent.

On 7 June 1981, during the [[– War]], the [[Operation Opera| air force destroyed]] 's sole nuclear reactor, then under construction, in order to impede the  nuclear weapons programme.

An  government inquiry (the [[Kahan Commission]]) held Begin and several  generals indirectly responsible for the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] and held [[Ministry of Defense ()|defence minister]] [[Ariel Sharon]] as bearing "personal responsibility". Sharon was forced to resign.

In 1985,  responded to a Palestinian [[Larnaca yacht killings|terrorist attack in ]] by [[Operation Wooden Leg|bombing the PLO headquarters]] in .  withdrew from most of  in 1986 but continued to [[ occupation of Southern |occupy a borderland buffer zone]] in southern  until 2000, from where  forces [[South  conflict (1985–2000)|engaged in conflict]] with [[Hezbollah]]. The [[First Intifada]], a Palestinian uprising against  rule, broke out in 1987, with waves of uncoordinated demonstrations and violence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Over the following six years, the intifada became more organised and included economic and cultural measures aimed at disrupting the  occupation. Over 1,000 people were killed. During the 1991 [[Gulf War]], the PLO supported [[Saddam Hussein]] and  missile [[ rocket attacks on |attacks against ]]. Despite public outrage,  heeded  calls to refrain from hitting back.{{sfn |Mowlana |Gerbner |Schiller |1992 |p=111}}

In 1992, [[Yitzhak Rabin]] became prime minister following [[1992  legislative election|an election]] in which his party called for compromise with 's neighbours.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|p=236}} The following year, [[Shimon Peres]] on behalf of  and [[Yasser Arafat]] for the PLO signed the [[Oslo Accords]], which gave the [[Palestinian Authority|Palestinian National Authority]] (PNA) the right to govern [[West Bank areas in the Oslo II Accord|parts of the West Bank]] and the Gaza Strip. The PLO also [[–Palestine Liberation Organization letters of recognition|recognised 's right to exist]] and pledged an end to terrorism.{{sfn|Tessler|2009|p=729}} In 1994, the [[– peace treaty]] was signed, making  the second Arab country to normalise relations with . Arab public support for the Accords was damaged by the continuation of  settlements and [[ checkpoint|checkpoints]], and the deterioration of economic conditions.  public support for the Accords waned after [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks|Palestinian suicide attacks]]. In November 1995, Rabin [[assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|was assassinated]] by [[Yigal Amir]], a far-right Jew who opposed the Accords.

During [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s premiership at the end of the 1990s,  [[Protocol Concerning the Redeployment in Hebron|agreed to withdraw]] from [[Hebron]],{{sfn|Bregman|2002|p=257}} though this was never ratified or implemented, and he signed the [[Wye River Memorandum]]. The agreement dealt with further redeployments in the West Bank and security issues. The memorandum was criticised by major international human rights organisations for its "encouragement" of human rights abuses.
[[Ehud Barak]], [[1999  general election|elected]] prime minister in 1999, withdrew forces from southern  and conducted negotiations with PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat and U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] at the [[2000 Camp David Summit]]. Barak offered a plan for the establishment of a [[Palestinian state]], including the entirety of the Gaza Strip and over 90% of the West Bank with Jerusalem as a shared capital.{{sfn|Gelvin|2005|p=240}} Each side blamed the other for the failure of the talks.

In late 2000, after a controversial visit by Sharon to the [[Temple Mount]], the [[Second Intifada]] began. The popular uprising faced disproportionate repression from the  state. [[Palestinian suicide attacks|Palestinian suicide bombings]] eventually developed into a recurrent feature of the intifada. Some commentators contend that the intifada was pre-planned by Arafat after the collapse of peace talks. Sharon became prime minister in a [[2001  prime ministerial election|2001 election]]; he carried out his plan to [[ disengagement from the Gaza Strip|unilaterally withdraw]] from the Gaza Strip and spearheaded the construction of the [[West Bank barrier]], ending the intifada. Between 2000 and 2008, 1,063 Israelis, 5,517 Palestinians and 64 foreign citizens were killed.

In July 2006, a Hezbollah artillery assault on 's northern border communities and a [[2006 Hezbollah cross-border raid|cross-border abduction]] of two  soldiers precipitated the month-long [[2006  War|Second  War]], including an  invasion of . The war wound down in August 2006 after the passage of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701]];  forces mostly withdrew from  by October 2006 but continued to occupy the  portion of [[Ghajar]] village.

On 7 October 2023, Palestinian militant groups from Gaza, led by Hamas, launched [[7 October Hamas-led attack on |a series of coordinated attacks]] on , leading to the start of the [[Gaza war]]. On that day, approximately 1,300 Israelis, predominantly civilians, were killed in communities near the Gaza Strip border and [[Re'im music festival massacre|during a music festival]]. [[Gaza war hostage crisis|Over 200 hostages]] were kidnapped and taken to the Gaza Strip. Studies modeling trauma exposure and assessing mental health outcomes estimated that approximately 5.3% of Israelis may develop PTSD, with national data showing that probable PTSD nearly doubled from 16.2% to 29.8% and rates of anxiety and depression also rising sharply.
