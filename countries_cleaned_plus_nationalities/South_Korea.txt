The  Peninsula was inhabited as early as the [[Lower Paleolithic]] period.

According to 's [[Civil religion|founding mythology]], the history of  begins with the founding of Joseon (also known as "[[Old Chosŏn|Gojoseon]]", or "Old Joseon", to differentiate it from the 14th century dynasty) in 2333 BC by the legendary [[Dangun]]. Gojoseon was noted in  records in the early 7th century. Gojoseon expanded until it controlled the northern  Peninsula and parts of [[Manchuria]]. [[Gija Joseon]] was purportedly founded in the 12th century BC, but its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era. In 108 BC, the [[Han dynasty]] [[Gojoseon–Han War|defeated]] [[Wiman Joseon]] and installed [[Four Commanderies of Han|four commanderies]] in the northern  peninsula. Three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades, but the [[Lelang commandery]] remained a center of cultural and economic exchange with successive  dynasties ruling for four centuries, until it was conquered by Goguryeo in 313. 

The linguistic homeland of Proto-[[]] is located somewhere in southern [[Siberia]]/[[Manchuria]], such as the [[Liao River]] area or the [[Amur]] River area. Proto- arrived in the southern part of the  Peninsula at around 300 BC, replacing and assimilating [[Japonic languages|Japonic]]-speaking [[Yayoi people|Yayoi]] and likely causing their migration to the [[ archipelago]].

=== Three Kingdoms of  ===
During the [[Proto–Three Kingdoms period]], the states of [[Buyeo]], [[Okjeo]], [[Eastern Ye|Dongye]], and [[Samhan]] occupied the whole  peninsula and southern Manchuria. From them, the [[Three Kingdoms of ]] emerged: [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], and [[Silla]].

Goguryeo, the largest and most powerful among them, was a highly militaristic state and competed with various  dynasties during its 700 years of history. Goguryeo experienced a golden age under [[Gwanggaeto the Great]] and his son [[Jangsu of Goguryeo|Jangsu]], who both subdued Baekje and Silla during their respective reigns, achieving a brief unification of the Three Kingdoms and becoming the most dominant power on the  Peninsula. In addition to contesting control of the  Peninsula, Goguryeo had many [[Military history of Goguryeo|military conflicts]] with various [[Dynasties of | dynastie]]s, most notably the [[Goguryeo–Sui War]], in which Goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men.

Baekje was a maritime power, sometimes called the "[[Phoenicia]] of East Asia". Its maritime ability was instrumental in the dissemination of [[East Asian Buddhism|Buddhism throughout East Asia]] and spreading continental culture to . Baekje was once a great military power on the  Peninsula, especially during the time of [[Geunchogo of Baekje|Geunchogo]], but was critically defeated by Gwanggaeto the Great and declined. Silla was the smallest and weakest of the three, but used opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful  kingdoms, and eventually [[Tang dynasty|Tang ]], to its advantage.

In 676, the unification of the Three Kingdoms by Silla led to the [[Northern and Southern States period]], in which relationships between  and  remained relatively peaceful. [[Balhae]], a Goguryeo successor state founded by a [[Go of Balhae|general]], controlled most of Manchuria and parts of the  Far East and was called the "Prosperous Country in the East". In addition to , there were many other ethnicities such as the [[Mohe people|Mohe]], [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], and .

[[Late Silla]] was a wealthy country, and its metropolitan capital of [[Gyeongju]] grew to become the fourth largest city in the world. It experienced a golden age of art and culture, exemplified by monuments such as [[Hwangnyongsa]], [[Seokguram]], and the [[Bell of King Seongdeok|Emille Bell]]. It also carried on the maritime legacy and prowess of Baekje, and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of East Asia and the trade between , , and , most notably during the time of [[Chang Pogo]]. In addition, Silla people made overseas communities in  on the [[Shandong Peninsula]] and the mouth of the [[Yangtze]] River. However, Silla was later weakened due to internal strife and the revival of successor states [[Later Baekje|Baekje]] and [[Taebong|Goguryeo]], which culminated into the [[Later Three Kingdoms]] period in the late 9th century.

Buddhism flourished during this time. Many [[ Buddhism| Buddhists]] gained great fame among  Buddhist circles and greatly contributed to [[ Buddhism]]. Examples of significant  Buddhists from this period include [[Woncheuk]], [[Wonhyo]], [[Uisang]], [[Kim Hwasang|Musang]], and [[Kim Gyo-gak]]. Kim was a Silla prince whose influence made [[Mount Jiuhua]] one of the Four [[Sacred Mountains of |Sacred Mountains]] of  Buddhism.

=== Unified dynasties ===

In 936, the Later Three Kingdoms were united by [[Taejo of Goryeo|Wang Geon]], who established [[Goryeo]] as a successor state to Goguryeo. Balhae had fallen to the [[Khitan Empire]] in 926, and a decade later the [[Dae Gwang-hyeon|last crown prince of Balhae]] fled south to Goryeo, where he was warmly welcomed and included in the ruling family by Wang Geon, thus unifying the two successor nations of Goguryeo. Like Silla, Goryeo was a highly cultural state, and invented the metal movable type [[printing press]]. After defeating the Khitan Empire, which was the most powerful empire of its time in the [[Goryeo–Khitan War]], Goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century, during which the [[Tripitaka Koreana]] was completed and significant developments in printing and publishing occurred. This promoted education and the dispersion of knowledge on philosophy, literature, religion, and science. By 1100, there were 12 universities that produced notable scholars.

However, the [[Mongol invasions of |Mongol invasions]] in the 13th century greatly weakened the kingdom. Goryeo was never conquered by the Mongols, but exhausted after three decades of fighting, the  court sent its [[Wonjong of Goryeo|crown prince]] to the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] capital to swear allegiance to [[Kublai Khan]], who accepted and married one of his daughters to the  crown prince. Henceforth, Goryeo continued to rule , though as a tributary ally to the Mongols for the next 86 years. During this period, the two nations' royalty became intertwined as all subsequent  kings married Mongol princesses. In the mid-14th century, Goryeo drove out the Mongols to regain its northern territories, briefly conquered [[Liaoyang]], and defeated invasions by the [[Red Turbans invasions of Goryeo|Red Turbans]]. However, in 1392, General [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]], who had been ordered to attack , turned his army around and staged a successful coup.

Yi Seong-gye established the [[House of Yi]], renamed the nation to [[Joseon]] in reference to Gojoseon, and moved the capital to Hanseong (one of the old names of [[Seoul]]). The first 200 years of the Joseon dynasty were marked by peace and saw great advancements in science and education, among them the creation of [[Hangul]] by [[Sejong the Great]] to promote literacy among the common people. The prevailing ideology of the time was [[ Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism]], which was epitomized by the [[seonbi]] class: nobles who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity. Between 1592 and 1598,  under [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] launched [[ invasions of  (1592–1598)|invasions of ]], but the advance was halted by  forces (most notably the [[Joseon Navy]] led by Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] and his renowned "[[turtle ship]]") with assistance from [[righteous army]] militias formed by  civilians, and [[Ming dynasty]]  troops. Through a series of successful battles of attrition, the  forces were eventually forced to withdraw, and relations between all parties became normalized. However, the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] took advantage of Joseon's war-weakened state and [[Manchu invasion of |invaded in 1627 and 1637]]. After normalizing relations with the new [[Qing dynasty]], Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace. Kings [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]] and [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]] particularly led a new renaissance of the Joseon dynasty during the 18th century.

In the 19th century, Joseon began experiencing economic difficulties and widespread uprisings, including the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]]. The royal in-law families had gained control of the government, leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state. Additionally, the strict isolationism of the Joseon government that earned it the nickname "the [[hermit kingdom]]" became increasingly ineffective due to increasing encroachment from powers such as , , and the . This was exemplified by the [[Joseon– Treaty of 1882]], which forced Joseon to open its borders.

===  occupation and World War II ===
{{Main| under  rule}}
In the late 19th century,  became a significant regional power after winning the [[First Sino- War]] against Qing  and the [[Russo- War]] against the [[ Empire]]. In 1897, King Gojong, the [[List of monarchs of |last king of ]], proclaimed Joseon as the [[ Empire]]. However,  [[– Treaty of 1905|compelled  to become its protectorate]] in 1905 and [[– Treaty of 1910|formally annexed it]] in 1910. What followed was a period of forced assimilation, in which  language, culture, and history were suppressed. This led to the [[March First Movement]] protests in 1919 and the subsequent foundation of resistance groups in exile, primarily in . Among the resistance groups was [[Provisional Government of the Republic of ]].

Towards the end of [[World War II]], the U.S. proposed dividing the  peninsula into two occupation zones: a [[ Army Military Government in |U.S. zone]] and a [[Soviet Civil Administration|Soviet zone]]. [[Dean Rusk]] and [[Charles H. Bonesteel III]] suggested the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] as the dividing line, as it placed Seoul under U.S. control. To the surprise of Rusk and Bonesteel, the Soviets accepted their proposal and agreed to divide .

=== Division of  ===
[[File:Ceremony inaugurating the government of the Republic of  (colored).jpg|thumb|Ceremony for the inauguration of the South  government (August 15, 1948)]]
Despite intentions to liberate a unified peninsula in the [[1943 Cairo Declaration]], escalating tensions between the Soviet Union and the  led to the [[division of ]] into two political entities in 1948:  and .

In the South, the  appointed and supported the former head of the  Provisional Government [[Syngman Rhee]] as leader. Rhee won the first presidential elections of the newly declared Republic of  in May 1948. In the North, the Soviets backed a former anti- guerrilla and communist activist, [[Kim Il Sung]], who was appointed premier of the Democratic People's Republic of  in September.

In October, the Soviet Union declared Kim Il Sung's government as sovereign over both the north and south. The UN declared Rhee's government as "a lawful government having effective control and jurisdiction over that part of  where the UN Temporary Commission on  was able to observe and consult" and the government "based on elections which was observed by the Temporary Commission" in addition to a statement that "this is the only such government in ." Both leaders engaged in authoritarian repression of political opponents.  requested military support from the  but was denied, while 's military was heavily reinforced by the Soviet Union.

===  War ===
On June 25, 1950, [[Operation Pokpung| invaded]] , sparking the [[ War]], the [[Cold War]]'s first major conflict, which continued until 1953. At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the UN, thus forfeiting [[United Nations Security Council veto power|their veto rights]]. This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North  forces would unify the entire country. The Soviet Union and  backed , with the later participation of millions of [[People's Volunteer Army| troops]]. After an ebb and flow that saw both sides facing defeat with massive losses among  civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate. During the war, Rhee's party promoted the [[Ilminism|One-People Principle]], an effort to build an obedient citizenry through ethnic homogeneity and authoritarian appeals to [[nationalism]].

The [[ Armistice Agreement|1953 armistice]], never signed by , split the peninsula along the [[ Demilitarized Zone|demilitarized zone]] near the original demarcation line. No peace treaty was ever signed, resulting in the two countries remaining technically at war. Approximately 3 million people died in the  War, with a higher proportional civilian death toll than [[World War II]] or the [[ War]], making it one of the deadliest conflicts of the Cold War era. In addition, virtually all of 's major cities were destroyed by the war.

=== Miracle on the Han River ===
{{main|Miracle on the Han River}}
[[File:'s GDP (PPP) growth from 1911 to 2008.png|thumb|Between 1962 and 1994, the [[Economy of |South  economy]] grew at an average of 10% annually, fueled by annual export growth of 20%, in a period called the [[Miracle on the Han River]].]]In 1960, a student uprising (the "[[April Revolution]]") led to the resignation of the autocratic President Syngman Rhee. This was followed by 13 months of political instability as  was led by the weak and ineffectual [[Second Republic of |Second Republic]]. This instability was broken by the [[May 16 coup|May 16, 1961 coup]] led by General [[Park Chung Hee]]. As president, Park oversaw a period of rapid [[Export-oriented industrialization|export-led economic growth]] enforced by [[Political repression in |political repression]]. Under Park,  [[ in the  War|took an active role]] in the  War.

Park was heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a [[Yusin Constitution|new constitution]], which gave the president dictatorial powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms. The [[Economy of | economy]] developed significantly during Park's tenure, largely due to investment in [[Chaebol|family-run conglomerates]]. The government developed the [[Expressways in |nationwide expressway system]], the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|Seoul subway system]], and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year tenure, which ended with [[Assassination of Park Chung Hee|his assassination]] on 26 October, 1979.

The years after Park's assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979, General [[Chun Doo-hwan]] led the [[coup d'état of December Twelfth]]. On May 17, 1980, Chun forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to [[Jeju Island]]. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities, and further curtailed the press. Chun's assumption of the presidency through the events of May 17 triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy; these protests were particularly widespread in [[Gwangju]], to which Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the 18–27 May 1980 [[Gwangju Uprising|Gwangju Democratization Movement]] at the cost of probably 500 to 2,000 civilian lives and 26 dead soldiers (half of them by [[friendly fire]]).

Chun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan. Chun and his government held  under a despotic rule until 1987, when a [[Seoul National University]] student, [[Park Jong-chul]], was tortured to death. On {{Nowrap|June 10}}, the [[Catholic Priests Association for Justice]] revealed the incident, igniting the [[June Democratic Struggle]] across the country. Eventually, Chun's party, the [[Democratic Justice Party]], and its leader, [[Roh Tae-woo]], announced the [[June 29 Declaration]], which promised a democratic election of the president.

=== Democracy ===
Roh Tae-woo went on to win the [[1987 South  presidential election|1987 election]] by a narrow margin against the two main opposition leaders, [[Kim Dae-jung]] and [[Kim Young-sam]]. Seoul hosted the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games in 1988]], which was widely regarded as successful and a significant boost for 's global image and economy.

[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 702| was formally invited]] to become a member of the United Nations in 1991. The transition of  from autocracy to modern democracy was marked in 1997 by the election of Kim Dae-jung, who was sworn in as the eighth president of  on February 25, 1998. His election was significant given that he had in earlier years been a political prisoner sentenced to death (later commuted to exile). He won against the backdrop of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], where he took [[IMF]] advice to restructure the economy and the nation soon recovered its economic growth, albeit at a slower pace.

In June 2000, as part of President Kim Dae-jung's "[[Sunshine Policy]]" of engagement, a [[Inter- summit|North–South summit]] took place in [[Pyongyang]], the capital of , now ruled by Kim Il Sung's son [[Kim Jong Il]]. Later that year, Kim received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] "for his work for democracy and human rights in  and in East Asia in general, and for peace and reconciliation with  in particular". However, because of discontent among the population for fruitless approaches to the North under the previous administrations and, amid North  provocations, a conservative government was elected in 2007 led by President [[Lee Myung-bak]], former [[mayor of Seoul]]. While [[– relations|South  and  relations]] improved when they jointly co-hosted the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], it later [[– disputes|soured]] because of conflicting claims of sovereignty over the [[Liancourt Rocks dispute|Liancourt Rocks]].

In 2010, there was an [[List of border incidents involving North and |escalation in attacks]] by . In March 2010 the South  warship [[ROKS Cheonan sinking|ROKS ''Cheonan'' was sunk]] killing 46 South  sailors, allegedly by a North  submarine. In November 2010 [[Yeonpyeongdo]] [[Bombardment of Yeonpyeong|was attacked]] by a significant North  artillery barrage, with 4 people dying. The official UN report declined to explicitly name  as the perpetrator for the ''Cheonan'' sinking. The lack of a strong response to these attacks from both  and the international community caused significant anger with the South  public.

=== Contemporary history ===
The children of presidents Park Chung Hee and Kim Jong Il would take power in the two  from 2011 to 2012. [[Kim Jong Un]] succeeded his father as leader of  in 2011, while  elected the first ever female president [[Park Geun-hye]] in the [[2012 South  presidential election|2012 election]]. The conservative Park Geun-hye administration was formally accused of corruption, bribery, and influence-peddling for the involvement of Park's close friend [[Choi Soon-sil]] in state affairs. There followed a series of [[2016–2017 South  protests|nationwide public demonstrations]] from November 2016, and she was removed from office. After the fallout of Park's impeachment and dismissal, elections were held and [[Moon Jae-in]] of the [[Democratic Party (, 2015)|Democratic Party]] won the presidency, immediately taking office on May 10, 2017. His tenure saw an improving political relationship with , some increasing divergence in the military alliance with the , and the successful hosting of [[2018 Winter Olympics|the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang]]. In April 2018, Park Geun-hye was sentenced to 24 years in jail and convicted of abuse of power and corruption. [[COVID-19 pandemic in |The COVID-19 pandemic]] caused  to record more deaths than births, resulting in a population decline for the first time on record.

In March 2022, [[Yoon Suk Yeol]], the candidate of the conservative opposition [[People Power Party ()|People Power Party]], won a close [[2022 South  presidential election|election]] over Democratic Party candidate [[Lee Jae-myung]] by the narrowest margin in the history of the Sixth Republic and was sworn in on May 10, 2022. He declared [[2024 South  martial law|martial law]] on December 3, 2024, accusing the opposition of being pro-North  and conducting anti-state activities. After several hours, the National Assembly voted to nullify the declaration in a unanimous vote of 190/0, causing Yoon to end martial law early on December 4. Yoon's actions resulted in [[Impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol|his impeachment]] on December 14, 2024, followed by his unanimous removal from office on April 4, 2025. Lee Jae-myung won the [[2025 South  presidential election|election]] to succeed Yoon, immediately taking office on June 4, 2025.
