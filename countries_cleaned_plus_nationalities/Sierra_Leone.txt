=== Early history ===
[[File:Prehistoric pottery shards, .jpg|thumb|Fragments of [[prehistoric]] pottery from [[Kamabai]] Rock Shelter]]

[[File: Bunce Island 1805.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bunce Island]], 1805, during the period the slave factory was run by [[Sir John Anderson, 1st Baronet, of Mill Hill|John]] and [[Alexander Anderson (slave trader)|Alexander Anderson]]]]'s history is marked by continuous human habitation for at least 2,500 years, influenced by migrations from across Africa. Iron technology had been adopted by the 9th century and agriculture established by 1000 AD along the coast. Climate shifts over centuries altered the ecological zones, influencing migration and conquest dynamics.

The region's dense [[tropical rainforest]] and swamps, coupled with the presence of the [[tsetse fly]] which carried a disease fatal to horses and the [[zebu]] cattle used by the [[Mande people|Mandé people]], provided natural defenses against invasions by the [[Mandinka Empire]] and other African empires, and limited influence by the [[ Empire]]. The introduction of [[Islam]] by [[Susu people|Susu]] traders, merchants and migrants in the 18th century further enriched the culture, eventually establishing a strong foothold in the north. The conquest by [[Samory Touré]] in the northeast solidified Islam among the [[Yalunka people|Yalunka]], [[Kuranko]] and [[Limba people ()|Limba]] people.

===European trading===

The 15th century marked the beginning of European interaction with , highlighted by  explorer [[Pedro de Sintra]] mapping the region in 1462 and naming it after the lioness mountains. This naming has been subject to historical reinterpretation, suggesting earlier European knowledge of the region. Following Sintra, European traders established fortified posts, engaging primarily in the [[History of slavery|slave trade]], which shaped the socio-economic landscape significantly.

Traders from European countries such as the [[ Republic]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of |]], started to establish trading stations. These stations quickly began to primarily deal in slaves, who were brought to the coast by indigenous traders from interior areas. The Europeans made payments, called ''Cole'', for rent, tribute, and trading rights, to the king of an area. Local Afro-European merchants often acted as middlemen, the Europeans advancing them goods to trade to indigenous merchants, most often for slaves and ivory.

===Early  interactions===
 traders were particularly drawn to the local craftsmanship in [[ivory]], leading to a notable trade in ivory artifacts such as horns, [[Sapi Saltceller]], and spoons. The Sapi people belonged to a cluster of people who spoke [[West Atlantic languages]], living in the region of modern day . There had already been a carving culture established in the area prior to  contact and many travelers to  initially impressed with their carving skills took local ivory horns back to Europe.

=== Black Poor of London ===
{{Main|Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor}}
[[File:Houses at Sierra-Leone (May 1853, X, p.55) - Copy.jpg|thumb|Houses at Sierra-Leone (May 1853, X, p. 55)]]
In the late 18th century, some African Americans who had fought for the [[British Crown]] during the [[ Revolutionary War]] were resettled in , forming a community named [[Black Loyalists]]. This resettlement scheme was partly motivated by social issues in London, with the  Resettlement Scheme offering a new beginning for the [[Black Poor]]. Many had been slaves who had escaped to join the British, lured by promises of freedom ([[emancipation]]). Official documentation known as the ''[[Book of Negroes]]'' lists thousands of freed slaves whom the British evacuated from the nascent  and resettled in colonies elsewhere in [[British North America]].
Pro-slavery advocates accused the Black Poor of being responsible for a large proportion of crime in 18th-century London. While the broader community included some women, the Black Poor seems to have exclusively consisted of men, some of whom developed relationships with local women and often married them. On the voyage between [[Plymouth|Plymouth, England]] and , 29 European girlfriends and wives accompanied the [[Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor|Black Poor settlers]]. Many in London thought moving them to  would lift them out of poverty. The  Resettlement Scheme was proposed by entomologist [[Henry Smeathman]] and drew interest from humanitarians like [[Granville Sharp]], who saw it as a means of showing the pro-slavery lobby that black people could contribute towards the running of the new colony. Government officials soon became involved in the scheme as well, although their interest was spurred by the possibility of resettling a large group of poor citizens elsewhere. [[William Pitt the Younger]], prime minister and leader of the Tory party, had an active interest in the Scheme because he saw it as a means to repatriate the Black Poor to Africa.

In January 1787, the ''Atlantic'' and the ''Belisarius'' set sail for , but bad weather forced them to divert to Plymouth, during which time about 50 passengers died. Another 24 were discharged, and 23 ran away. Eventually, 411 passengers sailed to  in April 1787. On the voyage between Plymouth and , 96 passengers died. In 1787 the British Crown founded a settlement in  in what was called the "[[Province of Freedom]]". About 400 black and 60 white colonists reached  on 15 May 1787. After they established [[Granville Town]], most of the first group of colonists died, owing to disease and warfare with the indigenous African peoples ([[Temne people|Temne]]), who resisted their encroachment. When the ships left them in September, they had been reduced to "276 persons, namely 212 black men, 30 black women, 5 white men and 29 white women".

The settlers that remained forcibly captured land from a local African chieftain, but he retaliated, attacking the settlement, which was reduced to a mere 64 settlers comprising 39 black men, 19 black women, and six white women. Black settlers were captured by unscrupulous traders and sold as slaves, and the remaining colonists were forced to arm themselves for their own protection. The 64 remaining colonists established a second Granville Town.

=== Nova Scotians ===
{{Main|Nova Scotian Settlers}}

Following the  Revolution, some Black Loyalists from [[Nova Scotia]], , were relocated to , founding Freetown and contributing significantly to the [[Krio people]] and [[Krio language]] that would come to define the region.{{citation needed|date=April 2025}}

Following the [[ Revolution]], more than 3,000 Black Loyalists had also been settled in [[Nova Scotia]], but faced harsh winters and racial discrimination. [[Thomas Peters (black leader)|Thomas Peters]] pressed British authorities for relief and more aid; together with British abolitionist [[John Clarkson (abolitionist)|John Clarkson]], the [[ Company]] was established to relocate Black Loyalists who wanted to take their chances in West Africa. In 1792 nearly 1,200 persons from Nova Scotia crossed the Atlantic to build the second (and only permanent) Colony of  and the settlement of [[Freetown]] on 11 March 1792. In  they were called the [[Nova Scotian Settlers]], the ''Nova Scotians'', or the ''Settlers''. Clarkson initially banned the survivors of Granville Town from joining the new settlement, blaming them for the demise of Granville Town. The Settlers built Freetown in the styles they knew from their lives in the [[ South]]; they also continued  fashion and  manners. In addition, many continued to practise [[Methodism]].

In the 1790s, the Settlers, including adult women, voted for the first time in elections. In 1792, in a move that foreshadowed the women's suffrage movements in Britain, the heads of all households, of which a third were women, were given the right to vote. Black settlers in  enjoyed much more autonomy than their white equivalent in European countries. Black migrants elected different levels of political representatives, 'tithingmen', who represented each dozen settlers and 'hundreders' who represented larger amounts. This sort of representation was not available in Nova Scotia. The initial process of society-building in Freetown was a harsh struggle. The Crown did not supply enough basic supplies and provisions and the Settlers were continually threatened by illegal slave trading and the risk of re-enslavement.

===  Maroons and Liberated Africans ===
{{Main| Maroons in | Liberated Africans}}

The  Company, controlled by London investors, refused to allow the settlers to take [[fee simple|freehold]] of the land. In 1799 some of the settlers revolted. The Crown subdued the revolt by bringing in forces of more than 500&nbsp;[[ Maroons]], whom they transported from [[Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town)]] via Nova Scotia in 1800. Led by Colonel [[Montague James]], the Maroons helped the colonial forces to put down the revolt, and in the process the [[ Maroons in ]] secured the best houses and farms.

On 1 January 1808, [[Thomas Ludlam (colonial administrator)|Thomas Ludlam]], the Governor of the  Company and a leading abolitionist, surrendered the company's charter. This ended its 16&nbsp;years of running the Colony. The British Crown reorganised the  Company as the [[African Institution]]; it was directed to improve the local economy. Its members represented both British who hoped to inspire local entrepreneurs and those with interest in the Macauley & Babington Company, which held the (British) monopoly on  trade.

At about the same time (following the Slave Trade Act 1807 which abolished the slave trade), Royal Navy crews delivered thousands of formerly enslaved Africans to Freetown, after liberating them from illegal slave ships. These [[recaptives|Liberated Africans]] or ''recaptives'' were sold for $20 a head as apprentices to the white settlers, Nova Scotian Settlers, and the  Maroons. Many Liberated Africans were treated poorly and even abused because some of the original settlers considered them their property. Cut off from their various homelands and traditions, the Liberated Africans were forced to assimilate to the Western styles of Settlers and Maroons. The Liberated Africans eventually modified their customs to adopt those of the Nova Scotians, Maroons and Europeans, yet kept some of their ethnic traditions. As the Liberated Africans became successful traders and spread Christianity throughout West Africa, they intermarried with the Nova Scotians and Maroons.{{rp|3–4, 223–255}}

These [[Liberated Africans in |Liberated Africans]] were from many areas of Africa, but principally the west coast. Between the 18th and 19th century, freed African Americans, some [[Americo ]] "refugees", and particularly [[Afro-Caribbean]]s, mainly  Maroons, also immigrated and settled in Freetown. Together these peoples formed the [[ Creole|Creole/Krio ethnicity]] and an [[-based creole languages|-based creole]] language ([[Krio language|Krio]]), which is the [[lingua franca]].

=== Colonial era (1808–1961) ===
{{Main| Colony and Protectorate}}

The colonial era saw  evolving under British rule.  developed as an educational center in West Africa, with the establishment of [[Fourah Bay College]] in 1827, attracting -speaking Africans from across the region.

The settlement of  in the 1800s was unique in that the population was composed of displaced Africans, brought to the colony after the British [[abolition of the slave trade]] in 1807. Upon arrival in , each ''recaptive'' was given a registration number, and information on their physical qualities was entered into the Register of Liberated Africans. Documentation was often subjective, resulting in inaccurate entries, making them difficult to track.

The first missionaries, [[Peter Hartwig (missionary)|Peter Hartwig]] and [[Melchior Renner]]from the [[Church Mission Society|Church Missionary Society]] (CMS), arrived in  in 1804. The CMS missionaries were to introduce Western ideals, including Western education and healthcare. One of their most significant contributions was the establishment of schools for West African children. European missionaries established these schools with an agenda to convert the native people to their religion, but the educational efforts did not relate to local needs.

In the early 19th century, Freetown served as the residence of the British colonial governor of the region, who also administered the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[]]) and the [[Gambia]] settlements.  developed as the educational centre of [[British West Africa]]. The British established [[Fourah Bay College]] in 1827, which became a magnet for -speaking Africans on the West Coast. For more than a century, it was the only European-style university in west [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther]] was the first student to be enrolled. Fourah Bay College soon drew [[ Creole people|Creoles/Krio people]] and other Africans seeking higher education in British West Africa. These included Nigerians, Ghanaians, Ivorians, and others, especially in the fields of [[theology]] and education. Freetown was known as the "[[Athens]] of Africa" due to the number of excellent schools there and in surrounding areas.

In Freetown, the British interacted mostly with the Krio people, who did most of the trading with the indigenous peoples of the interior. Educated Krio people held many positions in the colonial government, giving them status and good pay. After the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884–85, the British decided to establish more dominion over the inland areas, to satisfy what the European powers called "effective occupation". In 1896 it annexed these areas, declaring them the  Protectorate. With this change, the British began to expand their administration in the region, recruiting British citizens to posts and pushing Krio people out of governmental positions and even Freetown's desirable residential areas.

[[File: Bai Bureh.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[Bai Bureh]], Temne leader of the [[Hut Tax War of 1898]] against British rule]]
[[Madam Yoko]] persuaded the British to give her control of the Kpaa Mende chiefdom. She used diplomacy to communicate with local chiefs who did not trust her friendship with the British. Because Yoko supported the British, some sub-chiefs rebelled, causing Yoko to take refuge in the police barracks. She ruled as a paramount chief in the new British Protectorate until 1906.

The British annexation of the Protectorate interfered with indigenous chiefs' sovereignty. They designated chiefs as units of local government, rather than dealing with them individually, as had been the previous practice. They did not maintain relationships even with longstanding allies, such as [[Bai Bureh]], who was later unfairly portrayed as a prime instigator of the [[Hut Tax War]].

Published caption: "British expeditionary force preparing to embark at Freetown to attack the [[ Cameroons]], the main object of the attack being the port of [[Douala|Duala]]. Auxiliary native troops were freely used in African warfare."]]
In 1898, Colonel [[Frederic Cardew]], military governor of the Protectorate, imposed a new tax on dwellings and demanded that chiefs use their people to maintain roads. The taxes were often higher than the value of the dwellings, and 24 chiefs signed a petition to Cardew stating how destructive this was; their people could not afford to take time off from their subsistence agriculture. They resisted payment of taxes, and tension over the new colonial requirements and the administration's suspicion of the chiefs led to the Hut Tax War. The British fired first; the northern front of mainly Temne people was led by Bai Bureh. The southern front, consisting mostly of [[Mende people]], entered the conflict somewhat later, for other reasons.

For several months, Bureh's fighters had the advantage over the vastly more powerful British forces but both sides suffered hundreds of fatalities. Bureh surrendered on 11 November 1898 to end the destruction of his people's territory and dwellings. The British government recommended leniency, but Cardew insisted on sending the chief and two allies into exile in the Gold Coast; his government hanged 96 of the chief's warriors. Bureh was allowed to return in 1905, when he resumed his chieftaincy of Kasseh. The defeat of the Temne and Mende in the Hut Tax War ended mass resistance to the Protectorate and colonial government, but intermittent rioting and labour unrest continued throughout the colonial period. Riots in 1955 and 1956 involved tens of thousands of Sierra Leoneans in the Protectorate.

Domestic [[Slavery in Africa|slavery]], which continued to be practised by local African elites, was abolished in 1928. In 1935, a monopoly on mineral mining was granted to the [[ Selection Trust]], run by [[De Beers]]. The monopoly was scheduled to last 98 years. Mining of diamonds in the east and other minerals expanded, drawing labourers there from other parts of the country.

In 1924, the UK government divided the administration of  into Colony and Protectorate, with different political systems for each. The Colony was Freetown and its coastal area; the Protectorate was defined as the [[hinterland]] areas dominated by local chiefs. Antagonism between the two entities escalated to a heated debate in 1947, when proposals were introduced to provide for a single political system for both the Colony and the Protectorate. Most proposals came from leaders of the Protectorate, whose population far outnumbered the Colony's. The Krios, led by [[I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson|Isaac Wallace-Johnson]], opposed the proposals, as they would have reduced the Krios' political power in the Colony.

In 1951, [[Lamina Sankoh]] collaborated with educated Protectorate leaders to form the [[ People's Party]] (SLPP) as the party of the Protectorate. The SLPP leadership, led by Sir Milton Margai, negotiated with the British and the educated Krio-dominated colony based in Freetown to achieve independence. Under Margai, educated Protectorate elites were able to join forces with the [[paramount chiefs]] in the face of Krio intransigence. Later, Margai used the same skills to win over opposition leaders and moderate Krio elements to achieve independence from the UK.

In November 1951, Margai oversaw the drafting of a new constitution, which united the separate Colonial and Protectorate legislatures and provided a framework for [[decolonisation]]. In 1953,  was granted local ministerial powers and Margai was elected [[Chief Minister]] of . The new constitution ensured  had a parliamentary system within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In May 1957,  held its first parliamentary election. The SLPP won the most seats in Parliament and Margai was reelected as Chief Minister by a landslide.

=== Independence and post-independence era ===
On 27 April 1961, Margai led  to independence from Great Britain and became the country's first prime minister.  had its own parliament, its own prime minister, and the ability to make its own laws, but like countries such as  and ,  remained a "Dominion" and Queen Elizabeth was Queen of the independent [[ (1961–1971)|Dominion of ]]. The Dominion of  retained a parliamentary system of government and was a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The leader of the main opposition [[All People's Congress]] (APC), Siaka Stevens, along with Isaac Wallace-Johnson, another outspoken critic of the SLPP government, were arrested and placed under [[house arrest]] in Freetown.

In May 1962,  held its [[ general election, 1962|first general election]] as an independent state. The SLPP won a plurality of seats in parliament, and Margai was reelected as prime minister. Margai was popular among Sierra Leoneans during his time in power. He was not corrupt, nor did he make lavish displays of his power or status. He based the government on the [[rule of law]] and the separation of powers, with multiparty political institutions and fairly viable representative structures. Margai employed a brokerage style of politics, sharing power among political parties and interest groups, especially the powerful paramount chiefs in the provinces, most of whom were key allies of his government.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==== Albert Margai's tenure (1964–1967) ====
Upon Margai's unexpected death in 1964, his younger [[half-brother]], Sir Albert Margai, was appointed as prime minister by parliament. Sir Albert's leadership was briefly challenged by Foreign Minister John Karefa-Smart, who questioned his succession to the SLPP leadership position. But Karefa-Smart lacked broad support within the SLPP in his attempt to oust Albert as both the leader of the SLPP and prime minister. Soon after Albert Margai was sworn in as prime minister, he fired several senior government officials who had served in his brother's government, viewing them as a threat to his administration, including Karefa-Smart.

Sir Albert resorted to increasingly [[authoritarian]] actions in response to protests and enacted several laws against the opposition All People's Congress while attempting to establish a [[one-party state]]. He opposed to the colonial legacy of allowing executive powers to the Paramount Chiefs, many of whom had been his brother's allies. Accordingly, they began to consider Sir Albert a threat to the ruling houses across the country. Margai appointed many non-Creoles to the country's [[civil service]] in Freetown, in an overall diversification of the civil service, which had been dominated by Creoles. As a result, he became unpopular among Creoles, many of whom had supported Sir Milton. Margai sought to make the army homogeneously [[Mende people|Mende]], his own ethnic group, and was accused of favouring members of the Mende for prominent positions.

In 1967, riots broke out in Freetown against Margai's policies. In response, he declared a [[state of emergency]] across the country. He was accused of corruption and of a policy of [[affirmative action]] in favour of the Mende ethnic group. He also endeavoured to change  from a democracy to a [[one-party state]].

==== 1967 General Election and military coups (1967–1968) ====
The APC, with its leader [[Siaka Stevens]], narrowly won a small majority of seats in Parliament over the SLPP in a closely contested [[ general election, 1967|1967 general election]]. Stevens was sworn in as prime minister on 21 March 1967.

Within hours of taking office, Stevens was ousted in a bloodless [[1967  coups d'état|military coup]] led by [[Brigadier General]] [[David Lansana]], the commander of the [[Republic of  Armed Forces| Armed Forces]]. He was a close ally of Albert Margai, who had appointed him to the position in 1964. Lansana placed Stevens under [[house arrest]] in Freetown and insisted that the determination of the Prime Minister should await the election of the tribal representatives to the House. Stevens was later freed and fled the country, going into exile in neighbouring . On 23 March 1967, a group of military officers in the  Army led by Brigadier General [[Andrew Juxon-Smith]] staged a counter-coup against Lansana. They seized control of the government, arrested Lansana, and suspended the constitution. The group set up the [[National Reformation Council]] (NRC), with Juxon-Smith as its chairman and Head of State of the country.

On 18 April 1968 a group of low-ranking soldiers in the  Army who called themselves the Anti-Corruption Revolutionary Movement (ACRM), led by Brigadier General [[John Amadu Bangura]], [[Sergeants' Coup ()|overthrew]] the NRC [[Military junta|junta]]. The ACRM arrested many senior NRC members. They reinstated the constitution and returned power to Stevens, who at last assumed the office of prime minister.

Stevens had Bangura arrested in 1970 and charged with conspiracy and treason. He was found guilty and sentenced to death, even though his actions had led to Stevens's return to power. Lansana and [[Samuel Hinga Norman|Hinga Norman]], the main army officers involved in the first coup (1967), were unceremoniously dismissed from the armed forces and made to serve time in prison. Norman was a guard to [[Governor-general]] [[Henry Josiah Lightfoot Boston|Sir Henry Lightfoot-Boston]]. Lansana was tried, found guilty of treason, and sentenced to death in 1975.

==== One-party state and dawn of the 'Republic' (1968–1991) ====
[[File: All People's Congress political rally  1968.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An [[All People's Congress|APC]] political rally in the northern town of [[Kabala, |Kabala]] outside the home of supporters of the rival [[ People's Party|SLPP]] in 1968]]

Stevens assumed power as prime minister again in 1968, following a series of coups. He had campaigned on a platform of socialist principles, but abandoned them and employed an authoritarian government. During his first decade or so in power, Stevens renegotiated some of what he called "useless prefinanced schemes" contracted by his predecessors Albert Margai of the SLPP and Juxon-Smith of the NRC. Some of these policies were said to have left the country economically deprived.

Stevens reorganised the country's oil refinery, the government-owned Cape Sierra Hotel, and a cement factory. He began efforts that later improved transportation and movement between the provinces and Freetown. Roads and hospitals were constructed in the provinces, and Paramount Chiefs and provincial peoples became a prominent force in Freetown. Under the pressure of several coup attempts, real or perceived, Stevens's rule grew increasingly authoritarian, and his relationship with some of his supporters deteriorated. He removed the SLPP from competitive politics in general elections, some believed, through violence and intimidation. To maintain the support of the military, Stevens retained the popular John Amadu Bangura as head of the  Armed Forces.

After the return to civilian rule, [[by-election]]s were held (beginning in autumn 1968) and an all-APC cabinet was appointed. In November 1968, unrest in the provinces led Stevens to declare a state of emergency across the country. Many senior officers in the  Army were greatly disappointed with Stevens's policies and his handling of the  Military, but none could confront him. Brigadier General Bangura, who had reinstated Stevens as prime minister, was widely considered the only person who could control Stevens. The army was devoted to Bangura. In January 1970, Bangura was arrested and charged with [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] and plotting to commit a coup against the Stevens government. After a trial that lasted a few months, Bangura was convicted; on 29 March 1970, he was executed by hanging in Freetown.

After Bangura's execution, a group of soldiers loyal to him mutinied in Freetown and other parts of the country in opposition to Stevens's government. Dozens of soldiers were arrested and convicted by a [[court martial]] in Freetown for their participation in the mutiny. Among the soldiers arrested was a little-known army [[corporal]], [[Foday Sankoh]], a strong Bangura supporter, who later formed the [[Revolutionary United Front|Revolutionary United Front (RUF)]]. Sankoh was convicted and jailed for seven years at Pademba Road Prison in Freetown.

In April 1971, a new republican constitution was adopted under which Stevens became president. In the 1972 by-elections, the opposition SLPP complained of intimidation and procedural obstruction by the APC and militia. These problems became so severe that the SLPP boycotted the [[ general election, 1973|1973 general election]]; as a result, the APC won 84 of the 85 elected seats.

An alleged plot to overthrow President Stevens failed in 1974 and its leaders were executed. In mid-1974,  soldiers, as requested by Stevens, were stationed in the country to help maintain his hold on power, as Stevens was a close ally of then- president [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]]. In March 1976, Stevens was elected without opposition to a second five-year term as president. On 19 July 1975, 14 senior army and government officials were executed after being convicted of attempting a coup to topple Stevens's government.

In 1977, a nationwide student demonstration against the government disrupted 's politics. The demonstration was quickly put down by the army and Stevens's personal Special Security Division (SSD), a heavily armed paramilitary force he had created to protect him and maintain his hold on power. SSD officers were loyal to Stevens and were deployed across the country to clamp down on any rebellion or protest against his government. [[ parliamentary election, 1977|A general election]] was called later that year in which corruption was again endemic; the APC won 74 seats and the SLPP 15. In 1978, the APC-dominant parliament approved a new constitution making the country a one-party state. The 1978 constitution made the APC the only legal political party in . This move led to another major demonstration against the government in many parts of the country, which was also put down by the army and the SSD force.

Stevens is generally criticised for dictatorial methods and government corruption, but he kept the country stable and from collapsing into civil war. He created government institutions still in use. Stevens reduced ethnic polarisation in government by incorporating members of various ethnic groups into his all-dominant APC government.

Stevens retired from politics in November 1985. The APC named a new presidential candidate, [[Major General]] [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], head of the  Armed Forces. Momoh had been loyal to Stevens, who had appointed him to the position. Like Stevens, Momoh was a member of the minority [[Limba people ()|Limba]] ethnic group. As the sole candidate, Momoh was elected president without opposition and sworn in as 's second president on 28 November 1985 in Freetown. President Momoh appointed his former military colleague and key ally, Major General Mohamed Tarawalie, to succeed him as head of the  Military. Momoh named James Bambay Kamara head of the [[ Police]]. Bambay Kamara was also a strong Momoh loyalist and supporter. Momoh broke from Stevens by integrating the SSD into the  Police as a special [[paramilitary force]]. Under Stevens, the SSD had been a personal force used to maintain his hold on power, independent from the  Military and  Police Force. The  Police under Bambay Kamara's leadership was accused of physical violence, arrest, and intimidation against critics of Momoh's government.

Momoh's strong links with the army and verbal attacks on corruption earned him initial support among Sierra Leoneans. With the lack of new faces in the APC cabinet under Momoh and the return of many from Stevens's government, criticisms soon arose that Momoh was simply perpetuating the rule of Stevens.

The next few years under the Momoh administration were characterised by corruption, which Momoh defused by sacking several senior cabinet ministers. To formalise his war against corruption, Momoh announced a "Code of Conduct for Political Leaders and Public Servants". After an alleged attempt to overthrow Momoh in March 1987, more than 60 senior government officials were arrested, including Vice-President [[Francis Minah]], who was convicted of plotting the coup and executed by hanging in 1989.

===  Civil War (1991–2002) and the NPRC regime (1992–1996) ===

{{Further| Civil War}}The brutal civil war significantly impacted , with internal and external factors contributing to widespread violence. International interventions, notably by the  and the United Nations, were crucial in restoring peace.[[File: School destroyed by  Civil War.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A school in [[Koindu]] destroyed during the [[ Civil War|Civil War]]; in total 1,270 primary schools were destroyed in the War.]]

In October 1990, owing to mounting pressure from both within and outside the country for political and economic reforms, Momoh set up a constitutional review commission to assess the 1978 one-party constitution. Based on the commission's recommendations, a constitution reestablishing a multi-party system was approved by the exclusive APC Parliament by a 60% majority vote, becoming effective on 1 October 1991. It was widely suspected that Momoh was not serious about political reform, as APC rule was increasingly marked by abuses of power.

The brutal civil war in neighbouring [[]] played a significant role in the outbreak of fighting in . [[Charles Taylor ()|Charles Taylor]], then leader of the [[National Patriotic Front of ]], reportedly helped form the [[Revolutionary United Front|Revolutionary United Front (RUF)]] under the command of former  army [[corporal]] [[Foday Sankoh|Foday Saybana Sankoh]], an ethnic Temne from [[Tonkolili District]] in Northern . Taylor's aim was for the RUF to attack the bases of -dominated peacekeeping troops in  who opposed his rebel movement in .

On 29 April 1992, a group of young soldiers in the  Army, led by seven army officers—Lieutenant Sahr Sandy, Captain Valentine Strasser, [[Solomon Musa|Lieutenant Solomon "SAJ" Musa]], Captain [[Komba Mondeh]], Lieutenant [[Tom Nyuma]], Captain Julius Maada Bio and Captain Komba Kambo—staged a [[military coup]] that sent Momoh into exile in , and the soldiers established the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC), with 25-year-old Captain Valentine Strasser as its chairman and Head of State of the country. The NPRC junta immediately suspended the constitution, banned all political parties, limited [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]], and enacted a rule-by-decree policy, in which soldiers were granted unlimited powers of administrative detention without charge or trial, and challenges against such detentions in court were precluded.

SAJ Musa, a childhood friend of Strasser, became the deputy chairman and deputy leader of the NPRC government. Strasser became the world's youngest head of state when he seized power just three days after his 25th birthday. The NPRC established the National Supreme Council of State as the military highest command and final authority in all matters and was exclusively made up of the highest-ranking NPRC soldiers, including Strasser and the others who toppled Momoh.

One of the top-ranking soldiers in the NPRC junta, Lieutenant Sahr Sandy, a trusted ally of Strasser, was assassinated, allegedly by Major S.I.M. Turay, a key loyalist of Momoh. A heavily armed military manhunt was carried out across the country to find Sandy's killer. Turay, the main suspect, fled to . Dozens of soldiers loyal to Momoh were arrested, including Colonel Kahota M. Dumbuya and Major Yayah Turay.

The NPRC maintained relations with ECOWAS and strengthened support for -based ECOMOG troops fighting in the  war. On 28 December 1992, an alleged coup attempt against the NPRC government aimed at freeing the detained Colonel Yahya Kanu, Colonel [[Kahota M.S. Dumbuya]], and former inspector general of police Bambay Kamara, was foiled. Several Junior army officers led by Sergeant Mohamed Lamin Bangura were identified as being behind the coup plot. The coup plot led to the execution of 17 soldiers by firing squad. Some of those executed include Colonel Kahota Dumbuya, Major Yayah Kanu, and Sergeant Mohamed Lamin Bangura. Several prominent members of the Momoh government who had been in detention at the Pa Demba Road prison, including former inspector general of police Bambay Kamara, were also executed.

On 5 July 1994 SAJ Musa, who was popular among the general population, particularly in Freetown, was arrested and sent into exile after he was accused of planning a coup to topple Strasser, an accusation SAJ Musa denied. Strasser replaced Musa as deputy NPRC chairman with Captain Bio and instantly promoted him to [[brigadier]].

The NPRC's efforts proved nearly as ineffective as the Momoh administration in repelling the RUF rebels. More and more of the country fell into the RUF fighters' hands, and by 1994 they had gained control of much of the diamond-rich Eastern Province and were getting close to Freetown. In response, the NPRC hired several hundred mercenary fighters from [[]]-based [[private military contractor]] [[Executive Outcomes]] to strengthen the response to RUF rebels. Within a month, they drove the RUF fighters back to enclaves along 's borders and cleared the RUF from the Kono diamond-producing areas of .

With Strasser's two most senior NPRC allies and commanders Lieutenant Sahr Sandy and Lieutenant [[Solomon Musa]] no longer around to defend him, Strasser's leadership within the NPRC's Supreme Council of State became fragile. On 16 January 1996, after about four years in power, Strasser was arrested in a palace coup staged by his fellow NPRC soldiers led by Brigadier Bio at the Defence Headquarters in Freetown. Strasser was immediately flown into exile in a [[military helicopter]] to [[Conakry]], [[]]. In his first public broadcast to the nation after the 1996 coup, Brigadier Bio said that returning  to a democratically elected civilian government and ending the civil war were his motivations for the coup.

Following the 1995 National Consultative Conference at the Bintumani Hotel in Freetown, dubbed "Bintumani I", a Strasser-led initiative, the Bio administration initiated another National Consultative Conference at the same hotel, dubbed "Bintumani II". It involved both national and international stakeholders, in an effort to find a viable solution to the issues plaguing the country. "''Peace before Elections vs Elections before Peace''" became a key debate topic and this quickly became a point of national discussion. The discussions eventually concluded with key stakeholders, including Bio's administration and the UN, agreeing that while efforts in finding a peaceful solution to ending the war should continue, a general election should be held as soon as possible. Bio handed power over to Ahmad Tejan Kabbah of the SLPP, after the conclusion of elections in early 1996 which Kabbah won. After taking over, President Kabbah immediately opened [[dialogue]] with the RUF and invited their leader Foday Sankoh for peace negotiations.

On 25 May 1997, 17 soldiers in the  army led by Corporal Tamba Gborie, loyal to the detained Major [[Johnny Paul Koroma]], launched a military coup which sent President Kabbah into exile in  and they established the [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council]] (AFRC). Gborie quickly went to the  Broadcasting Services headquarters in New England, Freetown to announce the coup to a shocked nation and to alert all soldiers across the country to report for guard duty. The soldiers immediately released Koroma from prison and installed him as their chairman and Head of State.

Koroma suspended the constitution, banned demonstrations, shut down all private radio stations in the country and invited the RUF to join the new junta government, with its leader Foday Sankoh as the Vice-Chairman of the new AFRC-RUF coalition junta government. Within days, Freetown was overwhelmed by the presence of the RUF combatants. The Kamajors, a group of traditional fighters mostly from the Mende ethnic group under the command of deputy [[Defence Minister]] [[Samuel Hinga Norman]], remained loyal to President Kabbah and defended the Southern part of  from the soldiers.

After nine months in office, the junta was overthrown by the -led [[ECOMOG]] forces, and the democratically elected government of president Kabbah was reinstated in February 1998. On 19 October 1998, 24 soldiers in the  army—including Gborie, Brigadier Hassan Karim Conteh, Colonel Samuel Francis Koroma, Major Kula Samba and Colonel Abdul Karim Sesay—were executed by firing squad after they were convicted in a [[court martial]] in Freetown, some for orchestrating the 1997 coup that overthrew President Kabbah and others for failure to reverse the mutiny.

In October 1999, the United Nations agreed to send [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]] to help restore order and disarm the rebels. The first of the 6,000-member force began arriving in December, and the [[UN Security Council]] voted in February 2000 to increase the force to 11,000, and later to 13,000. But in May, when nearly all [[]]n forces had left and UN forces were trying to disarm the RUF in eastern , [[Foday Sankoh|Sankoh]]'s forces clashed with the UN troops, and some 500 peacekeepers were taken [[hostage]] as the peace accord effectively collapsed. The hostage crisis resulted in more fighting between the RUF and the government as UN troops launched [[Operation Khukri]] to end the siege.

The situation in the country deteriorated to such an extent that British troops were deployed in [[Operation Palliser]], originally simply to evacuate foreign nationals. But the British exceeded their original mandate and took full military action to defeat the rebels and restore order. The British were the catalyst for the ceasefire that ended the civil war. Elements of the [[British Army]], together with administrators and politicians, remained after withdrawal to help train the armed forces, improve the country's infrastructure, and administer financial and material aid. [[Tony Blair]], the Prime Minister of Britain at the time, is regarded as a hero by the people of .

Between 1991 and 2001, about [[List of wars by death toll|50,000 people were killed]] in 's civil war. Hundreds of thousands of people were forced from their homes and many became refugees in [[]] and [[]]. In 2001, UN forces moved into rebel-held areas and began to disarm rebel soldiers. By January 2002, the war was declared over. In May 2002, Kabbah was reelected president by a landslide. By 2004, the disarmament process was complete. Also in 2004, a UN-backed [[war crime]]s court began holding trials of senior leaders from both sides of the war. In December 2005, UN peacekeeping forces pulled out of .
