During the [[last glacial period]], and until about 16,000 BC, much of  was periodically covered in ice. The [[relative sea level]] was less than 50&nbsp;m lower resulting in an [[ice bridge]] (but not a [[land bridge]]) forming between  and Great Britain. By 14,000 BC this ice bridge existed only between Northern  and Scotland and by 12,000 BC  was completely separated from Great Britain. Later, around 6,100 BC, Great Britain became separated from continental Europe. Until recently, the earliest evidence of human activity in  was dated at 12,500 years ago, demonstrated by a butchered bear bone found in a cave in [[County Clare]]. In 2021, a reindeer bone with chop marks, which had been found in Castlepook Cave near [[Doneraile]], County Cork in the early twentieth century during [[Richard J. Ussher]]'s excavations, was dated to 33,000 years ago by Dr Ruth Carden a [[paleozoologist]] from the School of Archaeology in [[University College Dublin]], pushing back the earliest signs of human activity by 20,000 years.

By about 8,000 BC, more sustained occupation of the island has been shown, with evidence for [[Mesolithic]] communities around the island.

Some time before 4,000 BC, [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] [[Early European Farmers|settlers]] introduced cereal [[cultivar]]s, domesticated animals such as cattle and sheep, built large timber buildings, and stone monuments. The earliest evidence for farming in  or Great Britain is from [[Ferriter's Cove]], [[County Kerry]], where a flint knife, cattle bones and a sheep's tooth were [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon-dated]] to {{circa|4,350 BC}}. Field systems were developed in different parts of , including at the {{lang|ga|[[Céide Fields]]}}, that has been preserved beneath a blanket of peat in present-day [[Tyrawley]] in northwest Mayo.  An extensive [[field system]], arguably the oldest in the world, consisted of small divisions separated by [[dry-stone wall]]s. The fields were farmed for several centuries between 3,500 BC and 3,000 BC. [[Wheat]] and [[barley]] were the principal crops.

The [[Bronze Age]] began around 2,500 BC, with technology changing people's everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the wheel, harnessing [[oxen]], [[weaving|weaving textiles]], brewing [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[metalworking]], which produced new weapons and tools, along with fine gold decoration and jewellery, such as [[brooch]]es and [[torc]]s.

=== Celts ===
How and when the island became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the [[Celts]] being one of the more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. The most recent genetic research strongly associates the spread of [[Indo-European languages]] (including [[Celtic languages|Celtic]]) through Western Europe with a people bringing a composite [[Bell Beaker culture]], with its arrival in Britain and  dated to around the middle of the third millennium BC. According to [[John T. Koch]] and others,  in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading culture called the [[Atlantic Bronze Age]] that also included Britain, western  and Iberia, and that this is where Celtic languages developed. This contrasts with the traditional view that their origin lies in mainland Europe with the [[Hallstatt culture]].

[[File:Uragh Stone Circle.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Uragh Stone Circle|The Uragh Stone Circle]], a [[Neolithic]] [[stone circle]] in [[Tuosist]], close to Gleninchaquin Park, [[County Kerry]]]]
The long-standing traditional view is that the Celtic language, [[Ogham]] script and culture were brought to  by waves of invading or migrating Celts from mainland Europe. This theory draws on the ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'', a medieval Christian pseudo-history of , along with the presence of Celtic culture, language and artefacts found in  such as Celtic bronze spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of . The [[Priteni]] were said to be the first, followed by the [[Belgae]] from northern [[Gaul]] and Britain. Later, [[Laigin|Laighin]] tribes from [[Armorica]] were said to have invaded  and Britain more or less simultaneously. Lastly, the [[Milesians ()|Milesians]] ([[Gaels]]) were said to have reached  from either northern Iberia or southern Gaul. It was claimed that a second wave named the Euerni, belonging to the Belgae people of northern Gaul, began arriving about the 6th century BC. They were said to have given their name to the island.

The theory was advanced in part because of the lack of archaeological evidence for large-scale Celtic immigration, though it is accepted that such movements are notoriously difficult to identify. Historical linguists are skeptical that this method alone could account for the absorption of Celtic language, with some saying that an assumed processual view of Celtic linguistic formation is 'an especially hazardous exercise'. Genetic lineage investigation into the area of Celtic migration to  has led to findings that showed no significant differences in [[mitochondrial DNA]] between  and large areas of continental Europe, in contrast to parts of the Y-chromosome pattern. When taking both into account, a study concluded that modern Celtic speakers in  could be thought of as European "Atlantic Celts" showing a shared ancestry throughout the Atlantic zone from northern Iberia to western Scandinavia rather than substantially central European.
In 2012, research showed that the occurrence of genetic markers for the earliest farmers was almost eliminated by Beaker-culture immigrants: they carried what was then a new Y-chromosome R1b marker, believed to have originated in Iberia about 2,500 BC. The prevalence amongst modern  men of this mutation is a remarkable 84%, the highest in the world, and closely matched in other populations along the Atlantic fringes down to . A similar genetic replacement happened with lineages in mitochondrial DNA. This conclusion is supported by recent research carried out by the geneticist [[David Reich (geneticist)|David Reich]], who says: "British and  skeletons from the Bronze Age that followed the Beaker period had at most 10 per cent ancestry from the first farmers of these islands, with other 90 per cent from people like those associated with the Bell Beaker culture in the ." He suggests that it was Beaker users who introduced an Indo-European language, represented here by Celtic (i.e. a new language and culture introduced directly by migration and genetic replacement).

===Late antiquity and early medieval times===
{{Main|History of  (800–1169)}}

[[File:Dalriada.png|right|thumb|upright=0.75|The [[Scoti]] were [[Gaels|Gaelic]]-speaking people from  who settled in western Scotland in the 6th century or before.]]
The earliest written records of  come from classical [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] geographers. [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' refers to  as ''Mikra Brettania'' ("Little Britain"), in contrast to the larger island which he called ''Megale Brettania'' ("Great Britain"). In [[Ptolemy's map of |his map of ]] in his later work, ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', Ptolemy refers to  as ''[[Hibernia|Iouernia]]'' and to Great Britain as ''Albion''. These names were likely to have been the local names for the islands at the time. The earlier names, [[Exonym and endonym|in contrast]], were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made.

The [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] referred to  by this name too in its [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] form, ''Hibernia'', or [[Scotia]]. Ptolemy records 16 nations inhabiting every part of  in 100 AD. The relationship between the Roman Empire and the kingdoms of ancient  is unclear. However, finds of Roman coins have been made, for example at the Iron Age settlement of Freestone Hill near [[Gowran]] and [[Newgrange]].

 continued as a patchwork of rival kingdoms; however, beginning in the 7th century, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through the concept of a [[High King of ]]. [[Medieval  literature]] portrays an almost unbroken sequence of high kings stretching back thousands of years, but some modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.

All of the  kingdoms had their own kings but were nominally subject to the high king. The high king was drawn from the ranks of the provincial kings and ruled also the royal [[kingdom of Meath]], with a ceremonial capital at the [[Hill of Tara]]. The concept did not become a political reality until the [[Viking Age#|Viking Age]] and even then was not a consistent one.  did have a culturally unifying rule of law: the early written judicial system, the [[Brehon Laws]], administered by a professional class of jurists known as the ''brehons''.

''[[The Chronicle of ]]'' records that in 431, Bishop [[Palladius (bishop of )|Palladius]] arrived in  on a mission from [[Pope Celestine I]] to minister to the  "already believing in Christ". The same chronicle records that [[Saint Patrick]], 's best known [[Patron saints of places|patron saint]], arrived the following year. There is continued debate over the missions of Palladius and Patrick, but the consensus is that they both took place and that the older [[druid]] tradition collapsed in the face of Christianity.  Christian scholars excelled in the study of Latin and  learning and Christian theology. In the monastic culture that followed the Christianisation of , Latin and  learning was preserved in  during the [[Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]] in contrast to elsewhere in Western Europe, where the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]] followed the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]].{{page needed|date=October 2019}}

[[File:KellsFol032vChristEnthroned.jpg|thumb|right|A folio of the [[Book of Kells]] showing Christ enthroned]]
The arts of [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]], metalworking and sculpture flourished and produced treasures such as the ''[[Book of Kells]]'', ornate jewellery and the many carved stone crosses that still dot the island today. A mission founded in 563 on [[Iona]] by the  monk Saint [[Columba]] began [[Hiberno- mission|a tradition of  missionary]] work that spread [[Celtic Christianity]] and learning to Scotland, England and the [[Frankish Empire]] on continental Europe after the fall of Rome. These missions continued until the [[late Middle Ages]], establishing monasteries and centres of learning, producing scholars such as [[Sedulius Scottus]] and [[Johannes Eriugena]] and exerting much influence in Europe.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

From the 9th century, waves of [[Viking]] raiders plundered  monasteries and towns. These raids added to a pattern of raiding and [[endemic warfare]] that was already deep-seated in . The Vikings were involved in establishing most of the major coastal settlements in : [[Dublin]], [[Limerick]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Wexford]], [[Waterford]], as well as other smaller settlements.{{unreliable source?|date=October 2019}}

===Norman and  invasions===
{{Main|Anglo-Norman invasion of |History of  (1169–1536)|Tudor conquest of }}

{{See also|Bruce campaign in }}
[[File:Trim Castle 6.jpg|thumb|Remains of the 12th-century [[Trim Castle]] in [[County Meath]], the largest [[Norman architecture|Norman castle]] in ]]
On 1 May 1169, an expedition of [[Cambro-Norman]] knights, with an army of about 600 men, landed at [[Bannow|Bannow Strand]] in present-day [[County Wexford]]. It was led by [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]], known as 'Strongbow' owing to his prowess as an archer. The invasion, which coincided with a period of renewed Norman expansion, was at the invitation of [[Diarmait Mac Murchada|Dermot Mac Murrough]], [[Kings of Leinster|King of Leinster]].

In 1166, Mac Murrough had fled to [[County of Anjou|Anjou]], , following a war involving [[Tighearnán Ua Ruairc]], of [[Breifne]], and sought the assistance of the [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]] King [[King Henry II of England|Henry II]], in recapturing his kingdom. In 1171, Henry arrived in  in order to review the general progress of the expedition. He wanted to re-exert royal authority over the invasion which was expanding beyond his control. Henry successfully re-imposed his authority over Strongbow and the Cambro-Norman warlords and persuaded many of the  kings to accept him as their overlord, an arrangement confirmed in the 1175 [[Treaty of Windsor 1175|Treaty of Windsor]].

The invasion was legitimised by reference to provisions of the alleged [[Papal Bull]] ''[[Laudabiliter]]'', issued by an Englishman, [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]], in 1155. The document apparently encouraged Henry to take control in  in order to oversee the financial and administrative reorganisation of the [[Celtic Church| Church]] and its integration into the Roman Church system. Some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the [[Synod of Kells]] in 1152. There has been significant controversy regarding the authenticity of ''Laudabiliter'', and there is no general agreement as to whether the bull was genuine or a forgery. Further, it had no standing in the  legal system.
[[File: 1450.png|thumb|left|Political boundaries in  in 1450, before the [[plantations of |plantations]]]]

In 1172, Pope [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]] further encouraged Henry to advance the integration of the  Church with Rome. Henry was authorised to impose a tithe of one penny per hearth as an annual contribution. This church levy, called [[Peter's Pence]], is extant in  as a voluntary donation. In turn, Henry assumed the title of [[Lord of ]] which Henry conferred on his younger son, [[John Lackland]], in 1185. This defined the Anglo-Norman administration in  as the [[Lordship of ]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} When Henry's successor, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] died unexpectedly in 1199, [[John of England|John]] inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of . Over the century that followed, Norman feudal law gradually replaced the Gaelic Brehon Law across large areas, so that by the late 13th century the [[Hiberno-Norman|Norman-]] had established a feudal system throughout much of . Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and the seeds of the modern county system. A version of [[Magna Carta]] (the [[Great Charter of ]]), substituting ''Dublin'' for ''London'' and the '' Church'' for, the  church at the time, the ''Catholic Church'', was published in 1216 and the [[Parliament of ]] was founded in 1297.

=== Gaelicisation ===
From the mid-14th century, after the [[Black Death]], Norman settlements in  went into a period of decline. The Norman rulers and the Gaelic  elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the [[Parliament of #Middle Ages| parliament]] passed the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] in 1367. These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into  society by requiring  subjects in  to speak , follow  customs and abide by  law.

By the end of the 15th century, central  authority in  had all but disappeared, and a renewed  culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was again dominant.  Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as [[The Pale]], and under the provisions of [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] of 1494,  Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the [[ Privy Council]].

The title of [[King of ]] was re-created in 1542 by [[Henry VIII]], the then [[King of England]], of the [[Tudor dynasty]].  rule was reinforced and expanded in  during the latter part of the 16th century, leading to the [[Tudor conquest of ]]. A near-complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the 17th century, following the [[Nine Years' War ()|Nine Years' War]] and the [[Flight of the Earls]].

This control was consolidated during the wars and conflicts of the 17th century, including the  and  colonisation in the [[Plantations of ]], the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] and the [[Williamite War in |Williamite War]].  losses during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (which, in , included the [[ Confederacy]] and the [[Cromwellian conquest of ]]) are estimated to include 20,000 battlefield casualties. 200,000 civilians are estimated to have died as a result of a combination of war-related famine, displacement, guerrilla activity and pestilence throughout the war. A further 50,000{{efn|Numbers vary, from a low of 12,000. [[Giovanni Battista Rinuccini]] wrote 50,000, T. N. Burke said 80,000 to 100,000.}} were sent into [[indentured servitude]] in the [[West Indies]]. Physician-general [[William Petty]] estimated that 504,000 Catholic  and 112,000 Protestant settlers died, and 100,000 people were transported, as a result of the war. If a prewar population of 1.5 million is assumed, this would mean that the population was reduced by almost half.

The religious struggles of the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in . Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the  King and Parliament. After the passing of [[Test Act#Test Act of 1673|the Test Act 1672]], and the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] over the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the  Parliament. Under the emerging [[Penal Laws ()|Penal Laws]],  Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various civil rights, even the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed in 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists. The new Anglo- ruling class became known as the [[Protestant Ascendancy]].

[[File:Hanging.gif|thumb|upright|[[Half-hanging]] of suspected [[United Irishmen]]]]
The "[[ Famine (1740–1741)#Cause|Great Frost]]" struck  and the rest of Europe between December 1739 and September 1741, after a decade of relatively mild winters. The winters destroyed stored crops of potatoes and other staples, and the poor summers severely damaged harvests.{{page needed|date=October 2019}} This resulted in the [[ Famine (1740–1741)|famine of 1740]]. An estimated 250,000 people (about one in eight of the population) died from the ensuing pestilence and disease. The  government halted export of corn and kept the army in quarters but did little more. Local gentry and charitable organisations provided relief but could do little to prevent the ensuing mortality.

In the aftermath of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared in the latter part of this century and the [[ architecture|architectural legacy of ]]  was built. In 1782, [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] was repealed, giving  legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of  without the consent of the  parliament.

===1798 Rebellion===
{{Main| Rebellion of 1798}}

[[File:MAXWELL(1845) p130 Camp on Vinegar Hill.jpg|thumb|right|"The Camp on Vinegar Hill" - an illustration by [[George Cruikshank]] to accompany [[William Hamilton Maxwell]]'s 1845 work ''History of the  rebellion in 1798'']]

In 1798, members of the Protestant Dissenter tradition (mainly [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the [[Society of United Irishmen]], with the aim of creating an independent . Despite assistance from  the [[ Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] was put down by British and  government and yeomanry forces. The rebellion lasted from the 24th of May to the 12th of October that year and saw the establishment of the short lived [[ Republic (1798)]] in the province of [[Connacht]]. It saw numerous battles across the island with an estimated 30,000 people dead.{{citation needed|date=November 2024}}

===Union with Great Britain===
{{Main| of Great Britain and }}

As a direct result of the 1798 rebellion in its aftermath in 1800, the British and  parliaments both passed [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the [[Kingdom of ]] and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] to create a [[ of Great Britain and ]].

The passage of the Act in the  Parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities, having failed on the first attempt in 1799. According to contemporary documents and historical analysis, this was achieved through a considerable degree of bribery, with funding provided by the British Secret Service Office, and the awarding of peerages, places and honours to secure votes. Thus, the parliament in  was abolished and replaced by a [[Parliament of the |united parliament at Westminster]] in London, though resistance remained, as evidenced by [[Robert Emmet]]'s failed [[ Rebellion of 1803]].

Aside from the development of the [[linen]] industry,  was largely passed over by the [[Industrial Revolution]], partly because it lacked coal and iron resources and partly because of the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw  as a source of agricultural produce and capital.

[[File:(1891) p118 THE FAMINE AT BOFIN.jpg|thumb|A depiction of the [[Great Famine ()|Great Famine]] from ''Our Boys in '' by Henry Willard  (1891)]]
The [[Great Famine ()|Great Famine]] of 1845–1851 devastated , as in those years 's population fell by one-third. More than one million people died from starvation and disease, with an additional million people emigrating during the famine, mostly to the  and . In the century that followed, an economic depression caused by the famine resulted in a further million people emigrating. By the end of the decade, half of all [[immigration to the ]] was from . The period of civil unrest that followed until the end of the 19th century is referred to as the [[Land War]]. Mass emigration became deeply entrenched and the population continued to decline until the mid-20th century. Immediately prior to the famine the population was recorded as 8.2 million by the [[1841 census of |1841 census]]. The population has never returned to this level since. The population continued to fall until 1961; [[County Leitrim]] was the final  county to record a population increase post-famine, in 2006.

The 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of modern [[ nationalism]], primarily among the Roman Catholic population. The pre-eminent  political figure after the Union was [[Daniel O'Connell]]. He was elected as Member of Parliament for [[Ennis (UK Parliament constituency)|Ennis]] in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat [[The Test Act|as a Roman Catholic]]. O'Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the Prime Minister, the -born soldier and statesman, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. Steering the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Bill]] through Parliament, aided by future prime minister [[Robert Peel]], Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant [[George IV of the |George IV]] to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. [[George III|George's father]] had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]], to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing [[Catholic Emancipation]] to be in conflict with the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].

Daniel O'Connell led a subsequent campaign, for the repeal of the Act of Union, which failed. Later in the century, [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or "[[ Home Rule Bills|Home Rule]]". Unionists, especially those located in Ulster, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests. After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914. To prevent this from happening, the [[Ulster Volunteers]] were formed in 1913 under the leadership of [[Edward Carson]].

Their formation was followed in 1914 by the establishment of the [[ Volunteers]], whose aim was to ensure that the [[Third Home Rule Act|Home Rule Bill]] was passed. The Act was passed but with the "temporary" exclusion of the six counties of Ulster, which later became Northern . Before it could be implemented, however, the Act was suspended for the duration of the [[First World War]]. The  Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under [[John Redmond]], took the name [[National Volunteers]] and supported [[ and World War I| involvement]] in the war. A minority, approximately 13,000, retained the  Volunteers' name and opposed 's involvement in the war.

[[File:Sackville Street (Dublin) after the 1916 Easter Rising.JPG|thumb|Sackville Street (now [[O'Connell Street]]), Dublin, after the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]]]
The [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 was carried out by the latter group together with a smaller socialist militia, the [[ Citizen Army]]. The British response, executing 15 leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people, turned the mood of the country in favour of the rebels. Support for [[Physical force  republicanism| republicanism increased]] further due to the ongoing war in Europe, as well as the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]].

The pro-independence republican party, [[Sinn Féin]], received overwhelming endorsement in the [[1918  general election|general election of 1918]], and in 1919 proclaimed an [[ Republic]], setting up its own parliament ({{lang|ga|[[First Dáil|Dáil Éireann]]}}) and government. Simultaneously the Volunteers, which became known as the [[ Republican Army]] (IRA), launched a [[ War of Independence|three-year guerrilla war]], which ended in a truce in July 1921 (although violence continued until June 1922, mostly in Northern ).

===Partition===
{{Main|Partition of }}

In December 1921, the [[Anglo- Treaty]] was concluded between the British government and representatives of the [[Second Dáil]]. It gave  complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed [[Northern ]] to remain within the , which it immediately exercised. Additionally, Members of the [[Third Dáil|Free State Parliament]] were required to swear [[Oath of Allegiance ()|an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the  Free State]] and make a statement of faithfulness to the king. Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent [[ Civil War]] between the new government of the [[ Free State]] and those opposed to the treaty, led by [[Éamon de Valera]]. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.

====Independence====
{{main|History of the Republic of |Economy of the Republic of }}

[[File:Anglo- Treaty Griffith annotated2.gif|thumb|Annotated page from the [[Anglo- Treaty]] that established the [[ Free State]] and independence for 26 out of 32 [[Counties of | counties]]]]
During its first decade, the newly formed  Free State was governed by the victors of the civil war. When de Valera achieved power, he took advantage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] and [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|political circumstances]] to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government. The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted. This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence. However, it was not until 1949 that the state was declared, officially, to be the [[Republic of ]].

[[ neutrality|The state was neutral]] during [[The Emergency ()|World War II]], but offered [[ neutrality during World War II|clandestine assistance to the Allies]], particularly in the potential defence of Northern . Despite their country's neutrality, approximately 50,000 volunteers from independent  joined the British forces during the war, four being awarded [[Victoria Crosses]].

The [[Abwehr| intelligence]] was also active in . Its operations ended in September 1941 when [[Garda Síochána|police]] made arrests based on surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in Dublin. To the authorities, counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence. With a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand men at the start of the war, and with limited supplies of modern weapons, the state would have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side in the conflict.

Large-scale emigration marked most of the post-WWII period (particularly during the 1950s and 1980s), but beginning in 1987 the economy improved, and the 1990s saw the beginning of substantial economic growth. This period of growth became known as the [[Celtic Tiger]]. The Republic's real GDP grew by an average of 9.6% per annum between 1995 and 1999, in which year the Republic joined the [[euro]]. In 2000, it was the sixth-richest country in the world in terms of GDP per capita. Historian [[R. F. Foster (historian)|R. F. Foster]] argues the cause was a combination of a new sense of initiative and the entry of  corporations. He concludes the chief factors were low taxation, pro-business regulatory policies, and a young, tech-savvy workforce. For many multinationals, the decision to do business in  was made easier still by generous incentives from the [[IDA |Industrial Development Authority]]. In addition [[European Union]] membership was helpful, giving the country lucrative access to markets that it had previously reached only through the , and pumping huge subsidies and investment capital into the  economy.

Modernisation brought secularisation in its wake. The traditionally high levels of religiosity have sharply declined. Foster points to three factors: First,  feminism, largely imported from America with liberal stances on contraception, abortion and divorce, undermined the authority of bishops and priests. Second, the mishandling of the paedophile scandals humiliated the Church, whose bishops seemed less concerned with the victims and more concerned with covering up for errant priests. Third, prosperity brought hedonism and materialism that undercut the ideals of saintly poverty.

The [[post-2008  economic downturn]] dramatically ended this period of boom. GDP fell by 3% in 2008 and by 7.1% in 2009, the worst year since records began (although earnings by foreign-owned businesses continued to grow). The state has since experienced deep recession, with unemployment, which doubled during 2009, remaining above 14% in 2012.

====Northern ====
{{Main|History of Northern |Economy of Northern }}

Northern  resulted from the division of the  by the [[Government of  Act 1920]], and until 1972 was a self-governing jurisdiction within the  with its own parliament and prime minister. Northern , as part of the , was not neutral during the Second World War, and [[Belfast Blitz|Belfast suffered four bombing raids]] in 1941. [[Conscription]] was not extended to Northern , and roughly an equal number volunteered from Northern  as volunteered from the Republic of .

[[File:Carson signing Solemn League and Covenant.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Carson]] signing the [[Ulster Covenant|Solemn League and Covenant]] in 1912, declaring opposition to [[ Home Rule bills|Home Rule]] "using all means which may be found necessary"]]

Although Northern  was largely spared the strife of the civil war, in the decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter-communal violence. Nationalists, mainly Roman Catholic, wanted to unite  as an independent republic, whereas unionists, mainly Protestant, wanted Northern  to remain in the . The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern  voted largely along [[sectarian]] lines, meaning that the government of Northern  (elected by [[Plurality electoral system|"first-past-the-post"]] from 1929) was controlled by the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as [[gerrymandering]] and discrimination in housing and employment.

In the late 1960s, nationalist grievances were aired publicly in mass civil rights protests, which were often confronted by [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] counter-protests. The government's reaction to confrontations was seen to be one-sided and heavy-handed in favour of unionists. Law and order broke down as unrest and inter-communal violence increased. The Northern  government requested the [[British Army]] to aid the police and protect the [[ Nationalist]] population. In 1969, the paramilitary [[Provisional  Republican Army|Provisional IRA]], which favoured the creation of a [[united ]], emerged from a split in the [[ Republican Army (1922–1969)| Republican Army]] and began a campaign against what it called the "British occupation of the six counties".{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

Other groups, both the unionist and nationalist participated in violence, and a period known as "[[the Troubles]]" began. More than 3,600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict. Owing to the civil unrest during the Troubles, the British government suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed [[Direct rule over Northern |direct rule]]. There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the [[Good Friday Agreement]] was concluded as a treaty between the British and  governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks.

The substance of the Agreement (formally referred to as the Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of . The Agreement restored self-government to Northern  on the basis of power-sharing in a regional [[Northern  Executive|Executive]] drawn from the major parties in a new [[Northern  Assembly]], with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]] drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994, and in 2005, the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning|independent commission]] supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.

The Assembly and power-sharing Executive were suspended several times but were restored again in 2007. In that year the British government officially ended its military support of the police in Northern  ([[Operation Banner]]) and began withdrawing troops. On 27 June 2012, Northern 's deputy first minister and former IRA commander, [[Martin McGuinness]], shook hands with Queen Elizabeth II in Belfast, symbolising reconciliation between the two sides.
