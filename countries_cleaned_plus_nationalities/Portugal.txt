The region has been inhabited by humans since circa 400,000 years ago, when [[Homo heidelbergensis]] entered the area. The oldest human fossil found in  is the 400,000-year-old ''[[Aroeira 3]]'' ''H. Heidelbergensis'' skull discovered in the [[Cave of Aroeira]] in 2014. Later [[Neanderthal]]s roamed the northern Iberian peninsula and a tooth has been found at Nova da Columbeira cave in [[Estremadura Province (1936–76)|Estremadura]]. [[Homo sapiens sapiens]] arrived in  around 35,000 years ago and spread rapidly, with the earliest signs of [[Human settlement|settlement]] dating to 5500 BC. Pre-Celtic tribes inhabited . The [[Cynetes]] developed a written language, leaving [[stelae]], which are mainly found in the south.

The [[Lusitanians]] were an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]-speaking people living in the far west of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], in present-day central  and regions of Western [[]]. 
It is uncertain whether the Lusitanians were Celticized Iberians, representatives of the ancient [[Beaker Culture]] (with Proto-Lusitanian tribes possibly originating from [[Gallia Belgica]]) or Celts, related to the [[Lusones]].
Early in the first millennium BC, several waves of [[Celts]] arrived in  from Central Europe and intermarried with the local populations to form several different ethnic groups.

The [[Celts|Celtic]] presence and heritage is patent in archaeological and linguistic evidence. They dominated most of northern and central , while the south maintained some of its older character (believed non-Indo-European, likely related to [[Basque language|Basque]]) until the Roman conquest. In southern , some small, semi-permanent commercial outposts were also founded by Mediterranean peoples namely [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[]] and [[Carthaginian Iberia|Carthaginians]] along the coast.

Romans first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC. The Carthaginians, Rome's opponent in the [[Punic Wars]], were expelled from their coastal colonies. During [[Julius Caesar]]'s rule, almost the entire peninsula was annexed to Rome. The conquest took two hundred years and many died, including those sentenced to work in slave mines or sold as slaves to other parts of the empire. The Roman occupation suffered a setback in 155 BC, when a [[Lusitanian War|rebellion]] began in the north. The [[Lusitanians]] and other native tribes, under the leadership of [[Viriathus]], wrested control of all of western Iberia. Rome sent legions to quell the rebellion but were unsuccessful. Roman leaders bribed Viriathus's allies to kill him in 139 BC; he was replaced by [[Tautalus]].

In 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of [[Roman province]]. Later, a northern province was separated from the province of [[Hispania Tarraconensis|Tarraconensis]], under Emperor [[Diocletian]]'s reforms, known as [[Gallaecia]]. There are numerous ruins of castros ([[hill forts]]) and remains of the [[Castro culture]], like the [[Castro of Monte Mozinho|Mozinho]], [[Castro of Zambujal|Zambujal]], [[Castro of Cidadelhe|Cidadelhe]], [[Conímbriga]], [[Miróbriga|Mirobriga]], [[Citânia de Briteiros|Briteiros]] archaeological sites.

=== Germanic kingdoms ===
[[File:Reino suevo.svg|thumb|A map of the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] in the 5th and 6th centuries]]

In 409, with the decline of the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was occupied by [[Germanic tribes]]. In 411, with a federation contract with [[Emperor Honorius]], many of these people settled in [[Hispania]]. An important group was made up of the [[Suebi]], [[Buri tribe|Buri]], [[Vandals]] in [[Gallaecia]], who founded a [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebi Kingdom]] with its capital in [[Braga]]. They came to dominate central , including [[Aeminium]] ([[Coimbra]]) all the way to the [[River Tagus|Tagus]], while the [[Visigoths]] occupied the south.
The [[Suebi]] and the Visigoths were the Germanic tribes who had the most lasting presence in the territories corresponding to modern . As elsewhere in Western Europe, there was a sharp decline in urban life during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]].

Roman institutions disappeared in the wake of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] invasions with the exception of [[ecclesiastical]] organisations, which were fostered by the Suebi in the fifth century and adopted by the Visigoths afterwards. Although the Suebi and Visigoths were initially followers of [[Arianism]] and [[Priscillianism]], they adopted [[Catholicism]] from the local inhabitants. St. [[Martin of Braga]] was a particularly influential evangelist.

In 429, the Visigoths moved south to expel the [[Alans]] and [[Vandals]] and founded a kingdom with its capital in [[Toledo, |Toledo]]. From 470, conflict between the Suebi and Visigoths increased. In 585, the Visigothic King [[Liuvigild]] conquered Braga and annexed Gallaecia; the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was unified under a [[Visigothic Kingdom]]. A new class emerged, unknown in Roman times: a [[nobility]], which played a key social and political role during the [[Middle Ages]]. It was under the Visigoths that the Church began to play an important part within the state. As the Visigoths did not learn Latin from the local people, they had to rely on bishops to continue the Roman system of governance. The laws were made by councils of bishops, and the [[clergy]] emerged as a high-ranking class.

=== Islamic period ===
Today's continental , along with most of modern , was invaded from the South and became part of [[al-Andalus]] between 726 and 1249, following the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. This rule lasted decades in the North, up to five centuries in the South.
[[File:Aljezur-nucleo-urbano-2025-09-msu--1820.jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Aljezur]] castle, in the [[Algarve]] built by the [[Moors]] in the 10th century.]]
After defeating the [[Visigoths]] in a few months, the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula. Beginning in 726, the land that is now  became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of [[Damascus]], until its collapse in 750. That year the west of the empire gained its independence under [[Abd-ar-Rahman I]] with the establishment of the [[Emirate of Córdoba]]. The Emirate became the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] in 929, until its dissolution in 1031, into 23 small kingdoms, called [[Taifa]] kingdoms.

The governors of the taifas proclaimed themselves [[Emir]] of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the Christian kingdoms of the north. Most of present-day  fell into the hands of the [[Taifa of Badajoz]] of the [[Aftasid Dynasty]], and in 1022 the [[Taifa of Seville]] of the [[Abbadids]] poets. The Taifa period ended with the conquest of the [[Almoravids]] in 1086, then by the [[Almohads]] in 1147.
Al-Andaluz was divided into districts called ''Kura''. [[Gharb Al-Andalus]] at its largest consisted of ten kuras, each with a distinct capital and governor. The main cities were in the southern half of the country: [[Beja ()|Beja]], [[Silves Municipality, |Silves]], [[Alcácer do Sal]], [[Santarém, |Santarém]] and [[Lisbon]]. The Muslim population consisted mainly of native Iberian converts to Islam and [[Berbers]]. The Arabs (mainly noblemen from [[]]) although a minority, constituted the elite. The Berbers who joined them, were nomads from the [[Rif Mountains]] of North Africa.

[[File:Siglaspoveirasbase.png|thumb|"Marcas" share similarities with [[bomärken]], in Scandinavia]]
Invasions from the North also occurred in this period, with [[Viking]] incursions raiding the coast between the 9th and 11th centuries, including Lisbon. This resulted in the establishment of small [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlements in the coastline between [[Douro]] and [[Minho Province|Minho]].

One likely Viking cultural heritage is found in the ancient ''Marcas Poveiras'' or [[Siglas Poveiras]]. It is generally accepted that the ''siglas'', also known as ''marcas'', are of [[Scandinavian people|Scandinavian]] origin. Based on numerous similarities initially found at the [[National Museum of |Nationalmuseet]] in [[Copenhagen]], several objects marked with "[[home-marks]]" were also identified in [[Funen]] (also known as [[Fyn]]), [[]]. Further studies revealed that the complex hereditary marking system of Póvoa de Varzim was also present in Fyn. Given the geographical distance, historical Viking incursions along the  coast, and pagan rituals practiced by people from this particular fishing region, it is believed that there is a partial Norse ancestry and cultural legacy.

=== Reconquista ===
{{Main| in the Reconquista}}
[[File:Porto April 2019-18.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.7|A statue of Count [[Vímara Peres]], first [[County of |Count of ]] (868–873)]]
The [[Reconquista]] was a period when Christians reconquered the Iberian Peninsula from [[Moors|Moorish]] domination. An Asturian Visigothic noble named [[Pelagius of Asturias]] was elected leader in 718 by many of the ousted [[Visigoth]] nobles. Pelagius called for the remnants of the Christian Visigothic armies to rebel against the Moors and regroup in the unconquered northern Asturian highlands, known today as the [[Cantabrian Mountains]], in north-west . After defeating the Moors in the [[Battle of Covadonga]] in 722, Pelagius was proclaimed king, thus founding the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and starting the war of Christian reconquest.

At the end of the 9th century, the region of  between the rivers Minho and Douro was reconquered from the Moors by nobleman and knight [[Vímara Peres]] on the orders of King [[Alfonso III of Asturias]]. Finding many towns deserted, he decided to repopulate and rebuild them.

Vímara Peres elevated the region to the status of [[County]], naming it the [[County of ]] after its major port city – ''Portus Cale'' or modern [[Porto]]. One of the first cities he founded is Vimaranes, known today as [[Guimarães]] – "birthplace of the  nation" or the "cradle city".

After annexing the County of  into one of the counties that made up the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], King [[Alfonso III of Asturias]] knighted Vímara Peres, in 868, as the First Count of Portus Cale (). The region became known as ''Portucale'', ''Portugale'', and simultaneously ''Portugália''. With the forced abdication of Alfonso III in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms; they were reunited in 924 under the crown of [[Kingdom of León|León]].

In 1093 [[Alfonso VI of León]] bestowed the county to Henry of Burgundy and married him to his daughter, [[Theresa, Countess of |Teresa of León]]. Henry thus became [[Henry, Count of ]] and based his newly formed county from Bracara Augusta (modern [[Braga]]).

=== Independence ===
{{Main| in the Middle Ages}}
[[File:Museu Arqueológico do Carmo - Lisbon (52750994466).jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|One of the oldest representations of Afonso I, {{Circa|13th century}}]]
At the [[Battle of São Mamede]], in the outskirts of [[Guimarães]], in 1128, [[Afonso I of |Afonso Henriques]], Count of , defeated his mother [[Teresa, Countess of |Countess Teresa]] and her lover [[Fernão Peres de Trava]], establishing himself as sole leader of the [[County of |county]]. Afonso continued his father Henry of Burgundy's Reconquista wars. His campaigns were successful and in 1139, he obtained a victory in the [[Battle of Ourique]], so was proclaimed [[King of ]] by his soldiers. This is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of  became the independent [[Kingdom of ]] and, in 1129, the capital city was transferred from Guimarães to Coimbra. Afonso was recognised as the first king of  in 1143 by King [[Alfonso VII of León]], and in 1179 by [[Pope Alexander III]] as Afonso I of , with the [[papal bull]] ''[[Manifestis Probatum]]''.

Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military [[Christian monasticism|monastic orders]], continued pushing southwards against the Moors. In 1217, during the reign of King [[Afonso II of |Afonso II]],  troops, supported by [[Crusades|crusaders]] and others, retook [[Siege of Alcácer do Sal|Alcácer do Sal]], with further land conquests from the Moors during the reign of [[Sancho II of |Sancho II]], mainly the start of the [[ conquest of the Algarve|conquest of the Algarve]] in 1238. After internal tensions, Sancho II was deposed from the throne and his brother, [[Afonso III of |Afonso III]], became king in 1248. In 1249, the Reconquista ended with the capture of the [[Algarve]], in the aftermath of the [[Siege of Faro (1249)|Siege of Faro]], and the last Moorish settlements were expelled. With minor readjustments, 's territorial borders have remained the same, making it one of the oldest established nations in Europe.

[[File:Treaty of alliance between king Edward III of England and Ferdinand I of , 16th June 1373.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A copy of the [[Anglo- Treaty of 1373]].]]
After a conflict with the [[kingdom of Castile]], [[Denis of ]] signed the [[Treaty of Alcañices]] in 1297 with Ferdinand IV of Castile. This treaty established the border between the kingdoms of  and Leon. During the reign of Denis, the first university in  opened in Lisbon, on March 1, 1290, being then transferred to Coimbra in 1308. Denis died in 1325 and was succeeded by his son, [[Afonso IV of |Afonso IV]], who had a strained relationship with his father that nearly [[Battle of Alvalade|ended in war]]. In 1355, in the aftermath of the assassination of [[Inês de Castro]], [[Peter I of |Peter's I]] lover, a civil war broke between the King, Afonso IV, and his son, and heir, Peter, with peace only being achieved in 1357. The reigns of Denis, Afonso IV, and Peter I mostly saw peace with the other kingdoms of Iberia.

In 1348-49 , as with the rest of Europe, was devastated by the [[Black Death]]. In 1373, , during the reign of [[Ferdinand I of |Ferdinand I]], made an [[Anglo- Alliance|alliance with England]], the oldest standing alliance in the world. This alliance was signed during the [[Fernandine Wars]], a series of conflicts between  and Castile over the right to the throne of Castile. This alliance would be reinforced with the signing of the [[Treaty of Windsor (1386)|Treaty of Windsor]] in 1386.

In 1383 [[John I of Castile]] and [[Beatrice of ]], the only surviving legitimate child of [[Ferdinand I of ]], claimed the throne of . John of Aviz, later [[John I of ]], led a revolt against this claim and defeated the Castilians in the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]], with the [[House of Aviz]] becoming the ruling house. The new ruling dynasty led  to the limelight of European politics and culture. They created and sponsored literature, such as a history of , by [[Fernão Lopes]].

The  explored the [[ Ocean]], established trade routes in most of southern Asia, and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to  ([[Jorge Álvares]]) and  ([[Nanban trade]]). In 1415,  acquired its first colonies by conquering [[Ceuta]], in North Africa. Throughout the 15th century, [[European exploration of Africa#| explorers]] sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts [[Economic history of #Expansion of the  empire (15th and 16th centuries)|for commodities]], ranging from [[gold]] to [[slavery]].  sailed the [[  Armadas]] to Goa via the [[Cape of Good Hope]].

The [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] of 1494 was intended to resolve a dispute created following the return of [[Christopher Columbus]] and divided the newly located lands outside Europe between  and  along a line west of the [[]] islands, off the west coast of Africa. In 1498 [[Vasco da Gama]] became the first European to reach  by sea, bringing [[Economic history of |economic prosperity to ]] and helping to start the [[ Renaissance]]. In 1500, the  explorer [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] reached what is now [[]] and founded the town of [[ Cove-St. Philip's]], one of many [[ colonization of the Americas| colonies of the Americas]].

In 1500, [[Discovery of |Pedro Álvares Cabral landed on ]] and claimed it for . Ten years later, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Goa]] in , [[Muscat, |Muscat]] and [[Ormuz]] in the [[Persian Strait]], and [[Malacca]], now in . Thus, the  empire held dominion over commerce in the  Ocean and South Atlantic.  sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia, landing in [[Taiwan]], , [[Timor]], [[Flores]], and the [[Moluccas]]. Although it was believed the [[ people|]] were the first Europeans to arrive in , there is evidence the [[Theory of the  discovery of | may have discovered it]] in 1521.

Between 1519 and 1522 [[Ferdinand Magellan]] organised a  expedition to the [[East Indies]] which resulted in the first [[circumnavigation]] of the globe. The [[Treaty of Zaragoza]], signed in 1529 between  and , divided the Pacific Ocean between  and .

=== Iberian Union and Restoration ===
{{Main|Iberian Union}}

 voluntarily entered a dynastic union (1580&ndash;1640) because the last two kings of the [[House of Aviz]] ([[Sebastian, King of ]], followed by his grand-uncle [[Henry, King of ]]) died without heirs, resulting in the [[ succession crisis of 1580]]. [[Philip II of ]] claimed the throne, under the pretext that his mother was a  princess, [[Isabella of ]], the second child and first daughter of King [[Manuel I of ]]. Philip II of  was accepted as Philip I of . Yet,  did not lose its formal independence. Instead, a [[Iberian Union|union]] of kingdoms was formed. But the joining of the two crowns deprived  of an independent foreign policy, and led to its involvement in the [[Eighty Years' War]] between  and the .

[[File:Europa -  - Lisboa - Mafra - Palacio.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of Mafra]] built by John V, now a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]]]
War led to a deterioration of relations with [[Anglo- Alliance|'s oldest ally, England]], and the loss of [[Ormus|Hormuz]], a strategic trading post located between [[]] and [[]]. From 1595 to 1663 the [[- War|  War]] primarily involved  companies invading  [[colonies]] and commercial interests in , Africa,  and the Far East, resulting in the loss of 's  sea trade monopoly. 

In 1640 [[John IV of ]] spearheaded an uprising backed by disgruntled nobles and was proclaimed king. The [[ Restoration War]] ended the 60-year period of the Iberian Union under the [[House of Habsburg]]. This was the beginning of the [[House of Braganza]], which reigned until 1910. [[John V of |John V]] saw a reign characterised by the influx of gold into the royal treasury, supplied largely by the [[royal fifth]] (tax on precious metals) from the [[ empire| colonies]] of [[State of |]] and [[State of Maranhão (colonial)|Maranhão]]. Most estimates place the number of  migrants to [[Colonial ]] during the gold rush of the 18th century at 600,000. This represented one of the largest movements of European populations to their colonies, during colonial times.

=== Pombaline era and Enlightenment ===

In 1738 [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo]], later ennobled as 1st [[Marquis of Pombal (title)|Marquis of Pombal]], began a career as the  Ambassador in London, later in Vienna. King [[Joseph I of |Joseph I]] was crowned in 1750 and made him his [[political minister|Minister]] of Foreign Affairs. As the King's confidence in Carvalho e Melo increased, he entrusted him with more control of the state. By 1755, Carvalho e Melo was made prime minister. Impressed by  economic success witnessed as ambassador, he successfully implemented similar [[Economic system|economic]] policies in .

In 1761, during the reign of King José I, he banned the import of black slaves into mainland  and , not for humanitarian reasons, but because they were a necessary work force in . At the same time, he encouraged the trade of black slaves ("the pieces", in the terms of that time) to that colony, and with the support and direct involvement of the Marquis of Pombal, two companies were founded - the ''Companhia do Grão-Pará e Maranhão'' and the ''Companhia Geral de Pernambuco e Paraíba'' - whose main activity was the trafficking of slaves, mostly Africans, to  lands.

He reorganised the army and navy and ended legal discrimination against different [[Christianity|Christian]] sects. He created companies and guilds to regulate commercial activity and one of the first [[appellation|appellation systems]] by demarcating the region for production of [[port wine|Port]] to ensure the wine's quality. This was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He imposed strict law upon all classes of  society, along with a widespread review of the tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes.

Lisbon was struck by a major [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake on 1 November 1755]], magnitude estimated to have been between 7.7 and 9.0, with casualties ranging from 12,000 to 50,000. Following the earthquake, Joseph I gave his prime minister more power, and Carvalho de Melo became an [[Enlightened absolutism|enlightened despot]]. In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination. The [[Marquis of Távora]], several members of his family and even servants were tortured and executed in public with extreme brutality (even by the standards of the time), as alleged part of the [[Távora affair]].

The following year, the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppressed and expelled]]. This crushed opposition by publicly demonstrating even the aristocracy was powerless before Pombal. Further titled "Marquês de Pombal" in 1770, he ruled  until Joseph I's death in 1777. The new ruler, Queen [[Maria I of ]], disliked Pombal because of his excesses, and upon her accession to the throne, withdrew all his political offices. Pombal was banished to his estate at [[Pombal, |Pombal]], where he died in 1782.

Historians argue that Pombal's "enlightenment," while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial exploitation and consolidating personal control, and profit.

During the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic invasions]], the [[Transfer of the  court to | royal family transferred]] the court to [[Rio de Janeiro]], in , making it the capital of the  empire between 1808 and 1821.

In 1820, [[constitutionalist]] insurrections took place at [[Porto]] and Lisbon, and King John VI and his court were forced to return to mainland  in 1821. Lisbon regained its status as the capital of  when  declared its independence in 1822. The death of King [[John VI of |John VI]] in 1826 led to a crisis of royal succession. His eldest son, [[Pedro I of ]], briefly became [[Pedro IV of ]], but neither the  nor  wanted a unified monarchy.

Consequently, Pedro abdicated the  crown in favour of his 7-year-old daughter, [[Maria II of |Maria da Glória]], on the condition that when she came of age she would marry his brother, [[Miguel I of |Miguel]]. Dissatisfaction at Pedro's constitutional reforms led the "absolutist" faction of landowners and the church to proclaim Miguel king in February 1828. This led to the [[Liberal Wars]], also known as the ''War of the Two Brothers'' or the '' Civil War'', in which Pedro forced Miguel to abdicate and go into exile in 1834 and place his daughter on the throne as Queen [[Maria II of ]].

The government of  quietly accepted the ultimatum and withdrew their forces from the disputed area, leading to a widespread backlash among the  public, who viewed acceptance of the  demands as a humiliation.

On 1 February 1908, King [[Carlos I of |Carlos I]] and his son and heir, [[Luís Filipe, Prince Royal of |Luís Filipe, Prince Royal]], were [[Lisbon Regicide|assassinated]] by Republican and [[Carbonária]] members. Two years later, on 5 October 1910, a [[5 October 1910 revolution|coup d'état]] overthrew the near 800-year-old Monarchy and the Republic was proclaimed. During World War I,  helped the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] fight the [[Central Powers]]; however the war hurt its weak economy.

Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the [[First  Republic]]. Several coups occurred during the First Republic, like the failed [[Monarchy of the North]] coup, but others had success, like the [[December 1917 coup d'état]], which led to the rise of [[Sidónio Pais]] to power. In 1921, the [[Bloody Night (Lisbon, 1921)|''Bloody Night'']] revolt ended in the assassination of the Prime Minister and other high-ranking officials of the Republic.

These conditions led to the [[28 May 1926 coup d'état]] and creation of the National Dictatorship ({{lang|pt-PT|[[Ditadura Nacional]]}}). This in turn led to the right-wing dictatorship of the {{lang|pt-PT|[[Estado Novo ()|Estado Novo]]}} (New State), under [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] in 1933.

 remained neutral in [[World War II]]. From the 1940s to 1960s,  was a founding member of [[NATO]], [[OECD]], the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) and joined the [[United Nations]] in 1955. New economic development projects and relocation of mainland  citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated, with [[ |]] and [[ |]] being the main targets of those initiatives. These actions were used to affirm 's status as a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental]] nation and not a colonial empire.

Pro- residents of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], separated those territories from  rule in 1954. In 1961, [[Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá]]'s annexation by the [[Republic of Dahomey]] was the start of a process that led to the dissolution of the centuries-old  Empire. Another forcible retreat occurred in 1961 when  refused to relinquish [[Goa]]. The  were involved in armed conflict in [[ ]] against the [[ Armed Forces]]. The [[Annexation of Goa|operations resulted in the defeat]] and loss of the remaining  territories in the [[ subcontinent]]. The  regime refused to recognise  sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in the National Assembly until the coup of 1974.

Also in the early 1960s the independence movements in the  provinces of [[ ]], [[ ]], and [[ ]] in Africa, resulted in the [[ Colonial War]] (lasting from 1961 till 1974). The war mobilised around 1.4 million men for military or for civilian support service, and led to large casualties. Throughout the colonial war period  dealt with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by the international community. The authoritarian and conservative Estado Novo regime, tried to preserve the empire.

Salazar governed until 1968, when he suffered a [[brain hemorrhage]], and was replaced by [[Marcelo Caetano]], which raised hopes of a "liberalization" of the Estado Novo regime, called the ''Marcelist Spring'', but those hopes were soon crushed.

=== Carnation Revolution and return to democracy===
{{Main|Carnation Revolution}}

The government and army resisted the [[decolonization]] of its overseas territories until April 1974, when a left-wing military [[coup]] in Lisbon, the Carnation Revolution, led the way for the independence of territories, as well as the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (''[[Processo Revolucionário Em Curso]]''). This period was characterised by power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. By the summer of 1975, the tensions were so high, that the country was on the verge of civil war. Forces connected to the extreme left-wing launched another coup on 25 November, but a military faction, the Group of Nine, initiated a counter-coup.

The Group of Nine emerged victorious, preventing the establishment of a [[communist state]] and ending political instability. The retreat from the overseas territories prompted a mass exodus of  citizens from its African territories. Over one million [[White African# in Africa| refugees]] fled the former  provinces, as white settlers were usually not considered part of the former colonies. By 1975, all  African territories were independent and  held [[1975  Constituent Assembly election|its first democratic elections]] in 50 years.

 continued to be governed by a [[National Salvation Junta]] until the [[1976  legislative election| legislative election of 1976]]. It was won by the [[Socialist Party ()| Socialist Party]] and Mário Soares, its leader, became prime minister. Soares would be prime minister from 1976 to 1978 and 1983 to 1985. Soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution. He initiated the process of accession to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC).

After the transition to democracy,  flipped between [[socialism]] and adherence to the [[neoliberal]] model. [[Land reform]] and [[nationalization|nationalisations]] were enforced; the [[ Constitution]] was rewritten to accommodate socialist and communist principles. Until the revisions of 1982 and 1989, the constitution had references to socialism, the rights of workers, and the desirability of a [[socialist economy]]. 's economic situation after the revolution obliged the government to pursue [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)-monitored stabilisation programmes in 1977–78 and 1983–85.[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 2007, when  held the presidency for the [[European Council]]]] In 1986  alongside , joined the European Economic Community which later became the [[European Union]] (EU). 's economy progressed considerably as a result of [[European Structural and Investment Funds]] and companies' easier access to foreign markets.

's last overseas territory, [[Macau]], was peacefully handed over to  in 1999. In 2002, the independence of [[East Timor]] (Asia) was formally recognised by . In 1995,  started to implement [[Schengen Area]] rules, eliminating border controls with other Schengen members. [[Expo '98]] took place in  and in 1999 it was one of the founding countries of the [[euro]] and [[eurozone]]. In 2004 [[José Manuel Barroso]], the then [[Prime Minister of ]], was nominated [[President of the European Commission]].

On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] entered into force, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union. Economic disruption and an unsustainable growth in [[government debt]] during the [[2008 financial crisis]] led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the [[European Financial Stability Mechanism]] and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]], a loan to help the country stabilise its finances.
