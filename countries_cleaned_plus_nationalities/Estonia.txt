===Prehistory===
[[File:StoneCistGraves.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze age stone-cist graves at [[Rebala Heritage Reserve|Jõelähtme]]]]
Human settlement in  became possible 13,000–11,000 years ago, when the [[glacier]]s of the last [[ice age]] melted. The [[Pulli settlement]], dated around 9000 BC, is the oldest known settlement in . The earliest human habitation during the [[Mesolithic]] period is connected to the [[Kunda culture]]. Around 5300 BC, [[Neolithic]] ceramics of the [[Narva culture]] appear. Next, the [[Comb Ceramic culture]] around 3900 BC brought early agriculture and sophisticated religious art. Starting from around 2800 BC, the [[Corded Ware culture]], which included primitive farming and animal husbandry, appeared. Archaeological estimates place the population within  territory at {{circa|10,000}} inhabitants in 2000 BC.

The first [[hillfort]] settlements were established during the [[Nordic Bronze Age]]. A transition from hunter-fisher subsistence to single-farm-based settlement started around 1000 BC, and was complete by around 500 BC. The large amount of bronze objects indicate active communication with neighbouring [[Germanic tribes]]. During the [[Iron Age Europe|Iron Age]], the local iron production began around 200 BC; north , particularly the coastal region of [[Virumaa]], emerged as a trade hub. North  settlers gradually moved into nearby areas in the Baltic Sea region, spreading [[Proto-Finnic language]]. In the 4th century AD, [[Goths|Gothic]] ruler [[Ermanaric]] claimed to have subjugated the territories corresponding to , but there is no archaeological evidence to support this. The [[Late Antique Little Ice Age|Little Ice Age]] in 6th–7th centuries AD, is starkly evident in the archaeological record, with a sharp drop in the number of sites and grave finds, indicating a severe population decline and slow recovery. Similar patterns appear in the surrounding regions.

===The Viking Age===
The  coast and nearby Baltic Sea islands were a trade hub located on a major waterway which made these areas both a target and a starting point for many raids already prior to the [[Viking Age in ]]. Coastal , particularly the [[Oeselians|Saaremaa islanders]], adopted a [[Vikings|Viking]] lifestyle. Several Scandinavian sagas referred to major confrontations with , notably when 7th century " Vikings" defeated and killed [[Ingvar Harra]], the [[Yngling|King]] of [[Swedes (tribe)|Swedes]]. In {{circa|1030}}, Grand Prince [[Yaroslav the Wise]] of [[Kievan Rus]] attempted to subjugate the [[Chud]]s (as East Slavic sources called  and related Finnic tribes) in southeast  and captured Tartu. Chuds (''Sosols'') destroyed this foothold in 1061. In 1187, , [[Curonians]] and [[Karelians]] sacked [[Sigtuna]], a major  city at the time.

[[File:Old  counties.png|thumb|left|Pre-Christian independent  counties (''maakond''), {{circa|1200}}]]
 had two regional cultures in this period. Northern and western coastal areas maintained close connections with [[Scandinavia]], while the inland had stronger ties to the [[Balts]] and the [[principality of Pskov]]. Ancient  had a professional warrior caste, while international trade provided nobles wealth and prestige. This era's  burial sites often contain both individual and collective graves, with artefacts like weapons and jewelry reflecting the shared material culture of Scandinavia and Northern Europe. Very little is known about the religious beliefs of medieval  prior to [[Christianization|Christianisation]]. A 1229 [[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia|chronicle]] mentions ''[[Tharapita]]'' as the supreme deity of the islanders of Saaremaa (Ösel). [[Sacred grove]]s, particularly of [[oak]] trees, factored prominently into pagan worship practices.

In the early centuries AD, 's first administrative subdivisions emerged, primarily the parish (: ''kihelkond'') and the county (: ''[[maakond]]''), usually including multiple parishes. Parishes were commonly centred on hill forts, and ruled by local nobles. By the 13th century,  was divided into eight major counties – [[Harjumaa (ancient county)|Harjumaa]], [[Järvamaa]], [[Läänemaa]], [[Revala]], [[Saare County|Saaremaa]], [[Sakala County|Sakala]], [[Ugandi]], and [[Virumaa]] – and several smaller, single-parish counties. Counties operated independently, forming only loose defensive alliances against foreign threats.

===Christianisation and Catholic ===
{{Main|Livonian Crusade|Terra Mariana| }}

[[File:Medieval Livonia 1260.svg|thumb|right| and Livonia after the 12th/13th century [[Northern crusades]]]]
In 1199, Pope [[Innocent III]] declared a [[Livonian Crusade|crusade]] to "defend the Christians of [[Livonia]]". The crusading  [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Swordbrothers]], who had previously subjugated [[Livonians]], [[Latgalians]], and [[Selonians]], started campaigning against  in 1208. The following years saw many raids and counter-raids. In 1217, the  suffered a significant defeat in the [[Battle of St. Matthew's Day|battle]] where their most prominent leader [[Lembitu]], an elder of [[Sakala County|Sakala]], was killed. In 1219, the armies of King [[Valdemar II]] of  defeated  in the [[Battle of Lyndanisse]] (Tallinn), and conquered northern . In the uprising of 1223,  were able to push the  and  invaders out of the whole country, except Tallinn. The crusaders soon resumed their offensive, and in 1227, Saaremaa was the last  county to surrender, and convert to Christianity.

In the 13th century, the newly Christian territory of present-day  and  was named [[Terra Mariana]]; later it became known simply as Livonia. North  became [[ |part of]] the [[Kingdom of ]]. The rest was divided between Swordbrothers and the [[prince-bishop]]s of [[Bishopric of Dorpat|Dorpat]] and [[Bishopric of Ösel–Wiek|Ösel–Wiek]]. In 1236, the Swordbrothers merged into the then larger [[Teutonic Order]] (becoming its regional branch, the "[[Livonian Order]]"). In 1343, a major anti- [[St. George's Night Uprising|uprising]] encompassed north  and Saaremaa. The [[Teutonic Order]] suppressed the rebellion by 1345, and the next year bought the  lands from the king of . The  upper-class minority consolidated their power after the unsuccessful rebellion. For the subsequent centuries [[Low ]] remained the language of the ruling elite in both  cities and the countryside.

[[File:Wanradti-Koelli katekismus, fragment.jpg|thumb|Fragments of the [[Wanradt–Koell Catechism]] (1535), the first book printed in [[ language|]]]]
[[Tallinn]], the capital of [[ ]] founded on the site of Lindanise, adopted the [[Lübeck law]] and received full town rights in 1248. The [[Hanseatic League]] controlled trade on the Baltic Sea, and the four largest cities in  became members: Tallinn, Tartu, [[Pärnu]], and [[Viljandi]]. Protected by stone walls and membership in the Hansa, prosperous cities like Tallinn and Tartu often defied other rulers of the medieval Livonia.

===Reformation and  ===
{{Main| }}
The [[Reformation]] began in central Europe in 1517, and soon spread northward to the Baltic region despite some opposition from the Catholic Teutonic Order. Protestant preaching began actively in Tallinn in 1524, leading the town council to align with the Reformation by the following year. Similar events unfolded in Tartu, where tensions arose with Catholic bishop Johann Blankenfeld, resulting in [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] riots that damaged Catholic churches and monasteries in both cities. By the late 1520s, most  cities and towns had embraced the Reformation. Unlike the cities, rural areas were slower to adopt Protestantism, with Catholic influence persisting during the 1530s. With the Reformation, church services began to be conducted in vernacular language, which initially meant [[Low ]], but already from the 1530s onward the regular religious services were held in . Early -language Protestant texts emerged, including [[Wanradt–Koell Catechism]] in 1535.

In 1558, Tsar [[Ivan the Terrible]] of [[Tsardom of | (Muscovy)]] invaded Livonia, starting the [[Livonian War]]. The Livonian Order was decisively [[Battle of Ergeme|defeated]] in 1560. The majority of Livonia accepted  rule, while Reval and the nobles of Northern  swore loyalty to the  king, and the Bishop of Ösel-Wiek sold his lands to the  king.  forces gradually conquered the majority of Livonia, but in the late 1570s the - and  armies started their own offensives and the bloody war finally ended in 1583 with  defeat. As a result of the war, Northern  became  [[Duchy of  (1561–1721)|Duchy of ]], Southern  became  [[Duchy of Livonia]], and Saaremaa remained under  control. [[List of wars between  and |Wars]] between  and - continued until 1629, when the victorious  acquired south  and northern .  [[Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645)|gained]] Saaremaa from  in 1645. The wars cut the population of  from about 250–270,000 people in the mid-16th century to 115–120,000 in the 1630s.
[[File:Academia Gustaviana.jpg|thumb|''Academia Gustaviana'', now [[University of Tartu]] was founded in 1632 by King Gustavus Adolphus]]
The  era in  was marked by both religious repression and significant reforms. Initially, it brought Protestant [[puritans]] who opposed traditional  beliefs and practices, leading to [[witch trials]] and bans on [[folk music]]. While large parts of rural population remained in [[serfdom]], legal reforms under King [[Charles XI]] strengthened both serfs' and [[free tenant]] farmers' land usage and inheritance rights, resulting in this period's reputation as "The Good Old  Time" in historical memory. King [[Gustav II Adolph]] established [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] in Tartu (which became the university in 1632) and Tallinn. [[Printer (publishing)|Printers]] were established in both towns. The beginnings of the -language public education system appeared in the 1680s, largely owing to [[Bengt Gottfried Forselius|Bengt Forselius]]. The population of  grew rapidly until about 20% of the population died in the [[Great Famine of  (1695–1697)|Great Famine]] of 1695–97.

===In the  Empire===
{{Main|Governorate of |Governorate of Livonia}}
During the 1700–1721 [[Great Northern War]], the [[Tsardom of ]] (Muscovy) conquered the whole of  by 1710. The war and [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague]] again devastated the population of , with the 1712 population estimated at only 150,000–170,000.  administration restored all the political and landholding rights of Baltic . The rights of local farmers reached their lowest point, as serfdom completely dominated agricultural relations during the 18th century. Tsarist regime sought to avoid conflicts with the local nobility, and the Baltic autonomous "special order" remained largely in effect until the late 19th century, marking a distinctive period of localised governance within the  Empire. Although serfdom had been abolished in  in 1816–1819, major reforms improving farmers' rights started only in the mid-19th century.

====National awakening ====
The [[ national awakening]] began in the 1850s as several leading figures started promoting an  national identity among the general populace. Widespread farm buyouts by  and the resulting rapidly growing class of land-owning farmers provided the economic basis for the formation of this new " identity". In 1857, [[Johann Voldemar Jannsen]] started publishing the first successful -language weekly newspaper, and began popularising the denomination of oneself as ''eestlane'' ().  The first nationwide movements formed, such as a campaign to establish an -language secondary school, the founding of the [[Society of  Literati]] and the [[ Students' Society]], and the first [[ Song Festival|national song festival]], held in 1869 in Tartu. The national [[Epic poetry|epic]] ''[[Kalevipoeg]]'' was published in 1862, and 1870 saw the first performances of [[Theatre of | theatre]]. In 1878 a major split happened in the national movement. The moderate wing led by [[Jakob Hurt]] focused on development of culture and  education, while the radical wing led by [[Carl Robert Jakobson]] started demanding increased political and economical rights.

In the 1890s, the central government of the  Empire launched a [[Russification]] campaign in order to tie the Baltic governorates more closely to the empire administratively and culturally.  language replaced  and  in most secondary schools and universities, and many societal activities in local languages were suppressed. In the late 1890s, prominent figures like [[Jaan Tõnisson]] and [[Konstantin Päts]] rose in a new surge of nationalism. In the early 20th century,  started taking over their -run town governments.
During the [[1905  Revolution|1905 Revolution]], the first legal  political parties were founded. An  national congress was convened and demanded the unification of  areas into a single autonomous territory and an end to Russification. The unrest was accompanied by both peaceful [[political demonstration|demonstrations]] and violent [[riot]]s. The Tsarist government responded with a brutal crackdown; some 500 people were executed and hundreds more jailed or deported to Siberia.

===World War I and independence===
{{Main| Declaration of Independence| War of Independence|History of #Interwar period (1920–1939)}}
In 1917, following the [[February Revolution]] collapse of monarchy, the new [[ Provisional Government]] yielded to popular demand and the two main -speaking governorates were merged into one [[Autonomous Governorate of |autonomous Governorate of ]], and the [[ Provincial Assembly]] was then elected. [[Bolsheviks]] [[Bolshevik coup|seized power]] in  in November 1917, and disbanded the Provincial Assembly. However, the Provincial Assembly established the [[ Salvation Committee|Salvation Committee]], and during the short interlude between  retreat and [[Operation Faustschlag| arrival]], the committee [[ Declaration of Independence|declared the independence of ]] on 24 February 1918, and formed the [[ Provisional Government]]. [[ occupation of  during World War I| occupation]] immediately followed, but after 's capitulation in [[World War I]], they were forced to return power to the  government on 19 November 1918.

On 28 November 1918 the new [[Soviet ]]n government of [[Vladimir Lenin]] launched a military attack against , starting the [[ War of Independence]]. The  [[Red Army]] came within 30&nbsp;km of Tallinn, but in January 1919, the [[ Army]], led by [[Johan Laidoner]], in co-operation with the  navy went on a counteroffensive, ejecting the  Bolshevik forces from  within a few weeks. By the spring of 1919, the  army advanced into neighbouring areas of Soviet  and [[]]. In June 1919,  [[Battle of Cēsis (1919)|defeated]] the [[Baltische Landeswehr| Landeswehr]] which had attempted to dominate . After a Soviet counteroffensive attempt in the [[Narva]] region in late 1919 failed to achieve a breakthrough, the sides agreed to a ceasefire. On 2 February 1920, the [[Treaty of Tartu (–)|Tartu Peace Treaty]] was signed by  and [[Soviet ]], with the latter pledging to permanently give up all sovereign claims to .

[[File:EstConstAssmb.jpg|thumb| Constituent Assembly, opening session on 23 April 1919]] 
In April 1919, the [[ Constituent Assembly]] was elected. They passed a sweeping [[ Land Reform of 1919|land reform]] and adopted a highly [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Constitution of |constitution]], establishing  as a [[Riigikogu|parliamentary]] democracy.  joined the [[League of Nations]] in 1921.  enjoyed rapid economic growth during the interwar period. Land reforms improved the farmers' conditions, but the country also prospered from industrialisation and the development of oil shale mining. With independence, most economic links with  dissolved, but trade rapidly reoriented towards Western markets. 's cultural-autonomy law for ethnic minorities, adopted in 1925, was one of the most liberal of its time.

The [[Great Depression]] strained 's political system, and in 1933 the right-wing [[Vaps movement]] spearheaded a constitutional reform establishing a strong presidency. On 12 March 1934 the acting head of state, [[Konstantin Päts]], extended a state of emergency over the entire country, under the pretext that the Vaps movement had been planning a coup. Päts ruled by decree for several years while parliament did not reconvene ("[[era of silence]]"). The Päts régime was relatively benign compared to other authoritarian régimes in [[Interwar period|interwar]] Europe, never using violence against political opponents. A 1937 referendum adopted a new constitution. In 1938, an election including opposition candidates provided [[1938  parliamentary election|a new bicameral parliament]].  signed non-aggression pacts [[Soviet– Non-Aggression Pact|with the Soviet Union]] in 1932, and [[– Non-Aggression Pact|with ]] in 1939. In 1939,  declared neutrality, but this proved futile in [[World War II]].

===World War II, Soviet and  occupations===
{{Main| in World War II|Occupation of the Baltic states}}

[[File:PlaqueMemorizingEstonianGovernment.jpg|thumb|Ten former  prime ministers and 56 government members were executed or perished in captivity of the Soviet occupation regime after 1940 (memorial plaque at the [[Stenbock House|seat of government]] in [[Toompea]], Tallinn)]]
A week before the outbreak of [[World War II]], on 23 August 1939, [[Nazi ]] and the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. In the pact's [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|secret protocol]] , , , ,  and  were divided between USSR and  into "spheres of influence", with  assigned to the Soviet "sphere". On 24 September 1939, during the [[Soviet invasion of ]], the Soviet dictator [[Joseph Stalin]] presented the  government an ultimatum demanding that  immediately sign a treaty that would allow the USSR to establish military bases in , or else face war. The  government decided to avoid military conflict, and a "[[Soviet– Mutual Assistance Treaty|mutual assistance treaty]]" was signed in Moscow on 28 September 1939, allowing the USSR to establish and operate several military bases in  for 10 years. However, on 16–17 June 1940, the Soviet army invaded and occupied the entire territory of , including the capital Tallinn, facing almost no armed resistance, as the  government considered it hopeless. Following instructions from Stalin, the Soviet occupation forces organized a [[coup d'état]] on 22 June 1940, and installed a new pro-Soviet government. On 6 August 1940,  was annexed by the Soviet Union; the administrative subunit of the USSR from then on was formally named the [[ SSR]]. 

[[File:Victims of Soviet repressions in Kuressaare, , 1941.jpg|thumb|Over 90 civilians were killed by the Soviet naval forces and [[NKVD]] in 1941 in [[Kuressaare]] in one of the largest mass executions during the Soviet occupation of ]]  
The new Stalinist government established a repressive wartime regime in occupied . Many of the country's high-ranking civil and military officials, intelligentsia and industrialists were imprisoned and executed. Soviet terror culminated on 14 June 1941 with [[June deportation|mass deportation]] of around 11,000 people to Soviet . When [[Operation Barbarossa]] (accompanied by  [[Guerilla warfare|guerrilla soldiers]] called "[[Forest Brothers]]") began against the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 in the form of the "[[Summer War]]", around 34,000 young  men were forcibly drafted into the Soviet army (only about half of whom saw any military action, and fewer than 30% survived the war). Soviet [[destruction battalions]] initiated a scorched earth policy. Political prisoners who could not be evacuated from  [[NKVD prisoner massacres|were executed]] by the Soviet [[NKVD]]. Many  went into the forest, starting an anti-Soviet guerrilla campaign. In July 1941,  [[Wehrmacht]] reached south . The USSR [[Soviet evacuation of Tallinn|evacuated Tallinn]] in late August with massive losses, and capture of the  islands was completed by  forces in October.

A puppet [[ Self-Administration]] was established, and [[ occupation of  during World War II|occupied ]] was merged into [[Reichskommissariat Ostland]]. About a thousand [[ Jews]] were [[Holocaust in |killed]] in 1941 and numerous forced labour camps were established.  occupation authorities initially started recruiting men into [[ Legion|volunteer units]], but forced conscription was instituted in 1943, eventually leading to formation of the [[20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st )| Waffen-SS division]]. Thousands of  escaped to , where [[ Infantry Regiment 200|many volunteered]] to fight together with Finns [[Continuation War|against Soviets]].

[[File:Tallinn Old Town after being bombed by the Soviet Air Forces in 1944.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tallinn Old Town]] after [[Bombing of Tallinn in World War II|bombing by the Soviet air force]] (March 1944)]]
The Red Army reached the  borders again in early 1944, but its advance into  was stopped in [[Battle of Narva (1944)|heavy fighting near Narva]] for six months by  forces, including numerous  units. In March, the Soviet Air Force carried out heavy bombing raids [[Bombing of Tallinn in World War II|against Tallinn]] and other  towns. In July, the Soviets started [[Tallinn Offensive|a major offensive]] from the south, forcing the  to abandon mainland  in September, with the  islands being abandoned in November. As  forces were retreating from Tallinn, the last pre-war prime minister [[Jüri Uluots]] [[National Committee of the Republic of |appointed a government]] headed by [[Otto Tief]] in an unsuccessful attempt to restore 's independence. Tens of thousands of  fled westwards from the Soviets.  lost around one fourth of its population through war-related deaths, deportations and evacuations.

The , , , , and the majority of other Western countries [[Stimson Doctrine|considered]] the annexation of  by the Soviet Union illegal. [[State continuity of the Baltic states|Legal continuity]] of the  state was preserved through the [[ government-in-exile|government-in-exile]] and the  [[ Diplomatic Service (1940–91)|diplomatic representatives]] which Western governments continued to recognise. Thousands of  opposing the second Soviet occupation joined a guerrilla movement known as the "[[ partisans|Forest Brothers]]". The armed resistance was heaviest in the first few years after the war, but Soviet authorities gradually wore it down through attrition, and resistance effectively ceased to exist in the mid-1950s. The Soviets initiated a [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|policy of collectivisation]], but as farmers remained opposed to it a campaign of terror was unleashed. In March 1949 about 20,000  [[Operation Priboi|were deported]] to Siberia. Collectivization was fully completed soon afterwards.

The Soviet Union began [[Russification]], with hundreds of thousands of [[ in |]] and people of other [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] nationalities being induced to settle in , which eventually threatened to turn  into a minority in their own land. In 1945  formed 97% of the population, but by 1989 their share of the population had fallen to 62%.  The military presence was pervasive, with closed military zones occupying around one-fifth of the  land and the entire surrounding sea. Access to coastal areas required permits, rendering the  people physically isolated from the world outside the USSR. Economically, heavy industry was strongly prioritised, but this did not improve the well-being of the local population, and caused massive environmental damage through pollution. Living standards under the Soviet occupation kept falling further behind nearby independent .

===Independence restored===
[[File:Balti kett 22.jpg|thumb|left|In the [[Baltic Way]] on 23 August 1989, two million people formed a human chain across three countries in a mass demonstration against the Soviet occupation.]]
The introduction of ''[[perestroika]]'' by the Soviet government in 1987 enabled political activism in , sparking the [[Singing Revolution]], a peaceful movement towards independence. One of the first major acts of resistance was the [[Phosphorite War]], an environmental protest against Soviet plans to establish large phosphate mines in [[Virumaa]]. On 23 August 1987, the [[Hirvepark meeting]] in Tallinn called for the public disclosure of the secret protocols of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact that had led to 's occupation. In 1988, new political movements emerged, including the [[Popular Front of ]], a moderate faction within the independence movement, and the [[ National Independence Party]], which became the first non-communist political party registered in the Soviet Union. The [[Supreme Soviet of the  Soviet Socialist Republic|parliament of Soviet-controlled ]] asserted the primacy of  laws with the [[ Sovereignty Declaration|Sovereignty Declaration]] on 16 November 1988, inspiring similar declarations across other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]]. On 23 August 1989, two million people formed the [[Baltic Way]], a human chain spanning , , and , to demonstrate unity in pursuit of independence.

In 1990, the [[Congress of ]] was formed as the representative body of  citizens. In March 1991, a [[1991  independence referendum|referendum was held]] where 78.4% of voters supported independence, and during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|coup attempt in Moscow]],  [[ restoration of Independence|declared restoration of independence]] on 20 August. Soviet authorities recognised  independence on 6 September, and on 17 September  was admitted into the [[United Nations]]. The last units of the [[ army]] left  in 1994. In 1992 radical economic reforms were launched for switching over to a market economy, including privatisation and currency reform.  foreign policy since independence has been oriented toward [[Western world|the West]], and in 2004  joined both the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]. In 2011,  joined the [[eurozone]] and adopted the EU single currency.
