The islands making up  were formed approximately 30 million years ago due to volcanic activity in deep water along the [[ Line]]. Over time, interactions with seawater and periods of eruption have engendered a wide variety of different igneous and volcanic rocks on the islands with complex assemblages of [[mineral]]s.

=== Arrival of Europeans ===
The islands of  were uninhabited when the  arrived sometime around 1470. The first Europeans to put ashore were [[João de Santarém]] and [[Pêro Escobar]].  navigators explored the islands and decided that they would be good locations for bases to trade with the mainland.

The dates of European arrival are sometimes given as 21 December ([[Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas's Day]]) 1471, for ; and 17 January ([[Anthony the Great|St Antony's Day]]) 1472, for Príncipe, though other sources cite different years around that time. Príncipe was initially named ''Santo Antão'' (" Anthony"), changing its name in 1502 to ''Ilha do Príncipe'' ("Prince's Island"), in reference to the Prince of  to whom duties on the island's sugar crop were paid.

The first successful settlement of  was established in 1493 by [[Álvaro Caminha]], who received the land as a grant from the crown. Príncipe was settled in 1500 under a similar arrangement. Attracting settlers proved difficult, however, and most of the earliest inhabitants were "undesirables" sent from , mostly [[ and  Jews|Sephardic Jews]]. 2,000 Jewish children, eight years old and under, were taken from the Iberian peninsula for work on the sugar plantations. In time, these settlers found the volcanic soil of the region suitable for agriculture, especially the growing of sugar.

By 1515,  had become slave depots for the coastal slave trade centered at [[Elmina]].
The cultivation of sugar was a labour-intensive process and the  began to enslave large numbers of Africans from the continent. In the sugar boom's early stages, property on the islands had little value, with farming for local consumption while the economy relied mainly on the transit of slaves, though already many foodstuffs were imported. When the local landowner Álvaro Borges died in 1504, his cleared land and domesticated animals were sold for only 13,000 réis, about the price of three slaves. According to [[Valentim Fernandes]] around 1506,  had more sugarcane fields than [[Madeira]] "from which they already produce molasses," but the island lacked facilities for industrial sugar production.

==== Economic development in the 16th century ====
 would only become economically noteworthy with the introduction of a water-powered sugar mill in 1515, which soon led to the mass cultivation of sugar: "The fields are expanding and the sugar mills, too. At this time, only two sugar mills are here and another three are being built, counting the mill of the contractors, which is large. Similarly, the necessary conditions exist, such as streams and timber, to be able to build many more. And the [sugar] canes are the biggest I have ever seen in my life."{{Citation needed|reason=who?|date=December 2022}} Sugar [[plantation]]s were organized with slave labor, and by the mid-16th century, the  settlers had turned the islands into Africa's foremost exporter of sugar.

Slaves in  were brought from the [[Slave Coast of West Africa]], the  Delta, the island of Fernando Po, and later from the Kongo and . In the 16th century, the enslaved were imported from and exported to , [[Elmina]], the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], , and the  Americas. In 1510, reportedly 10,000 to 12,000 slaves were imported by . In 1516,  received 4,072 slaves with the purpose of re-exportation. From 1519 to 1540, the island was the center of the slave trade between Elmina and the  Delta. Throughout the early to mid-sixteenth century,  traded in slaves intermittently with  and the Kingdom of Kongo. In 1525  began trafficking slaves to the  Americas, mainly to the Caribbean and . From 1532 to 1536,  sent an annual average of 342 slaves to the [[Antilles]]. Prior to 1580, the island accounted for 75 percent of 's imports, mainly slaves. The slave trade remained a cornerstone of 's economy until after 1600.

The power dynamics of  in the 16th century were surprisingly diverse with the participation of free [[mulatto]][s] and black citizens in governance. Voluntary colonists shunned  for its disease and food shortages, so the  crown deported convicts to the island and encouraged interracial relationships to secure the colony. Slavery was also not permanent, as demonstrated through the 1515 royal decree granting the manumission of African wives of white settlers and their mixed-race children. In 1517, another decree freed the male slaves who had originally arrived on the island with the first colonists. After 1520, a royal charter allowed for property-owning, married, free mulattos to hold public offices. This was followed by a decree in 1546 establishing civil equality between these qualified mulattos and the white settlers, allowing free mulattos and black citizens opportunities for upward mobility and participation in local politics and business. Social divisions led to frequent disputes within the colony's town councils and with the governor and bishop, with constant political instability.

At first, slavery in  was less strict. In the mid-16th century, an anonymous  pilot noted that the slaves were employed as couples, built their own accommodations, and worked autonomously once a week on the cultivation of their own food supply. However, this more relaxed slave system did not last long following the introduction of plantations. Throughout, slaves frequently ran away to the inhospitable mountain forests of the island's interior. Between 1514 and 1527, five percent of slaves that were imported to  escaped, often to starve, though 1531–1535 saw major food shortages even in the plantations. Eventually, the [[Maroon (people)|Maroon people]] developed settlements in the interior known as'' macambos''.

==== Slave rebellions ====
The first signs of slave rebellion began in the 1530s, when the maroon gangs organized to attack plantations, some of which were abandoned. A formal complaint was lodged by local  authorities in 1531 lamenting that too many settlers and black citizens were being killed in the attacks, and that the island would be lost if the problem remained unresolved. In a 1533 'bush war', a 'bush captain' led militia units to suppress the maroons. A significant event in the maroon fight for freedom occurred in 1549, when two men claiming to be free-born were taken in from the ''macambos ''by a wealthy mulatto planter named Ana de Chaves. With the support of de Chaves, the two men petitioned the king to be declared free, and the request was approved. The largest population of maroons coincided with the sugar boom of the mid-16th century, as the plantations teemed with slaves. Between 1587 and 1590, many of the runaway slaves were defeated in another bush war. By 1593, the governor declared the maroon forces almost completely extinguished. Nevertheless, maroon populations kept settlers away from the southern and western regions.

The greatest slave revolt occurred in July 1595, when the government was weakened by disputes between the bishop and the governor. A native slave named [[Rei Amador|Amador]] recruited 5,000 slaves to raid and destroy plantations, sugar mills, and settler houses. Amador's rebellion made three raids on the town and destroyed 60 of the island's 85 sugar mills, but they were defeated by the militia after three weeks. Two hundred slaves were killed in combat, and Amador and the other rebel leaders were executed, while the rest of the slaves were granted amnesty and returned to their plantation. Smaller slave rebellions followed in the 17th and 18th centuries.

==== 18th, 19th and 20th centuries ====
Eventually, competition from sugar-producing colonies in the [[Western Hemisphere]] began to hurt the islands. The large enslaved population also proved difficult to control, with  unable to invest many resources in the effort.{{citation needed|date=July 2024}} Sugar cultivation thus declined over the next 100 years, and by the mid-17th century,  had become primarily a transit point for ships engaged in the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] between continental Africa and the Americas.{{citation needed|date=July 2024}}

In the early 19th century, two new cash crops, coffee and cocoa, were introduced.{{rp|2}} By 1905,  had become the world's largest producer of cocoa, which remains the country's most important crop.

The ''roças'' system, which gave the plantation managers a high degree of authority, led to abuses against the African farm workers. Although  officially abolished slavery in 1876, the practice of forced paid labour continued. ''[[Scientific ]]'' documented in words and pictures the continued use of slaves in  in its 13 March 1897 issue.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

Observations of the [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]] in Príncipe by Sir [[Arthur Eddington]] provided one of the first successful tests of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]].

In the early 20th century, an internationally publicized controversy arose over charges that [[]]n contract workers were being subjected to forced labour and unsatisfactory working conditions. Sporadic labor unrest and dissatisfaction continued well into the 20th century, culminating in an outbreak of riots in 1953 in which several hundred African laborers were killed in a clash with their  rulers. The anniversary of this "[[Batepá Massacre]]" remains officially observed by the government.

By the late 1950s, when other emerging nations across the African continent demanded their independence, a small group of São Toméans formed the [[Movement for the Liberation of ]] (MLSTP), which eventually established its base in nearby [[]]. Picking up momentum in the 1960s, events moved quickly after the overthrow of the [[Marcelo Caetano|Caetano]] dictatorship in  in April 1974.

The new  regime was committed to the dissolution of its overseas colonies. In November 1974, its representatives met with the MLSTP in Algiers and worked out an agreement for the transfer of sovereignty. After a period of transitional government,  achieved independence on 12 July 1975, choosing as the first president the MLSTP Secretary General [[Manuel Pinto da Costa]].

In 1990,  became one of the first African countries to undergo [[Democratization|democratic reform]], and changes to the constitution—including the legalization of opposition political parties—led to elections in 1991 that were non-violent, free, and transparent. [[Miguel Trovoada]], a former prime minister who had been in exile since 1986, returned as an independent candidate and was elected president. Trovoada was re-elected in 's second multiparty presidential election in 1996.

The [[Democratic Convergence Party – Reflection Group|Party of Democratic Convergence]] won a majority of seats in the [[National Assembly of |National Assembly]], with the MLSTP becoming an important and vocal minority party. Municipal elections followed in late 1992, in which the MLSTP won a majority of seats on five of seven regional councils. In early legislative elections in October 1994, the MLSTP won a plurality of seats in the assembly. It regained an outright majority of seats in the November 1998 elections.

===21st century===
In the 2001 presidential elections the candidate backed by the [[Independent Democratic Action]] party, [[Fradique de Menezes]], was elected in the first round and inaugurated on 3 September. Parliamentary elections were held in March 2002. For the next four years, a series of short-lived opposition-led governments was formed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In July 2003, the army seized power for one week, complaining of corruption and that forthcoming oil revenues would not be divided fairly. An accord was negotiated under which President de Menezes was returned to office. In March 2006, the [[Cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]] period ended, when a propresidential coalition won enough seats in National Assembly elections to form a new government.

In the 30 July 2006 [[2006 São Toméan presidential election|presidential election]], Fradique de Menezes easily won a second five-year term in office, defeating two other candidates, [[Patrice Trovoada]] (son of former president Miguel Trovoada) and independent [[Nilo Guimarães]]. Local elections, the first since 1992, took place on 27 August 2006 and were dominated by members of the ruling coalition. On 12 February 2009, a'' [[coup d'état]] ''was attempted to overthrow President Fradique de Menezes. The plotters were imprisoned, but later received a pardon from President de Menezes.

[[Evaristo Carvalho]] became the [[President of ]] in the [[2016 São Toméan presidential election|2016 elections]], after winning over the incumbent President [[Manuel Pinto da Costa]]. President Carvalho is also vice president of the Independent Democratic Action party (ADI). [[Patrice Emery Trovoada]] became prime minister in 2014; he is also the leader of the Independent Democratic Action party (ADI). In December 2018, [[Jorge Bom Jesus]], the leader of the Movimento de Libertação de  e Príncipe-Partido Social Democráta (MLSTP-PSD), was sworn in as new prime minister.

In September 2021, the candidate of the centre-right opposition Independent Democratic Action (ADI), [[Carlos Vila Nova]], won the [[2021 São Toméan presidential election|presidential election]].[[File:Sao Tome WV banner.jpg|thumb|center|550px|A view of ''[[Praia Inhame]]'', [[Caué District]], ]]In September 2022, the opposition Independent Democratic Action (ADI), led by former prime minister [[Patrice Trovoada]], won [[2022 São Toméan legislative election|the election]] over the ruling Movement for the Liberation of Sao Tome and Principe/Social Democratic Party (MLSTP/PSD) of Prime Minister Jorge Bom Jesus. In November of the same year, the government and military thwarted [[2022  coup d'état attempt|an attempted coup d'état]], after Patrice Trovoada was appointed prime minister of  by Carlos Vila Nova.
