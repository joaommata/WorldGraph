[[File:Pottery of Asa Koma.JPG|thumb|upright|Geometric design pottery found in [[Asa Koma]]]]

The [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] region has often been considered a primary crossing point for early hominins following a southern coastal route from [[East Africa]] to [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]].

The  area has been inhabited since the [[Neolithic]]. According to linguists, the first [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations arrived in the region during this period from the family's proposed [[Afroasiatic Urheimat|urheimat]] ("original homeland") in the [[Nile Valley]], or the [[Near East]]. Other scholars propose that the Afroasiatic family developed in situ in the Horn, with its speakers subsequently dispersing from there.

Cut stones dated about 3 million years old have been collected in the area of [[Lake Abbe]]. In the Gobaad plain (between Dikhil and Lake Abbe), the remains of the extinct elephant ''[[Palaeoloxodon recki]]'' were also discovered, visibly butchered using basalt tools found nearby. These remains would date from 1.4 million years BCE. Subsequently, other similar sites were identified as probably the work of ''[[Homo ergaster]]''. An [[Acheulean]] site (from 800,000 to 400,000 years BCE), where [[stone]] was cut, was excavated in the 1990s, in Gombourta, between [[Damerdjog]] and [[Loyada]], 15&nbsp;km south of [[ City]]. Finally, in Gobaad, a ''[[Homo erectus]]'' jaw was found, dating from 100,000 BCE. On [[Ghoubbet-el-Kharab|Devil's Island]], tools dating back 6,000 years have been found, which were used to open shells. In the area at the bottom of [[Ghoubbet-el-Kharab|Goubet]] (Dankalélo, not far from Devil's Island), circular stone structures and fragments of painted [[pottery]] have also been discovered. Previous investigators have also reported a fragmentary maxilla, attributed to an older form of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and dated to c. 250 Ka, from the valley of the Dagadlé Wadi.

Pottery predating the mid-2nd millennium has been found at [[Asa Koma]], an inland lake area on the Gobaad Plain. The site's ware is characterized by punctate and incision geometric designs, which bear a similarity to the Sabir culture phase 1 ceramics from Ma'layba in [[Southern Arabia]]. Long-horned humpless cattle bones have likewise been discovered at Asa Koma, suggesting that domesticated cattle were present by around 3,500 years ago. Rock art of what appear to be antelopes and a giraffe are also found at [[Dorra]] and [[Balho]]. [[Handoga]], dated to the fourth millennium BCE, has in turn yielded obsidian microliths and plain ceramics used by early nomadic pastoralists with domesticated cattle.

The site of Wakrita is a small [[Neolithic]] establishment located on a [[wadi]] in the tectonic depression of Goba'ad in  in the [[Horn of Africa]]. The 2004 excavations yielded abundant ceramics that enabled us to define one Neolithic cultural facies of this [[region]], which was also identified at the nearby site of [[Asa Koma]]. The faunal remains confirm the importance of fishing in Neolithic settlements close to [[Lake Abbe|Lake Abbé]], but also the importance of bovine husbandry and, for the first time in this area, evidence for caprine herding practices. Radiocarbon dating places this occupation at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE, similar in range to Asa Koma. These two sites represent the oldest evidence of herding in the region, and they provide a better understanding of the development of Neolithic societies in this region.

Up to 4000 years BCE, the region benefited from a climate very different from the one it knows today and probably close to the [[Mediterranean climate]]. The water resources were numerous with lakes in Goba'ad, lakes Assal and Abbé larger and resembling real bodies of water. The humans therefore lived by gathering, fishing and hunting. The region was populated by a very rich fauna: [[Felidae|felines]], [[African Buffalo|buffalo]]es, [[elephant]]s, [[rhino]]s, etc., as evidenced, for example, by the bestiary of cave paintings at [[Balho]]. In the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE, few nomads settled around the lakes and practiced fishing and cattle breeding. The burial of an 18-year-old woman, dating from this period, as well as the bones of hunted animals, bone tools and small [[Gemstone|jewels]] have been unearthed. By about 1500 BCE, the climate was already beginning to change, with sources of fresh water becoming more scarce. Engravings show dromedaries (animal of arid zones), some of which are ridden by armed warriors. The sedentary people now returned to a nomadic life. Stone [[tumuli]] of various shapes and sheltering graves dating from this period have been unearthed all over the territory.

=== Antiquity ===
{{main|Land of Punt}}
The earliest recorded ancient  expedition to Punt was organized by [[Sahure]] of the [[Fifth Dynasty of |Fifth Dynasty]] (25th century BC), returning with cargoes of ''antyue'' and Puntites. However, [[gold]] from Punt is recorded as having been in [[]] as early as the time of Pharaoh [[Khufu]] of the [[Fourth Dynasty of |Fourth Dynasty]].

Subsequently, there were more expeditions to Punt in the [[Sixth Dynasty of |Sixth]], [[Eleventh Dynasty of |Eleventh]], [[Twelfth Dynasty of |Twelfth]] and [[Eighteenth Dynasty of |Eighteenth]] dynasties of . In the Twelfth Dynasty, trade with Punt was celebrated in popular literature in the ''[[Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor]]''.

[[File:Three_Puntites.jpg|thumb|The Hatshepsut Punt Relief depicting three men in Puntite dress bearing gifts]]

In the reign of [[Mentuhotep III]] (11th dynasty, ca. 2000 BC), an officer named [[Hannu]] organized one or more voyages to Punt, but it is uncertain whether he personally traveled on these expeditions. Trading missions of the 12th dynasty pharaohs [[Senusret I]], [[Amenemhat II]] and [[Amenemhat IV]] had also successfully navigated their way to and from the mysterious land of Punt.
In the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of ]], [[Hatshepsut]] built a [[Red Sea]] fleet to facilitate trade between the head of the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] and points south as far as Punt to bring mortuary goods to [[Karnak]] in exchange for Nubian gold. Hatshepsut personally made the most famous ancient  expedition that sailed to Punt. Her [[ hieroglyphs|artists revealing]] much about the royals, inhabitants, habitation and variety of trees on the island, revealing it as the "Land of the Gods, a region far to the east in the direction of the sunrise, blessed with products for religious purposes", where traders returned with gold, ivory, [[ebony]], [[incense]], aromatic resins, animal skins, live animals, eye-makeup cosmetics, fragrant woods, and cinnamon. During the reign of [[Hatshepsut|Queen Hatshepsut]] in the 15th century BC, ships regularly crossed the Red Sea in order to obtain [[bitumen]], copper, carved amulets, [[naptha]] and other goods transported overland and down the Dead Sea to Elat at the head of the gulf of Aqaba where they were joined with [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]] coming north both by sea and overland along trade routes through the mountains running north along the east coast of the Red Sea. Together with northern , Somaliland,  and the Red Sea coast of ,  is considered the most likely location of the territory known to the [[Ancient ]]ians as ''[[Land of Punt|Punt]]'' (or ''Ta Netjeru'', meaning "God's Land"). The first mention of the Land of Punt dates to the 25th century BC. The Puntites were a nation of people who had close relations with Ancient  during the reign of the 5th dynasty Pharaoh [[Sahure]] and the 18th dynasty Queen [[Hatshepsut]]. According to the temple murals at [[Deir el-Bahari]], the Land of Punt was ruled at that time by King Parahu and Queen Ati.

===Introduction of Islam and the Middle Ages===
{{main|Adal (historical region)|Ifat Sultanate|Adal Sultanate}}

The ''Adal'' (also ''Awdal'', ''Adl'', or ''Adel'') was centered around [[Zeila]], its capital. It was established by the local [[|]] clans in the early 9th century. Zeila attracted merchants from around the world, contributing to the wealth of the city. Zeila is an ancient city and it was one of the earliest cities in the world to embrace [[Islam]], shortly after the [[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]. [[Masjid al-Qiblatayn ()|Masjid al-Qiblatayn]] dates to the 7th century, and is the oldest mosque. In the late 9th century, [[Al-Yaqubi]], an Arab Muslim scholar and traveler, wrote that the Kingdom of Adal was a small wealthy kingdom and that Zeila served as the headquarters for the kingdom, which dated back to the beginning of the century.

[[File:YagbeaSionBattlingAdaSultan.JPG|thumb|The Sultan of [[Adal (historical region)|Adal]] (right) and his troops battling King [[Yagbe'u Seyon of |Yagbea-Sion]] and his men depicted in [[Livre des merveilles (BNF Fr2810)|Livre Des Merveilles]]|left]]

The earliest reference to Adal was following the collapse of the [[Makhzumi dynasty]] in July 1288 when '[[Ali Baziyu]] led a campaign in Adal and [[Mora (historical region)|Mora]] which was concluded by the killing of the lords of Adal and [[Mora (historical region)|Mora]], the victorious Sultan then annexed Adal and Mora to his Kingdom. Adal is also mentioned by [[Marco Polo]] in 1295 as a state continuously in conflict with Abyssinia. According to fourteenth century [[Arab]] historian [[Ibn Fadlallah al-Umari|Al Umari]], Adal was one of the founding regions of the [[Ifat Sultanate]] alongside [[Biqulzar]], [[Makhzumi dynasty|Shewa]], [[Kwelgora]], Shimi, Jamme and Laboo.

It was used ambiguously in the medieval era to indicate the Muslim inhabitant low land portion east of the [[ Empire]]. Including north of the [[Awash River]] towards [[Lake Abbe]] in modern [[– border]] as well as the territory between [[Shewa]] and [[Zeila]] on the coast of [[]]. Districts within Adal included [[Hubat]], [[Gidaya]] and [[Hargaya]]. It also occasionally included the [[Hadiya Sultanate]]. The region was mostly located in modern day [[Awdal]] and had [[Zeila]] as a capital city but also controlled other interior towns like [[Abasa, Awdal|Abasa]] or [[Dakkar]] extending into the [[Harari Region|Harar plateau]] to the south-east and modern day  in the west.

[[File:The_Sultanate_of_Ifat.png|thumb|The [[Ifat Sultanate]]'s realm in the 14th century]]

The [[Walashma dynasty]] are regarded by scholars as the founders of the Ifat Sultanate. Ifat first emerged when Umar Ibn Dunyā-ḥawaz, later to be known as Sultan [[Umar Walasma]], carved out his own kingdom and conquered the [[Sultanate of Shewa]] located in northern [[Hararghe]]. In 1288 Sultan Wali Asma successfully imposed his rule on [[Hubat]], [[Zeila]] and other Muslim states in the region. Taddesse Tamrat explains Sultan Walashma's military acts as an effort to consolidate the Muslim territories in the Horn of Africa in much the same way as Emperor [[Yekuno Amlak of |Yekuno Amlak]] was attempting to consolidate the Christian territories in the highlands during the same period.

In 1320 a conflict between the Christian monarch and Muslim Ifat leaders began. The conflict was precipitated by [[Al-Nasir Muhammad]] of [[]]. The Mamluk ruler Al-Nasir Muhammad was persecuting [[Copts|Christian Copts]] and destroying Coptic churches. The  Emperor [[Amda Seyon I]] sent an envoy with a warning to the Mamluk ruler that if he did not stop the persecution of Christians in , he would retaliate against Muslims under his rule and would starve the peoples of  by diverting the course of the Nile. According to Pankhurst, of the two threats, the diversion of Nile was an idle threat and the  sultan dismissed it because he likely realized this to be so. The fear that the  might tamper with the Nile, states Pankhurst, was nevertheless to remain with  for many centuries.

[[Sabr ad-Din I|Sabr ad-Din's]] rebellion was not an attempt to achieve independence, but to become emperor of a Muslim . Amda Seyon's royal chronicle states that Sabr ad-Din proclaimed:

: "I wish to be King of all ; I will rule the Christians according to their law and I will destroy their churches...I will nominate governors in all the provinces of , as does the King of [[Axum|Zion]] ()...I will transform the churches into mosques. I will subjugate and convert the King of the Christians to my religion, I will make him a provincial governor, and if he refuses to be converted I will hand him over to one of the shepherds, called Warjeke [i.e. [[Werji people|Warjih]]], that he may be made a keeper of camels. As for the Queen Jan Mangesha, his wife, I will employ her to grind corn. I will make my residence at Marade [i.e. [[Tegulet]]], the capital of his kingdom."

In fact, after his first incursion, Sabr ad-Din appointed governors for nearby and neighboring provinces such as [[Fatagar]] and Alamalé, as well as far-off provinces in the north like [[Damot (historical region)|Damot]], [[Amhara province|Amhara]], [[Angot]], [[Enderta Province|Inderta]], [[Begemder]], and [[Gojjam]]. He also threatened to plant ''[[khat]]'' at the capital, a stimulant used by Muslims but forbidden to [[ Orthodox Tewahedo Church| Orthodox Christians]].

In 1376, Sultan [[Sa'ad ad-Din II|Sa'ad ad-Din Abdul Muhammad]], also called Sa'ad ad-Din II, succeeded his brother and came to power, who continued to attack the Abyssinian Christian army. He attacked regional chiefs such as at Zalan and Hadeya, who supported the Emperor. According to Mordechai Abir, Sa'ad ad-Din II raids against the  empire were largely hit-and-run type, which hardened the resolve of the Christian ruler to end the Muslim rule in their east. In the early 15th century, the  Emperor who was likely [[Dawit I]] collected a large army to respond. He branded the Muslims of the surrounding area "enemies of the Lord", and invaded Ifat. After much war, Ifat's troops were defeated in 1403 on the Harar plateau, Sultan Sa'ad ad-Din subsequently fled to Zeila where  soldiers pursued him. [[Al-Maqrizi]] narrates:{{blockquote|the [[Amhara people|Amhara]] pursued Sa'd al-Din as far as the peninsula of [[Zeila]], in the ocean, where he took refuge. The Amhara besieged him there, and deprived him of water; at last one of the impious showed them a way by which they could reach him. When they came upon him a battle ensued; and after three days the water failed. Sa'd al Din was wounded in the forehead and fell to the ground, whereupon they pierced him with their swords. But he died happily, falling in God's cause.}}

[[File:Adalite_Population.png|left|thumb|A depiction of Adal's traditional costumes by Giuseppe Antonelli]]

After Sa'ad ad-Din's death "the strength of the Muslims was abated", as Maqrizi states, and then the Amhara settled in the country "and from the ravaged mosques and they made churches". The followers of Islam were said to have been harassed for over twenty years. The sources disagree on which  Emperor conducted this campaign. According to the medieval historian [[al-Makrizi]], Emperor [[Dawit I of |Dawit I]] in 1403 pursued the [[Sultan of Adal]], [[Sa'ad ad-Din II]], to Zeila, where he killed the Sultan and sacked the city of [[Zeila]]. However, another contemporary source dates the death of Sa'ad ad-Din II to 1410, and credits Emperor [[Yeshaq I of |Yeshaq]] with the slaying. His children and the remainder of the [[Walashma dynasty]] would flee to [[]] where they would live in exile until 1415. [[Handoga]] initially was a marginal semi-permanent settlement in the 13th century, but it transformed into a permanent stone city in the 14th century, coinciding with Ifat’s weakening and disrupted trade networks. The fall of Ifat, marked by military defeats,  occupation, and the loss of Zeila, disrupted the key trade route linking the  Ocean to the interior, prompting the rise of peripheral centres like Handoga. Its growth was likely driven by trade route realignments and the reorganisation of regional commerce until stability was restored under the [[Adal Sultanate]]. It had acted as a trade hub in the region for several centuries before being utterly abandoned at the end of the 16th century.

In 1415, [[Sabr ad-Din III]], the eldest son of [[Sa'ad ad-Din II]], would return to Adal from his exile in Arabia to restore his father's throne. He would proclaim himself "king of Adal" after his return from  to the [[Harar]] plateau and established his new capital at [[Dakkar]]. Sabr ad-Din III and his brothers would defeat an army of 20,000 men led by an unnamed commander hoping to restore the "lost Amhara rule". The victorious king then returned to his capital, but gave the order to his many followers to continue and extend the war against the Christians. The Emperor of  [[Tewodros I]] was soon killed by the Adal Sultanate upon the return of Sa'ad ad-Din's heirs to the Horn of Africa. [[Sabr ad-Din III]] died a natural death and was succeeded by his brother [[Mansur ad-Din of Adal|Mansur ad-Din]] who invaded the capital and royal seat of the Solomonic Empire and drove Emperor [[Dawit I of |Dawit I]] to Yedaya where according to [[al-Maqrizi]], Sultan Mansur destroyed a Solomonic army and killed the Emperor. He then advanced to the mountains of Mokha, where he encountered a 30,000 strong Solomonic army. The Adalite soldiers surrounded their enemies and for two months besieged the trapped Solomonic soldiers until a truce was declared in Mansur's favour. During this period, Adal emerged as a centre of Muslim resistance against the expanding Christian Abyssinian kingdom. Adal would thereafter govern all of the territory formerly ruled by the Ifat Sultanate, as well as the land further east all the way from the [[Bab el Mandeb]] to Cape Guardafui, according to Leo Africanus. Adal is mentioned by name in the 14th century in the context of the battles between the Muslims of the  and Afar seaboard and the Abyssinian King [[Amda Seyon I]]'s [[Christians|Christian]] troops. Adal originally had its capital in the port city of Zeila, situated in the western Awdal region. The polity at the time was an [[Emir]]ate in the larger [[Sultanate of Ifat|Ifat Sultanate]] ruled by the [[Walashma dynasty]].

[[File:Young_Ahmad_Gragn.png|thumb|An illustration of the young [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi|Ahmad ibn Ibrahim]] demonstrating his strength]]

According to I.M. Lewis, the polity was governed by local dynasties consisting of Somalized Arabs or Arabized , who also ruled over the similarly established [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]] in the [[Benadir]] region to the south. Adal's history from this founding period forth would be characterized by a succession of battles with neighbouring [[ Empire|Abyssinia]]. At its height, the Adal kingdom controlled large parts of modern-day , [[Somaliland]], [[]] and . Between [[ City]] and [[Loyada]] are a number of anthropomorphic and phallic [[Stele|stelae]]. The structures are associated with graves of rectangular shape flanked by vertical slabs, as also found in [[Tiya]], central [[]]. The -Loyada stelae are of uncertain age, and some of them are adorned with a T-shaped symbol. Additionally, archaeological excavations at Tiya have yielded tombs. As of 1997, 118 stelae were reported in the area. Along with the stelae in the [[Hadiya Zone]], the structures are identified by local residents as ''Yegragn Dingay'' or "Gran's stone", in reference to Imam [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] (Ahmad "Gurey" or "Gran"), ruler of the [[Adal Sultanate]]. Genasere was a major inland market town of Adal, supplied through the port of Zayla’ with goods from across . Located about 25 days from the coast and 40 days from [[Gendebelo]], it was likely near [[Lake Abbe|Lake Abbé]].

[[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] was a military leader of the medieval [[Adal Sultanate]] in the northern Horn of Africa. Between 1529 and 1543, he embarked on a campaign referred to as the [[–Adal War|Futuh Al-Habash]], bringing the three-quarters of Christian [[Abyssinia]] under the control of the [[Muslims|Muslim]] empire. With an army composed of Afar, Harari (Harla), and , al-Ghazi's forces came close to extinguishing the ancient  kingdom, slaughtering any  who refused to convert to Islam. Within the span of fourteen years the Imam was able to conquer the heartland of the country, wreaking havoc on the Christian nation. The Bahri Negash joined Emperor [[Gelawdewos]] and the  in the decisive [[Battle of Wayna Daga]], where tradition states that Imam Ahmad was shot in the chest by a  musketeer named João de Castilho, who had charged alone into the Muslim lines and died. The wounded Imam was then beheaded by an  cavalry commander, ''Azmach'' Calite. Once the Imam's soldiers learned of his death, they fled the battlefield. This conflict provided an opportunity for the [[Oromo people]] to [[Oromo migrations|conquer and migrate]] into the historically [[Gafat people|Gafat]] land of [[Welega]] south of the [[Blue Nile]] and eastward to the walls of [[Harar]], establishing new territories.

===Early modern era===
{{main|Imamate of Aussa|Habesh Eyalet|Khedivate's  Coast}}

In 1550, [[Nur ibn Mujahid]] became the Emir of [[Harar]] and the de facto ruler of Adal, fortifying Harar by constructing a defensive wall still present today. In 1559, he led an invasion against the [[ Empire]], killing Emperor [[Gelawdewos]] at the [[Battle of Fatagar]], while simultaneously repelling an  assault on Harar, which resulted in the death of Sultan [[Barakat ibn Umar Din]] and the end of the [[Walashma dynasty]]. The [[Oromo people|Oromo]] then invaded Adal, and Nur's army suffered a defeat at the [[Battle of Hazalo]], though the city's walls kept it safe, albeit under severe famine conditions. Nur died in 1567, and was succeeded by [[Uthman the Abyssinian]], whose peace treaty with the Oromos led to his overthrow. His successor, [[Muhammad ibn Nasir]], attempted an expedition against  but was defeated and killed at the [[Battle of Webi River]], marking the end of Adal's aggression. Muhammad's successor, [[Mansur ibn Muhammad]], fought the Oromos unsuccessfully and later reconquered [[Asaita|Aussa]] and [[Zeila]]. The death of Nur and the fall of the [[Walashma dynasty|Walashma]] monarchs sparked power struggles, with [[Muhammad Gasa]] taking the title of [[Imam]] in 1576 and relocating the capital to [[Asaita|Aussa]], founding the [[Imamate of Aussa]], which declined over the next century, eventually falling to the [[Afar people]]. In the seventeenth century, [[Harla people]] and [[Doba (historical region)|Doba]] populations integrated into the [[Afar people|Afar]] identity, leading to the emergence of the [[Sultanate of Aussa]]. [[Enrico Cerulli]] attributed Adal's downfall to its inability to overcome tribal divisions, unlike the  Empire under [[Sarsa Dengel]], resulting in ongoing struggles among the nomadic tribes. The collapse of the Adal Sultanate led to the formation of multiple rump states such as [[Imamate of Aussa|Aussa]], Tadjourah and Rahayto.

[[File:Einwohner_Von_Abex.webp|left|thumb|An inhabitant of the Habesh Eyalet by Georg Adam Dillinger (1773)]]The [[Oromo expansion|Oromo invasion]] in the sixteenth century caused the most severe social and economic disruption to the Muslim state, dominating traditional Muslim territories from [[Berbera]] to [[Asaita|Aussa]] and displacing communities. With Islamic centers destroyed and scholars gone, [[Islam]] became largely nominal. In the absence of formal legal authorities, [[Xeer]] customary law emerged or reemerged, drawing heavily from Sharia and developing further after the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] were defeated. The [[Xeer]] helped unite scattered groups to form the [[Issa (clan)|Issa]] tribal confederation. Originating in the 16th century, the [[Xeer]] functioned as a foundational legal system that brought diverse groups together under shared laws. It helped introduce principles central to modern political institutions long. The primary lineages of the Issa clan were divided into two main groups: the "three Issa" (saddehda Issa), which consisted of the lineal descendants of Shaykh Issa’s three sons Ēlēye (also known as Abgal), ʿAli (also known as Walāldōn and Holleqade), and Hōlle (also known as Fūrlabe), and the "three followers" (saddehda so'rā). Issa’s three sons and their descendants were collectively known as Bah Madigan. The "three followers" consisted of the Hōrrōne, Ūrweyne, and Wardiq, whose ancestors were said to be of extraneous origin and not descended from Issa’s sons. According to some traditions, the Wardiq were of Sheekash origin, the Hōrrōne of Ishaq origin, and the Ūrweyne were said to have descended from the Afar. The account of ʿAli Kalageeye, a  warrior who freed the Issa clan from Oromo domination, is preserved in oral tradition, which recounts how he came from the east and managed to defeat the Oromo monarch Aale Boore. It is said that the site of these clashes was [[Adigala]], a small town located today along the [[Addis Ababa– Railway|– railway]] between [[Dire Dawa]] and . In the early 18th century, the Mudaito-led sultanate of Awsa thrived as a mercantile center due to strong rulers, agriculture, and its strategic location. However, by the late 18th century, economic stagnation and political instability led to its decline. In the early 19th century, the Adoimara Afar clan invaded and forced revenue sharing. Meanwhile, Oromo expansion into Dankali lands deepened the north-south division where the region fragmented into small coastal sultanates, the most significant being Tadjoura, which dominated salt trade from Lake Assal.
[[File:Johann-Martin-Bernatz-Salt-Lake-Bahr-Assal.jpg|thumb|320x320px|Drawing landscape of [[Lake Assal ()|Lake Assal]] in 1841 by Johann Martin Bernatz.]]
[[Mamluk Sultanate|Mamluk ]] being conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] alarmed the [[Arabs|Arabian]] merchants, who were afraid of these new  conquerors hence they chose to travel towards Adal's shores. This was also followed by  merchants fleeing from the same enemy. The Ottomans noticing this sudden mass movement, hastidly occupied [[Zeila|Zeyla]] and established a customs house and [[galley]]s patrolling the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]]. By the 17th century, when the Ottomans were compelled to retire from Zeyla, the town and its environs such as [[Tadjoura]] fell under the control of the rulers of [[Mokha|Mocha]] and [[Sanaa|Sana'a]], who had leased the territory to a Sana'a merchant called [[Sayyid]] Al-Barr. Zeyla was subsequently ruled by an Emir, whom Mordechai Abir suggested had "some vague claim to authority over all of the ''Sahil'', but whose real authority did not extend very far beyond the walls of the town." Assisted by cannons and a few mercenaries armed with [[matchlock]]s, the governor succeeded in fending off incursions by both the disunited nomads of the interior, who had penetrated the area, as well as brigands in the Gulf of Aden. Although [[Tadjoura]] claimed complete independence, it was considered subordinate to Zeyla as the sultan would received an annual stipend from the local governor. Abubakr Pasha explained to Vice-Admiral [[Alphonse Fleuriot de Langle]] that when the Imam of Sana'a still controlled the  coast, some soldiers sent to Tadjoura were one day massacred by the inhabitants of the city. The governor of Mocha then dispatched a new detachment to avenge them. Rather than suffer these reprisals, the city preferred to commit to paying the Imam, each year at the time of the fairs, a perpetual annuity which the governor of Zeyla would be responsible for extracting. Tadjourah's vizier Mahammed Mahammed renewed it for the benefit of the  Pasha of [[Al Hudaydah|Al-Hodeydah]] although the Ottoman Empire never exercised political right over Tadjoura. Mohammed Al-Barr would later be succeeded as governor of Zeila and its dependencies(''Sahil'') by [[Sharmarke Ali Saleh|Sharmake Ali Salih]]. In June 1861, the  accused Sharmarke Ali Salih of being involved in the [[Assassination of Henri Lambert|murder of Henri Lambert]], a former  consular agent and supporter of Sharmarke's rival, [[Abubakr Ibrahim Chehem|Abubakr Pasha]], an [[Afar people|Afar]] slave trader. Although the  Pasha of [[Al Hudaydah|Al-Hodeydah]] and the [[List of  colonial administrators of Aden| Residency in Aden]] believed Sharmarke was innocent, he and some of his supporters were arrested and handed over to the  navy. The trial, originally planned for [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], was later moved to [[Jeddah]].
[[File:Portrait_of_Bourhan_Bey.png|left|thumb|310x310px|Portrait of Bourhan [[Bey]] (1855–1923), son of [[Abubakr Ibrahim Chehem|Aboubakr Ibrahim Chehem]], who first served under [[Khedivate of |]] before becoming a pioneer in the founding of [[ City]].]]
During the period of [[Muhammad Ali of |Muhammad Ali]]'s domination over the [[Hejaz]] and [[]] in the early 19th century, the port of [[Zeila]] also fell under the authority of Cairo, depending administratively on [[Mokha]]; its governor, named Mohammed El-Barr, kept command of it in exchange for an annual payment of 50 thalers, which he paid each year to [[Ibrahim Pasha of |Ibrahim Pasha]], son of Muhammad Ali. Contemporary  officials, such as Jamali Bey, expressed anticipation for the reintegration of Zeilaʿ into  and even proposed establishing an independent government there that would unite the villages, coastal regions, roads, and mountains stretching from Zeila to Massawa and up to the  frontier under the authority of Khedive [[Isma'il Pasha of |Ismaʿil]]. Abubakr, a key local intermediary, shifted his allegiance from the Ottomans to the  after failing to secure  support, became an influential figure in  policy. By the 1870s, he was acting as an indispensable go-between for correspondence between the khedive and regional rulers, including Menelik of Shewa, who relied on Abubakr’s mediation while carefully avoiding provocation of Emperor Yohannes IV. On 12 February 1871, the  corvette ''Sa'ka'' anchored at Zeila with Mumtaz Pasha on board, who distributed subsidies on behalf of Cairo, raised the  flag in accordance with prior agreements, and extended  influence to Berbera and Tadjoura. Local rulers, such as the Afar chief Hummad, welcomed these overtures, requesting additional arms and supplies while signalling willingness to establish closer ties with . This period marked the beginning of a short-lived “honeymoon” between  and the East African coast, though Cairo's ambitions faced diplomatic resistance from both Britain and the Ottoman Empire, particularly concerning the still-independent  ports of Berbera and Bulhar.

In the 1870s,  authorities portrayed their collaboration with prominent regional figures, including two influential slave traders Abubakr Pasha and [[Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur]], as part of their anti-slavery stance, despite the ongoing slave trade occurring openly. Abubakr, being governor of Zeila, was recognised more for his political influence than his role in the slave trade. After receiving the title of pasha from Cairo, he and al-Zubayr visited the city. In 1875, Zeila became 's strategic base for the planned conquest of Harar. In August of that year, [[Muhammad Rauf Pasha|Muhammad Ra'uf Pasha]] arrived in Zeila with a firman from the khedive, instructing Abubakr to support a "[[ invasion of Harar|geographic scientific voyage]]" to Harar which was a diplomatic facade intended to conceal military intentions from the  and maintain regional strategic balance. By the early 1870s, [[Khedivate of |]] had been gaining power in the region and, in 1873, the  occupied Sagallo and other sites such as Tadjoura, but their hold didn't last long.

On October 16 1884, [[Léonce Lagarde]] informed the commander of the cruiser ''Seignelay'' that the evacuation of Tadjourah and Sagallo by the  was imminent and advised immediate action. On October 18, as the  left Sagallo, the ''Seignelay''’s steam launch slipped ashore, allowing Legras to seize the site without resistance and install a garrison of 14 men. Over the following days, small posts were set up at Raïssali and Rood-Ali, though 35  soldiers remained in Tadjourah. The ''Seignelay''’s commander proposed military intervention, believing resistance unlikely, but Lagarde hesitated at the last moment. On November 17, aboard the ''Brandon'', Lagarde entered Tadjoura after the  withdrawal, raised the  flag, and departed without establishing a permanent post. The positions created in October were soon abandoned, leaving only a symbolic occupation maintained by occasionally hoisting the  flag and sending a ship from time to time.

The boundaries of the present-day  state were established as the first  establishment in the [[Horn of Africa]] during the [[Scramble for Africa]]. The March 11, 1862, agreement the [[Afar people|Afar]] sultan, Raieta Dini Ahmet, signed in [[Paris]] was a treaty where the Afars sold lands surrounding in [[Obock]]. The  were interested in having a [[coaling station]] for [[steamship]]s, which would become especially important upon the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869. (Up to that time  ships had to buy coal at the  port of [[Aden]] across the gulf, an unwise dependency in case of war.) Later on, that treaty was used by the captain of the Fleuriot de Langle to colonize the south of the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]]. On March 26, 1885, the  signed another treaty with the Issas where the latter would become a protectorate under the .[[File:-Eid-Celebration.jpg|thumb|Solemn procession of local Muslims using  lyres to celebrate Eid in 1913]]
It was established between 1883 and 1887, after the ruling [[ people|]] and [[Afar people|Afar]] sultans each signed a treaty with the [[ Third Republic|]]. An attempt by [[Nikolay Ivanovitch Achinov]], a [[ Empire|]] adventurer, to establish a settlement at [[Sagallo]] in 1889 was promptly thwarted by  forces after just one month. In 1894, [[Léonce Lagarde]] established a permanent  administration in the [[city of ]] and named the region [[ Somaliland]]. The construction of the [[Imperial  Railway]] west into [[]] turned the [[ (city)|port of ]] into a boomtown of 15,000 at a time when [[Harar]] was the only city in  to exceed that.

Although the population fell after the completion of the railwayline to [[Dire Dawa]] and the original company failed and required a government bail-out, the rail link allowed the territory to quickly supersede the caravan-based trade carried on at [[Zeila]] (then in the [[ of Great Britain and |]] area of [[ Somaliland|Somaliland]]) and become the premier port for [[Harari coffee|coffee]] and other goods leaving southern  and the [[Ogaden]] through [[Harar]].[[File:Ahmed_Abokob.jpg|left|thumb|Ahmed Abokob, a  tirailleur from , who participated in [[World War I]]|310x310px]]The 6th  Marching Battalion was formed in  on May 11, 1916, with recruits from the [[  Coast]] and renamed the [[1st Battalion of  Tirailleurs]] upon arrival in  in June. Originally intended as a staging unit, the battalion’s officers responded to the ' desire to fight, leading to their participation alongside the [[Régiment d'infanterie-chars de marine|RICM]] in the October 1916 assault on Fort Douaumont. For their distinguished role, the battalion's companies were awarded the Croix de Guerre, and the RICM flag received the Legion of Honor. Reorganized as a combat unit by December 1916, the battalion fought at Chemin des Dames in May 1917 and later in significant battles such as Malmaison, the 3rd Battle of the Aisne, and the 2nd Battle of the Marne, earning multiple citations and the right to wear the Croix de Guerre fourragère. Of the 2,434 riflemen deployed, 517 were killed and 1,200 wounded in Europe.

After the  [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invasion and occupation of ]] in the mid-1930s, constant border skirmishes occurred between  forces in  Somaliland and  forces in [[ East Africa]]. In June 1940, during the early stages of [[World War II]], [[fall of | fell]] and the colony was then ruled by the [[Vichy |Vichy () government]].{{sfn|Imbert-Vier|2008|pp=226–29}}  and Commonwealth forces fought the neighboring  during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]]. In 1941, the  were defeated and the Vichy forces in  Somaliland were isolated. The Vichy  administration continued to hold out in the colony for over a year after the  collapse. In response, the  blockaded the port of [[ City]] but it could not prevent local  from providing information on the passing ship convoys. In 1942, about 4,000 [[ troops]] occupied the city.{{Sfn|Ebsworth|1953|p=564}} A local [[1st Battalion of  Tirailleurs|battalion]] from  Somaliland participated in the [[Liberation of ]] in 1944.

In 1958, on the eve of neighboring 's independence in 1960, a [[ Somaliland overseas territory referendum, 1958|referendum]] was held in  to decide whether to remain with  or to be an independent country. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with , partly due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident . There were also allegations of widespread [[vote rigging]]. The majority of those who had voted no were  who were strongly in favour of joining a united  as had been proposed by [[Mahmoud Harbi]], Vice President of the Government Council. Harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later under suspicious circumstances.

In 1966,  rejected the [[United Nations]]' recommendation that it should grant  Somaliland independence. In August of the same year, an official visit to the territory by then  President [[Charles de Gaulle]], was also met with demonstrations and rioting. In response to the protests, de Gaulle ordered another referendum.

In 1967, a [[ Somaliland independence referendum, 1967|second plebiscite]] was held to determine the fate of the territory. Initial results supported a continued but looser relationship with . Voting was also divided along ethnic lines, with the resident  generally voting for independence, with the goal of eventual union with , and the Afars largely opting to remain associated with . The referendum was again marred by reports of vote rigging on the part of the  authorities. Shortly after the plebiscite was held, the former ''Côte française des '' ( Somaliland) was renamed to ''Territoire français des Afars et des Issas''. Announcement of the plebiscite results sparked civil unrest, including several deaths.  also increased its military force along the frontier.<!-- Empty reference

During the 1960s, the struggle for independence was led by the [[Front de Libération de la Côte des |Front for the Liberation of the  Coast]] (FLCS), who waged an armed struggle for independence with much of its violence aimed at  personnel. FLCS used to initiate few mounting cross-border operations into [[ Somaliland]] from [[ Democratic Republic|]] and [[Derg|]] to attacks on  targets. On March 24, 1975, the Front de Libération de la Côte des  kidnapped the  Ambassador to , Jean Guery, to be exchanged against two activists of FLCS members who were both serving life terms in mainland [[]]. He was exchanged for the two FLCS members in [[Aden]], [[South ]]. The FLCS was recognized as a national liberation movement by the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU), which participated in its financing. The FLCS evolved its demands between the request of integration in a possible "[[Greater ]]" influenced by the [[ Democratic Republic| government]] or the simple independence of the territory. In 1975 the African People's League for the Independence (LPAI) and FLCS met in [[Kampala]], [[]] with several meeting later they finally opted for independence path, causing tensions with [[ Democratic Republic|]].

In 1976, members of the [[Front de Libération de la Côte des ]] which sought 's independence from [[]], also clashed with the Gendarmerie Nationale Intervention Group over a bus hijacking en route to [[Loyada]]. This event, by showing the difficulties of maintaining the  colonial presence in , was an important step in the [[independence]] of the [[territory]]. The likelihood of a third [[referendum]] appearing successful for the  had grown even dimmer. The prohibitive cost of maintaining the [[colony]], 's last outpost on the [[continent]], was another factor that compelled observers to doubt that the [[|]] would attempt to hold on to the territory.

A [[1977 Afars and Issas independence referendum|third independence referendum]] was held in the [[ Territory of the Afars and the Issas]] on 8 May 1977. The previous referendums were held in [[1958  Somaliland overseas territory referendum|1958]] and [[1967  Somaliland independence referendum|1967]], which rejected [[independence]]. This referendum backed independence from [[]]. A landslide 98.8% of the electorate supported disengagement from , officially marking [[Independence Day ()|'s independence]]. [[Hassan Gouled Aptidon]], an Issa (ethnic ) politician who had campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1958, became the nation's first president (1977–1999).

During its first year,  joined the [[Organization of African Unity]] (now the [[African Union]]), the [[Arab League]], and the United Nations. In 1986, the nascent republic was also among the founding members of the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]] regional development organization. During the [[Ogaden War]], influential Issa politicians envisioned a Greater  or "Issa-land", where 's borders would extend from the Red Sea to [[Dire Dawa]]. That dream was dashed towards the end of the war as  forces were routed from .

In the early 1990s, tensions over government representation led to [[ Civil War|armed conflict]] between 's ruling [[People's Rally for Progress]] (PRP) party and the [[Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy]] (FRUD) opposition group. The impasse ended in a power-sharing agreement in 2000.

In April 2021, [[Ismaïl Omar Guelleh|Ismael Guelleh]], the second [[president of ]] since independence from  in 1977, was [[2021  presidential election|re-elected]] for his fifth term.
