The [[Natufian culture]] was the first to become sedentary around the 11th millennium BC and became one of the centers of [[Neolithic]] culture (known as [[PPNA|Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]]), where agriculture and cattle breeding first began to appear. The site of [[Tell Qaramel]] has several round stone towers dated to 10650 BC, making them the oldest structures of this kind in the world. The Neolithic period ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]) is represented by rectangular houses of [[Mureybet]] culture. At the time, people used containers made of stone, gyps, and burnt lime ([[White Ware|Vaisselle blanche]]). The discovery of [[obsidian]] tools from [[]] are evidence of early trade. The ancient cities of [[Hamoukar]] and [[Emar]] played an important role during the late Neolithic and Bronze Age. Archaeologists have demonstrated that civilization in  was one of the most ancient on earth, perhaps preceded by only that of [[Mesopotamia]].

[[File:Ishqi-Mari (dark background).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ishqi-Mari]], king of the Second Kingdom of [[Mari, |Mari]], circa 2300 BC]]The earliest recorded indigenous civilization in the region was the Kingdom of [[Ebla]] near present-day [[Idlib]], northern . Ebla appears to have been founded around 3500 BC and gradually built its fortune through trade with the Mesopotamian states of [[Sumer]], [[Assyria]], and [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], as well as with the [[Hurrian]] and [[Hattians|Hattian]] peoples to the northwest, in [[Asia Minor]]. Gifts from [[Pharaoh]]s, found during excavations, confirm Ebla's contact with [[Ancient |]]. One of the earliest written texts from  is a trading agreement between Vizier [[Ibrium]] of Ebla and an ambiguous kingdom called [[Abarsal]] {{c.|2300 BC}}. This is known as the [[Treaty between Ebla and Abarsal]]. Scholars believe the [[Eblaite language|language of Ebla]] to be among the oldest known written [[Semitic languages]] after [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. Recent classifications of the Eblaite language have shown that it was an [[East Semitic language]], closely related to the [[Akkadian language]]. Ebla was weakened by a long war with [[Mari, |Mari]], and the whole of  became part of the Mesopotamian [[Akkadian Empire]] after [[Sargon of Akkad]] and his grandson [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]]'s conquests ended Eblan domination over  in the first half of the 23rd century BC.

By the 21st century BC, Hurrians settled in the northern east parts of  while the rest of the region was dominated by the [[Amorites]].  was called the Land of the Amurru (Amorites) by their Assyro-Babylonian neighbors. The Northwest Semitic [[Amorite language]] is the earliest attested of the [[Canaanite languages]]. [[Mari, |Mari]] reemerged during this period until conquered by [[Hammurabi]] of Babylon. [[Ugarit]] also arose during this time, circa 1800 BC, close to modern [[Latakia]]. [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] was a Semitic language loosely related to the Canaanite languages and developed the [[Ugaritic alphabet]], considered to be the world's earliest known alphabet. The Ugaritic kingdom survived until its destruction at the hands of the marauding Indo-European [[Sea Peoples]] in the 12th century BC in what was known as the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]].

[[Aleppo]] and Damascus are among the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world]]. [[Yamhad]] (modern Aleppo) dominated northern  for two centuries, although eastern  was occupied in the 19th and 18th centuries BC by the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] ruled by the Amorite dynasty of [[Shamshi-Adad I]], and by the [[Babylonian Empire]] which was founded by Amorites. Yamhad was described in the tablets of Mari as the mightiest state in the near east and as having more vassals than Hammurabi. Yamhad imposed its authority over [[Alalakh]], [[Qatna]], the Hurrians states, and the [[Euphrates]] valley down to the borders with Babylon. The army of Yamhad campaigned as far away as [[Der (Sumer)|Dēr]] on the border of [[Elam]] (modern ). Yamhad was conquered and destroyed, along with Ebla, by the [[Hittites]] from [[Asia Minor]] circa 1600 BC. From this time,  became a battle ground for various foreign empires, these being the [[Hittite Empire]], [[Mitanni]] Empire, [[ Empire]], [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], and to a lesser degree [[Babylonia]]. The  initially occupied much of the south, while the Hittites and the Mitanni occupied much of the north. However, Assyria eventually gained the upper hand, destroying the Mitanni Empire and annexing huge swathes of territory previously held by the Hittites and Babylon.

Around the 14th century BC, various [[Semitic people]] appeared in the area, such as the semi-nomadic [[Suteans]] who came into an unsuccessful conflict with Babylonia to the east, and the [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] speaking [[Arameans]] who subsumed the earlier Amorites. They too were subjugated by Assyria and the Hittites for centuries. The  fought the Hittites for control over western ; the fighting reached its zenith in 1274 BC with the [[Battle of Kadesh]]. The west remained part of the Hittite empire until its destruction {{c.|1200 BC}}, while eastern  largely became part of the Middle Assyrian Empire, who also annexed much of the west during the reign of [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] 1114–1076 BC. With the destruction of the Hittites and the decline of Assyria in the late 11th century BC, the Aramean tribes gained control of much of the interior, founding states such as [[Bit Bahiani]], [[Aram-Damascus]], [[Hamath]], [[Aram-Rehob]], [[Aram-Naharaim]], and [[Luhuti]]. From this point, the region became known as [[Aramea]] or [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]. There was also a synthesis between the Semitic Arameans and the remnants of the Indo-European Hittites, with the founding of a number of [[Syro-Hittite]] states centered in north central Aram () and south central Asia Minor (modern ), including [[Palistin]], [[Carchemish]] and [[Sam'al]].

[[File:Amrit01.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Amrit]] Phoenician Temple]]
A [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] group known as the [[Phoenicians]] came to dominate the coasts of , (and also  and northern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]) from the 13th century BC, founding [[city states]] such as [[Amrit]], [[Simyra]], [[Arwad]], [[Arab al-Mulk|Paltos]], [[Latakia#Ancient settlement and founding|Ramitha]], and [[Tell Sukas|Shuksi]]. From these coastal regions, they eventually spread their influence throughout the [[Mediterranean]], including building colonies in [[]], Sicily, the [[Iberian peninsula]], and the coasts of North Africa and most significantly, founding the major city-state of [[Carthage]] in the 9th century BC, which was much later to become the center of a major empire, rivaling the [[Roman Republic]].

 and the western half of [[Near East]] then fell to the vast [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (911 BC – 605 BC). The Assyrians introduced [[Imperial Aramaic]] as the [[lingua franca]] of their empire. This language was to remain dominant in  and the entire [[Near East]] until after the [[Islamic]] conquest in the 7th and 8th centuries AD, and was to be a vehicle for the spread of Christianity. The Assyrians named their colonies of  and  [[Eber-Nari]]. Assyrian domination ended after the Assyrians greatly weakened themselves in a series of brutal internal civil wars, followed by attacks from: the [[Medes]], [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]]. During the fall of Assyria, the [[Scythians]] ravaged and plundered much of . The last stand of the Assyrian army was at [[Carchemish]] in northern  in 605 BC. The Assyrian Empire was followed by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (605 BC – 539 BC). During this period,  became a battle ground between Babylonia and another former Assyrian colony, that of . The Babylonians, like their Assyrian relations, were victorious over .

Thus, it was the  who introduced the name "" to the region. Originally an Indo-European corruption of "Assyria" in northern Mesopotamia (), the  used this term to describe not only Assyria itself but also the lands to the west which had for centuries been under Assyrian dominion. Thus in the [[Greco-Roman]] world both the [[Arameans]] of  and the [[Old Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]] of Mesopotamia (modern day [[]]) to the east were referred to as "" or "Syriacs", despite these being distinct peoples in their own right, a confusion which would continue into the modern world. Eventually parts of southern [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]]  were taken by the [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Hasmonean dynasty]] upon the slow disintegration of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] Empire.

[[Palmyra]], a rich and sometimes powerful native Aramaic-speaking kingdom, arose in northern  in the 2nd century; the Palmyrene established a trade network that made the city one of the richest in the Roman Empire. In the late 3rd century the Palmyrene king [[Odaenathus]] defeated the Persian emperor [[Shapur I]] and controlled the entirety of the Roman East while his successor and widow [[Zenobia]] established the [[Palmyrene Empire]], which briefly conquered , , Palestine, much of Asia Minor, Judah and , before being finally brought under Roman control in 273.

The northern Mesopotamian [[Neo-Assyrian|Assyrian]] kingdom of [[Adiabene]] controlled areas of north east  between 10 and 117, before it was conquered by Rome. The Aramaic language has been found as far afield as [[Hadrian's Wall]] in [[Roman Britain]], with an inscription written by a Palmyrene emigrant at the site of Fort [[Arbeia]]. Control of  eventually passed from the Romans to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] with the split in the Roman Empire. The largely Aramaic-speaking population of  during the heyday of the Byzantine Empire was probably not exceeded again until the 19th century. Prior to the [[Early Muslim conquests|Arab Islamic Conquest]] in the 7th century, the bulk of the population were Arameans, but  was also home to [[ people|]] and Roman ruling classes, Assyrians still dwelt in the north east, Phoenicians along the coasts, and Jewish and  communities were also extant in major cities, with Nabateans and pre-Islamic [[Arabs]] such as the [[Lakhmids]] and [[Ghassanids]] dwelling in the deserts of southern . [[Syriac Christianity]] had taken hold as the major religion, although others still followed [[Judaism]], [[Mithraism]], [[Manicheanism]], [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman Religion]], [[Canaanite Religion]] and [[Mesopotamian Religion]]. 's large and prosperous population made  one of the most important of the Roman and Byzantine provinces, particularly during the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.

[[Muhammad]]'s first interaction with the people of  was during the [[invasion of Dumatul Jandal]] in July 626 where he ordered his followers to invade Duma, because Muhammad received intelligence that some tribes there were involved in highway robbery and were preparing to attack [[Medina]]. [[William Montgomery Watt]] claims that this was the most significant expedition Muhammad ordered at the time, even though it received little notice in the primary sources. [[Dumat Al-Jandal]] was {{convert|500|mi|km|order=flip}} from Medina, and Watt says that there was no immediate threat to Muhammad, other than the possibility that his communications to  and supplies to Medina would be interrupted. Watt says "It is tempting to suppose that Muhammad was already envisaging something of the expansion which took place after his death", and that the rapid march of his troops must have "impressed all those who heard of it". [[William Muir]] also believes that the expedition was important as Muhammad followed by 1,000 men reached the confines of , where distant tribes had learnt his name, while the political horizon of Muhammad was extended.

By 640,  [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|was conquered]] by the [[Rashidun army]] led by [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]]. In the mid-7th century, the [[Umayyad dynasty]] placed the capital of the empire in Damascus. The country's power declined during later Umayyad rule; this was mainly through totalitarianism, corruption and the resulting revolutions. The Umayyad dynasty was overthrown in 750 by the [[Abbasid dynasty]], which moved the capital of empire to [[Baghdad]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] – made official under Umayyad rule – became the dominant language, replacing [[ language|]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] of the Byzantine era. In 887, the -based [[Tulunids]] annexed  from the Abbasids and were later replaced by the -based [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshidids]] and then by the [[Hamdanid]]s originating in Aleppo founded by [[Sayf al-Dawla]].

Sections of  were held by , ,  and  overlords between 1098 and 1189 during the [[Crusades]] and were known collectively as the [[Crusader states]], among which the primary one in  was the [[Principality of Antioch]]. The coastal mountainous region was occupied in part by the [[Nizaris|Nizari Ismailis]], the so-called [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], who had intermittent confrontations and truces with the Crusader States. Later in history when "the Nizaris faced renewed Frankish hostilities, they received timely assistance from the Ayyubids." After a century of Seljuk rule,  was largely conquered (1175–1185) by the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] liberator [[Saladin|Salah ad-Din]], founder of the [[Ayyubid]] dynasty of . [[Siege of Aleppo (1260)|Aleppo fell]] to the [[Mongols]] of [[Hulegu]] in January 1260; Damascus fell in March, but then Hulegu was forced to break off his attack to return to  to deal with a succession dispute.

A few months later, the [[Mamluk]]s arrived with an army from  and defeated the Mongols in the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in [[Galilee]]. The Mamluk leader, [[Baibars]], made Damascus a provincial capital. When he died, power was taken by [[Qalawun]]. In the meantime, an emir named [[Sunqur al-Ashqar]] had tried to declare himself ruler of Damascus, but he was defeated by Qalawun on 21 June 1280 and fled to northern . Al-Ashqar, who had married a Mongol woman, appealed for help from the Mongols. The Mongols of the [[Ilkhanate]] took Aleppo in October 1280, but Qalawun persuaded Al-Ashqar to join him, and they fought against the Mongols on 29 October 1281 in the [[Second Battle of Homs]], which was won by the Mamluks. In 1400, the Muslim [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turco-Mongol]] conqueror [[Tamurlane]] invaded , in which he [[Sack of Aleppo (1400)|sacked Aleppo]] and [[Siege of Damascus (1400)|captured Damascus]] after defeating the Mamluk army. The city's inhabitants were massacred, except for the artisans who were deported to [[Samarkand]]. Tamurlane conducted massacres of the Assyrian Christian population, greatly reducing their numbers. By the end of the 15th century, the discovery of a sea route from Europe to the [[Far East]] ended the need for an [[Silk Road|overland trade route]] through .

In 1516, the [[Ottoman Empire]] invaded the [[Mamluk Sultanate|Mamluk Sultanate of ]], conquering  and incorporating it into its empire. The Ottoman system was not burdensome to  because the Turks respected Arabic as the language of the [[Quran]] and accepted the mantle of defenders of the faith. Damascus was made the major entrepot for [[Mecca]], and as such it acquired a holy character to Muslims, because of the beneficial results of the countless pilgrims who passed through on the [[hajj]].

Ottoman administration followed a system that led to peaceful coexistence. Each ethno-religious minority—Arab [[Shia Muslim]], Arab [[Sunni Muslim]], [[Syriac Orthodox]], [[ Orthodox]], [[Maronite Christians]], [[Assyrian Christians]], [[]], [[Kurds]] and [[Jews]]—constituted a [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]. The religious heads of each community administered all personal status laws and performed certain civil functions as well. In 1831, [[Ibrahim Pasha of ]] renounced his loyalty to the empire and overran [[Ottoman ]], capturing Damascus. His short-term rule over the domain attempted to change the demographics and social structure of the region: he brought thousands of  villagers to populate the plains of [[southern ]], rebuilt [[Jaffa]] and settled it with veteran  soldiers aiming to turn it into a regional capital, and he crushed peasant and Druze rebellions and deported non-loyal tribesmen. By 1840, however, he had to surrender the area back to the Ottomans. From 1864, [[Tanzimat]] reforms were applied on Ottoman , carving out the provinces (vilayets) of [[Aleppo Vilayet|Aleppo]], [[Sanjak of Zor|Zor]], [[Beirut Vilayet|Beirut]] and [[Damascus Vilayet]]; [[Mutasarrifate of Mount ]] was created, and soon after the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]] was given a separate status.

During [[World War I]], the Ottoman Empire entered the conflict as a [[Central Powers|Central Power]]. It ultimately suffered defeat and loss of control of the entire [[Near East]] to the [[ Empire]] and [[ colonial empire| Empire]]. During the conflict, genocide against indigenous Christian peoples was carried out by the Ottomans and their allies in the form of the [[ genocide]] and [[Sayfo|Assyrian genocide]], of which [[Deir ez-Zor]] in Ottoman  was the final destination of these death marches. In the midst of World War I, two [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] diplomats (Frenchman [[François Georges-Picot]] and [[ people|Briton]] [[Mark Sykes]]) secretly agreed on the post-war division of the Ottoman Empire into respective zones of influence in the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] of 1916. Initially, the two territories were separated by a border that ran in an almost straight line from  to . However, the discovery of oil in the region of [[Mosul]] just before the end of the war led to yet [[1918 Clemenceau–Lloyd George Agreement (Middle East)|another negotiation with  in 1918]] to cede this region to the  zone of influence, which was to become . The fate of the intermediate province of Zor was left unclear; its [[Occupation of Zor|occupation by Arab nationalists resulted in its attachment to ]]. This border was recognized internationally when  became a [[League of Nations]] mandate in 1920 and has not changed to date.

However, his rule over  ended after only a few months, following the [[Battle of Maysalun]].  troops occupied  later that year after the [[San Remo conference]] proposed that the [[League of Nations]] put  under a  mandate. General Gouraud had according to his secretary de Caix two options: "Either build a  nation that does not exist... by smoothing the rifts which still divide it" or "cultivate and maintain all the phenomena, which require our arbitration that these divisions give". De Caix added "I must say only the second option interests me". This is what Gouraud did.

=== Independent  Republic ===
{{Main|Second  Republic|United Arab Republic|1963  coup d'état}}
Upheaval dominated  politics from independence through the late 1960s. In May 1948,  forces invaded [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], together with other Arab states, and immediately [[Battles of the Kinarot Valley|attacked Jewish settlements]]. President [[Shukri al-Quwatli|Shukri al-Quwwatli]] instructed his troops in the front, "to destroy the Zionists". The invasion purpose was to prevent the establishment of the state of . Toward this end, the  government engaged in an active process of recruiting former [[Nazism|Nazis]], including several former members of the [[Schutzstaffel]], to build up their armed forces and military intelligence capabilities. Defeat in this war was one of several trigger factors for the [[March 1949  coup d'état]] by Colonel [[Husni al-Za'im]], described as the first military overthrow of the [[Arab World]] since the start of the Second World War. This was soon followed by another overthrow, by Colonel [[Sami al-Hinnawi]], who was quickly deposed by Colonel [[Adib Shishakli]], all within the same year.[[File:Syrien 1961 Aleppol 1.jpg|thumb|Aleppo in 1961|left]]Shishakli eventually abolished multipartyism altogether but was overthrown in a [[1954  coup d'état|1954 coup]], and the parliamentary system was restored. However, by this time, power was increasingly concentrated in the military and security establishment. The weakness of Parliamentary institutions and the mismanagement of the economy led to unrest and the influence of [[Nasserism]] and other ideologies. There was fertile ground for various [[Arab nationalist]], [[ nationalism| nationalist]], and socialist movements, which represented disaffected elements of society. Notably included were religious minorities, who demanded radical reform.
In November 1956, as a direct result of the [[Suez Crisis]],  signed a pact with the [[Soviet Union]]. This gave a foothold for communist influence within the government in exchange for military equipment. [[]] then became worried about this increase in the strength of  military technology, as it seemed feasible that  might attempt to retake [[İskenderun]]. Only heated debates in the United Nations lessened the threat of war.

=== United Arab Republic ===
[[File:Nasser addresses Aleppo, 1960.jpg|thumb|[[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] at [[Aleppo]], 1960]]
On 1 February 1958,  President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] and 's Nasser announced the merging of  and , creating the [[United Arab Republic]], and all  political parties, as well as the communists therein, ceased overt activities. Meanwhile, a group of  Ba'athist officers, alarmed by the party's poor position and the increasing fragility of the union, decided to form a secret Military Committee; its initial members were Lieutenant-Colonel [[Muhammad Umran]], Major [[Salah Jadid]] and Captain Hafez al-Assad.  seceded from the union with  on 28 September 1961, after a [[1961  coup d'état|coup]] and terminated the political union.

==== Land reform ====
Agrarian reform measures were introduced which consisted of three interrelated programs: legislation regulating the relationship between agriculture laborers and landowners; legislation governing the ownership and use of private and state domain land and directing the economic organization of peasants; and measures reorganizing agricultural production under state control. Despite high levels of inequality in land ownership these reforms allowed for more progress in redistribution of land from 1958 to 1961 than any other reforms in 's history, since independence.

The first law passed (Law 134; passed 4 September 1958) was in response to concern about peasant mobilization and expanding peasants' rights. This was designed to strengthen the position of sharecroppers and agricultural laborers in relation to land owners. This law led to the creation of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, which announced the implementation of new laws that would allow the regulation of working condition especially for women and adolescents, set hours of work, and introduce the principle of minimum wage for paid laborers and an equitable division of harvest for sharecroppers. Furthermore, it obligated landlords to honor both written and oral contracts, established collective bargaining, contained provisions for workers' compensation, health, housing, and employment services. Law 134 was not designed strictly to protect workers. It also acknowledged the rights of landlords to form their own syndicates.

The instability which followed the [[1961  coup d'état|1961 coup]] culminated in the [[1963  coup d'état|8 March 1963 Ba'athist coup]]. The takeover was engineered by members of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party –  Region|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]], led by [[Michel Aflaq]] and [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]].

Ba'athists took control over country's politics, education, culture, religion and surveilled all aspects of civil society through its powerful ''[[Military Intelligence Directorate ()|Mukhabarat]]'' (secret police). [[ Arab Armed Forces| Arab Armed forces]] and secret police were integrated with the Ba'ath party apparatus; after the purging of traditional civilian and military elites by the regime.

The 1963 Ba'athist coup marked a "radical break" in [[History of #Modern history|modern  history]], after which Ba'ath party monopolised power in the country to establish a [[one-party state]] and shaped a socio-political order by enforcing its [[neo-Ba'athism|state ideology]]. On 23 February 1966, the neo-Ba'athist Military Committee carried out an [[1966  coup d'état|intra-party rebellion]] against the Ba'athist Old Guard ([[Michel Aflaq|Aflaq]] and [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar|Bitar]]), imprisoned President [[Amin al-Hafiz]] and designated a [[Qutriyun|regionalist]], civilian Ba'ath government on 1 March. Although [[Nureddin al-Atassi]] became the formal head of state, [[Salah Jadid]] was 's effective ruler from 1966 until November 1970, when he was deposed by [[Hafez al-Assad]], who at the time was Minister of Defense.

The coup led to the schism within the original pan-Arab Ba'ath Party: one [[Ba'ath Party (-dominated faction)|-led ba'ath movement]] (ruled  from 1968 to 2003) and one [[Ba'ath Party (-dominated faction)|-led ba'ath movement]] was established. In the first half of 1967, a low-key state of war existed between  and . Conflict over  cultivation of land in the [[– Mixed Armistice Commission|Demilitarized Zone]] led to [[Origins of the Six-Day War# and |7 April pre-war aerial clashes]] between  and . When the [[Six-Day War]] broke out between  and ,  joined the war and attacked  as well. In the final days of the war,  turned its attention to , capturing two-thirds of the [[Golan Heights]] in under 48 hours. The defeat caused a split between Jadid and Assad over what steps to take next. Disagreement developed between Jadid, who controlled the party apparatus, and Assad, who controlled the military. The 1970 retreat of  forces sent to aid the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] led by [[Yasser Arafat]] during the "[[Black September]] (also known as the  Civil War of 1970)" hostilities with  reflected this disagreement.[[File:General Hafez al-Assad (1930-2000), the new president of  in November 1970.png|thumb|upright|[[Hafez al-Assad]], president of  (1970–2000)]]The power struggle culminated in the November [[Corrective Revolution ()|1970  Corrective movement]], a bloodless military coup that installed Hafez al-Assad as the strongman of the government. Assad transformed a Ba'athist party state into a dictatorship marked by his pervasive grip on the party, [[ Arab Armed Forces|armed forces]], [[Military Intelligence Directorate ()|secret police]], media, education sector, religious and cultural spheres and all aspects of civil society. He assigned [[Alawites|Alawite]] loyalists to key posts in the military forces, bureaucracy, [[Military Intelligence Directorate ()|intelligence]] and the ruling elite. A cult of personality revolving around Hafez and his family became a core tenet of [[Assadism|Ba'athist ideology]], which espoused that [[Assad family|Assad dynasty]] was destined to rule perennially. 

On 6 October 1973,  and  initiated the [[Yom Kippur War]] against . The [[ Defense Forces]] reversed the initial  gains and pushed deeper into  territory. The village of [[Quneitra]] was largely destroyed by the  army. 

In the late 1970s, an [[Islamist uprising in |Islamist uprising]] by the [[Muslim Brotherhood in |Muslim Brotherhood]] was aimed against the government. Islamists attacked civilians and off-duty military personnel, leading security forces to also kill civilians in retaliatory strikes. The uprising had reached its climax in the 1982 [[1982 Hama massacre|Hama massacre]], when more than 2,000 to 25,000{{sfnp|Carré|Michaud|1983|page=159}}-40,000 people (Islamist and civilians) were killed by [[ Armed Forces| military]] troops and Ba'athist paramilitaries. It has been described as the "single deadliest act" of violence perpetrated by any state upon its own population in [[Modern Middle East|modern Arab history]]

In a major shift in relations with both other [[Arab world|Arab states]] and the Western world,  participated in the -led [[Gulf War]] against [[Saddam Hussein]]. The country participated in the multilateral [[Madrid Conference of 1991]], and during the 1990s engaged in negotiations with  along with Palestine and . These negotiations failed, and there have been no further direct - talks since Assad's meeting with U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] in [[Geneva]] in 2000.

Hafez al-Assad died on 10 June 2000. His son, [[Bashar al-Assad]], was elected president in [[ presidential election, 2000|an election]] in which he ran unopposed. His election saw the birth of the [[Damascus Spring]] and hopes of reform, but by autumn 2001 the authorities had suppressed the movement, imprisoning some of its leading intellectuals. Instead, reforms have been limited to some market reforms. 

On 5 October 2003  [[Ain es Saheb airstrike|bombed a site near Damascus]], claiming it was a terrorist training facility for members of [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]]. In March 2004, [[ Kurds]] and Arabs [[2004 Al-Qamishli riots|clashed]] in [[al-Qamishli]]. Signs of rioting were seen in Qamishli and [[Al-Hasakah|Hasakeh]].

[[Killing of Rafic Hariri|Assassination]] of [[Rafic Hariri]] in 2005 led to international condemnation and triggered a popular ''[[Cedar Revolution|Intifada]]'' in [[]], known as "the Cedar Revolution", which forced the [[Assad regime]] to end its 29-year-old [[ occupation of |military occupation in ]]. On 6 September 2007, foreign jet fighters, suspected as , reportedly carried out [[Operation Orchard]] against a suspected nuclear reactor under construction by [[]]n technicians.

====  Revolution and Civil War ====

Nepotism of ruling elites and [[authoritarian]] regime caused [[ Revolution]] as part of the wider [[Arab Spring]]. Public demonstrations across  began on 26 January 2011 and developed into a nationwide uprising. Protesters demanded the resignation of Assad, the overthrow of his government, and an end to nearly five decades of Ba'ath Party rule. Since spring 2011, the  government deployed the  Army to quell the uprising, and several cities were besieged, though the unrest continued. According to some witnesses, soldiers, who refused to open fire on civilians, were summarily executed by the  Army. The  government denied reports of defections, and blamed armed gangs for causing trouble. Since early autumn 2011, civilians and army defectors began forming fighting units, which began an [[ Civil War|insurgency campaign]] against the  Army. The insurgents unified under the banner of the [[Free  Army]] and fought in an increasingly organized fashion; however, the civilian component of the armed opposition lacked an organized leadership.

The [[Arab League]], the , the European Union states, the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Cooperation Council states]], and other countries have condemned the use of violence against the protesters.  and  have avoided condemning the government or applying sanctions, saying that such methods could escalate into foreign intervention. However, military intervention has been ruled out by most countries. The Arab League suspended 's membership over the government's response to the crisis, but sent an [[Arab League Monitors in |observer mission]] in December 2011, as part of its [[ conflict peace proposals|proposal for peaceful resolution]] of the crisis.

By 2024, the  civil war had resulted in more than 600,000 deaths, with pro-Assad forces causing more than 90% of the [[Casualties of the  civil war|total civilian casualties]].{{efn|Sources:}} Between March 2011 and March 2021, more than 306,000 civilians were killed in the civil war.'''''' The war led to a [[Refugees of the  civil war|massive refugee crisis]], with an estimated 7.6 million [[Forced displacement|internally displaced people]] (July 2015 [[UNHCR]] figure) and over 5 million refugees (July 2017 registered by [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]]). The war has also worsened economic conditions, with more than 90% of the population living in poverty and 80% facing food insecurity.{{Efn|}}{{Efn|Sources:

Taking an advantage of ongoing civil war, the [[Islamic State|Islamic State of  and ]] (ISIS) won many battles against the rebel factions and the  government in 2014. ISIS was able to seize control of large parts of Eastern , prompting a -led coalition to launch an [[War against the Islamic State|aerial bombing campaign]] against ISIS, while providing [[US intervention in the  civil war|ground support]] and supplies to the [[ Democratic Forces]] (SDF), a Kurdish-dominated coalition led by the [[People's Defense Units]] (YPG).

In August 2016,  launched a [[ involvement in the  civil war|multi-pronged invasion]] of northern , in response to the creation of the Kurdish-led [[Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East |Autonomous Administration of North and East ]], also known as Rojava, while also fighting ISIS and government forces in the process. During this time,  helped establish the [[ National Army]] (SNA) out of remnants of the Free  Army. [[ intervention in the  civil war|]] and later  also [[ intervention in the  civil war|intervened]] in the civil war on behalf of the Assad government to help defeat ISIS and attack both SDF and SNA. The ISIS eventually lost its territory after the [[Fall of Mosul|fall of IS in Mosul]] and increasingly resorted to more terror bombings and insurgency operations that continues in present.

==== Rebel offensive and fall of the Ba'athist regime ====

In December 2024, violence flared up once again. Rebel factions, led by the Islamist group [[Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham]] (HTS), [[Battle of Aleppo (2024)|took control of Aleppo]] in a lightning offensive, prompting a retaliatory airstrike campaign by  regime forces, supported by [[ Aerospace Forces| aviation assets]]. The strikes, which targeted population centers and several hospitals in [[Idlib insurgency|rebel-held]] city of [[Idlib]], resulted in at least 25 deaths according to the White Helmets rescue group. NATO issued a joint statement calling for the protection of civilians and critical infrastructure to prevent further displacement and ensure humanitarian access. They stressed the urgent need for a -led political solution, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2254, which advocates for dialogue between the  government and opposition forces.

The [[2024  opposition offensives|rebel offensive]], which had begun on 27 November, continued its [[2024 Hama offensive|advance into Hama province]] following their capture of Aleppo. On 30 November, Brigadier General [[Hossam Louka]], director of the [[General Intelligence Directorate ()|General Security Directorate]], attempted to stage a coup in Damascus while Bashar al-Assad was in Moscow, but would be foiled by Bashar's younger brother [[Maher al-Assad|Maher]]. On 4 December, fierce clashes erupted in Hama province as the  army engaged rebel forces in a bid to halt their advance on the key city of [[Hama]]. Government forces claimed to have launched a counteroffensive with air support, pushing back rebel factions, including HTS, around six miles from the city. However, despite reinforcements, the rebels captured the city on 5 December. The fighting led to widespread displacement, with nearly 50,000 people fleeing the area and over 600 casualties reported, including 104 civilians.

Rebel forces reached the outskirts of [[Homs]] on 5 December, beginning a [[2024 Homs offensive|three-day battle]] for the city. Simultaneously, an HTS-coordinated [[Southern  offensive (2024)|mass uprising]] led by a [[Southern Operations Room|coalition of Druze tribes and opposition forces]] captured the southern cities of [[Suwayda]] and [[Daraa insurgency|Daraa]] by 6 December, and rapidly advanced northwards to encircle Damascus over the following day. Homs was captured by rebel forces by the early morning of 8 December, leaving no major regime strongholds between the rebel advance and Damascus itself.

Cut off from the [[Alawites|Alawite]] heartland of [[Tartus Governorate|Tartus]] and [[Latakia Governorate|Latakia]] governorates, faced with a rebel pincer from both north and south bearing down on Damascus, and with no hope of foreign intervention from the regime's  and  benefactors, Assadist authority over remaining regime-held territories rapidly disintegrated. The [[ Arab Armed Forces]] melted away as its soldiers abandoned their weapons and uniforms, many [[Desertion|deserting]] across the border to [[]] and [[]]. Opposition forces [[Fall of Damascus (2024)|captured]] the capital Damascus on 8 December, toppling Bashar al-Assad's government and ending the Assad family's 53-year-long rule over the country. Assad fled to [[Moscow]] with his family, where he was granted asylum.

Following the [[fall of the Assad regime]], Assad's ninth prime minister [[Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali]], with support from the opposition and [[Ahmed al-Sharaa]], remained at his post in a caretaker capacity until a [[ caretaker government|caretaker government]] led by [[Mohammed al-Bashir]] was formed the following day. Al-Jalali called for fresh elections so that the  people may choose their new leaders.

Prior to the fall of the Assad regime, Mohammed al-Bashir headed the [[ Salvation Government]] (SSG) formed in the province of [[Idlib]] by [[Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham]] (HTS), the Islamist militant organization which led the overthrow of Assad in December 2024. In general, the formation of the Transitional Government was scaling of the SSG "to the whole of ", as the composition of the new government was almost the same as that of the SSG. According to a report by the  Network for Human Rights, critics and opponents of the HTS were subject to repression in forms of enforced disappearances and tortures. Shortly after the fall of the Assad regime, [[ invasion of  (2024–present)| commenced a ground invasion]] of the [[Purple Line (ceasefire line)|Purple Line]] buffer zone near the Golan Heights, as well as commencing a series of airstrikes against  military depots and naval bases. The [[ Defense Forces| Defense Forces]] claims that it is destroying Ba'athist military infrastructure, including chemical weapons plants, so that the rebels cannot use them.

Despite the collapse of the Assad regime, -backed [[ National Army]] fighters in northern  continued their [[Manbij offensive (2024)|offensive]] against U.S.-backed [[ Democratic Forces]] (SDF) forces until a ceasefire was reached on 11 December. In February 2025, the SDF, the [[Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East |Autonomous Administration]], and the [[ Democratic Council]] decided in a meeting that SDF would merge with the [[ Armed Forces]]. The [[Operation Inherent Resolve|International Coalition against ISIS]] voiced support for continued dialogue between the SDF and the new  government as well.

The prime minister of the transitional government, Mohammed al-Bashir, has promised to allow Christians and other minorities to continue practicing their religion without interference. However, this has been met with doubts as many rebel forces had previous connections to [[al-Qaeda]] and the [[Islamic State]]. The use of a variation of the [[Islamic flag|''Tawhid'' flag]] by the new government alongside [[Flag of |the opposition flag]] also raised worries, as it implies that the new state may be [[Islam and secularism|less secular]]. [[Aisha al-Dibs]] was appointed as the Minister of Women's Affairs on 22 December 2024.

On 12 December 2024, a spokesman of the transitional government speaking to [[Agence -Presse]] said that during the government's three-month term, the [[Constitution of |constitution]] and [[People's Assembly of |parliament]] would be suspended and that a 'judicial and human rights committee' would be established to review the constitution, prior to making amendments.

On 29 January 2025, during the [[ Revolution Victory Conference]] in [[People's Palace of |Presidential Palace]], the  General Command appointed [[Ahmed al-Sharaa]] as president for the transitional period after he had served as the ''[[de facto]]'' leader following the fall of the Assad regime. 

In March 2025, the UK-based [[ Observatory for Human Rights|SOHR]] reported that  security forces and pro-government fighters had committed a [[2025 massacres of  Alawites|massacre of more than 1500 Alawite civilians]] during [[March 2025 Western  clashes|clashes in western ]]. 

On 10 March 2025, the SDF agreed to merge with the  Armed Forces after SDF leader [[Mazloum Abdi]] met with al-Sharaa. Three days later al-Sharaa signed an [[2025 Interim Constitution of |interim constitution]] covering a five-year transitional period.

On 29 March 2025, the [[ transitional government]] was announced by  President [[Ahmed al-Sharaa]] at a ceremony at the [[People's Palace of |Presidential Palace]] in [[Damascus]], in which the new ministers were sworn in and delivered speeches outlining their agendas. The government replaced the [[ caretaker government]], which was formed following the fall of the Assad regime on 8 December 2024. Since then, a number of Western governments have lifted the [[International sanctions against |sanctions on ]], most notably the  and the .
