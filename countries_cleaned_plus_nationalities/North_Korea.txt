According to [[ mythology]] in 2333 BC, the [[Old Chosŏn|Gojoseon]] Kingdom was established by the god-king [[Dangun]]. Following the end of the Three Kingdoms of  into Silla and Balhae in the late 7th century,  was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the [[Joseon dynasty]] (1392–1897). In 1897, [[Gojong of |King Gojong]] proclaimed the [[ Empire]], which was [[ under  rule|annexed]] by the [[Empire of ]] in 1910.

The  Peninsula was inhabited as early as the [[Lower Paleolithic]] period.

According to 's [[Civil religion|founding mythology]], the history of  begins with the founding of Joseon (also known as "[[Old Chosŏn|Gojoseon]]", or "Old Joseon", to differentiate it from the 14th century dynasty) in 2333 BC by the legendary [[Dangun]]. Gojoseon was noted in  records in the early 7th century. Gojoseon expanded until it controlled the northern  Peninsula and parts of [[Manchuria]]. [[Gija Joseon]] was purportedly founded in the 12th century BC, but its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era. In 108 BC, the [[Han dynasty]] [[Gojoseon–Han War|defeated]] [[Wiman Joseon]] and installed [[Four Commanderies of Han|four commanderies]] in the northern  peninsula. Three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades. As [[Lelang Commandery]] was destroyed and rebuilt around this time, the place gradually moved toward Liaodong.{{Clarify|reason=Grammar and wording is a bit unusual; not sure of meaning|date=April 2023}} Thus, its force was diminished and only served as a trade center until it was conquered by Goguryeo in 313.

Beginning around 300 BC, the [[Japonic]]-speaking [[Yayoi people]] from the  Peninsula entered the  islands and displaced or intermingled with the original [[Jōmon people|Jōmon]] inhabitants. The linguistic homeland of Proto-[[]] is located somewhere in southern [[Siberia]]/[[Manchuria]], such as the [[Liao River]] area or the [[Amur]] River area. Proto- arrived in the southern part of the  Peninsula at around 300 BC, replacing and assimilating Japonic-speakers and likely causing the [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] migration.

=== Three Kingdoms of  ===
During the [[Proto–Three Kingdoms period]], the states of [[Buyeo]], [[Okjeo]], [[Eastern Ye|Dongye]], and [[Samhan]] occupied the whole  peninsula and southern Manchuria. From them, the [[Three Kingdoms of ]] emerged: [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], and [[Silla]].

Goguryeo, the largest and most powerful among them, was a highly militaristic state and competed with various  dynasties during its 700 years of history. Goguryeo experienced a golden age under [[Gwanggaeto the Great]] and his son [[Jangsu of Goguryeo|Jangsu]], who both subdued Baekje and Silla during their respective reigns, achieving a brief unification of the Three Kingdoms and becoming the most dominant power on the  Peninsula. In addition to contesting control of the  Peninsula, Goguryeo had many [[Military history of Goguryeo|military conflicts]] with various [[Dynasties of | dynastie]]s, most notably the [[Goguryeo–Sui War]], in which Goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men.

Baekje was a maritime power, sometimes called the "[[Phoenicia]] of East Asia". Its maritime ability was instrumental in the dissemination of [[East Asian Buddhism|Buddhism throughout East Asia]] and spreading continental culture to . Baekje was once a great military power on the  Peninsula, especially during the time of [[Geunchogo of Baekje|Geunchogo]], but was critically defeated by Gwanggaeto the Great and declined.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}} Silla was the smallest and weakest of the three, but used opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful  kingdoms, and eventually [[Tang dynasty|Tang ]], to its advantage.

[[File:History of -Inter-country Age-830 CE.gif|thumb|[[Balhae]] (violet) and [[Unified Silla|Silla]] (blue), circa 830 AD]]

In 676, the unification of the Three Kingdoms by Silla led to the [[Northern and Southern States period]], in which [[Balhae]] controlled the northern parts of Goguryeo, and much of the  Peninsula was controlled by [[Unified Silla|Later Silla]]. Relationships between  and  remained relatively peaceful during this time. Balhae was founded by a [[Go of Balhae|Goguryeo general]] and formed as a successor state to Goguryeo. During its height, Balhae controlled most of Manchuria and parts of the  Far East and was called the "Prosperous Country in the East".

[[Late Silla]] was a wealthy country, and its metropolitan capital of [[Gyeongju]] grew to become the fourth largest city in the world. It experienced a golden age of art and culture, exemplified by monuments such as [[Hwangnyongsa]], [[Seokguram]], and the [[Bell of King Seongdeok|Emille Bell]]. It also carried on the maritime legacy and prowess of Baekje, and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of East Asia and the trade between , , and , most notably during the time of [[Chang Pogo]]. In addition, Silla people made overseas communities in  on the [[Shandong Peninsula]] and the mouth of the [[Yangtze]] River. However, Silla was later weakened due to internal strife and the revival of successor states [[Later Baekje|Baekje]] and [[Taebong|Goguryeo]], which culminated into the [[Later Three Kingdoms]] period in the late 9th century.

Buddhism flourished during this time. Many [[ Buddhism| Buddhists]] gained great fame among  Buddhist circles and greatly contributed to [[ Buddhism]]. Examples of significant  Buddhists from this period include [[Woncheuk]], [[Wonhyo]], [[Uisang]], [[Kim Hwasang|Musang]], and [[Kim Gyo-gak]]. Kim was a Silla prince whose influence made [[Mount Jiuhua]] one of the Four [[Sacred Mountains of |Sacred Mountains]] of  Buddhism.

=== Unified dynasties ===
In 936, the Later Three Kingdoms were united by [[Taejo of Goryeo|Wang Geon]], who established [[Goryeo]] as the successor state of Goguryeo. Balhae had fallen to the [[Khitan Empire]] in 926, and a decade later the [[Dae Gwang-hyeon|last crown prince of Balhae]] fled south to Goryeo, where he was warmly welcomed and included in the ruling family by Wang Geon, thus unifying the two successor nations of Goguryeo. Like Silla, Goryeo was a highly cultural state, and invented the metal movable type [[printing press]]. After defeating the Khitan Empire, which was the most powerful empire of its time, in the [[Goryeo–Khitan War]], Goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century, during which the [[Tripitaka Koreana]] was completed and significant developments in printing and publishing occurred. This promoted education and the dispersion of knowledge on philosophy, literature, religion, and science. By 1100, there were 12 universities that produced notable scholars.

However, the [[Mongol invasions of |Mongol invasions]] in the 13th century greatly weakened the kingdom. Goryeo was never conquered by the Mongols, but exhausted after three decades of fighting, the  court sent its [[Wonjong of Goryeo|crown prince]] to the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] capital to swear allegiance to [[Kublai Khan]], who accepted and married one of his daughters to the  crown prince. Henceforth, Goryeo continued to rule , though as a tributary ally to the Mongols for the next 86 years. During this period, the two nations became intertwined as all subsequent  kings married Mongol princesses, and the [[Empress Gi|last empress]] of the Yuan dynasty was a  princess. In the mid-14th century, Goryeo drove out the Mongols to regain its northern territories, briefly conquered [[Liaoyang]], and defeated invasions by the [[Red Turbans invasions of Goryeo|Red Turbans]]. However, in 1392, General [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]], who had been ordered to attack , turned his army around and staged a coup.

Yi Seong-gye declared the new name of  as "Joseon" in reference to Gojoseon, and moved the capital to Hanseong (one of the old names of [[Seoul]]). The first 200 years of the [[Joseon]] dynasty were marked by peace and saw great advancements in science and education, as well as the creation of [[Hangul]] by [[Sejong the Great]] to promote literacy among the common people. The prevailing ideology of the time was [[ Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism]], which was epitomized by the [[seonbi]] class: nobles who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity. Between 1592 and 1598,  under [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] launched [[ invasions of  (1592–1598)|invasions of ]], but the advance was halted by  forces (most notably the [[Joseon Navy]] led by Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] and his renowned "[[turtle ship]]") with assistance from [[righteous army]] militias formed by  civilians, and [[Ming dynasty]]  troops. Through a series of successful battles of attrition, the  forces were eventually forced to withdraw, and relations between all parties became normalized. However, the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] took advantage of Joseon's war-weakened state and [[Manchu invasion of |invaded in 1627 and 1637]] and then [[Transition from Ming to Qing|went on to conquer]] the destabilized Ming dynasty. After normalizing relations with the new [[Qing dynasty]], Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace. Kings [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]] and [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]] particularly led a new renaissance of the Joseon dynasty during the 18th century.

In the 19th century, Joseon began experiencing economic difficulties and widespread uprisings, including the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]]. The royal in-law families had gained control of the government, leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state.{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}} In addition, the strict isolationism of the Joseon government that earned it "the [[hermit kingdom]]" became increasing ineffective due to increasing encroachment from powers such as , , and the . This is exemplified by the [[Joseon– Treaty of 1882]], in which it was compelled to open its borders.

In the late 19th century,  became a significant regional power after winning the [[First Sino- War]] against Qing  and the [[Russo- War]] against the [[ Empire]]. In 1897, King Gojong, the [[List of monarchs of |last king of ]], proclaimed Joseon as the [[ Empire]]. However,  [[– Treaty of 1905|compelled  to become its protectorate]] in 1905 and [[– Treaty of 1910|formally annexed it]] in 1910. From 1910 to the [[End of World War II in Asia|end of World War II]] in 1945,  was [[ under  rule|under  rule]]. What followed was a period of forced assimilation, in which  language, culture, and history were suppressed. This led to the [[March First Movement]] protests in 1919 and the subsequent foundation of resistance groups in exile, primarily in . Among the resistance groups was [[Provisional Government of the Republic of ]].

During the  colonial period, most  were peasants engaged in [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]]. In the 1930s,  developed mines, hydro-electric dams, steel mills, and manufacturing plants in northern  and neighboring [[Manchuria]]. The  industrial working class expanded rapidly, and many  went to work in Manchuria. As a result, 65% of 's heavy industry was located in the north, but, due to the rugged terrain, only 37% of its agriculture.

Due to its rule by , northern  had little exposure to modern, Western ideas. One partial exception was the penetration of religion. Since the arrival of missionaries in the late nineteenth century, the northwest of , and Pyongyang in particular, had been a stronghold of Christianity. As a result, Pyongyang was called the "Jerusalem of the East". A  guerrilla movement emerged in the mountainous interior and in Manchuria, harassing the  imperial authorities. One of the most prominent guerrilla leaders was the Communist Kim Il Sung.

===Division of ===
{{Main|Division of }}

Towards the end of [[World War II]], the U.S. proposed dividing the  peninsula into two occupation zones: a [[ Army Military Government in |U.S. zone]] and a [[Soviet Civil Administration|Soviet zone]]. [[Dean Rusk]] and [[Charles H. Bonesteel III]] suggested the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] as the dividing line, as it placed Seoul under U.S. control. To the ' surprise, the Soviets accepted their proposal and agreed to divide  at that line.

After the [[Surrender of | surrender]] at the end of World War II in 1945, [[Division of |the  Peninsula was divided]] into two occupation zones along the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]], with the northern half of the peninsula [[Soviet Civil Administration|occupied by the Soviet Union]] and the southern half [[ Army Military Government in |by the ]]. Negotiations on reunification failed. Soviet general [[Terentii Shtykov]] recommended the establishment of the [[Soviet Civil Administration]] in October 1945, and supported Kim Il Sung as chairman of the [[Provisional People's Committee of ]], established in February 1946. In September 1946, South  citizens [[Autumn Uprising of 1946|rose up against the Allied Military Government]]. In April 1948, an [[Jeju uprising|uprising of the Jeju islanders]] was violently crushed. The South declared its statehood in May 1948 and two months later the ardent anti-communist [[Syngman Rhee]] became its ruler. The Democratic People's Republic of  was established in the North on 9 September 1948. Shtykov served as the first Soviet ambassador, while Kim Il Sung became premier.

Soviet forces withdrew from the North in 1948, and most  forces withdrew from the South in 1949. Ambassador Shtykov suspected Rhee was planning to invade the North and was sympathetic to Kim's goal of  unification under socialism. The two successfully lobbied Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] to support a quick war against the South, which culminated in the outbreak of the  War.

The [[military of ]] invaded the South on 25 June 1950, and swiftly overran most of the country. The [[United Nations Command]] (UNC) was subsequently established following the [[UN Security Council]]'s recognition of North  aggression against . The motion passed because the [[Soviet Union]], a close ally of  and a member of the UN Security Council, was boycotting the UN over its recognition of the [[Taiwan|Republic of ]] rather than the People's Republic of . The UNC, led by the , intervened to defend the South, and rapidly advanced into . As they neared the border with , [[People's Volunteer Army| forces]] intervened on behalf of , shifting the balance of the war again. Fighting ended on 27 July 1953, with [[ Armistice Agreement|an armistice]] that approximately restored the original boundaries between North and , but no peace treaty was signed. Approximately 3 million people died in the  War, with a higher proportional civilian death toll than [[World War II]] or the [[ War]]. In both per capita and absolute terms,  was the country most devastated by the war, which resulted in the death of an estimated 12–15% of the North  population ({{circa}} 10 million), "a figure close to or surpassing the proportion of [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|Soviet citizens killed in World War II]]", according to [[Charles K. Armstrong]]. As a result of the war, almost every substantial building in  was destroyed.{{sfn|Jager|2013|pp=237–242}} Some have referred to the conflict as a civil war, with other factors involved.

The post-war 1950s and 1960s saw an ideological shift in , as Kim Il Sung sought to consolidate his power. Kim Il Sung was highly critical of Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and his [[de-Stalinization]] policies and critiqued Khrushchev as revisionist.{{sfn|Armstrong|2010|p=9}} During the 1956 [[August Faction Incident]], Kim Il Sung successfully resisted efforts by the Soviet Union and  to depose him in favor of [[Soviet  faction|Soviet ]] or the pro- [[Yan'an faction]]. Some scholars believe that the 1956 August incident was an example of  demonstrating political independence.{{Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=XV}} However, most scholars consider the final withdrawal of  troops from  in October 1958 to be the latest date when  became effectively independent. In the late 1950s and early 1960s,  sought to distinguish itself internationally by becoming a leader of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and promoting the ideology of ''[[Juche]]''. In  policymaking,  was considered among the [[Captive Nations]]. Despite its efforts to break out of the Soviet and  spheres of influence,  remained closely aligned with both countries throughout the Cold War.

Industry was the favored sector in . Industrial production returned to pre-war levels by 1957. In 1959, relations with  had improved somewhat, and  began allowing the repatriation of  citizens in the country. The same year,  revalued the [[North  won]], which held greater value than its South  counterpart. Until the 1960s, economic growth was higher than in , and North  GDP per capita was equal to that of its southern neighbor as late as 1976.{{sfn|Country Study|2009|pp=xxxii, 46}} However, by the 1980s, the economy had begun to stagnate; it started its long decline in 1987 and almost completely collapsed after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, when all Soviet aid was suddenly halted.{{Sfn||2007|pp=97–99}}

An internal CIA study acknowledged various achievements of the North  government post-war: compassionate care for war orphans and children in general, a radical improvement in the status of women, free housing, free healthcare, and health statistics particularly in life expectancy and infant mortality that were comparable to even the most advanced nations up until the [[North  famine]]. Life expectancy in the North was 72 before the famine which was only marginally lower than in the South. The country once boasted a comparatively developed healthcare system; pre-famine  had a network of nearly 45,000 family practitioners with some 800 hospitals and 1,000 clinics.

The relative peace between the North and South following the armistice was interrupted by border skirmishes, celebrity abductions, and assassination attempts. The North failed in several assassination attempts on South  leaders, such as [[Blue House raid|in 1968]], 1974, and the [[Rangoon bombing]] in 1983; tunnels were found under the DMZ and tensions flared over the [[ axe murder incident|axe murder incident]] at [[Panmunjom]] in 1976. For almost two decades after the war, the two states did not seek to negotiate with one another. In 1971, secret, high-level contacts began to be conducted culminating in the 1972 [[July 4 South–North Joint Statement]] that established principles of working toward peaceful reunification. The talks ultimately failed because in 1973,  declared its preference that the two  should seek separate memberships in international organizations.

The Soviet Union was [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] on 26 December 1991, ending its aid and support to . In 1992, as Kim Il Sung's health began deteriorating, his son Kim Jong Il slowly began taking over various state tasks. Kim Il Sung [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il Sung|died]] of a [[heart attack]] in 1994; Kim Jong Il declared a three-year period of national mourning, afterward officially announcing his position as the new leader.

Flooding in the mid-1990s exacerbated the economic crisis, severely damaging crops and infrastructure and leading to [[North  famine|widespread famine]] that the government proved incapable of curtailing, resulting in the deaths of between 240,000 and 420,000 people and leading to the flight of many North  into ,  and neighboring countries. In , these illegal  child immigrants are called the [[Kotjebi]]. In 1996, the government accepted UN food aid.

Kim Jong Il instituted a policy called ''[[Songun]]'', or "military first". The international environment changed once [[George W. Bush]] became U.S. President in 2001, whose administration rejected 's Sunshine Policy and the Agreed Framework. Bush included  in his [[axis of evil]] in his [[2002 State of the Union Address]].
