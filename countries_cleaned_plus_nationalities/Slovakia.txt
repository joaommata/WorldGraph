The oldest surviving human artefacts from  are found near [[Nové Mesto nad Váhom]] and are dated at 270,000&nbsp;BCE, in the [[Lower Paleolithic|Early Paleolithic]] era. These ancient tools, made by the [[Clactonian]] technique, bear witness to the ancient habitation of .

Other [[stone tool]]s from the [[Middle Paleolithic]] era (200,000–80,000&nbsp;BCE) come from the Prévôt (Prepoštská) cave in [[Bojnice]] and from other nearby sites. The most important discovery from that era is a [[Neanderthal]] [[human skull|cranium]] (c. 200,000 BCE), discovered near [[Gánovce]], a village in northern .

Archaeologists have found prehistoric human skeletons in the region, as well as numerous objects and vestiges of the [[Gravettian]] culture, principally in the river valleys of [[Nitra (river)|Nitra]], [[Hron]], [[Ipeľ]], [[Váh]] and as far as the city of [[Žilina]], and near the foot of the [[Vihorlat Mountains|Vihorlat]], Inovec, and [[Tribeč]] mountains, as well as in the [[Myjava]] Mountains. The most well-known finds include the oldest female statue made of [[mammoth]] bone (22,800&nbsp;BCE), the famous [[Venus of Moravany]]. The statue was found in the 1940s in [[Moravany nad Váhom]] near [[Piešťany]]. Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca thermophile [[gastropoda|gastropods]] of the [[Tertiary (period)|Tertiary]] period have come from the sites of Zákovská, Podkovice, Hubina, and Radošina. These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Central Europe]].

=== Bronze Age ===
During the [[Bronze Age]], the geographical territory of modern-day  went through three stages of development, stretching from 2000 to 800&nbsp;BCE. <!--I am not sure what the following sentences mean, so I put them into this comment: To this, their period belongs the well-known funeral culture of the [[Little Carpathians|Carpathians]] and that of the middle [[Danube]]. During the later Neolithic Age a considerable growth in cultural regions took place in .--> Major cultural, economic, and political development can be attributed to the significant growth in production of copper, especially in central  (for example in [[Špania Dolina]]) and northwest . [[Copper]] became a stable source of prosperity for the local population.

After the disappearance of the [[Čakany]] and [[Velatice]] cultures, the [[Lusatian culture|Lusatian]] people expanded building of strong and complex fortifications, with the large permanent buildings and administrative centres. Excavations of Lusatian [[Hillfort|hill forts]] document the substantial development of trade and agriculture at that period. The richness and diversity of tombs increased considerably. The inhabitants of the area manufactured arms, shields, jewellery, dishes, and statues.

=== Iron Age ===
[[File:Boii Biatec 1st. cen BC 2940416.jpg|thumb|[[Biatec]], presumably a king, who appeared on the Celtic coins minted by the [[Boii]] at the current location of Bratislava, 1st century B.C.]]

==== Hallstatt Period ====
The arrival of tribes from [[Thrace]] disrupted the people of the Kalenderberg culture, who lived in the hamlets located on the plain ([[Sereď]]) and in the hill forts like Molpír, near [[Smolenice]], in the [[Little Carpathians]]. During Hallstatt times, monumental burial mounds were erected in western , with princely equipment consisting of richly decorated vessels, ornaments and decorations. The burial rites consisted entirely of cremation. Common people were buried in flat urnfield cemeteries.

A special role was given to weaving and the production of textiles. The local power of the "Princes" of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] disappeared in  during the century before the middle of first millennium BCE, after strife between the [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Thracian people and locals, resulting in abandonment of the old hill-forts. Relatively depopulated areas soon caught the interest of emerging [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, who advanced from the south towards the north, following the  rivers, peacefully integrating into the remnants of the local population.

==== La Tène Period ====
From around 500&nbsp;BCE, the territory of modern-day  was settled by [[Celt]]s, who built powerful ''[[oppida]]'' on the sites of modern-day [[Bratislava]] and [[Devín]]. [[Biatec]]s, [[silver coin]]s with inscriptions in the Latin alphabet, represent the first known use of writing in . At the northern regions, remnants of the local population of Lusatian origin, together with Celtic and later Dacian influence, gave rise to the unique [[Púchov culture]], with advanced crafts and iron-working, many hill-forts and fortified settlements of central type with the coinage of the "Velkobysterecky" type (no inscriptions, with a horse on one side and a head on the other). This culture is often connected with the Celtic tribe mentioned in Roman sources as [[Cotini]].

==== Roman Period ====
[[File:Trencin-Roman2.JPG|thumb|A Roman inscription at the castle hill of [[Trenčín]] (178–179 AD)]]
From 2&nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]], the expanding [[Roman Empire]] established and maintained a series of outposts around and just south of the [[Danube]], the largest of which were known as [[Carnuntum]] (whose remains are on the main road halfway between [[Vienna]] and [[Bratislava]]) and [[Brigetio]] (present-day [[Szőny]] at the - border). Such Roman border settlements were built on the present area of [[Rusovce]], currently a suburb of [[Bratislava]]. The military fort was surrounded by a civilian [[vicus]] and several farms of the [[villa rustica]] type. The name of this settlement was [[Gerulata]]. The military fort had an auxiliary cavalry unit, approximately 300 horses strong, modelled after the [[Cananefates]]. The remains of Roman buildings have also survived in [[Stupava, |Stupava]], [[Devín Castle]], Bratislava Castle Hill, and the Bratislava-[[Dúbravka, Bratislava|Dúbravka]] suburb.

Near the northernmost line of the Roman hinterlands, the [[Limes Romanus]], there existed the winter camp of [[Trenčín|Laugaricio]] (modern-day [[Trenčín]]) where the Auxiliary of Legion&nbsp;II fought and prevailed in a decisive battle over the Germanic [[Quadi]] tribe in 179&nbsp;CE during the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. The Kingdom of [[Vannius]], a kingdom founded by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]] tribes of [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]], as well as several small Germanic and [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribes]], including the Osi and [[Cotini]], existed in western and central  from 8–6&nbsp;BCE to 179&nbsp;CE.

=== Great invasions from the fourth to seventh centuries ===
In the second and third centuries CE, the [[Huns]] began to leave the [[Eurasian Steppe|Central Asian steppes]]. They crossed the Danube in 377&nbsp;CE and occupied [[Pannonia]], which they used for 75&nbsp;years as their base for launching looting-raids into Western Europe. However, [[Attila]]'s death in 453 brought about the disappearance of the [[Huns|Hunnic empire]]. In 568, a Turko-Mongol tribal confederacy, the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], conducted its invasion into the Middle Danube region. The Avars occupied the lowlands of the [[Pannonian Plain]] and established an empire dominating the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]].

In [[623]], the [[Early Slavs|Slavic population]] living in the western parts of Pannonia seceded from their empire after a revolution led by [[Samo]], a Frankish merchant. After 626, the Avar power started a gradual decline but its reign lasted to 804.

=== Avars ===
In 568, the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], under Khagan [[Bayan I]] established an empire in the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]] that lasted for 250 years.

=== Slavic states ===
The [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes settled in the territory of present-day  in the fifth century. Western  was the centre of [[Samo]]'s empire in the seventh century. A Slavic state known as the [[Principality of Nitra]] arose in the eighth century and its ruler [[Pribina]] had the first known Christian church of the territory of present-day  consecrated by 828. Together with neighbouring [[Moravia]], the principality formed the core of the [[Great Moravia]]n Empire from 833. The high point of this Slavonic empire came with the arrival of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in 863, during the reign of [[Duke]] [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]], and the territorial expansion under [[King]] [[Svätopluk I]].

==== Great Moravia (830–before 907) ====
{{Main|Great Moravia}}

[[File:Cyril a metod zilina.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|A statue of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius]] in [[Žilina]]. In 863, they introduced [[Christianity]] to what is now .]]

Great Moravia arose around 830 when [[Mojmir I of Moravia|Mojmír I]] unified the [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes settled north of the [[Danube]] and extended the Moravian supremacy over them. When Mojmír I endeavoured to secede from the supremacy of the king of [[East Francia]] in 846, King [[Louis the ]] deposed him and assisted Mojmír's nephew [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]] (846–870) in acquiring the throne. The new monarch pursued an independent policy: after stopping a Frankish attack in 855, he also sought to weaken the influence of Frankish priests preaching in his realm. [[Rastislav of Moravia|Duke Rastislav]] asked the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Michael III]] to send teachers who would interpret Christianity in the Slavic vernacular.

In 862, Prince [[Rastislav of Moravia]] rebelled against the [[Franks]], and after hiring [[Hungarians|]] troops, won his independence; this was the first time that Hungarians expeditionary troops entered the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]].

On Rastislav's request, two brothers, Byzantine officials and missionaries [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] came in 863. Cyril developed the [[Glagolitic alphabet|first Slavic alphabet]] and translated the Gospel into the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language. Rastislav was also preoccupied with the security and administration of his state. Numerous fortified castles built throughout the country are dated to his reign and some of them (e.g.,&nbsp;''Dowina'', sometimes identified with [[Devín Castle]]) are also mentioned in connection with Rastislav by Frankish chronicles.{{full citation needed |date=March 2025}}

During Rastislav's reign, the [[Principality of Nitra]] was given to his nephew [[Svatopluk I of Moravia|Svätopluk]] as an [[appanage]]. The rebellious prince allied himself with the Franks and overthrew his uncle in 870. Similarly to his predecessor, Svätopluk I (871–894) assumed the title of the king (''rex''). During his reign, the Great Moravian Empire reached its greatest territorial extent, when not only present-day [[Moravia]] and  but also present-day northern and [[central ]], [[Lower ]], [[Bohemia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lusatia]], southern  and [[Vojvodina|northern ]] belonged to the empire, but the exact borders of his domains are still disputed by modern authors. Svatopluk also withstood attacks of the [[Hungarians|Magyar]] tribes and the [[First  Empire| Empire]], although sometimes it was he who hired the Magyars when waging war against [[East Francia]].

In 880, [[Pope John&nbsp;VIII]] set up an independent [[ecclesiastical province]] in Great Moravia with Archbishop [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Methodius]] as its head. He also named the  cleric [[Wiching]] the Bishop of [[Nitra]].
[[File:Great Moravia.svg|thumb|left|Certain and disputed borders of Great Moravia under [[Svatopluk I of Moravia|Svatopluk I]] (according to modern historians)]]

After the death of Prince Svatopluk in 894, his sons [[Mojmir II of Moravia|Mojmír&nbsp;II]] (894–906?) and [[Svatopluk&nbsp;II]] succeeded him as the Prince of Great Moravia and the Prince of Nitra respectively. However, they started to quarrel for domination of the whole empire. Weakened by an internal conflict as well as by constant warfare with [[Eastern Francia]], Great Moravia lost most of its peripheral territories.

It is not known what happened with both Mojmír&nbsp;II and Svatopluk&nbsp;II because they are not mentioned in written sources after 906. In [[Battle of Pressburg|three battles]] (4–5&nbsp;July and 9&nbsp;August 907) near [[Bratislava]], the Magyars routed [[Bavaria]]n armies. Some historians put this year as the date of the break-up of the Great Moravian Empire, due to the  conquest; other historians take the date a little bit earlier (to 902).

Great Moravia left behind a lasting legacy in Central and Eastern Europe. The [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic script]] and its successor [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] were disseminated to other Slavic countries, charting a new path in their [[Sociocultural evolution|sociocultural development]].

=== Grand Principality of  (895–1000) ===
{{Main|Principality of }}
Foundation of the [[Principality of | state]] is connected to the [[ conquest of the Carpathian Basin| conquerors]], who arrived from the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe|Pontic steppes]] as a confederation of [[Seven chieftains of the Magyars|seven tribes]]. The [[Hungarians]] arrived in the frame of a strong centralized steppe-empire under the leadership of Grand Prince [[Álmos]] and his son [[Árpád]], they became founders of the [[Árpád dynasty]], the  ruling dynasty and the  state. The [[Árpád dynasty]] claimed to be a direct descendant of the great Hun leader Attila. The [[Hungarians]] took possession of the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]] in a pre-planned manner, with a long move-in between 862 and 895. Their armies' advance may have been promoted by continuous wars among the countries of the region whose rulers still hired them occasionally to intervene in their struggles.

Just a few decades after the collapse of the [[Pannonian Avars|Avar Khaganate]] in 822, once again a steppe empire, the  Grand Principality united the Carpathian Basin under its rule. Only the [[East Francia|East Frankish Empire]] had such military power that it could intervent in the formation of the new order. His leadership also wanted to eliminate the new steppe state because the East Frankish Empire lost Pannonia and its Christian Avar taxpayers, and his territory was hit by increasing attacks by the Hungarians, especially Bavaria, which was then the eastern province of the Eastern Frankish Kingdom. In 907, three East Francian armies led by [[Luitpold, Margrave of Bavaria|Luitpold]], Margrave of Bavaria, which entered the  territory in order to expel the Hungarians from the Carpathian Basin, is annihilated by the  army at the [[Battle of Pressburg]]. Luitpold, Margrave of Bavaria, Dietmar I, Archbishop of Salzburg, Prince Sieghard, 19 counts, 2 bishops, and 3 abbots are killed in the battle, together with the majority of the soldiers. The Hungarians secured the lands they gained during the  conquest of the Carpathian Basin, and prevented a future  invasion, the Germans did not launch an imperial scale campaign against  for 123 years until 1030.

=== The Kingdom of , the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire (1000–1918) ===
{{Main|Kingdom of |Habsburg monarchy|Ottoman Empire}}

[[File:Istvan-ChroniconPictum.jpg|thumb|[[Stephen I of |Stephen I]], [[King of ]]]]

In 972, the ruling prince [[Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|Géza]] of the [[Árpád dynasty]] officially started to integrate [[Principality of |Grand Principality of ]] into Christian Western Europe. His son [[Stephen I of |Saint Stephen I]] became the first [[King of ]] after defeating his [[Paganism|pagan]] uncle [[Koppány]]. Under Stephen,  was recognised as a Catholic [[Apostolic Majesty|Apostolic Kingdom]]. Applying to [[Pope Sylvester II]], Stephen received the insignia of royalty (including probably a part of the [[Holy Crown of ]]) from the papacy.

In the years 1001–1002 and 1018–1029,  was part of the [[Kingdom of ]], having been conquered by [[Boleslaus I the Brave]]. After the territory of  was returned to , a semi-autonomous polity continued to exist (or was created in 1048 by king [[Andrew I of |Andrew I]]) called [[Duchy of Nitra]]. Comprising roughly the territory of [[Principality of Nitra]] and [[Bihar County|Bihar principality]], they formed what was called a ''tercia pars regni'', third of a kingdom.

This polity existed up until 1108/1110, after which it was not restored. After this, up until the collapse of [[-]] in 1918, the territory of  was an integral part of the  state. The ethnic composition of  became more diverse with the arrival of the [[Carpathian Germans]] in the 13th century and the [[Jews]] in the 14th century.

A significant decline in the population resulted from the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|invasion of the Mongols]] in 1241 and the subsequent famine. After the invasion, much of the territory was destroyed, but was recovered largely thanks to  king [[Béla IV of |Béla IV]]. However, in medieval times the area of  was characterised by  and [[Jewish]] immigration, burgeoning towns, construction of numerous stone castles, and the cultivation of the arts. The arrival of  element sometimes proved a problem for the autochthonous Slovaks (and even Hungarians in the broader ), since they often quickly gained most power in medieval towns, only to later refuse to share it. Breaking of old customs by Germans often resulted in national quarrels. One of which had to be sorted out by the king [[Louis I of |Louis I.]] with the proclamation [[Privilegium pro Slavis]] (Privilege for Slovaks) in the year 1381. According to this privilege, Slovaks and [[Carpathian Germans|Germans]] were to occupy each half of the seats in the city council of [[Žilina]] and the mayor should be elected each year, alternating between those nationalities. This would not be the last such case.

[[File:1franci2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|One of the commanders of a  volunteers' army captain [[Ján Francisci-Rimavský]] during the [[ Uprising of 1848–49|fight for independence from the Kingdom of ]]]]

In 1465, King [[Matthias Corvinus of |Matthias Corvinus]] founded the  Kingdom's third university, in Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]), but it was closed in 1490 after his death. [[Hussites]] also settled in the region after the [[Hussite Wars]].

Owing to the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s expansion into  territory, [[Bratislava]] was designated the new capital of  in 1536, ahead of the fall of the old  capital of [[Buda]] in 1541. It became part of the  Habsburg monarchy, marking the beginning of a new era. The territory comprising modern , then known as [[Upper ]], became the place of settlement for nearly two-thirds of the [[Magyar tribes|Magyar]] nobility fleeing the Turks and became far more linguistically and culturally  than it was before. Partly thanks to old [[Hussite]] families and Slovaks studying under [[Martin Luther]], the region then experienced a growth in [[Protestantism]]. For a short period in the 17th century, most Slovaks were [[Lutherans]]. They defied the Catholic Habsburgs and sought protection from neighbouring [[Transylvania]], a rival continuation of the [[Magyar tribes|Magyar]] state that practised religious tolerance and normally had Ottoman backing. Upper , modern , became the site of frequent wars between Catholics in the west territory and Protestants in the east, as well as against Turks; the frontier was on a constant state of military alert and heavily fortified by castles and citadels often manned by Catholic  and  troops on the Habsburg side. By 1648,  was not spared the [[Counter-Reformation]], which brought the majority of its population from Lutheranism back to [[Roman Catholicism]]. In 1655, the printing press at the [[Trnava]] university produced the Jesuit Benedikt Szöllősi's Cantus Catholici, a Catholic hymnal in  that reaffirmed links to the earlier works of Cyril and Methodius.

The [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman wars]], the rivalry between  and [[Transylvania]], and the frequent insurrections against the [[Habsburg monarchy]] inflicted a great deal of devastation, especially in the rural areas. In the [[Austro- War (1663–1664)]] a  army led by the [[Grand Vizier]] decimated . In 1682, the [[Principality of Upper ]], a short-lived Ottoman vassal state, was established in the territory of modern . Prior to this, regions on its southern rim were already encompassed in the [[Eğri Eyalet|Egri]], [[Budin Eyalet|Budin]] and [[Uyvar Eyalet|Uyvar]] [[eyalet]]s. [[Emeric Thököly|Thököly]]'s [[kuruc]] rebels from the Principality of Upper  fought alongside the Turks against the Austrians and Poles at the [[Battle of Vienna]] of 1683 led by [[John III Sobieski]]. As the [[Great  War|Turks withdrew]] from  in the late 17th century, the importance of the territory composing modern  decreased, although [[Pressburg]] retained its status as the capital of  until 1848 when it was transferred back to Buda.

During the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolution of 1848–49]], the [[ Volunteer Campaigns|Slovaks started uprising]], supporting the [[Emperor of | Emperor]], hoping for independence from the  part of the [[-|Dual Monarchy]] and greater autonomy within the empire. They failed to achieve their aim, but the conflict resulted in  rights for language in certain administrative and educational areas.

Thereafter, relations between the nationalities deteriorated (see [[Magyarisation]]), culminating in the secession of  from  after World War I.

[[File:Masaryk Independence Hall2.jpg|thumb|[[Czechoslovak declaration of independence]] by [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] in the , 1918]]

On 18 October 1918, [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik]] and [[Edvard Beneš]] declared in [[Washington, D.C.]] the [[Czechoslovak declaration of independence|independence]] for the territories of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Upper ]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] from the [[Austro- Empire]] and proclaimed a common state, [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]].

During the chaos following the break-up of -, Czechoslovakia was formed with numerous [[Czechs]], [[ people|Germans]], [[Slovaks]], [[Hungarians]] and [[Ruthenians]]. The borders were set by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint Germain]] in 1919 and [[Treaty of Trianon]] in 1920. By the treaties following the World War I, Czechoslovakia emerged as a sovereign European state.

During the [[Interwar period]], democratic Czechoslovakia was allied with , and also with [[]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] ([[Little Entente]]); however, the [[Locarno Treaties]] of 1925 left East European security open. Both Czechs and Slovaks enjoyed a period of relative prosperity. There was progress in not only the development of the country's economy but also culture and educational opportunities. Yet the [[Great Depression]] caused a sharp economic downturn, followed by political disruption and insecurity in Europe.

In the 1930s, Czechoslovakia came under continuous pressure from the [[Revanchism|revanchist]] governments of ,  and  who used the aggrieved minorities in the country as a useful vehicle. Revision of the borders was called for, as Czechs constituted only 43% of the population. Eventually, this pressure led to the [[Munich Agreement]] of September 1938, which allowed the majority ethnic Germans in the [[Sudetenland]], borderlands of Czechoslovakia, to join with . The remaining minorities stepped up their pressures for autonomy and the State became federalised, with Diets in  and Ruthenia. The remainder of Czechoslovakia was renamed Czecho- and promised a greater degree of  political autonomy. This, however, failed to materialise. Parts of southern and eastern  were also reclaimed by  at the [[First Vienna Award]] of November 1938.

[[File:Jozef Tiso (Berlin).jpg|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]] greeting [[Jozef Tiso]], president of the (First) [[ Republic (1939–1945)| Republic]], a client state of Nazi  during World War II, 1941]]
After the [[Munich Agreement]] and its [[Vienna Award]], [[Nazi ]] threatened to annex part of  and allow the remaining regions to be partitioned by  or  unless independence was declared. Thus,  seceded from [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czecho-]] in March 1939 and allied itself, as demanded by , with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s coalition. Secession had created the first  state in history.

A [[one-party state|one-party]] [[Clerical fascism|clerical fascist]] [[ Republic (1939–1945)| Republic]] governed by the far-right [[ People's Party|Hlinka's  People's Party]] was led by President [[Jozef Tiso]] and Prime Minister [[Vojtech Tuka]]. The (First)  Republic is primarily known for its [[collaborationism|collaboration]] with Nazi , which included sending troops to the [[ invasion of |invasion of ]] in [[September Campaign|September 1939]] and the [[Operation Barbarossa|Soviet Union]] in 1941. On 24&nbsp;November 1940,  joined the [[Axis powers|Axis]] when its leaders signed the [[Tripartite Pact]]. The country was strongly influenced by  and gradually became a [[puppet state|puppet regime]] in many respects.

Meanwhile, the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] sought to reverse the [[Munich Agreement]] and the subsequent [[ occupation of Czechoslovakia]] and to return the Republic to its 1937 boundaries. The government operated from [[London]] and it was ultimately considered, by those countries that recognised it, the legitimate government for [[Czechoslovakia]] throughout the Second World War.

The [[History of the Jews in |local Jewish population]] was heavily persecuted. As part of the [[Holocaust in ]], 75,000 Jews out of 80,000 who remained on  territory after  had seized southern regions were deported and taken to  [[death camps]]. Thousands of Jews, Gypsies and other politically undesirable people remained in  forced labour camps in [[Sereď concentration camp|Sereď]], Vyhne, and Nováky. Tiso, through the granting of presidential exceptions, allowed between 1,000 and 4,000 people crucial to the war economy to avoid deportations.
Under Tiso's government and  occupation, the vast majority of 's pre-war Jewish population (between 75,000 and 105,000 individuals including those who perished from the occupied territory) were murdered. The  state paid  500 [[Reichsmark|RM]] per every deported Jew for "retraining and accommodation" (a similar but smaller payment of 30 RM was paid by [[Independent State of |]]).

After it became clear that the Soviet [[Red Army]] was going to push the Nazis out of eastern and central Europe, an anti-Nazi [[resistance movement]] launched. Internal opposition to the fascist government's policies culminated in the [[ National Uprising]], near the end of summer 1944. A bloody  occupation and a guerilla war followed. Germans and their [[Hlinka Guard|local collaborators]] completely destroyed 93 villages and massacred thousands of civilians, often hundreds at a time. Although the uprising was eventually suppressed, [[ partisans|partisan resistance]] continued. The territory of  was liberated by Soviet and  forces by the end of April 1945.

As a result of the [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945, Czechoslovakia came under the influence of the [[Soviet Union]].

After World War&nbsp;II, Czechoslovakia was reconstituted and [[Jozef Tiso]] was executed in 1947 for collaboration with the Nazis. More than [[Hungarians in #Population exchanges|80,000 Hungarians]] and 32,000 Germans were forced to leave , in a series of [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|population transfers]] initiated by the Allies at the [[Potsdam Conference]]. Out of about 130,000 [[Carpathian Germans]] in  in 1938, by 1947 only some 20,000 remained.{{failed verification|date=June 2014}}

In February 1948, the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]], with Soviet backing, assumed undisputed control over the government of [[Czechoslovakia]] through a [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|coup d'état]] and Czechoslovakia came under direct occupation of the Soviet Union and its [[Warsaw Pact]]. It became a [[puppet state]] of the Soviet Union, but it was never part of the Soviet Union and remained independent to a certain degree.

Borders with the West were protected by the [[Iron Curtain]]. About 600 people, men, women, and children, were killed on the Czechoslovak border with  and [[West ]] between 1948 and 1989. 8,240 people went to forced labour camps in 1948–1953.

On 11 July 1960, the [[1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia|Constitution of Czechoslovakia]] was promulgated, changing the name of the country from the "Czechoslovak Republic" to the "Czechoslovak Socialist Republic".

In 1968, following the [[Prague Spring]], the country was [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invaded]] by the Warsaw Pact forces ([[People's Republic of ]], [[ People's Republic|People's Republic of ]], [[ People's Republic|People's Republic of ]], and [[Soviet Union]], with the exception of [[Socialist Republic of ]] and [[People's Socialist Republic of ]]), ending a [[Prague Spring|period of liberalisation]] under the leadership of [[Alexander Dubček]]. 137 Czechoslovak civilians were killed and 500 seriously wounded during the invasion.

In 1969, Czechoslovakia became a [[Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation|federation]] of the [[ Socialist Republic]] and the [[ Socialist Republic]] within the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]].

[[File:Fidel Castro 1972 (SOA Prague).jpg|thumb|Czechoslovak communist leader [[Gustáv Husák]] (right) with [[Fidel Castro]] during his state visit of Czechoslovakia, 1972]]

Czechoslovakia was allied with communist regimes worldwide. As one of the first countries in the world acknowledged [[Kim Il-sung]]'s [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]]. After the beginning of the [[ War]], Czechoslovakia protested against measures taken by the Security Council.
