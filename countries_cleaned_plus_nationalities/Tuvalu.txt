===Prehistory===
The [[History of the Polynesian people|origins of the people of ]] are addressed in the theories regarding the migration into the Pacific that began about 3,000 years ago. During pre-European-contact times, there was frequent canoe voyaging between the nearer islands including  and [[]]. Eight of the nine islands of  were inhabited. This explains the origin of the name, , which means 'eight standing together' in [[ language|]] (compare to ''*walu'' meaning 'eight' in [[Proto-Austronesian language#Numerals|Proto-Austronesian]]). Possible evidence of human-made fires in the [[Caves of Nanumanga]] suggests humans may have occupied the islands for thousands of years.

An important [[ mythology|creation myth in the islands of ]] is the story of ''te Pusi mo te Ali'' (the Eel and the Flounder), who are said to have created the [[islands of ]]. ''Te Ali'' (the [[Bothidae|flounder]]) is believed to be the origin of the flat [[atoll]]s of  and ''te Pusi'' (the [[Moray eel|eel]]) is the model for the [[coconut]] palms that are important in the lives of Tuvaluans. The stories of the ancestors of the Tuvaluans vary from island to island. On [[Niutao]], Funafuti and [[Vaitupu]], the founding ancestor is described as being from , whereas on [[Nanumea]], the founding ancestor is described as being from [[]].

===Early contacts with other cultures===

 was first sighted by Europeans on 16 January 1568, during the voyage of [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira|Álvaro de Mendaña]] from , who sailed past [[Nui (atoll)|Nui]] and charted it as ''Isla de Jesús'' ( for "Island of Jesus") because the previous day was the feast of the [[Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus|Holy Name]]. Mendaña made contact with the islanders but was unable to land. During Mendaña's second voyage across the Pacific, he passed [[Niulakita]] on 29 August 1595, which he named ''La Solitaria''.

Captain [[John Byron]] passed through the islands of  in 1764, during his circumnavigation of the globe as captain of the {{HMS|Dolphin|1751|3}}. He charted the atolls as ''Lagoon Islands''. The first recorded sighting of [[Nanumea]] by Europeans was by  naval officer [[Francisco Antonio Mourelle|Francisco Mourelle de la Rúa]] who sailed past it on 5 May 1781 as captain of the frigate ''La Princesa'', when attempting a southern crossing of the Pacific from the  to [[New ]]. He charted Nanumea as ''San Augustin''. Keith S. Chambers and Doug Munro (1980) identified [[Niutao]] as the island that Mourelle also sailed past on 5 May 1781, thus solving what Europeans had called ''The Mystery of Gran Cocal''. Mourelle's map and journal named the island ''El Gran Cocal'' ('The Great Coconut Plantation'); however, the latitude and longitude was uncertain. Longitude could be reckoned only crudely at the time, as accurate [[Marine chronometer|chronometers]] did not become available until the late 18th century.

In 1809, Captain Patterson in the brig ''Elizabeth'' sighted Nanumea while passing through the northern  waters on a trading voyage from Port Jackson, Sydney,  to .
In May 1819, Arent Schuyler de Peyster, of New York, captain of the armed [[brigantine]] or [[privateer]] ''Rebecca'', sailing under British colours, passed through the southern  waters. De Peyster sighted [[Nukufetau]], and Funafuti which he named Ellice's Island after an  politician, [[Edward Ellice (merchant)|Edward Ellice]], the Member of Parliament for Coventry and the owner of the ''Rebecca''{{'}}s cargo. The name Ellice was applied to all nine islands after the work of  [[hydrographer]] [[Alexander George Findlay]].

In 1820, the  explorer [[Mikhail Lazarev]] visited Nukufetau as commander of the ''[[Mirny (sloop-of-war)|Mirny]]''. [[Louis-Isidore Duperrey]], captain of [[ ship Astrolabe (1811)|''La Coquille'']], sailed past [[Nanumanga]] in May 1824 during a circumnavigation of the Earth (1822–1825). A  expedition by the frigate ''Maria Reigersberg'' under captain Koerzen, and the corvette ''Pollux'' under captain C. Eeg, found [[Nui (atoll)|Nui]] on the morning of 14 June 1825 and named the main island ([[Fenua Tapu (isle)|Fenua Tapu]]) as ''Nederlandsch Eiland''.

[[Whaling|Whalers]] began roving the Pacific, although they visited  only infrequently because of the difficulties of landing on the atolls. The  Captain George Barrett of the [[Nantucket]] whaler ''Independence II'' has been identified as the first whaler to hunt the waters around . He bartered coconuts from the people of [[Nukulaelae]] in November 1821, and also visited [[Niulakita]]. He established a shore camp on [[Sakalua]] islet of [[Nukufetau]], where coal was used to melt down the whale blubber.

Christianity came to  in 1861 when [[Elekana]], a deacon of a [[Congregational church]] in [[Manihiki]], [[Cook Islands]], became caught in a storm and drifted for eight weeks before landing at Nukulaelae on 10 May 1861. Elekana began [[evangelism|preaching]] Christianity. He was trained at [[Malua]] Theological College, a [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS) school in , before beginning his work in establishing the [[Church of ]]. In 1865, the Rev. Archibald Wright Murray of the LMS, a [[Protestant]] congregationalist missionary society, arrived as the first European missionary; he also evangelised among the inhabitants of . By 1878 Protestantism was considered well established, as there were preachers on each island. In the later 19th and early 20th centuries, the ministers of what became the [[Church of ]] (''Te Ekalesia Kelisiano '') were predominantly Samoans, who influenced the development of the [[ language]] and the [[music of ]].

For less than a year between 1862 and 1863,  ships engaged in the so-called "[[blackbirding]]" trade, by which they recruited or impressed workers, combed the smaller islands of [[Polynesia]] from [[Easter Island]] in the eastern Pacific to  and the southern atolls of the Gilbert Islands (now ). They sought recruits to fill the extreme labour shortage in . On Funafuti and Nukulaelae, the resident traders facilitated the recruiting of the islanders by the "blackbirders". The Rev. Archibald Wright Murray, the earliest European missionary in , reported that in 1863 about 170 people were taken from Funafuti and about 250 were taken from Nukulaelae, as there were fewer than 100 of the 300 recorded in 1861 as living on Nukulaelae.

The islands came into Britain's sphere of influence in the late 19th century, when each of the Ellice Islands was declared a [[British protectorate]] by Captain [[Herbert William Sumner Gibson|Herbert Gibson]] of {{HMS|Curacoa|1878|6}}, between 9 and 16 October 1892.

===Trading firms and traders===
[[File: - Location Map (2013) - TUV - UNOCHA.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Islands of ]]]]
Trading companies became active in  in the mid-19th century; the trading companies engaged white ([[palagi]]) traders who lived on the islands. John (also known as Jack) O'Brien was the first European to settle in ; he became a trader on Funafuti in the 1850s. He married Salai, the daughter of the paramount chief of Funafuti. [[George Lewis Becke|Louis Becke]], who later found success as a writer, was a trader on [[Nanumanga]] from April 1880 until the trading station was destroyed later that year in a [[cyclone]]. He then became a trader on [[Nukufetau]].

In 1892, Captain [[Edward H. M. Davis|Edward Davis]] of {{HMS|Royalist|1883|6}} reported on trading activities and traders on each of the islands visited. Captain Davis identified the following traders in the Ellice Group: Edmund Duffy ([[Nanumea]]); [[Jack Buckland]] ([[Niutao]]); Harry Nitz ([[Vaitupu]]); Jack O'Brien (Funafuti); [[Alfred Restieaux]] and Emile Fenisot ([[Nukufetau]]); and [[Christian Martin Kleis|Martin Kleis]] ([[Nui (atoll)|Nui]]). During this time, the greatest number of palagi traders lived on the atolls, acting as agents for the trading companies. Some islands would have competing traders, while dryer islands might only have a single trader.

In the 1890s, structural changes occurred in the operation of the Pacific trading companies; they moved from a practice of having traders resident on each island to instead becoming a business operation where the [[supercargo]] (the cargo manager of a trading ship) would deal directly with the islanders when a ship visited an island. After the high point in the 1880s, the numbers of palagi traders in  declined; the last of them were [[Fred Whibley]] on Niutao, [[Alfred Restieaux]] on Nukufetau, and [[Christian Martin Kleis|Martin Kleis]] on Nui. By 1909 there were no more resident palagi traders representing the trading companies, although Whibley, Restieaux and Kleis remained in the islands until their deaths.

===Scientific expeditions and travellers===
[[File:Nukufetauman1831.jpg|thumb|left|A man from the [[Nukufetau]] atoll, drawn by [[Alfred Thomas Agate]] in 1841]]
The [[ Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] visited [[Funafuti]], [[Nukufetau]], and [[Vaitupu]] in 1841. During this expedition, engraver and illustrator [[Alfred Thomas Agate]] recorded the dress and tattoo patterns of the men of Nukufetau.

In 1885 or 1886, the  photographer [[Thomas Andrew (photographer)|Thomas Andrew]] visited Funafuti and [[Nui (atoll)|Nui]].

In 1890, [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], his wife [[Fanny Van de Grift|Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson]] and her son [[Lloyd Osbourne]] sailed on the ''Janet Nicoll'', a trading steamer owned by [[Thomas Henderson ( politician)|Henderson and Macfarlane]] of Auckland, , which operated between Sydney and Auckland and into the central Pacific. The ''Janet Nicoll'' visited three of the Ellice Islands; while Fanny records that they made landfall at Funafuti, Niutao and [[Nanumea]], Jane Resture suggests that it was more likely they landed at Nukufetau rather than Funafuti, as Fanny describes meeting [[Alfred Restieaux]] and his wife Litia; however, they had been living on Nukufetau since the 1880s. An account of this voyage was written by Fanny Stevenson and published under the title ''The Cruise of the Janet Nichol'', together with photographs taken by Robert Louis Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne.

In 1894, Count Rudolf [[Festetics family|Festetics]] de Tolna, his wife Eila (''née'' Haggin) and her daughter Blanche Haggin visited Funafuti aboard the yacht ''Le Tolna''. The Count spent several days photographing men and women on Funafuti.

The boreholes on Funafuti, at the site now called ''Darwin's Drill'', are the result of drilling conducted by the [[Royal Society of London]] for the purpose of investigating the [[formation of coral reefs]] to determine whether traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the [[coral]] of Pacific atolls. This investigation followed the work on ''[[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs]]'' conducted by [[Charles Darwin]] in the Pacific. Drilling occurred in 1896, 1897 and 1898. Professor [[Edgeworth David]] of the [[University of Sydney]] was a member of the 1896 "Funafuti Coral Reef Boring Expedition of the Royal Society", under [[William Johnson Sollas|Professor William Sollas]] and led the expedition in 1897. Photographers on these trips recorded people, communities, and scenes at Funafuti.

[[Charles Hedley]], a naturalist at the [[ Museum]], accompanied the 1896 expedition, and during his stay on Funafuti he collected [[invertebrate]] and [[ethnological]] objects. The descriptions of these were published in ''Memoir III of the  Museum Sydney'' between 1896 and 1900. Hedley also wrote the ''General Account of the Atoll of Funafuti'', ''The Ethnology of Funafuti'', and ''The Mollusca of Funafuti''. [[Edgar Ravenswood Waite|Edgar Waite]] was also part of the 1896 expedition and published ''The mammals, reptiles, and fishes of Funafuti''. [[William Joseph Rainbow|William Rainbow]] described the spiders and insects collected at Funafuti in ''The insect fauna of Funafuti''.

[[Harry Clifford Fassett]], captain's clerk and photographer, recorded people, communities and scenes at Funafuti in 1900 during a visit of [[USS Albatross (1882)|USFC ''Albatross'']] when the [[ Fish Commission]] was investigating the formation of coral reefs on Pacific atolls.

===Colonial administration===

The Ellice Islands were administered as a [[British protectorates|British Protectorate]] from 1892 to 1916, as part of the [[British Western Pacific Territories]] (BWPT), by a [[Resident Commissioner]] based in the Gilbert Islands. The administration of the BWPT ended in 1916, and the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] Colony was established, which existed until October 1975.

===Second World War===
During the [[Pacific War|Second World War]], as a [[Crown colony|British colony]] the Ellice Islands were aligned with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] of the war. Early in the war, the [[ occupation of the Gilbert Islands| invaded and occupied]] [[Butaritari|Makin]], [[Tarawa]] and other islands in what is now [[]]. The [[ Marine Corps]] landed on Funafuti on 2 October 1942, and on Nanumea and Nukufetau in August 1943. Funafuti was used as a base to prepare for the subsequent seaborne attacks on the Gilbert Islands ([[]]) that were occupied by  forces.

The islanders assisted the  forces to build airfields on Funafuti, Nanumea and Nukufetau and to unload supplies from ships. On Funafuti, the islanders shifted to the smaller islets so as to allow the  forces to build the airfield and [[Naval Base Funafuti]] on [[Fongafale]]. A Naval Construction Battalion ([[Seabees]]) built a seaplane ramp on the lagoon side of Fongafale islet, for seaplane operations by both short- and long-range seaplanes, and a compacted coral runway was also constructed on Fongafale, with runways also constructed to create [[Nanumea Airfield]] and [[Nukufetau Airfield]]. USN [[PT Boat|Patrol Torpedo Boats]] (PTs) and [[seaplane]]s were based at [[Naval Base Funafuti]] from 2 November 1942 to 11 May 1944.

The atolls of  acted as staging posts during the preparation for the [[Battle of Tarawa]] and the [[Battle of Makin]] that commenced on 20 November 1943, which were part of the implementation of "Operation Galvanic". After the war, the military airfield on Funafuti was developed into [[Funafuti International Airport]].

===Post-World War II – transition to independence===
The formation of the United Nations after World War II resulted in the [[United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization]] committing to a process of decolonisation; as a consequence, the British colonies in the Pacific started on a path to [[self-determination]].

In 1974, the ministerial government was introduced to the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] Colony through a change to the Constitution. In that year a general election was held, and a [[1974 Ellice Islands self-determination referendum|referendum was held in 1974]] to determine whether the Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands should each have their own administration. As a consequence of the referendum, separation occurred in two stages. The  Order 1975, which took effect on 1 October 1975, recognised  as a separate [[Crown Colony]] with its own government. The second stage occurred on 1 January 1976, when separate administrations were created out of the civil service of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.{{rp|169}}

In 1976,  adopted the [[ dollar]], whose currency circulates alongside the [[ dollar]], which was previously adopted in 1966.

Elections to the House of Assembly of the British Colony of  were held on 27 August 1977, with [[Toaripi Lauti]] being appointed chief minister in the House of Assembly of the Colony of  on 1 October 1977. The House of Assembly was dissolved in July 1978, with the government of Toaripi Lauti continuing as a [[caretaker government]] until the 1981 elections were held.

===Post-Independence===
[[Toaripi Lauti]] became the first [[Prime Minister of |prime minister]] on 1 October 1978, when  became an independent state.{{rp|153–177}} That date is also celebrated as the country's [[List of national independence days|Independence Day]] and is a public holiday.

On 26 October 1982, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] made a special royal tour to .

On 5 September 2000,  became the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1290|189th member of the United Nations]].

On 15 November 2022, amidst sea level rises,  announced plans as the first country in the world to build a self-digital replica in the [[metaverse]] in order to preserve its cultural heritage.

On 10 November 2023,  signed the [[– relations#– Falepili Union|Falepili Union]] treaty with . In the  language, ''Falepili'' describes the traditional values of good neighbourliness, care and mutual respect. The Treaty addresses climate change and security, with security threats encompassing major natural disasters, health pandemics and traditional security threats. The implementation of the Treaty will involve  increasing its contribution to the [[ Trust Fund]] and the [[ Coastal Adaptation Project]].  will also provide a pathway for 280 citizens of  to migrate to  each year, to enable [[Climate migration|climate-related mobility]] for Tuvaluans.
