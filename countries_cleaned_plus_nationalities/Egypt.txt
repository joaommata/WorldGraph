Evidence of [[rock carvings]] along the [[Nile]] and in surrounding oases indicates early habitation. In the [[10th millennium BCE]], a culture of [[hunter-gatherer]]s and [[fishing|fishers]] was replaced by a [[cereal|grain]]-grinding culture. Climate changes or [[overgrazing]] around 8000 [[before common era|BCE]] began to desiccate the pastoral lands of , forming the [[Sahara]]. Early [[tribal people]]s migrated to the Nile River where they developed a settled agricultural [[Economic system|economy]] and more centralised society.

By about 6000 BCE, a [[Neolithic]] culture took root in the Nile Valley. During the Neolithic era, several predynastic cultures developed independently in [[Upper and Lower ]]. The [[Badarian]] culture and the successor [[Naqada]] series are generally regarded as precursors to [[Ancient |dynastic ]]. The earliest known Lower  site, Merimda, predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years. Contemporaneous Lower  communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years, remaining culturally distinct, but maintaining frequent contact through trade. The earliest known evidence of [[ hieroglyphs| hieroglyphic]] inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery vessels, dated to about 3200 BCE.

===Ancient  (3150 BCE–305 BCE)===

Around {{circa|3150}} BCE, King [[Menes]] unified , establishing a succession of [[List of  dynasties|dynasties]] that ruled for three millennia. [[Culture of | civilisation]] thrived with distinctive achievements in [[Ancient  religion|religion]], [[Art of Ancient |art]], and [[ language|writing]]. The [[Old Kingdom]] ({{circa|2700–2200}} BCE) saw the construction of the [[ pyramids|pyramids]], including those at [[Giza Necropolis|Giza]]. A brief [[First Intermediate Period of |interregnum]] followed, succeeded by the [[Middle Kingdom of |Middle Kingdom]] ({{circa|2040}} BCE), a phase of renewed stability and prosperity under rulers such as [[Amenemhat III]].

After the [[Second Intermediate Period of |Second Intermediate Period]] and the [[Hyksos]] occupation,  was reunified by [[Ahmose I]], founder of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of |Eighteenth Dynasty]] and the [[New Kingdom of |New Kingdom]] ({{circa|1550–1070}} BCE). This era marked 's height as a major power in the region, extending influence into [[]] and the [[Levant]]. It produced many of 's most renowned [[Pharaoh]]s, [[Hatshepsut]], [[Thutmose III]], [[Akhenaten]], [[Tutankhamun]], and [[Ramesses II]], and witnessed the rise of [[Atenism]], one of the earliest forms of [[monotheism]]. Despite later invasions by [[Ancient |]], [[Kingdom of Kush|Nubians]], and [[Assyria]]ns, native dynasties eventually reasserted control.

In 525 BCE, [[Cambyses II of Persia]] conquered , beginning the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] [[satrapy]] period (the [[Twenty-seventh Dynasty of |Twenty-seventh Dynasty]]). Although several revolts occurred,  remained under Persian control until briefly regaining independence before falling again in 343 BCE. The [[Thirtieth dynasty of |Thirtieth Dynasty]] was the last native royal house. Following renewed Persian domination, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered  in 332 BCE, after which his general [[Ptolemy I Soter]] established the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].

===Ptolemaic and Roman  (305 BCE–641 CE)===

The [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] was a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] state from southern  to [[Cyrene, |Cyrene]] and south to , with [[Alexandria]] as its capital and a centre of [[|]] culture and trade. The Ptolemies adopted pharaonic traditions to legitimize their rule, appearing on monuments in  style and participating in local religious life. The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]], built c. 280 BCE, was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], later destroyed by earthquakes. The last ruler, [[Cleopatra VII]], committed suicide after [[Octavian]] captured Alexandria, ending the dynasty and paving the way for Roman annexation. Native rebellions and dynastic disputes weakened the kingdom, facilitating its annexation by Rome.

 was a wealthy imperial province of the [[Roman Empire]], supplying grain and hosting the major city of Alexandria. Governed with Roman administration and Hellenistic culture, its population primarily spoke [[Koine |]] in major cities and [[Coptic language|Coptic ]] in rural areas. Christianity reached  in the 1st century, brought by [[ Mark the Evangelist]]. During [[Diocletian]]'s reign (284–305 CE), the [[New Testament]] had been translated into  and many  Christians were persecuted. By CE 451, a distinct [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] was firmly established.

The Byzantines regained control of  after a brief [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanid Persian]] invasion early in the 7th century, until 639–42, when the country was conquered by Arab Muslim forces under [[Amr ibn al-As]]. The Arabs defeated the Byzantine armies, bringing [[Islam]] to . Alexandria briefly returned to Byzantine control in 645 but fell again to the Arabs in 646. In 654, an invasion fleet sent by [[Constans II]] was repulsed. The Arabs founded [[Fustat]], later replaced by Cairo in 969.

Under the [[Abbasid]] caliphate,  was governed through deputies residing in Baghdad. Revolts occurred frequently, including the  revolt of 828 and the uprising of 831 when Copts joined Muslims against the government. Semi-independent dynasties arose, including the [[Tulunid dynasty]] (868–905) and [[Ikhshidid dynasty]] (935–969), which maintained Abbasid allegiance while exercising local authority.

The [[Fatimid Caliphate]] ruled  from the 10th century, with [[Cairo]] as their capital. After the Fatimids, the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] governed until 1250, when the [[Mamluk]]s, a military caste of [[Turkic people|Turco]]-[[Circassians|Circassian]] origin, took control. The Mamluks ruled  for the next three centuries and maintained control over parts of the Levant. By the late 13th century,  linked trade routes connecting the Red Sea with , Malaya, and the East Indies. The mid-14th century [[Black Death]] killed about 40% of 's population.

=== Ottoman  (1517–1867) ===
{{Main| Eyalet|History of  under the Muhammad Ali dynasty}}
 was conquered by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1517, following the defeat of the [[Mamluk Sultanate]], and became a province of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Mamluks, who had dominated 's military and political life for centuries, retained influence under Ottoman rule, creating a semi-autonomous power structure. The Ottomans faced repeated challenges in maintaining control, while plagues and famines weakened the economy and civil society. Between 1687 and 1731,  experienced six major famines, including the 1784 famine that killed roughly one-sixth of the population.

In 1798, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] invaded , defeating the Mamluks at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]]. The  occupation was short-lived, but it destabilized the region and set the stage for Muhammad Ali Pasha's rise. After the  were expelled, power struggles ensued between the Ottomans, the Mamluks, and  mercenaries in Ottoman service, leaving  politically fragmented.

In 1805, [[Muhammad Ali of |Muhammad Ali Pasha]] seized power, massacring the remaining Mamluks and establishing a dynasty that would rule  until 1952. He reorganized the army along European lines, introduced conscription, and developed a centralized administration. At the same time, he promoted cash-crop agriculture, especially long-staple cotton, to integrate  into global markets. His successors, including [[Ibrahim Pasha of |Ibrahim Pasha]], [[Abbas I of |Abbas I]], [[Sa'id of |Sa'id]], and [[Isma'il Pasha of |Isma'il Pasha]], continued reforms in agriculture, science, and industry, and abolished slavery.

Muhammad Ali expanded 's control over [[Northern ]] (1820–1824), [[]] (1833), and parts of [[Arabia]] and [[]], but European powers intervened in 1841, forcing him to relinquish most of his conquests. He modernized 's infrastructure, built factories and irrigation networks, and strengthened the military, while broader education remained largely limited to military and technical training. The centralization of power and focus on military and economic modernization laid the foundation for 's transformation into a regional power.

=== Monarchical  (1867–1952) ===
{{Main|Khedivate of  {{!}} Khedivate of  (1867–1914|Sultanate of  {{!}} Sultanate of  (1914–1922)|Kingdom of  (1922–1953)}}

In 1867,  was formally granted autonomous status as a [[Khedivate of |vassal state]] of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Suez Canal]], completed in 1869 with  assistance, became a key strategic and commercial asset. Financial mismanagement and mounting debts led Isma'il Pasha to sell 's shares in the canal to Britain in 1875, increasing European influence. Rising discontent culminated in the [[Urabi revolt]], after which Britain occupied  in 1882, establishing a de facto protectorate while maintaining nominal Ottoman sovereignty. The Anglo- Condominium Agreement of 1899 placed  under joint  and  administration, though Britain retained real control. Incidents such as the [[Denshawai incident]] in 1906 intensified nationalist sentiment, laying the groundwork for political movements that challenged both Ottoman and European dominance.

In 1914, as the [[Ottoman Empire]] joined World War I alongside the Central Powers, Khedive [[Abbas II of |Abbas II]] declared support for the Ottoman side. In response, the  deposed him and installed his brother [[Hussein Kamel of |Hussein Kamel]], who assumed the title of [[Sultanate of |Sultan of ]].  was formally declared independent from the Ottoman Empire but remained under  protection.

After [[World War I]], nationalist sentiments surged. [[Saad Zaghlul]] and the [[Wafd Party]] secured popular support, but the  exiled Zaghlul and his colleagues to  on 8 March 1919, prompting the [[ revolution of 1919|first modern revolution]]. This uprising pressured the UK to issue a [[Unilateral Declaration of  Independence|declaration of independence]] on 22 February 1922. Sultan [[Fuad I of |Fuad I]] then assumed the title of King of . Despite nominal independence, Britain retained military presence and political influence.
[[File:Fuad I of , Edward VIII, & Mohamed Sa'id Paşa.jpg|thumb|[[Fuad I of ]] with [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]], 1932|left|223x223px]]
In 1923, a new constitution established a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] government. The Wafd Party won a decisive victory in the 1923–24 elections, with [[Saad Zaghloul]] becoming prime minister. The [[Anglo- Treaty of 1936|1936 treaty]] led to  troop withdrawal from most of , except the Suez Canal. The treaty left the status of [[Anglo- |]] unresolved, as real control remained with Britain.

During [[World War II]],  served as a strategic base for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] operations, particularly in [[North Africa]]. Although  declared martial law and severed diplomatic relations with [[Axis powers]], the  army did not engage directly. Political tensions persisted, highlighted by the 1942 [[Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942|Abdeen Palace Incident]], in which  forces pressured King Farouk to install a Wafd-coalition government.
[[File:1stAlameinBritDefense.jpg|thumb| infantry near [[First Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]], 17 July 1942|right|200x200px]]
After the war, nationalist and anti- sentiments intensified.  troops largely withdrew in 1947, leaving a residual presence around the Suez Canal. 's defeat in the [[First Arab- War]] fueled anti-monarchy feeling. The Wafd Party's 1950 election victory forced King Farouk to appoint [[Mostafa El-Nahas]] as prime minister. In 1951,  unilaterally renounced the [[Anglo- treaty of 1936|1936 treaty]] and demanded  troop withdrawal. The situation around the Suez Canal escalated, culminating in violent confrontations that led to the killing of 43  policemen in 1952 by  troops. The Ismailia incident outraged  and led to the subsequent [[Cairo fire|Black Saturday]] anti- riots, which saw widespread destruction in Cairo.

These events precipitated the [[ Revolution of 1952|Free Officers Movement coup]] on 22–23 July 1952, led by [[Muhammad Naguib]] and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. King Farouk abdicated in favor of his infant son, [[Fuad II of |Fuad II]], but real power rested with the [[ Revolutionary Command Council]]. By 18 June 1953, the monarchy was formally abolished, the 1923 constitution suspended, and  was declared a republic, with Naguib as president and Nasser as prime minister.

=== Republican  under Nasser (1952–1970) ===

Following the [[ revolution of 1952|1952 Revolution]] led by the [[Free Officers Movement ()|Free Officers Movement]],  came under military control, and all political parties were banned. On 18 June 1953, the [[Republic of  (1953–1958)|Republic of ]] was officially declared, with [[Muhammad Naguib]] serving as the first President. His presidency lasted less than a year and a half, as [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], a [[Pan-Arabist]] and the principal architect of the 1952 movement, gradually consolidated power. Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 and placed under [[house arrest]]. The presidency remained vacant until Nasser was formally elected in 1956.

In October 1954,  and the  agreed to end the [[Anglo- |Anglo- Condominium Agreement]] of 1899, granting  full independence, which came into effect on 1 January 1956. In June 1956, Nasser assumed the presidency and immediately became the central figure in 's domestic and foreign policy.  forces completed their withdrawal from the Suez Canal Zone on 13 June 1956. Later that year, on 26 July, Nasser [[nationalised]] the Suez Canal, provoking the [[Suez Crisis]] when , with support from  and the , invaded the Sinai Peninsula and targeted the Canal. The conflict ended following diplomatic pressure from the  and the Soviet Union, restoring the pre-war status quo.

In 1958,  formed a political union with , creating the [[United Arab Republic]]. The union, also loosely connected with [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of |North ]] in the [[United Arab States]], was short-lived;  seceded in 1961. During this period,  became heavily involved in the [[North  Civil War]], with military interventions and peace conferences ultimately leading to a prolonged stalemate.
In May 1967, tensions with  escalated after warnings from the Soviet Union, deployment of  forces to Sinai, expulsion of UN peacekeepers, and closure of the [[Straits of Tiran]]. These measures precipitated the [[Third Arab- War|Six-Day War]], during which  captured the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Gaza Strip]]. In response to the conflict, an [[Emergency law in |Emergency Law]] was enacted, greatly expanding police powers, restricting constitutional rights, and legalising censorship; it remained in force until 2012, except for a brief break in 1980–81.

Socially and economically, Nasser's policies transformed . At the time of the monarchy's fall, less than half a million  were considered upper class, four million were middle class, and seventeen million were lower class or poor. Education was expanded, with school enrolment more than doubling from 1953 to 1966. Land reforms, industrial support, and growth in public-sector employment created a larger middle class, including doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, and journalists. However, by the late 1960s, the  economy faced stagnation, political freedoms had declined, and Nasser's personal popularity began to wane.

===  under Sadat and Mubarak (1971–2011) ===
{{Main|History of  under Anwar Sadat|History of  under Hosni Mubarak}}
[[File: Armor.jpg|thumb| tanks advancing in the Sinai desert during the [[Yom Kippur War]], 1973]]
After the death of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] in 1970, [[Anwar Sadat]] assumed the presidency of . Sadat consolidated his power by marginalising Nasserist and leftist factions, while controlling opposition both secular and religious. He shifted 's Cold War alignment from the Soviet Union to the , expelling Soviet advisors in 1972, and renamed the country the Arab Republic of  in 1971. Sadat launched the [[Infitah]] ("open door") economic reforms. Some measures of this economic liberalization caused social tensions, most notably the removal of food subsidies in 1977 which sparked widespread [[1977  bread riots|bread riots]].
[[File:Begin, Carter and Sadat at Camp David 1978.jpg|thumb|Celebrating the signing of the 1978 [[Camp David Accords]]: [[Menachem Begin]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Anwar Sadat]]]]
In 1973, Sadat coordinated with  in the [[Fourth Arab- War]] to reclaim the [[Sinai Peninsula]] from  occupation. Though militarily mixed, the war restored Arab morale and strengthened Sadat's domestic legitimacy. His historic 1977 visit to Jerusalem led to the 1979 [[– peace treaty|- peace treaty]], with  withdrawing from Sinai and  recognizing  as a sovereign state. This initiative provoked widespread controversy across the Arab world, resulting in 's temporary expulsion from the [[Arab League]], but remained popular domestically. Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by an Islamic extremist opposed to his domestic policies and peace initiative.
[[File:Hosni Mubarak - Official Photo.JPG|left|thumb|222x222px|[[Hosni Mubarak]], president of  from 1981 to 2011]]
[[Hosni Mubarak]] succeeded Sadat in a 1981 referendum in which he was the sole candidate. He maintained 's peace treaty with  and improved relations with Arab neighbors. Domestically, he faced widespread poverty, high unemployment, and urban overcrowding. The 1986 Security Police riots, sparked by reports of extended military service, led to violent protests, destruction of businesses, and 107 deaths.

Terrorist attacks, particularly by Islamist groups like [[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]], targeted government officials, foreigners, and Christian [[Copts]], devastating tourism, 's primary source of hard currency. The political scene was dominated by the [[National Democratic Party ()|NDP]], which curtailed freedoms of association, expression, and political participation through laws such as the 1993 Syndicates Law, 1995 Press Law, and 1999 NGOs Law.
[[File:Cairo north.JPG|thumb|Cairo grew into a [[metropolitan area]] with a population of over 22 million.]]
In 1997, the [[Luxor massacre]] left 62 dead, mostly tourists, highlighting the continuing threat to security and the economy. In 2005, limited reforms allowed multi-candidate presidential elections, but restrictions on candidates and alleged government interference ensured Mubarak's easy reelection. Voter turnout was less than 25%, and opposition leader [[Ayman Nour]] was subsequently imprisoned.

[[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]] reported widespread human rights abuses, including torture, arbitrary detention, and the use of  as an international "torture hub" in the context of the [[war on terror]]. Constitutional changes in 2007 further expanded presidential powers, restricted religious parties, and broadened police authority.  remained under strong military influence, described by officials as a "pharaonic" system, with democracy as a distant aspiration.

On 25 January 2011, [[2011  revolution|widespread protests]] erupted against President Hosni Mubarak's government, triggered by demands for political freedom, social justice, and the end of long-standing corruption. Demonstrations rapidly spread across major cities, particularly in [[Cairo]]'s [[Tahrir Square]], capturing global attention. After 18 days of escalating unrest, Mubarak resigned on 11 February 2011 and fled Cairo. The [[ military]] assumed control, with [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]], chairman of the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]], acting as interim head of state. On 13 February, the military dissolved parliament and suspended the constitution. A constitutional referendum followed on 19 March 2011. Later that year,  held its first parliamentary elections since the previous regime, with high voter turnout and no major reported irregularities.

[[Mohamed Morsi]], affiliated with the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], won the [[2012  presidential election|presidency]] on 24 June 2012 and was sworn in on 30 June. His cabinet, announced in August 2012, included significant representation from the Muslim Brotherhood, prompting liberal and secular groups to withdraw from the [[Constituent Assembly of ]] over concerns of imposing strict Islamic law. In November 2012, Morsi issued a decree granting immunity to his decisions and protecting the constituent assembly's work, sparking [[2012–2013  protests|mass protests and violent clashes]] across the country. Tensions escalated, with the largest confrontations between Islamist supporters and opponents since the 2011 revolution occurring on 5 December 2012. Morsi refused to cancel the December 2012 [[2012  constitutional referendum|constitutional referendum]].

Following growing public discontent, the [[2013  coup d'état|military removed Morsi]] on 3 July 2013, dissolved the [[Senate ()|Shura Council]], and installed [[Adly Mansour]], chief justice of the [[Supreme Constitutional Court ()|Supreme Constitutional Court]], as interim president. Authorities cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood, jailing thousands and conducting mass trials. Violence during [[Rabaa massacre|dispersals of pro-Morsi camps]] left hundreds dead. A new [[Constitution of |constitution]] was approved by referendum on 18 January 2014 with 98.1% voting in favour.

[[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] won the [[2014  presidential election|presidential elections]] in June 2014 with 96.1% of the vote and was sworn in on 8 June. Under his rule,  intensified security on the Gaza border, dismantled tunnels between Sinai and Gaza, and consolidated political power. Presidential terms were extended to six years in 2019, allowing El-Sisi to run for a third term in 2024. Parliamentary elections in 2020 confirmed a pro-El-Sisi majority for the [[Nation's Future Party|Mostaqbal Watan Party]]. The constitutional reforms and strengthened military authority under El-Sisi have been described as a return to authoritarianism.
