{{main|History of | East Africa|Ruanda-Urundi}}
Modern human settlement of what is now  dates from, at the latest, the [[last glacial period]], either in the [[Neolithic]] period around 8,000 BC, or in the [[Neolithic Subpluvial|long humid period]] which followed, up to around 3,000 BC.{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=44}} Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of sparse settlement by [[hunter-gatherer]]s in the late [[Stone Age]], followed by a larger population of early [[Iron Age]] settlers, who produced dimpled [[pottery]] and iron tools.{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=36}}{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=45}} These early inhabitants were the ancestors of the [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]], aboriginal [[Pygmy peoples|pygmy]] hunter-gatherers who remain in  today. Then by 3,000 BC, [[Central Sudanic]] and [[Kuliak languages|Kuliak]] farmers and herders began settling into , followed by [[South Cushitic languages|South Cushitic]]–speaking herders in 2,000 BC.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the mountain slopes.{{sfn|King|2007|p=75}} Between 800 BC and 1500 AD, a number of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] groups migrated into , clearing forest land for agriculture.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=58}} Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one theory is that the first settlers were [[Hutu]], while the [[Tutsi]] migrated later to form a distinct racial group, possibly of Nilo-hamitic origin.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=16}} An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=58}} Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one.{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=69}}{{sfn|Shyaka|pp=10–11}}

The earliest form of social organisation in the area was the [[Clans of |clan]] (''ubwoko'').{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=88}} The clans were not limited to genealogical lineages or geographical area, and most included Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|pp=88–89}} From the 15th century, the clans began to merge into kingdoms.{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=141}} One kingdom, under King Gihanga, managed to incorporate several of its close neighbor territories establishing the [[Kingdom of ]]. By 1700, around eight kingdoms had existed in the present-day .{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=482}} One of these, the [[Kingdom of ]] ruled by the Tutsi [[Nyiginya]] clan, became increasingly dominant from the mid-18th century.{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=160}} The kingdom reached its greatest extent during the 19th century under the reign of King [[Kigeli IV Rwabugiri|Kigeli Rwabugiri]]. Rwabugiri conquered several smaller states, expanded the kingdom west and north,{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=160}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} and initiated administrative reforms; these included {{lang|rw|[[ubuhake]]}}, in which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle, and therefore privileged status, to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service,{{sfn|Prunier|1995|pp=13–14}} and {{lang|rw|uburetwa}}, a [[corvée]] system in which Hutu were forced to work for Tutsi chiefs.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} Rwabugiri's changes caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} The Twa were better off than in pre-Kingdom days, with some becoming dancers in the royal court,{{sfn|King|2007|p=75}} but their numbers continued to decline.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=6}}

The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884 assigned the territory to the [[ Empire]], who declared it to be part of [[ East Africa]]. In 1894, explorer [[Gustav Adolf von Götzen]] was the first European to cross the entire territory of ; he crossed from the south-east to Lake Kivu and met the king.{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=217}}{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=9}} In 1897,  established a presence in  with the formation of an alliance with the king, beginning the colonial era. The Germans did not significantly alter the social structure of the country, but exerted influence by supporting the king and the existing hierarchy, and delegating power to local chiefs.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=25}}

While it had been previously possible for particularly wealthy Hutu to become honorary Tutsi, the identity cards prevented any further movement between the classes.{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|pp=56–57}}

 continued to rule [[Ruanda-Urundi]] (of which  formed the northern part) as a [[United Nations trust territories|UN trust territory]] after the [[Second World War]], with a mandate to oversee eventual [[Decolonisation of Africa|independence]].{{sfn|United Nations (II)}}{{sfn|United Nations (III)}} Tensions escalated between the Tutsi, who favoured early independence, and the Hutu emancipation movement, culminating in the 1959 [[ Revolution]]: Hutu activists began killing Tutsi and destroying their houses,{{sfn|Linden|Linden|1977|p=267}} forcing more than 100,000 people to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|pp=58–59}}{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=51}} In 1961, the suddenly pro-Hutu Belgians held [[1961  monarchy referendum|a referendum]] in which the country voted to abolish the monarchy.  was separated from  and gained independence on 1 July 1962,{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=53}} which is commemorated as Independence Day, a national holiday. Cycles of violence followed, with mainly Tutsi [[Inyenzi movement|exile rebels]] attacking from neighbouring countries and the Hutu-led government retaliating with large-scale slaughter and repression of the Tutsi civilians inside .{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=56}} In 1973, [[Juvénal Habyarimana]] took power in [[1973  coup d'état|a military coup]]. Pro-Hutu discrimination continued, but there was greater economic prosperity and a reduced amount of violence against the Tutsi.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|pp=74–76}} The Twa remained marginalised, and by 1990 were almost entirely forced out of the forests by the government; many became beggars.{{sfn|UNPO|2008|loc=History}} 's population had increased from 1.6&nbsp;million people in 1934 to 7.1&nbsp;million in 1989, leading to competition for land.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=4}}

In 1990, the [[ Patriotic Front]] (RPF), a rebel group composed of Tutsi refugees, invaded northern  from their base in , initiating the [[ Civil War]].{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=93}} The group condemned the Hutu-dominated government for failing to democratize and confront the problems facing these refugees. Neither side was able to gain a decisive advantage in the war,{{sfn|Prunier|1995|pp=135–136}} but by 1992 it had weakened Habyarimana's authority; mass demonstrations forced him into a coalition with the domestic opposition and eventually to sign the 1993 [[Arusha Accords ()|Arusha Accords]] with the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|pp=190–191}}

The cease-fire ended on 6 April 1994 when [[Assassination of Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|Habyarimana's plane was shot down]] near Kigali Airport, killing him.{{sfn|BBC News (III)|2010}} The shooting down of the plane served as the catalyst for the [[ genocide]], which began within a few hours. Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000{{sfn|Henley|2007}} Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks on the orders of the interim government.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=386}} Many Twa were also killed, despite not being directly targeted.{{sfn|UNPO|2008|loc=History}}

The Tutsi RPF restarted their offensive, and took control of the country methodically, gaining control of the whole country by mid-July.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=299}} The international response to the genocide was limited, with major powers reluctant to strengthen the already overstretched [[United Nations Assistance Mission for |UN peacekeeping force]].{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=364}} When the RPF took over, approximately two million Hutu [[Great Lakes refugee crisis|fled to neighbouring countries]], in particular [[Zaïre]], fearing reprisals;{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=312}} additionally, the RPF-led army was a key belligerent in the [[First Congo War|First]] and [[Second Congo War]]s.{{sfn|BBC News (V)|2010}} Within , a period of reconciliation and justice began, with the establishment of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for ]] (ICTR) and the reintroduction of {{lang|rw|[[Gacaca]]}}, a traditional village court system.{{sfn|Bowcott|2014}} Since 2000 's economy,{{sfn|World Bank (X)}} tourist numbers,{{sfn|World Bank (XI)}} and [[Human Development Index]] have grown rapidly;{{sfn|UNDP (I)|2010}} between 2006 and 2011 the poverty rate reduced from 57% to 45%,{{sfn|National Institute of Statistics of |2012}} while [[life expectancy]] rose from 46.6 years in 2000{{sfn|UNDP (V)|2013|p=2}} to 65.4 years in 2021.{{sfn|CIA (I)}}
