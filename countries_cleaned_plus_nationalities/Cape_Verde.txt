The archipelago was formed approximately 40–50 million years ago during the [[Eocene]] epoch. Before the arrival of Europeans, the  Islands were uninhabited. They were discovered by [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and  navigators around 1456. According to  official records, the first discoveries were made by Genoa-born [[António de Noli]], who was afterwards appointed governor of  by  King [[Afonso V of |Afonso V]]. Other navigators mentioned as contributing to discoveries on the  archipelago are [[Diogo Dias]], Diogo Afonso, [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[Alvise Cadamosto]] and [[Diogo Gomes]] (who had accompanied António de Noli on his voyage of discovery, and who claimed to have been the first to land on [[Santiago, |Santiago]] and the first to name that island).

In 1462,  settlers arrived at Santiago and founded a settlement they called Ribeira Grande. Today it is called [[Cidade Velha]] ("Old City"), to distinguish it from [[Ribeira Grande, |Ribeira Grande]]. The original Ribeira Grande was the first permanent European settlement in the [[tropics]].

In the 16th century, the archipelago prospered from the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Pirates occasionally attacked the  settlements. [[Francis Drake]], an  [[privateer]], twice sacked Ribeira Grande in 1585 when it was a part of the [[Iberian Union]]. After a  attack in 1712, the town declined in importance relative to nearby [[Praia]], which became the capital in 1770.

The decline in the slave trade in the 19th century resulted in an economic crisis. 's early prosperity slowly vanished. However, the islands' position astride mid-Atlantic shipping lanes made  an ideal location for re-supplying ships. Because of its excellent harbour [[Mindelo]], located on the island of [[São Vicente, |São Vicente]], became an important commercial centre. Diplomat [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]] visited  in 1832.  was the first stop of [[Charles Darwin]]'s voyage with {{HMS|Beagle}} in 1832.

With few natural resources and inadequate sustainable investment from the , the citizens grew increasingly discontented with the colonial masters, who refused to provide the local authorities with more autonomy. In 1951,  changed 's status from a colony to an overseas province in an attempt to blunt growing nationalism.

In 1956, [[Amílcar Cabral]] and a group of fellow Cape Verdeans and Guineans organised (in [[ ]]) the clandestine [[African Party for the Independence of  and ]] (PAIGC). It demanded improvement in economic, social, and political conditions in  and   and formed the basis of the two nations' independence movement. Moving its headquarters to [[Conakry]], , in 1960, the PAIGC began an armed rebellion against  in 1961. Acts of sabotage eventually grew into a [[-Bissau War of Independence|war in  ]] that pitted 10,000 [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]]-supported PAIGC soldiers against 35,000  and African troops.

By 1972, the PAIGC controlled much of   despite the presence of the  troops, but the organisation did not attempt to disrupt  control in .   declared independence in 1973 and was granted ''[[de jure]]'' independence in 1974. A budding independence movement—originally led by [[Amílcar Cabral]] who was assassinated in 1973—passed on to his half-brother [[Luís Cabral]] and culminated in independence for the archipelago in 1975.

=== Independence (1975) ===
Following the [[Carnation Revolution|April 1974 revolution in ]], the PAIGC became an active political movement in . In December 1974, the PAIGC and  signed an agreement providing for a transitional government composed of  and Cape Verdeans. On 30 June 1975, Cape Verdeans elected a National Assembly which received the instruments of independence from  on 5 July 1975.

On 2 February 2024,  became the third African country to be free of [[malaria]].
