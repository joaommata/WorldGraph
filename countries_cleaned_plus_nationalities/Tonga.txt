An [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]-speaking group linked to what archaeologists call the [[Lapita culture]] covered from [[Island Melanesia]] to [[]], and then on to inhabit  sometime between 1500 and 1000&nbsp;BC. Scholars still debate exactly when  was first settled, but [[thorium]] dating confirms that settlers had arrived in the earliest known inhabited town, Nukuleka, by 888 BC, ± 8 years. 's precontact history was shared via [[oral tradition|oral history]], which was passed down from generation to generation.

By the 12th century,  and the  monarch, the [[Tuʻi ]], had acquired a reputation across the central Pacific{{snd}}from [[Niue]], [[]], [[Rotuma]], [[Wallis and Futuna]], [[New Caledonia]] to [[Tikopia]], leading some historians to speak of a Tuʻi  Empire having existed during that period. Civil wars are known to have occurred in  in the 15th and 17th centuries.

The  people first encountered Europeans in 1616, when the  vessel [[Eendracht (1615 ship)|''Eendracht'']], captained by [[Willem Schouten]], made a short visit to the islands for the purpose of engaging in trade. Later, other  explorers arrived, including [[Jacob Le Maire]] (who visited the northern island of [[Niuatoputapu]]); and [[Abel Tasman]] (who visited Tongatapu and [[Haʻapai]]) in 1643. Later noteworthy European visitors included James Cook, of the  Royal Navy, in 1773, 1774, and 1777;  Navy explorers [[Francisco Mourelle|Francisco Mourelle de la Rúa]] in 1781; [[Alessandro Malaspina]] in 1793; the first [[First missionaries in Polynesia|Protestant missionaries]] in 1797; and a [[Methodism|Wesleyan Methodist]] minister, Reverend Walter Lawry, in 1822.

[[Whaling]] vessels were among the earliest regular Western visitors. The first of these on record is the ''Ann and Hope'', which was reported to have been seen among the islands of  in June 1799. The last known whaling visitor was the ''Albatross'' in 1899. That ship arrived in  seeking a resupply of water, food, and wood. The islands most regularly visited by Westerners were Ata, 'Eua, Ha'apai, Tongatapu, and Vava'u. Sometimes,  men were recruited to serve as crewmen on these vessels.
The [[ Exploring Expedition]] visited  in 1840.

In 1845, an ambitious young  warrior, strategist, and orator named [[Tāufaʻāhau]] united  into a kingdom. He held the chiefly title of [[Tuʻi Kanokupolu]], but had been baptised by [[Methodist]] missionaries with the name ''Siaosi'' ("George") in 1831. In 1875, with the help of missionary [[Shirley Waldemar Baker]], he declared  a constitutional monarchy, formally adopted the Western royal style, emancipated the "serfs", enshrined a code of law, land tenure, and freedom of the press, and limited the power of the chiefs.

 became a [[ Protectorate|protected state]] under a Treaty of Friendship with Britain on 18 May 1900, when European settlers and rival  chiefs unsuccessfully tried to oust the man who had succeeded Tāufaʻāhau as king. The treaty posted no higher permanent representative on  than a  [[Consul (representative)|consul]] (1901–1970). Under the protection of Britain,  maintained its sovereignty and remained the only Pacific nation to retain its monarchical government. The  monarchy follows an uninterrupted succession of hereditary rulers from one family.

The [[1918 flu pandemic]], brought to  by a ship from , killed 1,800 , a mortality rate of about 8%.

The Treaty of Friendship and 's protection status ended in 1970 under arrangements that had been established by 's Queen [[Salote Tupou III]] before her death in 1965. Owing to its  ties,  joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1970 (atypically as a country that had its own monarch, rather than having the [[Monarchy of the |'s monarch]], along with [[]], [[]], [[]], and [[]]).  became a member of the United Nations in September 1999. While exposed to colonial pressures,  has always governed itself, which makes it unique in the Pacific.

In January 2022, the [[Hunga –Hunga Haʻapai]] volcano, {{Cvt|65|km|mi nmi}} north of the main island of Tongatapu, [[2022 Hunga –Hunga Ha'apai eruption and tsunami|erupted]], causing a [[tsunami]] which inundated parts of the archipelago, including the capital Nuku{{Okina}}alofa. The eruption affected the kingdom heavily, cutting off most communications and killing four people in . In [[]], two women drowned due to abnormal tsunami waves. It took around five weeks to repair a [[Submarine communications cable|submarine fiber optic cable]] used in the [[ Cable System]] for internet and telephone connectivity.
