=== Antiquity ===
 was home to [[Dilmun]], an important [[Bronze Age]] trade centre linking [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]].  was later ruled by the [[Sumer|Sumerians]] and [[Babylonia]]ns. From the 6th to 3rd century BC,  was part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. By about 250 BC, [[Parthia]] brought the Persian Gulf under its control and extended its influence as far as . The Parthians established garrisons along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf to control trade routes.

During the [[classical era]],  was referred to by the [[ancient ]]s as ''[[Tylos]]'', the centre of pearl trading, when the  admiral [[Nearchus]] serving under [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] landed on .{{sfn|Larsen|1983|p=13}} Nearchus is believed to have been the first of Alexander's commanders to visit the island, and he found a verdant land that was part of a wide trading network; he recorded: "That on the island of Tylos, situated in the Persian Gulf, are large plantations of cotton trees, from which are manufactured clothes called ''sindones'', of strongly differing degrees of value, some being costly, others less expensive. The use of these is not confined to , but extends to Arabia." The  historian [[Theophrastus]] states that much of  was covered by these cotton trees and that  was famous for exporting walking canes engraved with emblems that were customarily carried in Babylon. Alexander had planned to settle  colonists in , and although it is not clear that this happened on the scale he envisaged,  became very much part of the [[Hellenization|Hellenised]] world: the language of the upper classes was  (although [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] was in everyday use). Local coinage shows a seated Zeus, who may have been worshipped there as a syncretised form of the Arabian sun-god [[Shams (deity)|Shams]]. Tylos was also the site of  athletic contests.

The  historian [[Strabo]] believed the [[Phoenicians]] originated from . [[Herodotus]] also believed that the homeland of the Phoenicians was . This theory was accepted by the 19th-century  classicist [[Arnold Heeren]] who said "In the  geographers, for instance, we read of two islands, named Tyrus or Tylos, and [[Arad, |Aradus]], which boasted that they were the mother country of the Phoenicians, and exhibited relics of Phoenician temples." The people of [[Tyre, |Tyre]] in particular have long maintained [[Persian Gulf]] origins, and the similarity in the words "Tylos" and "Tyre" has been commented upon. However, there is little evidence of any human settlement at all on  during the time when such migration had supposedly taken place.[[File:Bellin - Karte von der Küste von Arabien c.1745 (crop).png|thumb|A 1745 [[Jacques-Nicolas Bellin|Bellin]] map of the historical region of ]]
[[File:AncientTombsOfBahrain.svg|thumb|Map showing the locations of the [[Dilmun Burial Mounds|ancient burial mounds]]. There are an estimated 350,000 burial mounds.]]The name Tylos is thought to be a Hellenisation of the Semitic ''Tilmun'' (from [[Dilmun]]). The term Tylos was commonly used for the islands until [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' when the inhabitants are referred to as Thilouanoi. Some place names in  go back to the Tylos era; for instance the name of Arad, a residential suburb of [[Muharraq]], is believed to originate from "Arados", the ancient  name for Muharraq.{{sfn|Larsen|1983|p=13}}

In the 3rd century, [[Ardashir I]], the first ruler of the [[Sassanid dynasty]], marched on  and , where he defeated Sanatruq the ruler of .

 was the site of worship of an ox deity called [[Awal]] ({{Langx|ar|اوال|links=no|engvar=gb}}) Worshipers built a large statue to Awal in [[Muharraq]], although it has now been lost. For many centuries after ''Tylos'',  was known as ''Awal''. By the 5th century,  became a centre for [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christianity]], with the village [[Samahij]] as the seat of bishops. In 410, according to the Oriental Syriac Church synodal records, a bishop named Batai was excommunicated from the church in . As a sect, the Nestorians were often persecuted as heretics by the [[Byzantine Empire]], but  was outside the empire's control, offering some safety. The names of several [[Muharraq]] villages today reflect 's Christian legacy, with [[Al Dair]] meaning "the monastery".

's pre-Muslim population consisted of [[Arab Christians|Christian Arabs]] (mostly [[Abd al-Qays]]), Persians ([[Zoroastrians]]), [[History of the Jews in #Early history|Jews]], and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]-speaking agriculturalists. According to [[Robert Bertram Serjeant]], the [[Baharna]] may be the [[Arabization|Arabised]] "descendants of converts from the original population of Christians (Aramaeans), Jews and Persians inhabiting the island and cultivated coastal provinces of [[Eastern Arabia]] at the time of the [[Early Muslim conquests|Muslim conquest]]". The sedentary people of pre-Muslim  were [[Aramaic language#Geographic distribution|Aramaic speakers]] and to some degree Persian speakers, while [[Syriac language|Syriac]] functioned as a [[Sacred language|liturgical language]].

[[File:Muhammad  letter facsimile.png|thumb|[[Facsimile]] of a letter sent by [[Muhammad]] to [[Munzir ibn-Sawa al-Tamimi]], governor of , in AD&nbsp;628]]

[[Muhammad]]'s first interaction with the people of  was the [[Al Kudr Invasion]]. Muhammad ordered a surprise attack on the [[Banu Salim]] tribe for plotting to attack Medina. He had received news that some tribes were assembling an army in  and preparing to attack the mainland, but the tribesmen retreated when they learned Muhammad was leading an army to do battle with them.[[File:Persia 600ad.jpg|thumb| The [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire in the Sassanid era]] on the eve of the Arab conquest, c. 600 AD]]

Traditional Muslim accounts state that [[Al-Ala'a Al-Hadrami]] was sent as an envoy during the [[Expedition of Zayd ibn Harithah (Hisma)]] to the [[Eastern Arabia| region]] by [[Muhammad]] in AD&nbsp;628 and that [[Munzir ibn Sawa Al Tamimi]], the local ruler, responded to his mission and converted the entire area.

=== Middle Ages ===
In the year 899, the [[Qarmatians]], a [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] Muslim sect, seized , seeking to create a [[utopia]]n society based on reason and redistribution of property among initiates. Thereafter, the Qarmatians demanded [[tribute]] from the caliph in [[Baghdad]], and in 930 [[Sack of Mecca|sacked]] [[Mecca]], bringing the sacred [[Black Stone]] back to their base in [[ (historical region)|Ahsa]], in medieval , for ransom. According to historian [[Al-Juwayni]], the stone was returned 22 years later in 951 under mysterious circumstances. Wrapped in a sack, it was thrown into the [[Great Mosque of Kufa]] in , accompanied by a note saying "By command we took it, and by command, we have brought it back." The theft and removal of the Black Stone caused it to break into seven pieces.

Following their defeat in the year 976 by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], the Qarmatians were overthrown by the Arab [[Uyunid dynasty]] of [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|al-Hasa]], who took over the entire  region in 1076. The Uyunids controlled  until 1235, when the archipelago was briefly occupied by the Persian ruler of [[Fars province|Fars]]. In 1253, the [[Usfurids]] brought down the Uyunid dynasty, thereby gaining control over eastern [[Arabia]], including the islands of . In 1330, the archipelago became a tributary state of the rulers of [[Ormus|Hormuz]], though locally the islands were controlled by the Shia [[Jarwanids|Jarwanid]] dynasty of [[Qatif]].
In the mid-15th century, the archipelago came under the rule of the [[Jabrids]], a Bedouin dynasty also based in [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Ahsa]] that ruled most of eastern Arabia.

[[File: Fort overview.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Qal'at al-| Fort of Barém]], built by the  when they ruled  from 1521 to 1602]]

In 1521, the  allied with Hormuz and seized  from the [[Jabrids|Jabrid]] ruler [[Muqrin ibn Zamil]], who was killed during the takeover.  rule lasted for around 80 years, during which time they depended mainly on [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Persian governors. The  were expelled from the islands in 1602 by [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] of the [[Safavid ]], which gave impetus to [[Shia Islam]]. For the next two centuries, Persian rulers retained control of the archipelago, interrupted by the 1717 and 1738 invasions of the [[Ibadi]]s of . During most of this period, they resorted to governing  indirectly, either through the city of [[Bushehr]] or through [[immigration|immigrant]] Sunni Arab clans. The latter were tribes returning to the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf from Persian territories in the north who were known as ''[[Huwala]]''. In 1753, the Huwala clan of [[Nasr Al-Madhkur]] invaded  on behalf of the  [[Zand dynasty|Zand]] leader [[Karim Khan Zand]] and restored direct  rule.

In 1783, Al-Madhkur lost the islands of  following his defeat by the [[Bani Utbah]] clan and allied tribes at the 1782 Battle of [[Zubarah]].  was not new territory to the Bani Utbah; they had been a presence there since the 17th century. During that time, they started purchasing date palm gardens in ; a document shows that 81 years before the arrival of the Al Khalifa, one of the sheikhs of the [[Al Bin Ali]] tribe (an offshoot of the Bani Utbah) had bought a palm garden from Mariam bint Ahmed Al Sanadi in [[Sitra]] island.

The Al Bin Ali were the dominant group controlling the town of Zubarah on the  peninsula, originally the centre of power of the Bani Utbah. After the Bani Utbah gained control of , the Al Bin Ali had a practically independent status there as a self-governing tribe. They used a flag with four red and three white stripes, called the [[Al-Sulami flag]] in , , [[]], and the Eastern province of the Kingdom of . Later, different Arab family clans and tribes from  moved to  to settle after the fall of Nasr Al-Madhkur of [[Bushehr]]. These families included the [[House of Khalifa]], Al-Ma'awdah, Al-Buainain, Al-Fadhil, Al-Kuwari, Al-Mannai, Al-Noaimi, Al-Rumaihi, Al-Sulaiti, Al-Sadah, Al-Thawadi and other families and tribes.

The House of Khalifa moved from  to  in 1799. Originally, their ancestors were expelled from [[Umm Qasr]] in central Arabia by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] due to their predatory habits of preying on caravans in [[Basra]] and trading ships in [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway until Turks expelled them to  in 1716, where they remained until 1766.

Around the 1760s, the [[Al Jalahma]] and House of Khalifa, both belonging to the Utub Federation, migrated to [[Zubarah]] in modern-day , leaving Al Sabah as the sole proprietors of .

In the early 19th century,  was invaded by both the Omanis and the [[House of Saud|Al Sauds]]. In 1802 it was governed by a 12-year-old child, when the  ruler Sayyid Sultan installed his son, Salim, as governor in the [[Arad Fort]]. In 1816, the British political resident in the Persian Gulf, William Bruce, received a letter from the Sheikh of  who was concerned about a rumour that Britain would support an attack on the island by the Imam of Muscat. He sailed to  to reassure the Sheikh that this was not the case and drew up an informal agreement assuring the Sheikh that Britain would remain a neutral party.
[[File:Coronation of Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa 1933.jpg|thumb|This photograph shows the coronation of Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa as the Hakim of  in February 1933.]]
In 1820, the Al Khalifa tribe were recognised by the  as the rulers ("Al-Hakim" in Arabic) of  after signing a [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820|treaty relationship]]. However, ten years later they were forced to pay yearly tributes to  despite seeking Persian and British protection.

[[File:Trigonometrical Plan of the Island and Harbour of .jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of  in 1825]]

In 1860, the Al Khalifas used the same tactic when the British tried to overpower . Writing letters to the Persians and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], Al Khalifas agreed to place  under the latter's protection in March due to offering better conditions. Eventually, the [[British Raj|Government of British ]] overpowered  when the Persians refused to protect it. Colonel [[Lewis Pelly|Pelly]] signed a new treaty with Al Khalifas placing  under British rule and protection.

[[File:Bahrainharbor.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Manama Harbour, c. 1870]]
Following the [[– War]] in 1868, British representatives signed another agreement with the Al Khalifas. It specified that the ruler could not dispose of any of his territories except to the  and could not enter into relationships with any foreign government without British consent. In return the British promised to protect  from all aggression by sea and to lend support in case of land attack. More importantly the British promised to support the rule of the Al Khalifa in , securing its unstable position as rulers of the country. Other agreements in 1880 and 1892 sealed the protectorate status of  to the British.

Unrest amongst the people of  began when Britain officially established complete dominance over the territory in 1892. The first revolt and widespread uprising took place in March 1895 against Sheikh Issa bin Ali, then ruler of .{{sfn | Mojtahed-Zadeh | 1999 | p=130}} Sheikh Issa was the first of the Al Khalifa to rule without Persian relations. [[Arnold Wilson|Sir Arnold Wilson]], Britain's representative in the Persian Gulf and author of ''The Persian Gulf'', arrived in  from Muscat at this time.{{sfn | Mojtahed-Zadeh | 1999 | p=130}} The uprising developed further with some protesters killed by British forces.{{sfn | Mojtahed-Zadeh | 1999 | p=130}}

Before the development of the petroleum industry, the island was largely devoted to [[Pearl hunting|pearl fisheries]] and, as late as the 19th century, was considered to be the finest in the world.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} In 1903,  explorer [[Hermann Burchardt]] visited  and took many photographs of historical sites, including the old ''Qaṣr es-Sheikh'', photos now stored at the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]]. Before the [[World War I|First World War]], there were about 400 vessels hunting pearls and an annual export of more than £30,000.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}

In 1911, a group of  merchants demanded restrictions on the British influence in the country. The group's leaders were subsequently arrested and exiled to . In 1923, the British introduced [[ administrative reforms of the 1920s|administrative reforms]] and replaced Sheikh Issa bin Ali with his son. Some clerical opponents and families, such as [[Dawasir|Al Dosari]], left or were exiled to . Three years later the British placed the country under the ''de facto'' rule of [[Charles Belgrave]] who operated as an adviser to the ruler until 1957. Belgrave brought a number of reforms such as establishment of the country's first modern school in 1919 and the abolition of [[Arab slave trade|slavery]] in 1937. At the same time, the pearl diving industry developed at a rapid pace.

In 1927, [[Rezā Shāh]], then [[Shah of ]], demanded sovereignty over  in a letter to the [[League of Nations]], a move that prompted Belgrave to undertake harsh measures including encouraging conflicts between [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and Sunni Muslims to bring down the uprisings and limit the  influence. Belgrave even went further by suggesting to rename the [[Persian Gulf]] to the "Arabian Gulf"; however, the proposal was refused by the British government. Britain's interest in 's development was motivated by concerns over  and  ambitions in the region.

[[File:First Oil Well, .jpg|thumb|A photograph of the First Oil Well in , with oil first being extracted in 1931]]

The [[ Petroleum Company]] (Bapco), a subsidiary of the [[Standard Oil Company]] of California (Socal), discovered oil in 1932.

In the early 1930s,  Airport was developed. [[Imperial Airways]] flew there, including the [[Handley Page HP42]] aircraft. Later in the same decade, the  Maritime Airport was established, for flying boats and seaplanes.

 [[Participants in World War II#|participated]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]] on the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] side, joining on 10 September 1939. On 19 October 1940, four  [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.82|SM.82s]] bombers [[Bombing of  in World War II|bombed ]] alongside [[Dhahran]] oilfields in , attacking Allied-operated oil refineries. Although minimal damage was caused in both locations, the attack forced the Allies to upgrade 's defences, an action which further stretched Allied military resources.

[[File:View of Manama from the South, 1953.png|thumb|Overview of Manama, 1953]]
After World War II, increasing sentiments against British occupation spread throughout Arab countries and led to protests in . The protests focused on the Jewish community. In 1948, following [[1947 Manama riots|rising hostilities and looting]], most members of 's Jewish community abandoned their properties and fled to [[Bombay]], later settling in  ([[Pardes Hanna-Karkur]]) and the . {{As of|2008}}, 37 Jews remained in the country. In the 1950s, the [[National Union Committee]], formed by reformists following sectarian clashes, demanded an elected popular assembly, removal of Belgrave and carried out a number of protests and general strikes. In 1965 a month-long [[March Intifada|uprising]] broke out after hundreds of workers at the  Petroleum Company were laid off.

On 15 August 1971, though the [[Shah of ]] was claiming historical sovereignty over , he accepted [[ independence survey, 1970|a referendum]] held by the United Nations and eventually  declared independence and signed a new treaty of friendship with Britain.  joined the United Nations and the [[Arab League]] later in the year. The oil boom of the 1970s benefited  greatly, although the subsequent downturn hurt the economy. The country had already begun diversification of its economy and benefited further from the [[ Civil War]] in the 1970s and 1980s, when  replaced [[Beirut]] as the Middle East's financial hub after 's large banking sector was driven out of the country by the war.

In 1981, following the [[1979 revolution in ]], the  Shia population orchestrated a [[1981  coup attempt|failed coup]] attempt under the auspices of a front organisation, the [[Islamic Front for the Liberation of ]]. The coup would have installed a Shia cleric exiled in , [[Hujjat al-Islam|Hujjatu l-Islām]] [[Hadi al-Modarresi|Hādī al-Mudarrisī]], as supreme leader heading a [[theocracy|theocratic government]]. In December 1994, a group of youths threw stones at female runners for running bare-legged during an international marathon. The resulting clash with police soon grew into civil unrest.

A [[1990s uprising in |popular uprising]] occurred between 1994 and 2000 in which leftists, liberals and fundamentalists joined forces. The event resulted in approximately forty deaths and ended after Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa became the Emir of  in 1999. He instituted elections for parliament, gave women the right to vote, and released all political prisoners. A referendum on 14–15 February 2001 massively supported the [[National Action Charter of |National Action Charter]]. As part of the adoption of the National Action Charter on 14 February 2002,  changed its formal name from the State (''dawla'') of  to the Kingdom of . At the same time, the title of the Head of State, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, was changed from Emir to King.

The country participated in [[War in  (2001–2021)|military action]] against the [[Taliban]] in October 2001 by deploying a [[frigate]] in the Arabian Sea for rescue and humanitarian operations. As a result, in November of that year,  president [[George W. Bush]]'s administration designated  as a "[[major non-NATO ally]]".  opposed the [[2003  invasion of |2003 -led invasion of ]] and had offered [[Saddam Hussein]] asylum in the days before the invasion. Relations improved with neighbouring [[]] after the border dispute over the [[Hawar Islands]] was resolved by the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[The Hague]] in 2001. Following the political liberalisation of the country,  negotiated a [[– Free Trade Agreement|free trade agreement]] with America in 2004.

In 2005, [[Qal'at al-]], a fort and archaeological complex was inscribed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

=== 2011  protests ===
{{Main|2011  uprising|-led intervention in }}

Inspired by the regional [[Arab Spring]], 's Shia population [[Day of Rage ()|started]] large protests against its Sunni rulers in early 2011. The government initially allowed [[March of loyalty to martyrs|protests]] following a [[Bloody Thursday ()|pre-dawn raid]] on protesters camped in [[Pearl Roundabout]]. A month later it requested security assistance from  and other [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] countries and declared a three-month state of emergency. The government then launched a crackdown on the opposition that included conducting thousands of arrests and [[Torture during the  uprising (2011–present)|systematic torture]]. Almost daily clashes between protesters and security forces led to [[Casualties of the 2011  uprising and its aftermath|dozens of deaths]]. Protests, sometimes staged by opposition parties, were ongoing. More than 80 civilians and 13 policemen have been killed {{as of|2014|March|lc=y}}.
According to [[Physicians for Human Rights]], 34 of these deaths were related to government usage of [[tear gas]] originally manufactured by America-based [[Federal Laboratories]]. The lack of coverage by Arab media in the Persian Gulf, as compared to other [[Arab Spring]] uprisings, has sparked several controversies. 

According to [[Amnesty International]], "Ten years after 's popular uprising, systemic injustice has intensified and political repression targeting dissidents, human rights defenders, clerics and independent civil society have effectively shut any space for the peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression or peaceful activism".  remains militarily and financially dependent on  and the UAE, though this is changing with the economic reforms being implemented by the government.
