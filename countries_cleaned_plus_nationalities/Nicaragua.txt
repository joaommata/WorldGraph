[[File: Ometepe pétroglyphes 1.jpg|thumb|An ancient [[petroglyph]] on [[Ometepe Island]]]]
[[Paleo-Indians]] first inhabited what is now known as  as far back as 12,000&nbsp;BCE. In later [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] times, 's [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] were part of the [[Intermediate Area]],{{rp|33}} between the [[Mesoamerica]]n and [[Andes|Andean]] cultural regions, and within the influence of the [[Isthmo- Area]]. 's central region and its Caribbean coast were inhabited by [[Macro-Chibchan languages|Macro-Chibchan language]] ethnic groups such as the [[Miskito people|Miskito]], [[Rama people|Rama]], [[Mayagna|Mayangna]], and [[Cacaopera people|Matagalpas]].{{rp|20}} They had coalesced in Central America and migrated both to and from present-day northern  and nearby areas. Their food came primarily from hunting and gathering, but also fishing and [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture.{{rp|33}}{{rp|65}}

At the end of the 15th century, western  was inhabited by several indigenous peoples related by culture to the Mesoamerican civilizations of the [[Aztecs|Aztec]] and [[Maya peoples|Maya]], and by language to the [[Mesoamerican language area]]. The Chorotegas were [[Mangue language]] ethnic groups who had arrived in  from what is now the  state of [[Chiapas]] sometime around 800 CE.{{rp|26–33}} The [[Nicarao people]] were a branch of [[Nahuas]] who spoke the [[Nawat language|Nawat]] dialect and also came from Chiapas, around 1200 CE. Prior to that, the Nicaraos had been associated with the [[Toltec]] civilization.{{rp|26–33}} 

Both Chorotegas and Nicaraos originated in 's [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]] valley, and migrated south.{{rp|26–33}} A third group, the [[Subtiaba language|Subtiaba]]s, were an [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] people who migrated from the  state of [[Guerrero]] around 1200 CE.{{rp|159}} Additionally, there were trade-related colonies in  set up by the Aztecs starting in the 14th century.{{rp|26–33}}

In 1502, on his fourth voyage, [[Christopher Columbus]] became the first European known to have reached what is now  as he sailed southeast toward the [[Isthmus of ]].{{rp|193}}{{rp|92}} Columbus explored the [[Mosquito Coast]] on the Atlantic side of  but did not encounter any indigenous people. 20 years later, the Spaniards returned to , this time to its southwestern part. The first attempt to conquer  was by the conquistador [[Gil González Dávila]], who had arrived in  in January 1520. 

In 1522, González Dávila ventured to the area that later became the [[Rivas Department]] of .{{rp|35}}{{rp|92}} There he encountered an indigenous Nahua tribe led by chief Macuilmiquiztli, whose name has sometimes been erroneously referred to as "[[Nicarao (cacique)|Nicarao]]" or "". The tribe's capital was Quauhcapolca. González Dávila conversed with Macuilmiquiztli thanks to two indigenous interpreters who had learned , whom he had brought along. 

After exploring and gathering gold{{rp|35}}{{rp|55}} in the fertile western valleys, González Dávila and his men were attacked and driven off by the Chorotega, led by chief [[Diriangen|Diriangén]]. The  tried to convert the tribes to Christianity; Macuilmiquiztli's tribe was baptized,{{rp|86}} but Diriangén was openly hostile to the Spaniards. Western , at the Pacific Coast, became a port and shipbuilding facility for the Galleons plying the waters between [[Manila]], [[]] and [[Acapulco]], [[]].

In 1524, the first  permanent settlements were founded. That year, the conquistador [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (founder of )|Francisco Hernández de Córdoba]] founded two of 's main cities: [[Granada, |Granada]] on [[Lake ]], and then [[León, |León]], west of [[Lake Managua]].{{rp|35, 193}}{{rp|92}} Córdoba soon built defenses for the cities and fought against incursions by other conquistadors.{{rp|92}} Córdoba was later publicly beheaded for having defied his superior, [[Pedro Arias Dávila]].{{rp|35}} Córdoba's tomb and remains were discovered in 2000 in the [[León Viejo|ruins of León Viejo]].

The clashes among  forces did not impede their destruction of the indigenous people and their culture. The series of battles came to be known as the "War of the Captains". Pedro Arias Dávila was a winner;{{rp|35}} although he lost control of , he moved to  and established his base in León. In 1527, León became the capital of the colony.{{rp|93}} Through diplomacy, Arias Dávila became the colony's first governor.

Without women in their parties,{{rp|123}} the  conquerors took Nahua and Chorotega wives and partners, beginning the multiethnic mix of indigenous and European stock now known as "''[[mestizo]]''", which constitutes the great majority of the population in western . Many indigenous people were killed by European [[infectious disease]]s, compounded by neglect by the Spaniards, who controlled their subsistence. Many other indigenous peoples were captured and transported as slaves to  and  between 1526 and 1540.{{rp|193}}{{rp|104–105}}

In 1610, the [[Momotombo]] volcano erupted, destroying the city of León. The city was rebuilt northwest of the original, which is now known as the [[León Viejo|ruins of León Viejo]]. During the [[ Revolutionary War]], Central America was subject to conflict between Britain and . British navy admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] led expeditions in the [[Battle of San Fernando de Omoa]] in 1779 and on the [[San Juan Expedition (1780)|San Juan River in 1780]], the latter of which had temporary success before being abandoned due to disease.

The [[Act of Independence of Central America]] dissolved the [[Captaincy General of ]] in September 1821, and  soon [[Central America under  rule|became part]] of the [[First  Empire]]. In July 1823, after the overthrow of the  monarchy in March of the same year,  joined the newly formed [[Federal Republic of Central America|United Provinces of Central America]], a country later known as the Federal Republic of Central America.  definitively became an independent republic in 1838.

The early years of independence were characterized by rivalry between the [[Constitutionalist Liberal Party|Liberal]] elite of León and the [[Conservative Party ()|Conservative]] elite of Granada, which often degenerated into civil war, particularly during the 1840s and 1850s. [[Managua]] rose to undisputed preeminence as the nation's capital in 1852 to allay the rivalry between the two feuding cities. Following the start of the [[California Gold Rush]] in 1848,  provided a route for travelers from the eastern  to journey to [[California]] by sea, via the [[San Juan River ()|San Juan River]] and Lake .{{rp|81}} 

Invited by the Liberals in 1855 to join their struggle against the Conservatives, the  adventurer and [[Filibuster (military)|filibuster]] [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] set himself up as [[President of ]] after conducting a farcical election in 1856; his presidency lasted less than a year. Military forces from , , , , and  itself united to drive Walker out of  in 1857, bringing three decades of Conservative rule.{{cn|date=July 2025}}

Great Britain, which had claimed the [[Mosquito Coast]] as a [[protectorate]] since 1655, delegated the area to  in 1859 before transferring it to  in 1860. The Mosquito Coast remained an [[autonomous area]] until 1894. [[José Santos Zelaya]], President of  from 1893 to 1909, negotiated the integration of the Mosquito Coast into . In his honor, the region became "[[Zelaya Department]]".

Throughout the late 19th century, the  and several European powers considered various schemes to link the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic by building a [[ Canal|canal across ]].

In 1909, the  supported the forces rebelling against President Zelaya. U.S. motives included differences over the proposed [[ Canal]], 's potential to destabilize the region, and Zelaya's attempts to regulate foreign access to  natural resources. On 18&nbsp;November 1909, U.S. warships were sent to the area after 500 revolutionaries (including two Americans) were executed by order of Zelaya. The U.S. justified the intervention by claiming to protect U.S. lives and property. Zelaya resigned later that year.{{cn|date=July 2025}}

In August 1912, the President of , [[Adolfo Díaz]], requested the secretary of war, General [[Luis Mena ( politician)|Luis Mena]], to resign for fear he was leading an insurrection. Mena fled Managua with his brother, the chief of police of Managua, to start an insurrection. After Mena's troops captured steam boats of an  company, the U.S. delegation asked President Díaz to ensure the safety of  citizens and property during the insurrection. He replied he could not, and asked the U.S. to intervene in the conflict.

[[ Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] occupied  from 1912 to 1933,{{rp|111, 197}} except for a nine-month period beginning in 1925. In 1914, the [[Bryan–Chamorro Treaty]] was signed, giving the U.S. control over a proposed canal through , as well as leases for potential canal defenses. After the U.S. Marines left, another [[ civil war (1926–27)|violent conflict]] between Liberals and Conservatives in 1926 resulted in the return of U.S. Marines.

[[File:General Sandino (center) and Staff enroute to . Siglo XX., 06-1929 - NARA - 532357.tif|thumb|Rebel leader [[Augusto César Sandino]] (center) in June 1929]]
From 1927 to 1933, rebel general [[Augusto César Sandino]] led a sustained guerrilla war against the regime and then against the [[ Marines|U.S. Marines]], whom he fought for over five years. When the Americans left in 1933, they set up the ''[[National Guard ()|Guardia Nacional]]'' (national guard), a combined military and police force trained and equipped by the Americans and designed to be loyal to U.S. interests.{{cn|date=July 2025}}

After the U.S. Marines withdrew from  in January 1933, Sandino and the newly elected administration of President [[Juan Bautista Sacasa]] reached an agreement that Sandino would cease his guerrilla activities in return for amnesty, a land grant for an agricultural colony, and retention of an armed band of 100 men for a year. However, due to a growing hostility between Sandino and National Guard director [[Anastasio Somoza García]] and a fear of armed opposition from Sandino, Somoza García ordered his assassination.  

Sacasa invited Sandino for dinner and to sign a peace treaty at the Presidential House on the night of 21&nbsp;February 1934. After leaving the Presidential House, Sandino's car was stopped by National Guard soldiers and they kidnapped him. Later that night, Sandino was assassinated by National Guard soldiers. Later, hundreds of men, women, and children from Sandino's agricultural colony were murdered.

[[File:Trujillo-Somoza 1952.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Anastasio Somoza García]] (left) with [[|]] President [[Rafael Trujillo]] in 1952]]
 has experienced several military dictatorships, the longest being the hereditary dictatorship of the [[Somoza family]], who ruled for 43 nonconsecutive years during the 20th century. The Somoza family came to power in 1937 partly as a result of a U.S.-engineered pact in 1927 that stipulated the formation of the ''Guardia Nacional'' to replace the marines who had long reigned in the country. Somoza García slowly eliminated officers in the national guard who might have stood in his way, and then deposed Sacasa and became president on 1&nbsp;January 1937, in a [[Electoral fraud|rigged election]].

In 1941, during the [[Second World War]],  declared war on [[Empire of |]] (8 December), [[Nazi |]] (11 December), [[Kingdom of |]] (11 December), [[Kingdom of |]] (19 December), [[Kingdom of  (1920–1946)|]] (19 December) and [[Kingdom of |]] (19 December). Only  reciprocated, declaring war on  on the same day (19 December 1941). No soldiers were sent to the war, but Somoza García confiscated properties held by [[ ]] residents. In 1945,  was among the first countries to ratify the United Nations Charter.

On 29 September 1956, Somoza García was shot to death by [[Rigoberto López Pérez]], a 27-year-old Liberal  poet. [[Luis Somoza Debayle]], the eldest son of the late president, was appointed president by the congress and officially took charge of the country. He is remembered by some as moderate, but after only a few years in power died of a heart attack. His successor as president was [[René Schick Gutiérrez]], whom most Nicaraguans viewed "as nothing more than a puppet of the Somozas". Somoza García's youngest son, [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]], often referred to simply as "Somoza", became president in 1967.

An [[1972  earthquake|earthquake in 1972]] destroyed nearly 90% of Managua, including much of its infrastructure. Instead of helping to rebuild the city, Somoza Debayle siphoned off relief money. The mishandling of relief money also prompted [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] star [[Roberto Clemente]] to personally fly to Managua on 31&nbsp;December 1972, but he died ''en route'' in an airplane accident. Even the economic elite were reluctant to support Somoza, as he had acquired monopolies in industries that were key to rebuilding the nation.

The Somoza family was among a few families or groups of influential firms which reaped most of the benefits of the country's growth from the 1950s to the 1970s. When Somoza was deposed by the Sandinistas in 1979, the family's worth was estimated to be between $500&nbsp;million and $1.5&nbsp;billion.

[[File:10th anniversary of the  revolution in Managua, 1989.jpg|thumb|Celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the [[ Revolution]] in [[Managua]] in 1989]]
In 1961, [[Carlos Fonseca]] looked back to the historical figure of Sandino, and along with two other people, one of whom was believed to be Casimiro Sotelo, who was later assassinated, founded the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (FSLN). After the 1972 earthquake and Somoza's apparent corruption, the ranks of the Sandinistas were flooded with young disaffected Nicaraguans who no longer had anything to lose.

In December 1974, a group of the FSLN, in an attempt to kidnap U.S. ambassador Turner Shelton, held some Managuan partygoers hostage after killing the party's host, former agriculture minister Jose Maria Castillo, until the Somoza government met their demands for a large ransom and free transport to [[]]. Somoza granted the demand, and then subsequently sent his national guard out into the countryside to look for the kidnappers, who were described by opponents as terrorists.

On 10 January 1978, [[Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal]], the editor of the national newspaper ''[[La Prensa (Managua)|La Prensa]]'' and ardent opponent of Somoza, was assassinated. It is alleged that the planners and perpetrators of the murder were at the highest echelons of the Somoza regime.

The Sandinistas forcefully took power in July 1979, ousting Somoza, and prompting the exodus of the majority of 's middle class, wealthy landowners, and professionals, many of whom settled in the . The Carter administration decided to work with the new government, while attaching a provision for aid forfeiture if it was found to be assisting insurgencies in neighboring countries. Somoza fled the country, and eventually ended up in [[]], where he was assassinated in September 1980, allegedly by members of the Argentinian Revolutionary Workers' Party.

In 1980, the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Carter administration]] provided $60&nbsp;million in aid to  under the Sandinistas, but the aid was suspended when the administration obtained evidence of  shipment of arms to El  rebels. {{Clarify span|Most people sided with  against the Sandinistas.|date=May 2024}}

====Contras (1981–1990)====
{{Main|Contras}}
[[File:Contra_commandas_1987.jpg|thumb|A group of [[Contras]] in the former [[Zelaya Department]]. Women [[Role of women in the  Revolution|commonly joined]] as combatants.]]
In response to the Sandinistas, various rebel groups collectively known as the "[[Contras]]" were formed to oppose the new government. The [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] ultimately authorized the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to [[ and state-sponsored terrorism#|help the Contra rebels]] with funding, weapons, and training. The Contras operated from camps in the neighboring countries of  to the north and  to the south.

They engaged in a systematic campaign of terror among rural Nicaraguans to disrupt the social reform projects of the Sandinistas. Several historians have criticized the Contra campaign and the [[Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration|Reagan administration's support for the Contras]], citing the brutality and numerous human rights violations of the Contras, alleging that health centers, schools, and cooperatives were destroyed by rebels, and that murder, rape, and torture occurred on a large scale in Contra-dominated areas. The U.S. also carried out a campaign of economic sabotage, and disrupted shipping by planting underwater mines in 's port of [[Corinto, |Corinto]], an action [[ v. |condemned]] by the [[International Court of Justice]] as illegal. The court also found that the U.S. encouraged acts contrary to humanitarian law by producing the manual ''[[Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare]]'' and disseminating it to the Contras. The manual, among other things, advised on how to rationalize killings of civilians. The U.S. also sought to place economic pressure on the Sandinistas, and the Reagan administration imposed a full trade embargo.

The Sandinistas were also accused of human rights abuses including torture, disappearances and mass executions. The [[Inter- Commission on Human Rights]] investigated abuses by Sandinista forces, including an execution of 35 to 40 [[Miskito people|Miskitos]] in December 1981, and an execution of 75 people in November 1984.

In the [[ general election, 1984| general elections of 1984]], which were judged by at least one visiting 30-person delegation of NGO representatives to have been free and fair, the Sandinistas won the parliamentary election and their leader [[Daniel Ortega]] won the presidential election. The Reagan administration criticized the elections as a "sham" based on the claim that [[Arturo Cruz]], the candidate nominated by the [[Coordinadora Democrática Nicaragüense]], comprising three right wing political parties, did not participate in the elections. However, the administration privately argued against Cruz's participation for fear that his involvement would legitimize the elections, and thus weaken the case for  aid to the Contras.

In 1983 the U.S. Congress prohibited federal funding of the Contras, but the Reagan administration illegally continued to back them by covertly selling arms to [[]] and channeling the proceeds to the Contras in the [[–Contra affair]], for which several members of the Reagan administration were convicted of felonies. The [[International Court of Justice]], in regard to the case of [[ v. ]] in 1986, found, "the  of America was under an obligation to make reparation to the Republic of  for all injury caused to  by certain breaches of obligations under customary international law and treaty-law committed by the  of America". During the war between the Contras and the Sandinistas, 30,000 people were killed.

In the [[1990  general election]], a coalition of anti-Sandinista parties from both the left and right of the political spectrum led by [[Violeta Chamorro]], the widow of Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal, defeated the Sandinistas. The defeat shocked the Sandinistas, who had expected to win.

Exit polls of Nicaraguans reported Chamorro's victory over [[Daniel Ortega|Ortega]] was achieved with a 55% majority. Chamorro was the first woman president of . Ortega vowed he would govern ''desde abajo'' (from below). Chamorro came to office with an economy in ruins, primarily because of the financial and social costs of the Contra War with the Sandinista-led government. In the [[1996  general election|1996 general election]], Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas of the FSLN lost again, this time to [[Arnoldo Alemán]] of the [[Constitutionalist Liberal Party ()|Constitutional Liberal Party]] (PLC).

In [[2001  general election|the 2001 elections]], the PLC again defeated the FSLN, with Alemán's Vice President [[Enrique Bolaños]] succeeding him as president. However, Alemán was convicted and sentenced in 2003 to 20 years in prison for [[embezzlement]], [[money laundering]], and corruption; liberal and Sandinista parliament members combined to strip the presidential powers of President Bolaños and his ministers, calling for his resignation and threatening [[impeachment]]. The Sandinistas said they no longer supported Bolaños after U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] told Bolaños to distance from the FSLN. This "slow motion ''coup d'état''" was averted partially by pressure from the Central  presidents, who vowed not to recognize any movement that removed Bolaños; the U.S., the OAS, and the [[European Union]] also opposed the action.

Before [[2006  general election|the general elections on 5 November 2006]], the [[National Assembly of |National Assembly]] passed a bill further restricting [[abortion in ]]. As a result,  is one of five countries in the world where abortion is illegal with no exceptions.

Legislative and presidential elections took place on 5 November 2006. Ortega returned to the presidency with 37.99% of the vote. This percentage was enough to win the presidency outright, because of a change in electoral law which lowered the percentage requiring a runoff election from 45% to 35% (with a 5% margin of victory). [[2011  general election|'s 2011 general election]] resulted in the re-election of Ortega, with a landslide 62.46% of the vote. In 2014 the National Assembly approved changes to the constitution allowing Ortega to run for a third successive term.

In November 2016, [[2016  general election|Ortega was elected for his third consecutive term]] (his fourth overall). International monitoring of the elections was initially prohibited, and as a result the validity of the [[Elections in |elections]] has been disputed, but observation by the [[Organization of  States|OAS]] was announced in October. Ortega was reported by  election officials as having received 72% of the vote. However, the [[Broad Front for Democracy]] (FAD), having promoted boycotts of the elections, claimed that 70% of voters had abstained (while election officials claimed 65.8% participation).

In April 2018, [[2018–2020  protests|demonstrations]] were held to oppose a decree increasing taxes and reducing benefits in the country's pension system. Local independent press organizations documented at least 19 dead and over 100 missing in the ensuing conflict. A reporter from NPR spoke to protestors who explained that while the initial issue was the pension reforms, the uprisings that spread across the country reflected many grievances about the government's time in office, and that the fight is for President Ortega and his vice president, his wife, to step down. 

24&nbsp;April 2018 marked the day of the greatest march in opposition of the Sandinista party. On 2&nbsp;May 2018, university student leaders made a public announcement giving the government seven days to set a date and time for a dialogue that was promised to the people due to the recent events of repression. The students also scheduled another peaceful protest march on that same day. As of May 2018, estimates of the death toll were as high as 63, many of them student protesters, and the wounded totalled more than 400. 

Following a working visit from 17 to 21&nbsp;May, the Inter- Commission on Human Rights adopted precautionary measures aimed at protecting members of the student movement and their families after testimonies indicated the majority of them had suffered acts of violence and death threats for their participation. In the last week of May, thousands who accuse Mr. Ortega and his wife of acting like dictators joined in resuming anti-government rallies after attempted peace talks have remained unresolved. Open suppression of political dissent and more militarized policing began in April 2018, but the onset of repression was gradual. On 12 October 2024,  broke ties with [[]] in response to the ongoing [[Gaza war]], condemning 's leaders as "fascist" and "[[Gaza genocide|genocidal]]".
