===Prehistoric and ancient period===
{{Main|Prehistoric |Ancient history of }}

Hunter-gatherers first arrived on  around 13–12,000 years ago (11,000 to 10,000 BC), based on dating of sites like [[Aetokremnos]] on the south coast and the inland site of Vretsia Roudias. The arrival of the first humans coincides with the extinction of the {{Convert|75|cm|ft|abbr=on}} high [[ pygmy hippopotamus]] and {{Convert|1|m}} tall [[ Dwarf Elephant| dwarf elephant]], the only large mammals native to the island. [[Neolithic]] farming communities emerged on the island by around 10,500 years ago (8500 BC).

Remains of an eight-month-old cat were discovered buried with a human body at a separate [[Neolithic]] site in . The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old (7500&nbsp;BC), predating [[ancient ]]ian civilisation and pushing back the [[Domestication of the cat|earliest known feline-human association]] significantly. The remarkably well-preserved Neolithic village of [[Khirokitia]] is a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], dating to approximately 6800&nbsp;BC.

During the Late [[Bronze Age]], from around 1650 BC  (identified in whole or part as [[Alashiya]] in contemporary texts) became more connected to the wider Mediterranean world driven by the trade in [[copper]] extracted from the Troodos Mountains, which stimulated the development of urbanised settlements across the island, with records suggesting that  at this time was ruled by "kings" who corresponded with the leaders of other Mediterranean states (like the [[pharaoh]]s of the [[New Kingdom of ]], as documented in the [[Amarna letters]]). The first recorded name of a  king is ''Kushmeshusha'', as appears on letters sent to [[Ugarit]] in the 13th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC.

At the end of the Bronze Age, the island experienced two waves of  settlement. The first wave consisted of [[Mycenaean |Mycenaean ]] traders, who started visiting  around 1400&nbsp;BC. A major wave of  settlement is believed to have taken place following the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] of Mycenaean  from 1100 to 1050&nbsp;BC, with the island's predominantly  character dating from this period.   occupies an important role in [[ mythology]], being the birthplace of [[Aphrodite]] and [[Adonis]], and home to [[Cinyras|King Cinyras]], [[Teucer]] and [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]. Literary evidence suggests an early Phoenician presence at [[Kition]], which was under [[Tyre, |Tyrian]] rule at the beginning of the 10th century BC. Some [[Phoenicia]]n merchants who were believed to come from [[Tyre, |Tyre]] [[colony|colonised]] the area and expanded the political influence of Kition. After c.&nbsp;850&nbsp;BC, the Phoenicians rebuilt and reused the sanctuaries [at the Kathari site].[[File:Kition, Zeus Keraunios.jpg|thumb|upright|Zeus Keraunios, 500–480 BC, Nicosia museum]]

 is at a strategic location in the Eastern Mediterranean. It was ruled by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] for a century starting in 708&nbsp;BC, before a brief spell under  rule and eventually [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] rule in 545&nbsp;BC. The Cypriots, led by [[Onesilus]], king of Salamis, joined their fellow Greeks in the [[Ionia]]n cities during the unsuccessful [[Ionian Revolt]] in 499&nbsp;BC against the Achaemenids. The revolt was suppressed, but  managed to maintain a high degree of autonomy and remained inclined towards the  world. 
During the whole period of the Persian rule, there is a continuity in the reign of the  kings and during their rebellions they were crushed by Persian rulers from Asia Minor, which is an indication that the Cypriots were ruling the island with directly regulated relations with the Great King and there was not a Persian [[satrap]]. The Kingdoms of  enjoyed special privileges and a semi-autonomous status, but they were still considered vassal subjects of the Great King.

The island was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333&nbsp;BC and  navy helped Alexander during the [[siege of Tyre (332 BC)]]. The  fleet was also sent to help [[Amphoterus (admiral)|Amphoterus]]. In addition, Alexander had two  generals [[Stasander]] and [[Stasanor]] both from the [[Soli, |Soli]] and later both became satraps in Alexander's empire.
Following Alexander's death, the [[Partition of Babylon|division of his empire]], and the subsequent [[Wars of the Diadochi]],  became part of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic empire]] of [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic ]]. It was during this period that the island was fully [[Hellenization|Hellenised]]. In 58&nbsp;BC  was acquired by the [[Roman Republic]] and became [[Roman ]] in 22 BC.

===Middle Ages===

[[File:Nicosia by Giacomo Franco.jpg|thumb|The [[Walls of Nicosia]] were built by the Venetians to defend the city in case of an Ottoman attack.]]
[[File:Kyrenia 01-2017 img11 Castle exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Kyrenia Castle]] was originally built by the Byzantines and enlarged by the Venetians.]]
When the [[Roman Empire]] was divided into Eastern and Western parts in 286,  became part of the East Roman Empire (also called the [[Byzantine Empire]]); the island would remain part of the empire for some 900 years. Under Byzantine rule, the  orientation that had been prominent since antiquity developed the strong Hellenistic-Christian character that continues to be a hallmark of the   community.

Beginning in 649,  endured repeated attacks and raids launched by [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. Many were quick raids, but others were large-scale attacks in which many Cypriots were killed and great wealth carried off or destroyed. The city of [[Salamis, |Salamis]] was destroyed and never rebuilt. Byzantine control remained stronger in the northern coast, the Arabs exerted more influence in the south. In 688, Emperor [[Justinian II|Justinian&nbsp;II]] and Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] signed a treaty whereby  would be paying an equal amount of tribute to the Caliphate and tax to the Empire, but would remain politically neutral to both while being retained as a province administered by the Empire. There are no Byzantine churches which survive from this period, and the island entered a period of impoverishment. Full Byzantine rule was restored in 965, when Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros&nbsp;II Phokas]] scored decisive victories on land and sea.

In 1156 [[Raynald of Châtillon]] and [[Thoros II|Thoros II of ]] brutally sacked  over a period of three weeks, stealing so much plunder and capturing so many of the leading citizens and their families for ransom, that the island took generations to recover. Several  priests were mutilated and sent away to Constantinople.

In 1185 [[Isaac Komnenos of |Isaac Komnenos]], a member of the Byzantine imperial family, took over  and declared it independent of the Empire. In 1191, during the [[Third Crusade]], [[Richard I of England]] captured the island from Isaac. He used it as a major supply base that was relatively safe from the [[Saracen]]s. A year later Richard sold the island to the [[Knights Templar]], who, following a bloody revolt, in turn sold it to [[Guy of Lusignan]]. His brother and successor [[Aimery of |Aimery]] was recognised as [[Kingdom of |King of ]] by [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]].

Following the death in 1473 of [[James II of |James&nbsp;II]], the last Lusignan king, the [[Republic of Venice]] assumed control of the island, while the late king's Venetian widow, Queen [[Catherine Cornaro]], reigned as figurehead. Venice formally annexed the [[Kingdom of ]] in 1489, following the abdication of Catherine. The Venetians fortified [[Nicosia]] by building the [[Walls of Nicosia]], and used it as an important commercial hub. Throughout Venetian rule, the [[Ottoman Empire]] frequently raided . In 1539 the Ottomans destroyed [[Limassol]] and so fearing the worst, the Venetians also fortified [[Famagusta]] and [[Kyrenia]].

Although the Lusignan  aristocracy remained the dominant social class in  throughout the medieval period, the former assumption that Greeks were treated only as serfs on the island is no longer considered by academics to be accurate. It is now accepted that the medieval period saw increasing numbers of  Cypriots elevated to the upper classes, a growing  [[middle class|middle ranks]], and the Lusignan royal household even marrying Greeks. This included King [[John II of |John&nbsp;II of ]] who married [[Helena Palaiologina]].

In 1570, a full-scale Ottoman assault with 60,000 troops brought the island under Ottoman control, despite stiff resistance by the inhabitants of Nicosia and Famagusta. Ottoman forces capturing  [[ massacre|massacred]] many  and  Christian inhabitants. The previous Latin elite were destroyed and the first significant demographic change since antiquity took place with the formation of a Muslim community. Soldiers who fought in the conquest settled on the island and  peasants and craftsmen were brought to the island from [[Anatolia]]. This new community also included banished Anatolian tribes, "undesirable" persons and members of various "troublesome" Muslim sects, as well as a number of new converts on the island.
[[File:Buyuk Han, Nicosia - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Büyük Han]], a [[caravanserai]] in Nicosia, is an example of the surviving Ottoman architecture in .]]
The Ottomans abolished the [[feudal]] system previously in place and applied the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]] to , under which non-Muslim peoples were governed by their own religious authorities. In a reversal from the days of Latin rule, the head of the [[Church of ]] was invested as leader of the   population and acted as mediator between Christian  Cypriots and the Ottoman authorities. This status ensured that the Church of  was in a position to end the [[Catholic Church]]'s constant expansion efforts on the island. Ottoman rule of  was at times indifferent, at times oppressive, depending on the temperaments of the sultans and local officials.

The ratio of Muslims to Christians fluctuated throughout the period of Ottoman domination. In 1777–78, 47,000 Muslims constituted a majority over the island's 37,000 Christians. By 1872, the population of the island had risen to 144,000, comprising 44,000 Muslims and 100,000 Christians. The Muslim population included numerous [[crypto-Christians]], including the [[Linobambaki]], a crypto-Catholic community that arose due to religious persecution of the Catholic community by the Ottoman authorities; this community would assimilate into the   community during British rule.

As soon as the [[ War of Independence]] broke out in 1821, several  Cypriots left for  to join the  forces. In response, the Ottoman governor of  arrested and executed 486 prominent  Cypriots, including the Archbishop of , [[Kyprianos of |Kyprianos]], and four other bishops. In 1828, modern 's first president [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] called for union of  with , and numerous minor uprisings took place. Reaction to Ottoman misrule led to uprisings by both  and  Cypriots, although none were successful. After centuries of neglect by the Ottoman Empire, the poverty of most of the people and the ever-present tax collectors fuelled  nationalism, and by the 20th century the idea of ''[[enosis|union]]'' with newly independent  was firmly rooted among  Cypriots.

Under Ottoman rule, numeracy, school enrolment and literacy rates were all low. They persisted some time after Ottoman rule ended, and then increased rapidly during the twentieth century.

===British ===

[[File:Hosting the British flag at Nicosia.jpg|thumb|upright|Hoisting the British flag at Nicosia]]

In the aftermath of the [[Russo- War (1877–1878)]] and the [[Congress of Berlin]],  was [[ Convention|leased]] to the [[British Empire]] which de facto took over its administration in 1878 (though, in terms of sovereignty,  remained a ''[[de jure]]'' Ottoman territory until 5 November 1914, together with [[Khedivate of | and ]]) in exchange for guarantees that Britain would use the island as a base to protect the Ottoman Empire against possible  aggression.

[[File: demonstration 1930.jpg|thumb|[[ Cypriots| ]] demonstrations for [[Enosis]] (union with ) in 1930]]
The island would serve Britain as a key military base for its colonial routes. By 1906, when the Famagusta harbour was completed,  was a strategic naval outpost overlooking the [[Suez Canal]], the crucial main route to  which was then Britain's most important overseas possession. Following the outbreak of the [[First World War]] and the decision of the Ottoman Empire to join the war on the side of the [[Central Powers]], on 5 November 1914 the British Empire formally annexed  and declared the Ottoman ''[[Khedive|Khedivate]]'' of [[Khedivate of | and ]] a [[Sultanate of |''Sultanate'' and British protectorate]].

In October 1915, Britain offered  to , ruled by King [[Constantine I of ]], on the condition that  join the war on the side of the British and went to [[Kingdom of |]]’s assistance, in order to fulfill her Treaty obligations under the [[– Alliance of 1913|Serbo- pact]] of May 1913. It gave  a golden 
“opportunity” in achieving ''[[enosis]]'' with . Alternatively it was a
“lost opportunity” when the [[Alexandros Zaimis|Zaimis]] administration declined the British proposal.

In 1923, under the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]], the nascent  republic relinquished any claim to , and in 1925 it was declared a British [[crown colony]]. During the [[Second World War]], many  and  Cypriots enlisted in the [[ Regiment]].

The   population, meanwhile, had become hopeful that the British administration would lead to ''enosis''. The idea of ''enosis'' was historically part of the ''[[Megali Idea]]'', a greater political ambition of a  state encompassing the territories with large  populations in the former Ottoman Empire, including  and [[Asia Minor]] with a capital in [[Constantinople]], and was actively pursued by the [[ Orthodox Church]], which had its members educated in . These religious officials, together with  military officers and professionals, some of whom still pursued the ''Megali Idea'', would later found the guerrilla organisation [[EOKA]] ''(Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston'' or National Organisation of  Fighters). The  Cypriots viewed the island as historically  and believed that union with  was a natural right. In the 1950s, the pursuit of ''enosis'' became a part of the  national policy.

[[File:Street riot in Nicosia 1956.jpg|thumb|A British soldier facing a crowd of   demonstrators in Nicosia (1956)]]

Initially, the  Cypriots favoured the continuation of the British rule. However, they were alarmed by the   calls for ''enosis'', as they saw the union of [[Cretan State|Crete]] with , which led to the exodus of [[Cretan Turks]], as a precedent to be avoided, and they took a pro-partition stance in response to the militant activity of EOKA. The  Cypriots also viewed themselves as a distinct ethnic group of the island and believed in their having a separate right to [[self-determination]] from  Cypriots. Meanwhile, in the 1950s,  leader [[Adnan Menderes|Menderes]] considered  an "extension of Anatolia", rejected the partition of  along ethnic lines and favoured the annexation of the whole island to . Nationalistic slogans centred on the idea that " is " and the ruling party declared  to be a part of the  homeland that was vital to its security. Upon realising that the fact that the   population was only 20% of the islanders made annexation unfeasible, the national policy was changed to favour partition. The slogan "Partition or Death" was frequently used in   and  protests starting in the late 1950s and continuing throughout the 1960s. Although after the Zürich and London conferences  seemed to accept the existence of the  state and to distance itself from its policy of favouring the partition of the island, the goal of the  and   leaders remained that of creating an independent  state in the northern part of the island.

In January 1950, the Church of  organised a [[ enosis referendum, 1950|referendum]] under the supervision of clerics and with no   participation, where 96% of the participating  Cypriots voted in favour of ''enosis''.{{rp|9}} The Greeks were 80.2% of the total island's population at the time ([[Demographics of |census 1946]]). Restricted autonomy under a constitution was proposed by the British administration but eventually rejected. In 1955 the EOKA organisation was founded, seeking union with  through armed struggle. At the same time the [[ Resistance Organisation]] (TMT), calling for Taksim, or partition, was established by the  Cypriots as a counterweight. British officials also tolerated the creation of the  underground organisation TMT The Secretary of State for the Colonies in a letter dated 15 July 1958 had advised the Governor of  not to act against TMT despite its illegal actions so as not to harm British relations with the  government.

During British rule, the future of the island became a matter of disagreement between the two prominent ethnic communities, [[ Cypriots]], who made up 77% of the population in 1960, and [[ Cypriots]], who made up 18% of the population. From the 19th century onwards, the   population pursued ''[[enosis]]'', union with [[]], which became a  national policy in the 1950s. The   population initially advocated the continuation of the British rule, then demanded the annexation of the island to , and in the 1950s, together with , established a policy of ''[[Taksim (politics)|taksim]]'', the partition of  and the creation of a  polity in the north.[[File:Ethnographic distribution in  1960.jpg|thumb|Ethnic map of  according to the 1960 census]]
 was [[London and Zürich Agreements|granted independence]] in 1960, following an armed campaign spearheaded by EOKA. As per the [[Zürich and London Agreement]],  officially attained independence on 16 August 1960, and at the time had a total population of 573,566; of whom 442,138 (77.1%) were Greeks, 104,320 (18.2%) Turks, and 27,108 (4.7%) others. The UK retained the two [[Sovereign Base Areas]] of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]], while government posts and public offices were allocated by ethnic quotas, giving the minority  Cypriots a permanent veto, 30% in parliament and administration, and granting the three mother-states guarantor rights.

However, the division of power as foreseen by the constitution soon resulted in legal impasses and discontent on both sides, and nationalist militants started training again, with the military support of  and  respectively. The   leadership believed that the rights given to  Cypriots under the 1960 constitution were too extensive and designed the [[Akritas plan]], which was aimed at reforming the constitution in favour of  Cypriots, persuading the international community about the correctness of the changes and violently subjugating  Cypriots in a few days should they not accept the plan. Tensions were heightened when  President Archbishop [[Makarios&nbsp;III]] called for [[Zürich and London Agreement#13 Amendments proposed by Makarios III|constitutional changes]], which were rejected by {{rp|17–20}} and opposed by  Cypriots.

Intercommunal violence [[Bloody Christmas (1963)|erupted]] on 21 December 1963, when two  Cypriots were killed at an incident involving the   police. The violence resulted in the death of 364&nbsp; and 174&nbsp; Cypriots, destruction of 109   or mixed villages and displacement of 25,000–30,000  Cypriots. The crisis resulted in the end of the   involvement in the administration and their claiming that it had lost its legitimacy;{{rp|56–59}} the nature of this event is still controversial. In some areas,  Cypriots prevented  Cypriots from travelling and entering government buildings, while some  Cypriots willingly withdrew due to the calls of the   administration.  Cypriots started living in [[  enclaves|enclaves]]. The republic's structure was changed, unilaterally, by Makarios, and Nicosia was divided by the [[Green Line ()|Green Line]], with the deployment of [[UNFICYP]] troops.{{rp|56–59}}

In 1964,  threatened to invade  in response to the continuing [[ intercommunal violence]], but this was stopped by a strongly worded telegram from the US President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on 5 June, warning that the US would not stand beside  in case of a consequential Soviet invasion of  territory. Meanwhile, by 1964, ''enosis'' was a  policy and would not be abandoned; Makarios and the  prime minister [[Georgios Papandreou]] agreed that ''enosis'' should be the ultimate aim and King [[Constantine II of |Constantine]] wished  "a speedy union with the mother country".  dispatched 10,000 troops to  to counter a possible  invasion.

The [[Bloody Christmas (1963)|crisis of 1963–64]] had brought further [[ intercommunal violence|intercommunal violence]] between the two communities, displaced more than 25,000  Cypriots into [[  enclaves|enclaves]]{{rp|56–59}} and brought the end of   representation in the republic.

===1974 coup d'état, invasion, and division===

[[File:Famagusta-Varosha 2007.JPG|thumb|[[Varosha, Famagusta|Varosha (Maraş)]], a suburb of Famagusta, was abandoned when its inhabitants fled in 1974 and remains under  military control.]]
On 15 July 1974, the [[ military junta of 1967–1974| military junta]] under [[Dimitrios Ioannides]] carried out a [[1974  coup d'état|coup d'état]] in , to [[Enosis|unite the island with ]]. The coup ousted president [[Makarios&nbsp;III]] and replaced him with pro-[[enosis]] nationalist [[Nikos Sampson]]. In response to the coup,{{efn|See:}} five days later, on 20 July 1974, the [[ invasion of | army invaded]] the island, citing a right to intervene to restore the constitutional order from the 1960 [[Treaty of Guarantee (1960)|Treaty of Guarantee]]. This justification has been rejected by the [[United Nations]] and the international community.

The  air force began bombing  positions in , and hundreds of [[paratroopers]] were dropped in the area between Nicosia and Kyrenia, where well-armed   enclaves had been long-established; while off the Kyrenia coast,  troop ships landed 6,000 men as well as tanks, trucks and armoured vehicles.

Three days later, when a ceasefire had been agreed,  had landed 30,000 troops on the island and captured Kyrenia, the corridor linking Kyrenia to Nicosia, and the   quarter of Nicosia itself. The junta in [[Athens]], and then the Sampson regime in  fell from power. In Nicosia, [[Glafkos Clerides]] temporarily assumed the presidency. But after the peace negotiations in [[Geneva]], the  government reinforced their Kyrenia bridgehead and started a second invasion on 14 August. The invasion resulted in [[Morphou]], [[Karpass Peninsula|Karpass]], Famagusta and the [[Mesaoria]] coming under  control.

International pressure led to a ceasefire, and by then 36% of the island had been taken over by the Turks and 180,000  Cypriots had been evicted from their homes in the north. At the same time, around 50,000  Cypriots were displaced to the north and settled in the properties of the displaced  Cypriots. Among a variety of sanctions against , in mid-1975 the US Congress imposed an arms embargo on  for using US-supplied equipment during the [[ invasion of ]] in 1974. There were 1,534  Cypriots and 502  Cypriots missing as a result of the fighting from 1963 to 1974.

The Republic of  has ''[[de jure]]'' [[sovereignty]] over the entire island, including its [[territorial waters]] and [[exclusive economic zone]], with the exception of the Sovereign Base Areas of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]], which remain under the UK's control according to the [[London-Zürich Agreements|London and Zürich Agreements]]. However, the island is ''[[de facto]]'' partitioned into two main parts: the area under the effective control of the Republic of , in the south and west and comprising about 59% of the island's area, and the north, administered by the self-declared  Republic of Northern , covering about 36% of the island's area. Another nearly 4% of the island's area is covered by the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in |UN buffer zone]]. The international community considers the northern part of the island to be territory of the Republic of  occupied by  forces.{{efn|See:}} The occupation is viewed as illegal under international law and amounting to illegal occupation of EU territory since  became a member of the [[European Union]].

===Post-division===

After the restoration of constitutional order and the return of Archbishop [[Makarios&nbsp;III]] to  in December 1974,  troops remained, occupying the northeastern portion of the island. In 1983, the [[Assembly of the Republic (Northern )|  parliament]], led by the   leader [[Rauf Denktaş]], [[Declaration of Independence of the  Republic of Northern |proclaimed]] the  Republic of Northern  (TRNC), which is recognised only by .

The events of the summer of 1974 dominate the [[ dispute|politics]] on the island, as well as [[Greco- relations]]. [[ settlers in Northern | settlers]] have been settled in the north with the encouragement of the  and   states. The Republic of  considers their presence a violation of the [[Geneva Convention]],{{rp|56–59}} whilst many  settlers have since severed their ties to  and their second generation considers  to be their homeland.

The  invasion, the ensuing occupation and the declaration of independence by the TRNC have been condemned by United Nations resolutions, which are reaffirmed by the Security Council every year.

Attempts to resolve the  dispute have continued. In 2004, the [[Annan Plan]], drafted by then UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]], was put to a [[ Annan Plan referendums, 2004|referendum]] in both  administrations. 65% of  Cypriots voted in support of the plan and 74%  Cypriots voted against the plan, saying that it disproportionately favoured  Cypriots and gave unreasonable influence over the nation to . In total, 66.7% of the voters [[ Annan Plan referendum, 2004|rejected the Annan Plan]].

On 1 May 2004  joined the [[European Union]], together with nine other countries.  was accepted into the EU as a whole, although the EU legislation is suspended in Northern  until a final settlement of the  problem.

Efforts have been made to enhance freedom of movement between the two sides. In April 2003, Northern  unilaterally eased checkpoint restrictions, permitting Cypriots to cross between the two sides for the first time in 30 years. In March 2008, a wall that had stood for decades at the boundary between the Republic of  and the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in |UN buffer zone]] was demolished. The wall had cut across [[Ledra Street]] in the heart of Nicosia and was seen as a strong symbol of the island's 32-year division. On 3 April 2008, Ledra Street was reopened in the presence of  and   officials. The two sides relaunched reunification talks in 2015, but these collapsed in 2017.

The [[European Union]] warned in February 2019 that  was selling [[Passports of the European Union|EU passports]] to [[ oligarch]]s, and thus would allow [[organized crime|organised crime]] syndicates to infiltrate the EU. In 2020, leaked documents revealed a wider range of former and current officials from , , Dubai, , the  Federation, ,  and  who bought a  citizenship prior to a change of the law in July 2019. Since 2020  and  have been [[– maritime zones dispute|engaged in a dispute]] over the extent of their [[exclusive economic zone]]s, ostensibly sparked by oil and gas exploration in the area.

In November 2023, the [[ Confidential]] data leak published by the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] showed the country's financial network entertaining strong links with  oligarchs and high-up figures in the Kremlin, supporting the regime of [[Vladimir Putin]].

In July 2024, on the 50th anniversary of the  invasion of Northern ,  President Erdoğan rejected a United Nations-endorsed plan for a federal government and supported the idea of having two separate states within .  Cypriots immediately rejected Erdoğan's two-state proposal, calling it a "non-starter".
