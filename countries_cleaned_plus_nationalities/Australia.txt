[[Indigenous ]] comprise two broad groups:
* [[Aboriginal ]], who are the various [[Indigenous peoples]] of the  mainland and many of its islands, including [[Aboriginal Tasmanians|Tasmania]]
* [[Torres Strait Islanders]], who are a distinct [[Melanesia]]n people of [[Torres Strait Islands]]

Human habitation of the  continent is estimated to have begun 50,000 to 65,000 years ago, with the migration of people by [[land bridge]]s and short sea crossings from what is now Southeast Asia. It is uncertain how many waves of immigration may have contributed to these ancestors of modern Aboriginal . The [[Madjedbebe]] rock shelter in [[Arnhem Land]] is possibly the oldest site showing the presence of humans in . The oldest human remains found are the [[Lake Mungo remains]], which have been dated to around 42,000 years ago.

Aboriginal  culture is one of the oldest continuous cultures on Earth. At the time of first European contact, Aboriginal  belonged to wide range of societies, with diverse economies spread across at least [[ Aboriginal languages|250 different language groups]]. Estimates of the Aboriginal population before  settlement range from 300,000 to 3 million. Aboriginal  cultures were (and remain) deeply connected with the land and the environment, with stories of [[The Dreaming]] maintained through [[oral tradition]], [[Songline|songs]], dance and paintings. Certain groups engaged in [[fire-stick farming]], [[fish farming]], and built [[Indigenous architecture#|semi-permanent shelters]]. These practices have variously been characterised as "[[hunter-gatherer]]", "[[Agriculture|agricultural]]", "natural cultivation" and "intensification".

Torres Strait Islander people first settled their islands at least 2,500 years ago. Culturally and linguistically distinct from mainland Aboriginal peoples, they were seafarers and obtained their livelihood from seasonal horticulture and the resources of their reefs and seas. Agriculture also developed on some islands and villages appeared by the 1300s. By the mid-18th century in northern , [[Makassan contact with |contact, trade and cross-cultural engagement]] had been established between local Aboriginal groups and [[Makassar people|Makassan]] [[trepanging|trepangers]], visiting from present-day .

===European exploration and colonisation===

[[File:Landing of Lieutenant James Cook at Botany Bay, 29 April 1770 (painting by E Phillips Fox).jpg|alt=Landing of Lieutenant James Cook at Botany Bay, 29 April 1770|left|thumb|Landing of [[James Cook]] at [[Botany Bay]] on 29 April 1770]]
The [[ East  Company]] ship, ''[[Duyfken]]'', captained by [[Willem Janszoon]], made the first documented European landing in  in 1606. Later that year, [[Luís Vaz de Torres]] sailed to the north of  through [[Torres Strait]], along New 's southern coast. [[Abel Tasman]]'s voyage of 1642 was the first known European expedition to reach [[Van Diemen's Land]]. On his second voyage of 1644, he mapped the north coast of  south of New . Following Tasman's voyages, the  were able to make almost complete maps of 's northern and western coasts and much of its southern and south-eastern Tasmanian coasts. They named the continent [[New Holland ()|New Holland]]''.''

In 1770, Captain [[James Cook]] sailed along and mapped the east coast, which he named "[[New South Wales]]" and claimed for Great Britain. in 1786, the  government announced its intention to establish a [[penal colony]] in New South Wales. On 26 January 1788, the [[First Fleet]] commanded by Captain [[Arthur Phillip]], arrived at [[Sydney Cove]], Port Jackson. A camp was established and the [[Union Jack|Union Flag]] raised. The date later became [[ Day|'s national day]].

Most early settlers were [[convicts in |convicts]], [[penal transportation|transported]] for petty crimes and [[convict assignment|assigned]] as labourers or servants to "free settlers" (willing immigrants). Once [[emancipist|emancipated]], convicts tended to integrate into colonial society. Aboriginal resistance, convict rebellions and [[Bushranger|bushranging]] were sometimes suppressed under martial law. The 1808 [[Rum Rebellion]], carried out by officers of the [[New South Wales Corps|New South Wales Corp]], led to a temporary [[military junta]]. During the next two decades, social and economic reforms, together with the establishment of a [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] and [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Supreme Court]], saw the penal colony transition to a civil society.

<!-- Please take note of talk page discussion (archive 21, Colonial expansion, treaties and land rights) before editing -->The indigenous population declined for 150 years following European settlement, mainly due to infectious disease.  colonial authorities did not sign any treaties with [[Aboriginal #Groups and sub-groups|Aboriginal groups]]. As settlement expanded, tens of thousands of Indigenous people and thousands of settlers were killed in [[ frontier wars|frontier conflicts]], which many historians argue included acts of [[Genocide of Indigenous |genocide]] by settlers. Settlers dispossessed surviving Indigenous peoples of most of their land.

Forested land rises gently to a peak several kilometres back from the shore.|Tasmania's [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] penal settlement is one of eleven UNESCO World Heritage-listed [[ Convict Sites]].]]

In 1803, a settlement was established in [[Van Diemen's Land]] (present-day [[Tasmania]]), and in 1813, [[Gregory Blaxland]], [[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]] and [[William Wentworth]] [[1813 crossing of the Blue Mountains|crossed the Blue Mountains]] west of Sydney, opening the interior to European settlement. The  claim was extended to the whole  continent in 1827 when Major [[Edmund Lockyer]] established a settlement on [[King George Sound]] (modern-day [[Albany, Western |Albany]]). The [[Swan River Colony]] (present-day [[Perth]]) was established in 1829, evolving into the largest  colony by area, [[History of Western |Western ]]. Separate colonies were carved from New South Wales: Tasmania in 1825, [[ colonisation of South |South ]] in 1836, [[Colony of Victoria|Victoria]] in 1851, and [[Colony of Queensland|Queensland]] in 1859. South  and Victoria were founded as free colonies—they never accepted transported convicts. Growing [[Australasian Anti-Transportation League|opposition to the convict system]] culminated in its abolition in the eastern colonies by the 1850s. Initially a free colony, Western  accepted convicts from 1850 to 1868.

The six colonies individually gained [[responsible government]] between 1855 and 1890, managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the [[ Empire]]. The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs. The colonial parliaments progressively extended voting rights to adult men from 1856, with [[women's suffrage]] on equal terms following between the 1890s and 1900s. Some colonies introduced racial restrictions on voting from 1885.

In the mid-19th century, explorers such as [[Burke and Wills expedition|Burke and Wills]] charted 's interior. A [[ gold rushes|series of gold rushes]] beginning in the early 1850s led to an influx of new migrants from [[ |]], North America and continental Europe, as well as outbreaks of [[bushranger|bushranging]] and civil unrest; the latter peaked in 1854 when [[Ballarat]] miners launched the [[Eureka Rebellion]] against gold licence fees. The 1860s saw the rise of [[blackbirding]], where [[South Sea Islanders]] were coerced or abducted into [[indentured labour]], mainly by Queensland colonists.

From 1886,  colonial governments began [[Stolen Generations|removing many Aboriginal children]] from their families and communities, justified on the grounds of child protection and [[forced assimilation]] policies. The [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902) marked the largest overseas deployment of [[colonial forces of |'s colonial forces]].

On 1 January 1901, [[Federation of |federation of the colonies]] was achieved after a decade of planning, [[Constitutional Convention ()|constitutional conventions]] and [[1898–1900  constitutional referendums|referendums]], resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of  as a nation under the new [[Constitution of | Constitution]].

From 1901,  was a self-governing [[dominion]] within the  Empire. It was one of the founding members of the [[League of Nations]] in 1920, and the [[Member states of the United Nations|United Nations]] in 1945. The ''[[Statute of Westminster 1931]]'' ended the ability of the UK to legislate for  at the federal level without 's consent.  [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942|adopted it]] in 1942, but it was backdated to 1939 to confirm the validity of legislation passed during World War II.

The [[ Capital Territory]] was formed in 1911 as the location for the future federal capital of [[Canberra]]. While it was being constructed, [[Melbourne]] served as the temporary capital from 1901 to 1927. The [[Northern Territory]] was transferred from the control of South  to the Commonwealth in 1911.  took over the administration of the [[Territory of Papua]] (which had previously been a  colony) in 1905 and of the [[Territory of New ]] (formerly [[ New ]]) in 1920. The two were unified as the [[Territory of Papua and New ]] in 1949 and gained independence from  in 1975.

[[File:Darwin 42.jpg|thumb|The 1942 [[Bombing of Darwin]], the first of more than 100 [[Air raids on , 1942–1943| air raids on ]] during [[World War II]]]]
In 1914,  joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in the First World War, and took part in the fighting on several fronts. Of the 324,000 men who served overseas, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were wounded. Many  regard the defeat of the [[ and  Army Corps]] (ANZAC) at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] in 1915 as the "baptism of fire" that forged the [[Anzac spirit|new nation's identity]]. The [[Landing at Anzac Cove|beginning of the campaign]] is commemorated annually on [[Anzac Day]], a date which rivals [[ Day]] as the nation's most important.

From 1939 to 1945,  joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in fighting the Second World War. 's [[ Defence Force|armed forces]] fought in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]], [[European Theatre of World War II|European]] and [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]] [[List of theaters and campaigns of World War II|theatres]]. The shock of Britain's [[fall of |defeat in ]] in 1942, followed soon after by the [[bombing of Darwin]] and [[Air raids on , 1942–43|other  attacks on  soil]], led to a widespread belief in  that [[Proposed  invasion of  during World War II|a  invasion was imminent]], and a shift from the  to the [[– relations|]] as 's principal ally and security partner. Since 1951,  has been allied with the  under the [[ANZUS]] treaty.

===Post-war and contemporary eras===

[[File: Migrant 1954 MariaScholte=50000thToAustraliaPostWW2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Post-war immigration to |Postwar migrants]] from Europe arriving in  in 1954]]
In the three decades following World War II,  experienced significant increases in living standards, leisure time and suburban development. Governments encouraged a [[Post-war immigration to |large wave of immigration from across Europe]] and called these migrants "[[New ]]". High immigration was justified to  using the slogan "populate or perish," and from the 1960s the [[white  policy]] was gradually relaxed.

A member of the [[Western Bloc]] during the [[Cold War]],  participated in the [[ in the  War| War]] and the [[Military history of  during the Malayan Emergency|Malayan Emergency]] during the 1950s and the [[Military history of  during the  War| War]] from 1962 to 1973. Tensions over communist influence in society led to [[1951  Communist Party ban referendum|unsuccessful attempts]] by the [[Menzies Government (1949–1966)|Menzies Government]] to ban the [[Communist Party of ]], and a [[ Labor Party split of 1955|bitter split]] in the [[ Labor Party|Labor Party]] in 1955.

As a result of a [[ referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]], the federal government gained the power to legislate with regard to Aboriginal , and Aboriginal  were fully included in the [[Census in |census]]. [[Aboriginal title|Pre-colonial land interests]] (referred to as [[Native title in |native title]] in ) was recognised in law for the first time when the [[High Court of ]] held in ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]]'' that  was not ''[[terra nullius]]'' ({{Gloss|land belonging to no one}}) at the time of European settlement.

Following the abolition of the last vestiges of the [[White  policy]] in 1973, 's demography and culture transformed as a result of a large and ongoing wave of non-European immigration, mostly from Asia. The late 20th century also saw an increasing focus on foreign policy ties with other [[Asia–Pacific|Asia{{En dash}}Pacific]] nations. The [[ Acts]] of 1986 severed the remaining constitutional ties between  and the  while maintaining the monarch in her independent capacity as [[Queen of ]]. In a [[1999  republic referendum|1999 constitutional referendum]], 55% of voters rejected [[Republicanism in |abolishing the monarchy]] and becoming a republic.

Following the [[September 11 attacks]] on the ,  joined the  in fighting the [[Military history of  during the War in | War]] from 2001 to 2021 and the [[ contribution to the 2003 invasion of | War]] from 2003 to 2009. The nation's trade relations also became increasingly oriented towards East Asia in the 21st century, with  becoming the nation's [[List of the largest trading partners of |largest trading partner]] by a large margin.

In response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in |COVID-19 pandemic]], from March 2020 [[COVID-19 lockdowns|lockdowns]] and other restrictions on public gatherings and movement across the national and state borders were implemented by the Federal, state and territory governments. Following the rollout of vaccines in 2021, these restrictions were gradually eased. In October 2023,  declared that COVID-19 was no longer a communicable disease incident of national significance.
