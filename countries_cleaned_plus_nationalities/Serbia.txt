Archaeological evidence of [[Paleolithic]] settlements on the territory of present-day  is scarce. A fragment of a hominid jaw found in [[Sićevo]] (Mala [[Balanica]]) is believed to be up to 525,000–397,000 years old.{{sfn|Roksandic|2011|pp=186–196}}

Approximately 6,500 BC, during the [[Neolithic]], the [[Starčevo culture|Starčevo]] and [[Vinča culture|Vinča]] cultures existed in the region of modern-day Belgrade. They dominated much of [[Southeast Europe]] as well as parts of [[Central Europe]] and [[Anatolia]]. Several important archaeological sites from this era, including [[Lepenski Vir]] and [[Vinča-Belo Brdo]], still exist near the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Chapman|1981|p=}}{{sfn|Srejović|1988|p=}}

During the [[Iron Age]], local tribes of [[Triballi]], [[Dardani]], and [[Autariatae]] were encountered by the [[Ancient |Ancient Greeks]] during their cultural and political expansion into the region, from the 5th up to the 2nd century BC. The Celtic tribe of [[Scordisci]] settled throughout the area in the 3rd century BC. It formed a tribal state, building several fortifications, including their capital at [[Singidunum]] (present-day Belgrade) and Naissos (present-day [[Niš]]).

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered much of the territory in the 2nd century BC. In 167 BC, the [[Roman province]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] was established; the remainder was conquered around 75 BC, forming the Roman province of [[Moesia#History|Moesia Superior]]; the modern-day [[Srem District|Srem]] region was conquered in 9 BC; and Bačka and Banat in 106 AD after the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]. As a result of this, contemporary  extends fully or partially over several former Roman provinces, including [[Moesia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Praevalitana]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Dacia]], and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Seventeen Roman Emperors were born in the area of modern-day , second only to contemporary .{{sfn|Kuzmanović|Mihajlović|2015|pp=416–432}} The most famous of these was [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian Emperor, who issued an edict ordering [[Edict of Milan|religious tolerance throughout the Empire]].

When the Roman Empire was divided in 395, most of  remained under the [[Byzantine Empire]], and its northwestern parts were included in the [[Western Roman Empire]]. By the 6th century, [[South Slavs]] migrated into the Byzantine territory in large numbers.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1956|p=84}} They merged with the local [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanised]] population that was gradually assimilated.{{sfn|Stipčević|1977|p=76}}{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=38, 41}}{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=533}}

The [[ Orthodox Church]] was organised as an [[Autocephaly|autocephalous]] archbishopric in 1219,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=28}} through the effort of [[Saint Sava|Sava]], the country's patron saint, and in 1346 it was raised to the [[ Patriarchate of Peć|Patriarchate]]. Monuments of the Nemanjić period survive in many [[List of  Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] (several being [[List of World Heritage Sites in |World Heritage sites]]) and [[List of fortifications in |fortifications]].

During these centuries the  state (and influence) expanded significantly. The northern part (modern [[Vojvodina]]), was ruled by the [[Kingdom of ]]. The period after 1371, known as the [[Fall of the  Empire]] saw the once-powerful state fragmented into several principalities, culminating in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389) against the rising [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|pp=84&ndash;85}} By the end of the 14th century, the Turks had conquered and ruled the territories south of the [[Šar Mountains]].

In all  lands conquered by the Ottomans, the native nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was [[Serfdom|enserfed]] to Ottoman rulers, while much of the clergy fled or were confined to the isolated monasteries. Under the Ottoman system, Serbs and Christians were considered an [[rayah|inferior class]] and subjected to heavy taxes, and a portion of the  population experienced [[Islamization|Islamisation]]. Many Serbs were recruited during the [[devshirme]] system, a [[slavery in the Ottoman Empire|form of slavery]], in which boys from Balkan Christian families were [[Forced conversion|forcibly converted]] to [[Islam]] and trained for infantry units of the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] known as the [[Janissaries]].{{sfn|A ́goston|Masters|2010|p=383}}{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2001|p=251}}{{sfn|Rodriguez|1997|p=6}}{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=62}} The  Patriarchate of Peć was extinguished in 1463,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=134}} but reestablished in 1557,{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|pp=135&ndash;136}}{{sfn|Fotić|2008|pp=519–520}}{{sfn|Sotirović|2011|pp=143–169}} providing for limited continuation of  cultural traditions within the Ottoman Empire, under the [[Millet system]].{{sfn|Runciman|1968|p=204}}{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=115}}

After the loss of statehood to the Ottoman Empire,  resistance continued in northern regions (modern Vojvodina), under titular despots (until 1537), and popular leaders like [[Jovan Nenad]] (1526–1527). From 1521 to 1552, Ottomans conquered Belgrade and regions of Syrmia, Bačka, and Banat.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|pp=115, 119}} Wars and rebellions constantly challenged Ottoman rule. One of the most significant was the [[Banat Uprising]] in 1594 and 1595, which was part of the [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] (1593–1606) between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans.{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|pp=141–142}}{{sfn|Sotirović|2011|pp=163–164}} The area of modern Vojvodina endured a century-long Ottoman occupation before being ceded to the [[Habsburg monarchy]], partially by the [[Treaty of Karlovci]] (1699),{{sfn|Pešalj|2010|pp=29&ndash;42}} and fully by the [[Treaty of Požarevac]] (1718).{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|p=151}}

The [[Corfu Declaration]] was a formal agreement between the government-in-exile of the Kingdom of  and the [[Yugoslav Committee]] (anti-Habsburg South Slav émigrés) that pledged to unify Kingdom of  and [[Kingdom of ]] with -'s South Slav autonomous crown lands: [[Kingdom of -Slavonia]], [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], [[]], Vojvodina (then part of the Kingdom of ) and [[]] in a post-war Yugoslav state. It was signed on 20 July 1917 on Corfu.

As the Austro- Empire collapsed, the territory of Syrmia united with  on 24 November 1918. Just a day later, the [[Great People's Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs in Banat, Bačka and Baranja]] declared the unification of these regions ([[Banat]], [[Bačka]], and [[Baranya County (former)|Baranja]]) with .

Serb centralists and Croat autonomists clashed in the parliament, and most governments were fragile and short-lived. [[Nikola Pašić]], a conservative prime minister, headed or dominated most governments until his death. King Alexander established a [[6 January Dictatorship|dictatorship]] in 1929 with the aim of establishing the [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslav ideology]] and single [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav nation]], changed the name of the country to Yugoslavia. The effect of Alexander's dictatorship was to further alienate the non-Serbs living in Yugoslavia from the idea of unity.{{sfn|Stavrianos|2000|p=624}}

Alexander was assassinated in [[Marseille]], during an official visit in 1934 by [[Vlado Chernozemski]], member of the [[Internal  Revolutionary Organization|IMRO]].

In August 1939 the [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement]] established an autonomous [[Banate of ]] as a solution to  concerns.

===World War II===
{{Main|World War II in Yugoslavia|The Holocaust in -occupied |Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of }}

In 1941, in spite of Yugoslav attempts to remain neutral, the [[Axis powers]] invaded Yugoslavia. The territory of modern  was divided between , , the Independent State of , Greater  and , while the remainder was placed under the [[Territory of the Military Commander in |military administration]] of [[Nazi ]], with [[Government of National Salvation| puppet governments]] led by [[Milan Aćimović]] and [[Milan Nedić]] assisted by [[Dimitrije Ljotić]]'s fascist organisation [[Yugoslav National Movement]] (Zbor).

The Yugoslav territory was the scene of a civil war between [[Chetniks|royalist Chetniks]] commanded by [[Draža Mihailović]] and [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|communist partisans]] commanded by [[Josip Broz Tito]]. Axis auxiliary units of the [[ Volunteer Corps (World War II)| Volunteer Corps]] and the [[ State Guard]] fought against both of these forces. The [[siege of Kraljevo]] was a major battle of the [[Uprising in  (1941)|uprising in ]], led by Chetnik forces against the Nazis. Several days after the battle began the  forces committed a massacre of approximately 2,000 civilians in an event known as the [[Kraljevo massacre]], in a reprisal for the attack.

[[Loznica|Draginac and Loznica massacre]] of 2,950 villagers in Western  in 1941 was the first large execution of civilians in occupied  by [[Nazi|]]s, with [[Kragujevac massacre]] and [[Novi Sad Raid]] of Jews and Serbs by  fascists being the most notorious, with over 3,000 victims in each case.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=62}} After one year of occupation, around 16,000 [[ Jews]] were murdered in the area, or around 90% of its pre-war Jewish population during [[The Holocaust in ]].
Many concentration camps were established across the area. [[Banjica concentration camp]] was the largest concentration camp and jointly run by the  army and Nedić's regime, with primary victims being  Jews, [[Romani people|Roma]], and Serb political prisoners.

Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Serbs fled the Axis [[puppet state]] known as the [[Independent State of ]] and sought refuge in -occupied , seeking to escape the large-scale persecution and [[Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of |Genocide of Serbs]], Jews, and Roma being committed by the [[Ustaše]] regime. The number of Serb victims was approximately 300,000 to 350,000. According to Tito himself, Serbs made up the vast majority of [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] fighters and [[Yugoslav Partisans]] for the whole course of [[World War II]].

The [[Republic of Užice]] was a short-lived liberated territory established by the Partisans and the first liberated territory in World War II Europe, organised as a military mini-state that existed in the autumn of 1941 in the west of [[ under  occupation|occupied ]]. By late 1944, the [[Belgrade Offensive]] swung in favour of the partisans in the civil war; the partisans subsequently gained control of Yugoslavia. Following the Belgrade Offensive, the [[Syrmian Front]] was the last major military action of World War II in . A study by [[Vladimir Žerjavić]] estimates total [[World War II casualties|war-related deaths]] in Yugoslavia at 1,027,000, including 273,000 in .

===Socialist Yugoslavia===
{{Main|Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Communist purges in  in 1944–45}}
[[File:Konferencija Pokreta nesvrstanih 1961. godine.jpg|thumb|The principle of non-alignment was the core of Yugoslav and later  diplomacy. The First [[Non-Aligned Movement]] Summit Conference took place in [[Belgrade]] in September 1961]]
The victory of the Communist Partisans resulted in the abolition of the monarchy and a subsequent constitutional referendum. A [[one-party state]] was soon established in Yugoslavia by the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist Party of Yugoslavia]]. It is claimed between 60,000 and 70,000 people died in  during the [[Communist purges in  in 1944–45|1944–45 communist purge]].  became a constituent republic within the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] known as the [[Socialist Republic of |People's Republic of ]], and had a republic-branch of the federal communist party, the [[League of Communists of ]].
's most powerful and influential politician in Tito-era Yugoslavia was [[Aleksandar Ranković]], one of the "big four" Yugoslav leaders. Ranković was later removed from the office because of the disagreements regarding Kosovo's [[nomenklatura]] and the unity of . Ranković's dismissal was highly unpopular among Serbs. Pro-decentralisation reformers in Yugoslavia succeeded in the late 1960s in attaining substantial decentralisation of powers, creating substantial autonomy in Kosovo and Vojvodina, and recognising a distinctive "[[Muslims (ethnicity)|Muslim]]" nationality. As a result of these reforms, there was a massive overhaul of Kosovo's nomenklatura and police, that shifted from being Serb-dominated to ethnic -dominated through firing Serbs on a large scale. Further concessions were made to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo in response to unrest, including the creation of the [[University of Pristina (1969–1999)|University of Pristina]] as an [[ language]] institution. These changes created widespread fear among Serbs of being treated as [[second-class citizen]]s.

Belgrade, the capital of FPR Yugoslavia and PR , hosted the first [[Non-Aligned Movement]] Summit in September 1961, as well as the first major gathering of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) with the aim of implementing the [[Helsinki Accords]] from October 1977 to March 1978. The [[1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak|1972 smallpox outbreak]] in SAP Kosovo and other parts of SR  was the last major outbreak of [[smallpox]] in [[Europe]] since World War II.

In 1989, [[Slobodan Milošević]] rose to power in . Milošević promised a reduction of powers for the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina, where his allies subsequently took over power, during the [[Anti-bureaucratic revolution]]. This ignited tensions between the communist leadership of the other republics of Yugoslavia and awoke ethnic nationalism across Yugoslavia that eventually resulted in its [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|breakup]], with [[]], [[]], [[Republic of |]], and [[|Macedonia]] declaring independence during 1991 and 1992.{{better source needed|date=March 2017}}  and  remained together as the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FRY). However, according to the [[Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia|Badinter Commission]], the country was not legally considered a continuation of the former SFRY, but a new state.

Fuelled by ethnic tensions, the [[Yugoslav Wars]] (1991–2001) erupted, with the most severe conflicts taking place in [[War in |]] and [[ War|Bosnia]], where the large ethnic Serb communities opposed independence from Yugoslavia.

After the Yugoslav Wars,  became home to highest number of [[refugee]]s and [[internally displaced person]]s in Europe.

After [[2000 Yugoslavian general election|presidential elections]] in September 2000, opposition parties accused Milošević of [[electoral fraud]]. A campaign of [[civil resistance]] followed, led by the [[Democratic Opposition of ]] (DOS), a broad coalition of anti-Milošević parties. This culminated on 5 October when half a million people from all over the country congregated in Belgrade, compelling Milošević to concede defeat. The [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milošević|fall of Milošević]] ended Yugoslavia's [[international isolation]]. Milošević was sent to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]. The DOS announced that FR Yugoslavia would seek to join the [[European Union]]. In 2003, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was renamed [[ and ]];{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=529–581}} the EU opened negotiations with the country for the [[Stabilization and Association Agreement|Stabilisation and Association Agreement]].
