Human habitation in  dates back to 50,000 years ago. Settlements and tools dating back to the [[Stone Age]] have been unearthed in the peninsula. [[Mesopotamia]]n artifacts originating from the [[Ubaid period]] (c. 6500–3800 BC) have been discovered in abandoned coastal settlements. [[Al Da'asa]], a settlement located on the western coast of , is the most important Ubaid site in the country and is believed to have accommodated a small seasonal encampment.  Some historians have theorised that the Sumerians may have originated from this region.

[[Kassites|Kassite]] [[Babylonia]]n material dating back to the second millennium BC found in [[Al Khor Island]]s attests to trade relations between the inhabitants of  and the Kassites in modern-day . Among the findings were crushed snail shells and Kassite potsherds. It has been suggested that  is the earliest known site of shellfish dye production, owing to a Kassite [[Tyrian purple|purple dye]] industry which existed on the coast.

In 224 AD, the [[Sasanian Empire]] gained control over the territories surrounding the Persian Gulf.  played a role in the commercial activity of the Sasanids, contributing at least two commodities: precious pearls and purple dye. Under the Sasanid reign, many of the inhabitants in eastern Arabia were introduced to [[Christianity]] following the eastward dispersal of the religion by Mesopotamian Christians. Monasteries were constructed and further settlements were founded during this era. During the latter part of the Christian era,  comprised a region known as 'Beth Qatraye' ([[Syriac language|Syriac]] for "house of the Qataris"). The region was not limited to ; it also included [[]], [[Tarout Island]], Al-Khatt, and [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Hasa]].

In 628, the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] sent a Muslim envoy to a ruler in eastern Arabia named [[Munzir ibn Sawa Al-Tamimi]] and requested that he and his subjects accept Islam. Munzir obliged his request, and accordingly most of the Arab tribes in the region converted to Islam.{{better source needed|date=June 2017}} In the middle of the century, the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] resulted in the fall of the Sasanian Empire.

 was described as a famous horse and camel breeding centre during the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] period. In the 8th century, it started benefiting from its commercially strategic position in the Persian Gulf and went on to become a centre of pearl trading.
Substantial development in the pearling industry around the  Peninsula occurred during the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] era. Ships voyaging from [[Basra]] to [[]] and [[]] would make stops in 's ports during this period. [[ ceramics| porcelain]], West African coins, and artefacts from  have been discovered in . Archaeological remains from the 9th century suggest that 's inhabitants used greater wealth to construct higher quality homes and public buildings. Over 100 stone-built houses, two mosques, and an Abbasid fort were constructed in [[Murwab]] during this period. When the caliphate's prosperity declined in , so too did it in .
 is mentioned in 13th-century Muslim scholar [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]]'s book, ''[[Mu'jam Al-Buldan]]'', which alludes to the Qataris' fine striped woven cloaks and their skills in improvement and finishing of spears.

Much of eastern Arabia was controlled by the [[Usfurids]] in 1253, but control of the region was seized by the prince of [[Ormus]] in 1320. 's pearls provided the kingdom with one of its main sources of income. In 1515, [[Manuel I of ]] vassalised the Kingdom of Ormus. [[Kingdom of |]] went on to seize a significant portion of eastern Arabia in 1521. In 1550, the inhabitants of [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Hasa]] voluntarily submitted to the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], preferring them to the .

===  era (1507–1650) ===
After the fall of the [[Jabrids|Jabrid]] Dynasty with the conquest of  by the , the Arabian coast up to [[Uqair|Al Hassa]] came under the rule and influence of the  empire. Attempts by the Ottomans to dominate the region were eliminated with the reconquest of the castle of [[Tarout Castle|Tarout]] or [[Siege of Qatif (1551)|Al Qatif]] in 1551.

Archaeological finds are still being excavated from one of the  fortresses that served as a base to dominate the region as [[Ruwayda]]. The first representation of  appears on the  map by Luis Lázaro in 1563, showing the "city of " as a fortress, possibly referring to the fort of Ruwayda. Having retained a negligible military presence in the area, the Ottomans were expelled by the [[Bani Khalid (tribe)|Bani Khalid]] tribe and [[Bani Khalid Emirate|their emirate]] in 1670.

In 1766, members of the [[House of Khalifa|Al Khalifa]] family of the [[Utub]] tribal confederation migrated from [[]] to [[Zubarah]] in . By the time of their arrival, the Bani Khalid exercised weak authority over the peninsula, notwithstanding the fact that the largest village was ruled by their distant kin. In 1783, -based [[Bani Utbah]] clans and allied Arab tribes [[Bani Utbah invasion of |invaded]] and annexed [[]] from the Persians. The Al Khalifa imposed their authority over  and retained their jurisdiction over Zubarah.

Following his swearing-in as crown prince of the [[First  state|Emirate of Diriyah]] in 1788, [[Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (1748–1814)|Saud ibn Abd al-Aziz]] moved to expand [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] territory eastward towards the Persian Gulf and . After defeating the Bani Khalid in 1795, the Wahhabi were attacked on two fronts. The Ottomans and [[Ottoman |Egyptians]] assaulted the western front, while the Al Khalifa in  and the [[ Empire|Omanis]] launched an attack against the eastern front. Upon being made aware of the  advance on the western frontier in 1811, the Wahhabi amir reduced his garrisons in  and Zubarah in order to redeploy his troops. [[Said bin Sultan]], Sultan of [[Muscat and ]], capitalised on this opportunity and raided the Wahhabi garrisons on the eastern coast, setting fire to the fort in Zubarah. The Al Khalifa was effectively returned to power thereafter.

As punishment for piracy, an [[East  Company]] vessel bombarded [[Doha]] in 1821, destroying the town and forcing hundreds of residents to flee. In 1825, the [[House of Thani]] was established with Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Thani]] as the first leader.

Although  was considered a [[dependent territory|dependency]] of , the Al Khalifa faced opposition from the local tribes. In 1867, the Al Khalifa, along with the ruler of [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi]], sent a massive naval force to [[Al Wakrah]] in an effort to crush the  rebels. This resulted in the maritime [[– War]] of 1867–68, in which  and Abu Dhabi forces sacked and looted Doha and Al Wakrah. The  hostilities were in violation of the [[Perpetual Truce of Peace and Friendship]] of 1861. The joint incursion, in addition to the  counter-attack, prompted British Political Resident, Colonel [[Lewis Pelly]] to impose a settlement in 1868. His mission to  and  and the resulting peace treaty were milestones because they implicitly recognised the distinctness of  from  and explicitly acknowledged the position of Mohammed bin Thani. In addition to censuring  for its breach of agreement, Pelly negotiated with  sheikhs who were represented by Mohammed bin Thani. The negotiations were the first stage in the development of  as a sheikhdom.

===Ottoman period (1871–1915)===

Under military and political pressure from the governor of the Ottoman [[Vilayet of Baghdad]], [[Midhat Pasha]], the ruling Al Thani tribe submitted to Ottoman rule in 1871. The Ottoman government imposed reformist ([[Tanzimat]]) measures concerning taxation and land registration to fully integrate these areas into the empire. Despite the disapproval of local tribes, Al Thani continued supporting the Ottoman rule. -Ottoman relations stagnated, and in 1882 they suffered further setbacks when the Ottomans refused to aid Al Thani in his expedition of Abu Dhabi-occupied [[Khor Al Adaid]] and offered only limited support in the [[–Abu Dhabi War]], mainly due to fear of British intervention on Abu Dhabi's side. In addition, the Ottomans supported the Ottoman subject Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab who attempted to supplant Al Thani as [[kaymakam]] of  in 1888. This eventually led Al Thani to rebel against the Ottomans, whom he believed were seeking to usurp control of the peninsula. He resigned as kaymakam and stopped paying taxes in August 1892.

In February 1893, Mehmed Hafiz Pasha arrived in  in the interests of seeking unpaid taxes and accosting Jassim bin Mohammed's opposition to proposed Ottoman administrative reforms. Fearing that he would face death or imprisonment, Jassim retreated to Al Wajbah ({{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on|order=flip|disp=or}} west of Doha), accompanied by several tribe members. Mehmed's demand that Jassim disband his troops and pledge his loyalty to the Ottomans was met with refusal. In March, Mehmed imprisoned Jassim's brother and 13 prominent  tribal leaders on the Ottoman [[corvette]] ''Merrikh'' as punishment for his insubordination. After Mehmed declined an offer to release the captives for a fee of 10,000 [[ lira|liras]], he ordered a column of approximately 200 troops to advance towards Jassim's [[Al Wajbah Fort]] under the command of Yusuf Effendi, thus signalling the start of the [[Battle of Al Wajbah]].

Effendi's troops came under heavy gunfire by a sizable troop of  infantry and cavalry shortly after arriving at Al Wajbah. They retreated to Shebaka fortress where they were again forced to draw back from a  incursion. After they withdrew to Al Bidda fortress, Jassim's advancing column besieged the fortress, resulting in the Ottomans' concession of defeat and agreement to relinquish their captives in return for the safe passage of Mehmed Pasha's cavalry to [[Hofuf]] by land. Although  did not gain full independence from the Ottoman Empire, the result of the battle forced a treaty that would later form the basis of 's emerging as an autonomous country within the empire.

===British period (1916–1971)===
[[File:Zubarah Fort1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zubarah Fort]] built in 1938]]
By the [[Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913]], the Ottomans agreed to renounce their claim to  and withdraw their garrison from Doha. With the outbreak of [[World War I]] however, nothing was done to carry this out, and the garrison remained in the fort at Doha, although its numbers dwindled as men deserted. In 1915, with the presence of British gunboats in the harbour, Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani (who was pro-British) persuaded the remainder to abandon the fort, and when British troops approached the following morning, they found it deserted.

 became a British protectorate on 3 November 1916 when the  signed a treaty with Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani to bring  under its [[Trucial States|Trucial System of Administration]]. The treaty reserved foreign affairs and defence to the  but allowed internal autonomy. While Abdullah agreed not to enter into any relations with any other power without the prior consent of the British government, the latter guaranteed the protection of  from aggression by sea and provide its 'good offices' in the event of an attack by land. This latter undertaking was left deliberately vague.

On 5 May 1935, while agreeing an oil concession with the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]], Abdullah signed another treaty with the British government which granted  protection against internal and external threats. Oil reserves were first discovered in 1939. Exploitation and development were, however, delayed by [[World War II]].

The focus of British interests in  changed after the Second World War with the independence of , the creation of [[]] in 1947, and the development of oil in . In 1949, the appointment of the first British political officer in Doha, John Wilton, signified a strengthening of Anglo- relations. Oil exports began in 1949, and oil revenues became the country's main source of revenue; the pearl trade had gone into decline. These revenues were used to fund the expansion and modernisation of 's infrastructure.

When Britain officially announced in 1968 that it would withdraw from the Persian Gulf in three years' time,  joined talks with  and seven other Trucial States to create the [[Federation of Arab Emirates]]. Regional disputes, however, persuaded  and  to withdraw from the talks and become independent states separate from the Trucial States, which went on to become the [[]].

According to the UN, the nation's economic growth, measured by GDP, was the fastest in the world during this decade. The basis of this growth lay in the exploitation of [[natural gas]] in the North Field during the 1990s. At the same time, the population tripled between 2001 and 2011, mostly from an influx of foreigners.
