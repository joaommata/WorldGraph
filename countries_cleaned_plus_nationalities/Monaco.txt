In 1191, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] granted  to the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] in return for cracking down on pirates. By the early 1200s, the Genoese had built a castle on the rock and were utilizing the port. An ousted branch of a Genoese family, the [[House of Grimaldi|Grimaldis]], captured it in 1297 by posing as monks, but then had to contest it for a century before gaining official control.

Francesco was evicted a few years later by the Genoese forces, and the struggle over "the Rock" continued for another century. The Grimaldi family was Genoese and the struggle was something of a family feud. The Genoese engaged in other conflicts, and in the late 1300s Genoa lost  after fighting the [[Crown of Aragon]] over [[Corsica]].
