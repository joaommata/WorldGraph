[[File:Jemen1988-022 hg.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the [[Marib Dam|Great Dam of Marib]]]]

With its long sea border between eastern and western civilizations,  has long existed at a crossroads of cultures with a strategic location in terms of trade on the west of the Arabian Peninsula. Large settlements for their era existed in the mountains of northern  as early as 5000 BC. The [[Sabaeans|Sabaean Kingdom]] existed in [[ (region)|]] from {{Circa|1000 BCE}} to {{Circa|275 CE}}. {{Sfn|Arbach|Rossi|2022|pp=40–41}} Its inhabitants were the Sabaeans,{{Efn|{{langx|xsa|{{script|Sarb|𐩪𐩨𐩱}}|{{sc|s¹bʾ}}}}; {{langx|ar|ٱلسَّبَئِيُّوْن|as-Sabaʾiyyūn}}; {{langx|he|סְבָאִים|Səḇāʾīm}}}} The four major kingdoms or tribal confederations in [[South Arabia]] were Saba, [[Hadhramaut]], [[Qataban]], and [[Minaeans|Ma'in]].

''[[Sabaeans|Sabaʾ]]'' ({{langx|ar|سَـبَـأ}}) is thought to be biblical Sheba and was the most prominent federation. The Sabaean rulers adopted the title [[Mukarrib]] generally thought to mean ''unifier'', or a ''priest-king'', or the head of the confederation of South Arabian kingdoms, the "king of the kings". The role of the Mukarrib was to bring the various tribes under the kingdom and preside over them all. The Sabaeans built the [[Marib Dam|Great Dam of Marib]] around 940 BC. The dam was built to withstand the seasonal flash floods surging down the valley.

By the third century BC, Qataban, Hadhramaut, and Ma'in became independent from Saba and established themselves in the  arena. Minaean rule stretched as far as [[Dedanites|Dedan]], with their capital at [[Baraqish]]. The Sabaeans regained their control over Ma'in after the collapse of Qataban in 50 BC. By the time of the Roman expedition to Arabia Felix in 25 BC, the Sabaeans were once again the dominating power in Southern Arabia. [[Aelius Gallus]] was ordered to lead a military campaign to establish Roman dominance over the Sabaeans.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had a vague and contradictory geographical knowledge about Arabia Felix. A Roman army of 10,000 men was defeated before reaching [[Marib]]. [[Strabo]]'s close relationship with Aelius Gallus led him to attempt to justify his friend's defeat in his writings. It took the Romans six months to reach Marib and 60 days to return to [[]]. The Romans blamed their [[Nabataeans|Nabataean]] guide and executed him for treachery. No direct mention in Sabaean inscriptions of the Roman expedition has yet been found.

After the Roman expedition (perhaps earlier) the country fell into chaos, and two clans, namely [[Banu Hamdan|Hamdan]] and [[Himyar]], claimed kingship, assuming the title King of Sheba and [[Himyar|Dhu Raydan]]. Dhu Raydan, ''i.e.'', Himyarites, allied themselves with [[Aksum]] in  against the Sabaeans. The chief of [[Bakil]] and king of Saba and Dhu Raydan, [[Ilasaros|El Sharih Yahdhib]], launched successful campaigns against the Himyarites and Habashat, ''i.e.'', [[Aksum]]. El Sharih took pride in his campaigns and added the title Yahdhib to his name, which means "suppressor"; he used to kill his enemies by cutting them to pieces. Sana'a came into prominence during his reign, as he built the [[Ghumdan Palace]] as his place of residence.

The Himyarites annexed Sana'a from Hamdan around 100 AD. [[Hashid|Hashdi]] tribesmen rebelled against them and regained Sana'a around 180. [[Shammar Yahri'sh]] had conquered Hadhramaut, [[Najran]], and [[Tihamah]] by 275, thus unifying  and consolidating Himyarite rule. The Himyarites rejected [[polytheism]] and adhered to a consensual form of [[monotheism]] called [[Rahmanism]].

[[File: Museum  04.jpg|thumb|Bronze hand with an inscribed prayer in [[Himyaritic]] to god [[Ta'lab]]]]
In 354, Roman Emperor [[Constantius II]] sent an embassy headed by [[Theophilos the ]] to convert the Himyarites to Christianity. According to [[Philostorgius]], the mission was resisted by local Jews. Several inscriptions have been found in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Sabaean language|Sabaean]] praising the ruling house in Jewish terms for "...helping and empowering the People of ."

According to Islamic traditions, King [[Tub'a Abu Kariba As'ad|As'ad the Perfect]] mounted a military expedition to support the Jews of [[Yathrib]]. Abu Kariba As'ad, as known from the inscriptions, led a military campaign to central Arabia or [[Najd]] to support the vassal [[Kingdom of Kinda]] against the [[Lakhmids]]. However, no direct reference to Judaism or Yathrib was discovered from his lengthy reign. Abu Kariba died in 445, having reigned for almost 50 years. By 515, Himyar became increasingly divided along religious lines and a bitter conflict between different factions paved the way for an [[Aksum]]ite intervention. The last Himyarite king Ma'adikarib Ya'fur was supported by Aksum against his Jewish rivals. Ma'adikarib was Christian and launched a campaign against the Lakhmids in southern [[]], with the support of other Arab allies of [[Byzantium]]. The Lakhmids were a bulwark of [[Persia]], which was intolerant to a proselytizing religion like Christianity.

After the death of Ma'adikarib Ya'fur around 521, a Himyarite Jewish warlord called [[Dhu Nuwas]] rose to power. Emperor [[Justinian I]] sent an embassy to . He wanted the officially Christian Himyarites to use their influence on the tribes in inner Arabia to launch military operations against Persia. Justinian I bestowed the "dignity of king" upon the Arab [[sheikh]]s of Kindah and [[Ghassanids|Ghassan]] in central and northern Arabia. From early on, Roman and Byzantine policy was to develop close links with the powers of the coast of the [[Red Sea]]. They were successful in converting{{clarify|date=August 2015|reason=https://www.britannica.com/place/Byzantine-Empire}} Aksum and influencing their culture. The results concerning to  were rather disappointing.

A Kendite prince called Yazid bin Kabshat rebelled against Abraha and his Arab Christian allies. A truce was reached once the Great Dam of Marib had suffered a breach. Abraha died around 570. The [[Sasanid Empire]] annexed Aden around 570. Under their rule, most of  enjoyed great autonomy except for Aden and Sana'a. This era marked the collapse of ancient South Arabian civilization, since the greater part of the country was under several independent clans until the arrival of Islam in 630.

[[Muhammad]] sent his cousin [[Ali]] to Sana'a and its surroundings around 630. At the time,  was the most advanced region in Arabia. The [[Banu Hamdan]] confederation was among the first to accept Islam. Muhammad sent [[Muadh ibn Jabal]], as well to Al-Janad, in present-day [[Taiz]], and dispatched letters to various tribal leaders. Major tribes, including Himyar, sent delegations to [[Medina]] during the "year of delegations" around 630–631. Several  accepted Islam before 630, such as [[Ammar ibn Yasir]], [[Al-Ala'a Al-Hadrami]], [[Miqdad ibn Aswad]], [[Abu Musa Ashaari]], and [[Sharhabeel ibn Hasana]]. A man named [[Aswad Ansi|'Abhala ibn Ka'ab Al-Ansi]] expelled the remaining Persians and claimed he was a prophet of [[Rahman (Islamic term)|Rahman]]. He was assassinated by a  of Persian origin called [[Fayruz al-Daylami]]. Christians, who were mainly staying in [[Najran]] along with Jews, agreed to pay ''[[jizya]]h'' ({{langx|ar|جِـزْيَـة}}), although some Jews converted to Islam, such as [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]] and [[Ka'ab al-Ahbar]].

 was stable during the [[Rashidun Caliphate]].  tribes played a pivotal role in the Islamic expansion into , , Persia, the [[Levant]], [[]], [[North Africa]], [[History of Islam in Southern |Sicily]], and [[Andalusia]].  tribes who settled in [[]] contributed significantly to the solidification of [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] rule, especially during the reign of [[Marwan I]]. Powerful Yemenite tribes such as Kinda were on his side during the [[Battle of Marj Rahit (684)|Battle of Marj Rahit]].

Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Ziyad founded the Ziyadid dynasty in [[Tihamah]] around 818. The state stretched from [[Al Qunfudhah|Haly]] (in present-day ) to Aden. They nominally recognized the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] but ruled independently from [[Zabid]]. By virtue of its location, they developed a special relationship with [[|Abyssinia]]. The chief of the [[Dahlak Archipelago|Dahlak islands]] exported slaves, as well as amber and leopard hides, to the ruler of . They controlled only a small portion of the coastal strip in Tihamah along the Red Sea, and never exercised control over the highlands and Hadhramaut. A Himyarite clan called the [[Yufirids]] established their rule over the highlands from [[Saada]] to [[Taiz]], while Hadhramaut was an Ibadi stronghold and rejected all allegiance to the Abbasids in [[Baghdad]].

The first [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] imam, [[Al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya|Yahya ibn al-Husayn]], arrived in  in 893. He was a religious cleric and judge who was invited to come to Saada from Medina to arbitrate tribal disputes. Yahya persuaded local tribesmen to follow his teachings. The sect slowly spread across the highlands, as the tribes of [[Hashid]] and [[Bakil]], later known as "the twin wings of the imamate", accepted his authority. He founded the [[Rassids|Zaidi imamate]] in 897. Yahya established his influence in Saada and Najran. He also tried to capture Sana'a from the Yufirids in 901 but failed miserably.

==== Sulayhid dynasty (1047–1138) ====

}}

The [[Sulayhid dynasty]] was founded in the northern highlands around 1040; at the time,  was ruled by different local dynasties. In 1060, [[Ali al-Sulayhi|Ali ibn Muhammad Al-Sulayhi]] conquered Zabid and killed its ruler Al-Najah, founder of the Najahid dynasty. His sons were forced to flee to Dahlak. Hadhramaut fell into Sulayhid hands after their capture of Aden in 1162.

By 1063, Ali had subjugated [[Greater ]]. He then marched toward [[Hejaz]] and occupied [[Makkah]]. Ali was married to [[Asma bint Shihab]], who governed  with her husband. The [[Khutba]] during [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayers]] was proclaimed in both her husband's name and hers. No other Arab woman had this honor since the advent of Islam.

Ali al-Sulayhi was killed by Najah's sons on his way to Mecca in 1084. His son Ahmed Al-Mukarram led an army to Zabid and killed 8,000 of its inhabitants. He later installed the Zurayids to govern Aden. al-Mukarram, who had been afflicted with facial paralysis resulting from war injuries, retired in 1087 and handed over power to his wife [[Arwa al-Sulayhi]]. Queen Arwa moved the seat of the Sulayhid dynasty from Sana'a to [[Jibla, |Jibla]], a small town in central  near [[Ibb]]. She sent Ismaili missionaries to , where a significant Ismaili community was formed that exists to this day.

Queen Arwa continued to rule securely until her death in 1138. She is still remembered as a great and much-loved sovereign, as attested in  historiography, literature, and popular lore, where she is referred to as ''Balqis al-sughra'' ("the junior queen of Sheba"). Shortly after Arwa's death, the country was split between five competing petty dynasties along religious lines. The [[Ayyubid dynasty]] overthrew the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in . A few years after their rise to power, [[Saladin]] dispatched his brother [[Turan Shah]] to conquer  in 1174.

==== Ayyubid conquest (1171–1260) ====
{{Main|Ayyubid dynasty}}
[[Turan Shah]] conquered Zabid from the [[Mahdids]] in 1174, then marched toward Aden in June and captured it from the Zurayids. The [[Hamdanid sultans]] of Sana'a resisted the Ayyubid in 1175, and the Ayyubids did not manage to secure Sana'a until 1189. The Ayyubid rule was stable in southern and central , where they succeeded in eliminating the ministates of that region, while Ismaili and Zaidi tribesmen continued to hold out in several fortresses.

The Ayyubids failed to capture the [[Zaydism|Zaydis]] stronghold in northern . In 1191, Zaydis of [[Shibam Kawkaban District|Shibam Kawkaban]] rebelled and killed 700 Ayyubid soldiers. Imam [[Al-Mansur Abdallah|Abdullah bin Hamza]] proclaimed the imamate in 1197 and fought al-Mu'izz Ismail, the Ayyubid Sultan of . Imam Abdullah was defeated at first but was able to conquer Sana'a and [[Dhamar, |Dhamar]] in 1198, and al-Mu'izz Ismail was assassinated in 1202.

[[Al-Mansur Abdallah|Abdullah bin Hamza]] carried on the struggle against the Ayyubid until his death in 1217. After his demise, the Zaidi community was split between two rival imams. The Zaydis were dispersed, and a truce was signed with the Ayyubid in 1219. The Ayyubid army was defeated in [[Dhamar, |Dhamar]] in 1226. Ayyubid Sultan Mas'ud Yusuf left for Mecca in 1228, never to return. Other sources suggest that he was forced to leave for  instead in 1223.

==== Rasulid dynasty (1229–1454) ====
[[File:Cairo Castle GardenTaiz,.jpg|thumb|[[Al-Qahira Castle]]'s Garden in Taiz, the capital of  during the [[Rasulid dynasty|Rasulid's era]]]]

The [[Rasulid dynasty]] was established in 1229 by [[Al-Mansur Umar|Umar ibn Ali]], who was appointed deputy governor by the Ayyubids in 1223. When the last Ayyubid ruler left  in 1229, Umar stayed in the country as caretaker. He subsequently declared himself an independent king by assuming the title "al-Malik Al-Mansur" (the king assisted by [[Allah]]).

Umar first established himself at Zabid, then moved into the mountainous interior, taking the important highland centre Sana'a. However, the Rasulid capitals were Zabid and Taiz. He was assassinated by his nephew in 1249. Omar's son [[Al-Muzaffar Yusuf I|Yusuf]] defeated the faction led by his father's assassins and crushed several counterattacks by the Zaydi imams who still held on in the northern highland. Mainly because of the victories he scored over his rivals, he assumed the honorific title "al-Muzaffar" (the victorious).

After the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Baghdad]] to the [[Mongols]] in 1258, al-Muzaffar Yusuf I appropriated the title of [[caliph]]. He chose the city of Taiz to become the political capital of the kingdom because of its strategic location and proximity to Aden. The Rasulid sultans built numerous [[Madrasa]]s to solidify the [[Shafi'i]] school of thought, which is still the dominant school of [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]] amongst  today. Under their rule, Taiz and Zabid became major international centres of Islamic learning. The kings were educated men in their own right, who not only had important libraries but also wrote treatises on a wide array of subjects, ranging from astrology and medicine to agriculture and genealogy.[[File:Slaves Zadib  13th century BNF Paris.jpg|thumb|A 13th-century book illustration produced in [[Baghdad]] by [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|al-Wasiti]] showing a slave-market in the town of [[Zabid]] in ]]They had a difficult relationship with the [[Mamluks of ]] because the latter considered them a vassal state. Their competition centred over the Hejaz and the right to provide ''[[kiswa]]'' of the [[Ka'aba]] in Mecca. The dynasty became increasingly threatened by disgruntled family members over the problem of succession, combined with periodic tribal revolts, as they were locked in a war of attrition with the Zaydi imams in the northern highlands. During the last 12 years of Rasulid rule, the country was torn between several contenders for the kingdom. The weakening of the Rasulid provided an opportunity for the [[Tahirids ()|Banu Taher]] clan to take over and establish themselves as the new rulers of  in 1454 AD.

==== Tahirid dynasty (1454–1517) ====
{{Main articles|Ottoman– confrontations|Ottoman– conflicts (1538–1560)}}

The [[Tahirids ()|Tahirids]] were a local clan based in [[Rada' District|Rada'a]]. They built schools, mosques, and irrigation channels, as well as water cisterns and bridges in Zabid, Aden, [[Rada'a]], and Juban. Their best-known monument is the [[Amiriya Madrasa]] in [[Rada' District]], which was built in 1504. The Tahirids were too weak either to contain the Zaydi imams or to defend themselves against foreign attacks.

Realizing how rich the Tahirid realm was, the Mamluks decided to conquer it. The Mamluk army, with the support of forces loyal to Zaydi Imam [[Al-Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din]], conquered the entire Tahirid realm but failed to capture Aden in 1517. The Mamluk victory was short-lived. The [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered , hanging the last Mamluk Sultan in [[Cairo]]. The Ottomans had not decided to conquer  until 1538. The Zaydi highland tribes emerged as national heroes by offering stiff, vigorous resistance to the  occupation. The Mamluks tried to attach  to  and the  led by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], occupied the island of [[Socotra]] and made an unsuccessful attack on Aden in 1513.

Starting in the 15th century, [[]] intervened, dominating the port of Aden for about 20 years and maintaining a fortified enclave on the island of Socotra during this period. From the 16th century, the  posed an immediate threat to  Ocean trade. The Mamluks therefore sent an army under Hussein al-Kurdi to fight the intruders  The Mamluk sultan went to Zabid in 1515 and entered into diplomatic talks with the Tahiri sultan 'Amir bin Abdulwahab for money that would be needed for the jihad against the . Instead of confronting them, the Mamluks, who were running out of food and water, landed on the coast of  and began harassing the villagers of Tihamah to obtain the supplies they needed.

The interest of  on the Red Sea consisted on the one hand of guaranteeing contacts with a Christian ally in  and on the other of being able to attack Mecca and the Arab territories from the rear, while still having absolute dominance over trade of spices, the main intention was to dominate the commerce of the cities on the coast of Africa and Arabia. To this end,  sought to influence and dominate by force or persuasion all the ports and kingdoms that fought among themselves. It was common for  to keep under its influence the Arab allies that were interested in maintaining independence from other Arab states in the region.

[[File:Jemen1988-153 hg.jpg|thumb|[[al-Bakiriyya Mosque|Al Bakiriyya Ottoman Mosque]] in [[Sana'a]] was built in 1597.]]

The Ottomans had two fundamental interests to safeguard in —the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and the trade route with  for spices and textiles, both threatened, and the latter virtually eclipsed, by the arrival of the  in the  Ocean and the Red Sea in the early 16th century. [[Hadım Suleiman Pasha]], the Ottoman governor of [[Eyalet of |]], was ordered to command a fleet of 90 ships to conquer . The country was in a state of incessant anarchy and discord as Pasha described it by saying:

{{Blockquote| is a land with no lord, an empty province. It would be not only possible but easy to capture, and should it be captured, it would be master of the lands of [[ subcontinent|]] and send every year a great amount of gold and jewels to [[Constantinople]].}}

Imam [[al-Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din]] ruled over the northern highlands including Sana'a, while Aden was held by the last Tahiride Sultan 'Amir ibn Dauod. Pasha stormed Aden in 1538, killing its ruler, and extended Ottoman authority to include Zabid in 1539 and eventually Tihamah in its entirety. Zabid became the administrative headquarters of  Eyalet. The Ottoman governors did not exercise much control over the highlands. They held sway mainly in the southern coastal region, particularly around Zabid, Mocha, and Aden. Of 80,000 soldiers sent to  from  between 1539 and 1547, only 7,000 survived. The Ottoman accountant-general in  remarked:

{{Blockquote|We have seen no foundry like  for our soldiers. Each time we have sent an expeditionary force there, it has melted away like salt dissolved in water.}}

[[File:Group of men in .tif|thumb|left|Ottoman soldiers and  locals]]

The Ottomans sent yet another expeditionary force to Zabid in 1547, while Imam al-Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din was ruling the highlands independently. Yahya chose his son Ali to succeed him, a decision that infuriated his other son [[al-Mutahhar]] ibn Yahya. Al-Mutahhar was lame, so he was not qualified for the imamate. He urged Oais Pasha, the Ottoman colonial governor in [[Zabid]], to attack his father. Indeed, Ottoman troops supported by tribal forces loyal to Imam al-Mutahhar stormed Taiz and marched north toward Sana'a in August 1547. The Turks officially made Imam al-Mutahhar a ''[[Sanjak-bey]]'' with authority over [['Amran]]. Imam al-Mutahhar assassinated the Ottoman colonial governor and recaptured Sana'a, but the Ottomans, led by [[Özdemir Pasha]], forced al-Mutahhar to retreat to his fortress in [[Thula]]. Özdemir Pasha effectively put  under Ottoman rule between 1552 and 1560. Özdemir died in Sana'a in 1561 and was succeeded by [[Mahmud Pasha (governor)|Mahmud Pasha]].

Mahmud Pasha was described by other Ottoman officials as a corrupt and unscrupulous governor, and he was displaced by Ridvan Pasha in 1564. By 1565,  was split into two provinces, the highlands under the command of Ridvan Pasha and Tihamah under Murad Pasha. Imam al-Mutahhar launched a propaganda campaign in which he claimed that the prophet Mohammed came to him in a dream and advised him to wage ''jihad'' against the Ottomans. Al-Mutahhar led the tribes to capture Sana'a from Ridvan Pasha in 1567. When Murad tried to relieve Sana'a, highland tribesmen ambushed his unit and slaughtered all of them. Over 80 battles were fought. The last decisive encounter took place in Dhamar around 1568, in which Murad Pasha was beheaded and his head sent to al-Mutahhar in Sana'a. By 1568, only Zabid remained under the possession of the Turks.

In 1632, Al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad sent an expeditionary force of 1,000 men to conquer Mecca. The army entered the city in triumph and killed its governor. The Ottomans sent an army from  to fight the Yemenites. Seeing that the  army was too numerous to overcome, the  army retreated to a valley outside Mecca. Ottoman troops attacked the  by hiding at the wells that supplied them with water. This plan proceeded successfully, causing the  over 200 casualties, most from thirst. The tribesmen eventually surrendered and returned to . Al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad died in 1644. He was succeeded by [[Al-Mutawakkil Isma'il]], another son of al-Mansur al-Qasim, who conquered  in its entirety.

 became the sole [[coffee bean|coffee]] producer in the world. The country established diplomatic relations with the [[Safavid dynasty]] of Persia, Ottomans of Hejaz, [[Mughal Empire]] in , and , as well. In the first half of the 18th century, the Europeans broke 's monopoly on coffee by smuggling coffee trees and cultivating them in their own colonies in the East Indies, East Africa, the West Indies, and Latin America. The imamate did not follow a cohesive mechanism for succession, and family quarrels and tribal insubordination led to the political decline of the Qasimi dynasty in the 18th century.

The  were looking for a coal depot to service their steamers en route to . It took 700 tons of coal for a round-trip from [[Suez]] to [[Bombay]]. [[East  Company]] officials decided on [[Aden]]. The [[ Empire]] tried to reach an agreement with the Zaydi imam of Sana'a, permitting them a foothold in Mocha, and when unable to secure their position, they extracted a similar agreement from the [[Sultanate of Lahej|Sultan of Lahej]], enabling them to consolidate a position in Aden. The  managed to occupy Aden and evicted the Sultan of Lahej from Aden and forced him to accept their "protection". In November 1839, 5,000 tribesmen tried to retake the town but were repulsed and 200 were killed.

With emigrants from , East Africa, and Southeast Asia, Aden grew into a world city. In 1850, only 980 Arabs were registered as original inhabitants of the city. The  presence in Aden put them at odds with the Ottomans. The Turks asserted to the  that they held sovereignty over the whole of Arabia, including  as the successor of Mohammed and the Chief of the Universal Caliphate.

==== Ottoman return ====
[[File:Mukhtar Pasha.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Grand Vizier]] and [[Wāli]] of  [[Ahmed Muhtar Pasha]]]]

The Ottomans were concerned about the  expansion from the [[ Raj|-ruled subcontinent]] to the Red Sea and Arabia. They returned to the Tihamah in 1849 after an absence of two centuries. Rivalries and disturbances continued among the Zaydi imams, between them and their deputies, with the [[ulema]], with the heads of tribes, as well as with those who belonged to other sects. Some citizens of Sana'a were desperate to return law and order to  and asked the Ottoman Pasha in Tihamah to pacify the country. The opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 strengthened the Ottoman decision to remain in . By 1873, the Ottomans succeeded in conquering the northern highlands. Sana'a became the administrative capital of [[ Vilayet]].

The Ottomans learned from their previous experience and worked on the disempowerment of local lords in the highland regions. They even attempted to secularize the  society, while [[Yemenite Jews]] came to perceive themselves in  nationalist terms. The Ottomans appeased the tribes by forgiving their rebellious chiefs and appointing them to administrative posts. They introduced a series of reforms to enhance the country's economic welfare. However, corruption was widespread in the Ottoman administration in . This was because only the worst of the officials were appointed because those who could avoid serving in  did so. The Ottomans had reasserted control over the highlands for a temporary duration. The so-called ''[[Tanzimat]]'' reforms were considered heretic by the Zaydi tribes. In 1876, the Hashid and Bakil tribes rebelled against the Ottomans; the Turks had to appease them with gifts to end the uprising.

The tribal chiefs were difficult to appease and an endless cycle of violence curbed Ottoman efforts to pacify the land. [[Ahmed Izzet Pasha]] proposed that the Ottoman army evacuate the highlands and confine itself to Tihamah, and not unnecessarily burden itself with continuing military operation against the Zaydi tribes. Imam [[Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din|Yahya Hamidaddin]] led a rebellion against the Turks in 1904; the rebels disrupted the Ottoman ability to govern. The revolts between 1904 and 1911 were especially damaging to the Ottomans, costing them as many as 10,000 soldiers and as much as 500,000 [[Pound sterling|pounds]] per year. The Ottomans signed a treaty with imam [[Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din|Yahya Hamidaddin]] in 1911. Under the treaty, Imam Yahya was recognized as an autonomous leader of the Zaydi northern highlands. The Ottomans continued to rule [[Shafi'i]] areas in the mid-south until their departure in 1918.

==== Mutawakkilite Kingdom ====
{{Main|Kingdom of }}
[[File:Dar al hajar.jpg|thumb|upright|Imam [[Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din|Yahya Hamid Ed-Din]]'s house near Sana'a]]

Imam Yahya hamid ed-Din al-Mutawakkil was ruling the northern highlands independently from 1911, from which he began a conquest of the  lands. In 1925 Yahya captured al-Hudaydah from the [[Idrisid dynasty|Idrisids]]. In 1927, Yahya's forces were about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} away from Aden, Taiz, and Ibb, and were bombed by the  for five days; the imam had to pull back. Small [[Bedouin]] forces, mainly from the [[Madh'hij]] confederation of [[Marib]], attacked [[Shabwah Governorate|Shabwah]] but were bombed by the  and had to retreat.

The [[ Empire]] was the first to recognize Yahya as the king of  in 1926. This created a great deal of anxiety for the , who interpreted it as recognition of Imam Yahya's claim to sovereignty over Greater , which included the Aden protectorate and Asir. The Idrisis turned to [[Ibn Saud]] seeking his protection from Yahya. However, in 1932, the Idrisis broke their accord with Ibn Saud and went back to Yahya seeking help against Ibn Saud, who had begun liquidating their authority and expressed his desire to annex those territories into his own  domain. Yahya demanded the return of all Idrisi dominion.

Negotiations between Yahya and Ibn Saud proved fruitless. After the 1934 - war, Ibn Saud announced a ceasefire in May 1934. Imam Yahya agreed to release  hostages and the surrender of the Idrisis to  custody. Imam Yahya ceded the three provinces of Najran, Asir, and [[Jizan Region|Jazan]] for 20 years. and signed another treaty with the  government in 1934. The imam recognized the  sovereignty over Aden protectorate for 40 years. Out of fear for [[Al Hudaydah|Hudaydah]], Yahya did submit to these demands.

Starting in 1890, hundreds of  people from Hajz, Al-Baetha, and Taiz migrated to Aden to work at ports, and as labourers. This helped the population of Aden once again become predominantly Arab after, having been declared a free zone, it had become mostly foreigners. During World War II, Aden had increasing economic growth and became the second-busiest port in the world after [[New York City]]. After the rise of labour unions, a rift was apparent between the sectors of workers and the first signs of resistance to the occupation started in 1943. [[Muhammad Ali Luqman]] founded the first Arabic club and school in Aden, and was the first to start working towards a union.

The [[Colony of Aden]] was divided into an eastern colony and a western colony. Those were further divided into 23 sultanates and emirates, and several independent tribes that had no relationships with the sultanates. The deal between the sultanates and Britain detailed protection and complete control of foreign relations by the . The Sultanate of Lahej was the only one in which the sultan was referred to as ''His Highness''. The [[Federation of South Arabia]] was created by the  to counter [[Arab nationalism]] by giving more freedom to the rulers of the nations.

The [[North  Civil War]] inspired many in the south to rise against the  rule. The [[National Liberation Front ()|National Liberation Front]] (NLF) of  was formed with the leadership of [[Qahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi|Qahtan Muhammad Al-Shaabi]]. The NLF hoped to destroy all the sultanates and eventually unite with the [[ Arab Republic]]. Most of the support for the NLF came from [[Radfan]] and Yafa, so the  launched Operation Nutcracker, which completely burned Radfan in January 1964.

==== Two states ====
{{Main| Arab Republic|South }}

Arab nationalism had an influence in some circles who opposed the lack of modernization efforts in the Mutawakkilite monarchy. This became apparent when Imam [[Ahmad bin Yahya]] died in 1962. He was succeeded by his son, but army officers attempted to seize power, sparking the [[North  Civil War]]. The Hamidaddin royalists were supported by , Britain, and  (mostly with weapons and financial aid, but also with small military forces), whilst the military rebels were backed by .  provided the rebels with weapons and financial assistance, but also sent a large military force to participate in the fighting.  covertly supplied weapons to the royalists to keep the  military busy in  and make Nasser less likely to initiate a conflict in the Sinai. After six years of civil war, the military rebels formed the [[ Arab Republic]].

The revolution in the north coincided with the [[Aden Emergency]], which hastened the end of  rule in the south. On 30 November 1967, the state of South  was formed, comprising Aden and the former Protectorate of South Arabia. This socialist state was later officially known as the [[People's Democratic Republic of ]] and a programme of nationalisation was begun.

Relations between the two  states fluctuated between peaceful and hostile. The South was supported by the Eastern bloc. The North, however, was not able to get the same connections. In 1972, the two states fought a war. The war was resolved with a ceasefire and negotiations brokered by the [[Arab League]], where it was declared that unification would eventually occur. In 1978, [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] was named as president of the  Arab Republic. After the war, the North complained about the South's help from foreign countries. This included .

In 1979, fresh fighting between the two states resumed and efforts were renewed to bring about unification. Thousands were killed in 1986 in the [[South  Civil War]]. President [[Ali Nasser Muhammad]] fled to the north and was later sentenced to death for treason. A new government formed.

==== Unification and civil war ====
{{Main| unification| Civil War (1994)}}
[[File:Divided .svg|thumb|right|[[ Arab Republic]] (in orange) and [[South ]] (in blue) before 1990. Land gained after unification is in grey.]]

In 1990, the two governments reached a full agreement on the joint governing of , and the countries were merged on 22 May 1990, with Saleh as president. The president of South , [[Ali Salim al-Beidh]], became vice president. A unified [[Assembly of Representatives of |parliament]] was formed and a unity constitution was agreed upon. In the [[ parliamentary election, 1993|1993 parliamentary election]], the first held after unification, the [[General People's Congress ()|General People's Congress]] won 122 of 301 seats.{{rp|309}}

After the [[Gulf War|invasion of ]] crisis in 1990, 's president opposed military intervention from non-Arab states. As a member of the [[United Nations Security Council]] for 1990 and 1991,  abstained on a number of [[United Nations Security Council|UNSC]] resolutions concerning  and  and voted against the "...use of force resolution." The vote outraged the U.S., and  expelled 800,000  in 1990 and 1991 to punish  for its opposition to the intervention.

In the absence of strong state institutions, [[Elite theory|elite politics]] in  constituted a ''de facto'' form of [[collaborative governance]], where competing tribal, regional, religious, and political interests agreed to hold themselves in check through tacit acceptance of the balance it produced. The informal political settlement was held together by a power-sharing deal among three men: President Saleh, who controlled the state; major general [[Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar]], who controlled the largest share of the [[ Armed Forces]]; and [[Abdullah ibn Husayn al-Ahmar]], figurehead of the Islamist [[Al-Islah ()|al-Islah party]] and 's chosen broker of transnational [[clientelism|patronage payments]] to various political players, including tribal [[sheikh]]s. The  payments have been intended to facilitate the tribes' autonomy from the  government and to give the  government a mechanism with which to weigh in on 's political decision-making.

Following food riots in major towns in 1992, a new coalition government made up of the ruling parties from both the former  states was formed in 1993. However, Vice President al-Beidh withdrew to Aden in August 1993 and said he would not return to the government until his grievances were addressed. These included northern violence against his [[ Socialist Party]], as well as the economic marginalization of the south. Negotiations to end the political deadlock dragged on into 1994. The government of Prime Minister [[Haydar Abu Bakr Al-Attas]] became ineffective due to political infighting.

An accord between northern and southern leaders was signed in [[Amman]], [[]] on 20 February 1994, but this could not stop the civil war. During these tensions, both the northern and southern armies (which had never integrated) gathered on their respective frontiers.

[[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] became 's first directly elected president in [[ presidential election, 1999|the 1999 presidential election]], winning 96% of the vote.{{rp|310}} The only other candidate, [[Najeeb Qahtan Al-Sha'abi]], was the son of Qahtan Muhammad al-Sha'abi, a former president of South . Though a member of Saleh's [[General People's Congress ()|General People's Congress]] (GPC) party, Najeeb ran as an independent.

In October 2000, 17 U.S. personnel died after an al-Qaeda [[USS Cole bombing|suicide attack on the U.S. naval vessel USS ''Cole'']] in [[Aden]]. After the [[September 11 attacks]] on the , President Saleh assured U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] that  was a partner in his [[War on Terror]]. In 2001, violence surrounded [[ constitutional referendum, 2001|a referendum]], which apparently supported extending Saleh's rule and powers.

The [[Houthi insurgency in ]] began in June 2004 when dissident cleric [[Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi]], head of the Zaidi Shia sect, launched an uprising against the  government. The  government alleged that the [[Houthis]] were seeking to overthrow it and to implement ''Shī'ite'' [[religious law]]. The rebels countered that they were "defending their community against discrimination" and government aggression. In 2005, at least 36 people were killed in clashes across the country between police and protesters over rising fuel prices. In the [[ presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential election]], Saleh won with 77% of the vote. His main rival, [[Faisal bin Shamlan]], received 22%. Saleh was sworn in for another term on 27 September.

A suicide bomber killed eight  tourists and two  in the [[Marib Governorate]] in July 2007. A series of bomb attacks occurred on police, official, diplomatic, foreign business, and tourism targets in 2008. Car bombings outside the U.S. embassy in Sana'a killed 18 people, including six of the assailants in September 2008. In 2008, an opposition rally in Sana'a demanding electoral reform was met with police gunfire.

The 2011 [[ Revolution| revolution]] followed other [[Arab Spring]] mass protests in early 2011. The uprising was initially against unemployment, economic conditions, and corruption, as well as against the government's proposals to modify the [[constitution of ]] so that Saleh's son could inherit the presidency.

In March 2011, police snipers opened fire on a pro-democracy camp in Sana'a, killing more than 50 people. In May, dozens were killed in clashes between troops and tribal fighters in Sana'a. By this point, Saleh began to lose international support. In October 2011,  human rights activist [[Tawakul Karman]] won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], and the [[UN Security Council]] condemned the violence and called for a transfer of power. On 23 November 2011, Saleh flew to [[Riyadh]], in neighbouring , to sign the [[Gulf Co-operation Council]] plan for political transition, which he had previously spurned. Upon signing the document, he agreed to legally transfer the office and powers of the presidency to his deputy, Vice President [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi]].

Hadi took office for a two-year term upon winning the uncontested presidential elections in February 2012. A unity government—including a prime minister from the opposition—was formed. Al-Hadi would oversee the drafting of a new constitution, followed by parliamentary and presidential elections in 2014. Saleh returned in February 2012. In the face of objections from thousands of street protesters, parliament granted him full immunity from prosecution. Saleh's son, General [[Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh]], continues to exercise a strong hold on sections of the military and security forces.

[[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula|AQAP]] claimed responsibility for a February 2012 suicide attack on the presidential palace that killed 26 Republican Guards on the day that President Hadi was sworn in. AQAP was also behind a suicide bombing that killed 96 soldiers in Sana'a three months later. In September 2012, a car bomb attack in Sana'a killed 11 people, a day after a local al-Qaeda leader [[Said al-Shihri]] was reported killed in the south.

By 2012, there was a "small contingent of U.S. special-operations troops"—in addition to CIA and "unofficially acknowledged" U.S. military presence—in response to increasing terror attacks by AQAP on  citizens. Many analysts have pointed out the former  government role in cultivating terrorist activity in the country. Following the election of President [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi]], the  military was able to push [[Ansar al-Sharia ()|Ansar al-Sharia]] back and recapture the [[Shabwah Governorate]].

The central government in Sana'a remained weak, staving off challenges from [[South  Movement|southern separatists]] and Houthis as well as AQAP. The [[Houthi insurgency]] intensified after Hadi took power, escalating in September 2014 as anti-government forces led by [[Abdul-Malik al-Houthi]] [[Battle of Sana'a (2014)|swept into the capital]] and forced Hadi to agree to a "unity" government. The Houthis then refused to participate in the government, although they continued to apply pressure on Hadi and his ministers, even shelling the president's private residence and placing him under house arrest, until the government's mass resignation in January 2015. The following month, the Houthis dissolved parliament and [[2014–15  coup d'état|declared]] that a [[Revolutionary Committee ()|Revolutionary Committee]] under [[Mohammed Ali al-Houthi]] was the interim authority in . Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, a cousin of the acting president, called the takeover a "glorious revolution". However, the "constitutional declaration" of 6 February 2015 was widely rejected by opposition politicians and foreign governments, including the [[United Nations]].

Hadi managed to flee from Sana'a to Aden, his hometown and stronghold in the south, on 21 February 2015. He promptly gave a televised speech rescinding his resignation, condemning the coup, and calling for recognition as the constitutional president of . The following month, Hadi declared Aden 's "temporary" capital. The Houthis, however, rebuffed an initiative by the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] and continued to move south toward Aden. All U.S. personnel were evacuated, and President Hadi was forced to flee the country to . On 26 March 2015,  announced [[Operation Decisive Storm]] and began airstrikes and announced its intentions to lead a military coalition against the Houthis, who they claimed were being aided by  and began a force buildup along the  border. The coalition included the [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], and [[]]. The  announced that it was assisting with intelligence, targeting, and logistics. After Hadi troops took control of Aden from Houthis, jihadist groups became active in the city, and some terrorist incidents were linked to them such as [[Missionaries of Charity attack in Aden]] on 4 March 2016. In February 2018, Aden was [[Battle of Aden (2018)|seized]] by the UAE-backed separatist [[Southern Transitional Council]].

 has been suffering from a [[Famine in  (2016–present)|famine since 2016]] as a result of the civil war. More than 50,000 children in  died from starvation in 2017. Numerous commentators have condemned the -led coalition's military campaign, including its [[blockade of ]], as [[genocide]]. The famine is being compounded by an outbreak of [[cholera]] that has affected more than one million people. The  Arabian-led intervention in  and blockade of  have contributed to the famine and cholera epidemic. The UN estimated that by the end of 2021, the war in  would have caused over 377,000 deaths, and roughly 70% of deaths were children under age 5.

On 4 December 2017, deposed strongman and former president [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]], accused of treason, was assassinated by Houthis whilst attempting to flee clashes near rebel-held Sana'a between Houthi and pro-Saleh forces. After losing the support of the -led coalition, 's President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi resigned, and the Presidential Leadership Council took power in April 2022.

Following the outbreak of the [[Gaza war]], the Houthis began to [[Houthi involvement in the –Hamas war|fire missiles at ]] and [[Houthi involvement in the –Hamas war#Attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and  Ocean (2023–2024)|attack ships]] off 's coast in the Red Sea, which they say is in solidarity with the Palestinians and aiming to facilitate entry of humanitarian aid into the [[Gaza Strip]].

In June 2024, the UAE-backed STC were putting pressure to lease the [[Port of Aden|Aden International Port]] to [[Abu Dhabi Ports]]. The move was opposed by the Parliament and the public. A joint statement by 24 members of Shura Council expressed categorical rejection of the lease agreement. Economists said the Emirates was attempting to control the Aden Port and limit its activities, in order to keep its own ports active. Governor of Aden, Tariq Salam also said the lease attempt aims to devalue the Aden Port and take its international maritime status. Aden International Port had ended its agreement to manage two container terminals with Dubai Ports World in 2012, due to economic decline and failure to fulfill commitments.
