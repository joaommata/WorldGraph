The history of  dates back to settlements founded about 10,000 years ago. The first people settled in the territory of  after the [[Last Glacial Period]] in the 10th millennium BC: [[Kunda culture|Kunda]], [[Neman culture|Neman]] and [[Narva culture]]s. They were traveling hunters. In the 8th millennium BC the climate became warmer and forests developed. The inhabitants of what is now  travelled less and engaged in local [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting, gathering]] and fresh-water fishing. The [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-Europeans]], who arrived in the 3rd – 2nd millennium BC, mixed with the local population and formed various Baltic tribes. The [[Balts]] did not maintain close cultural or political contacts with the [[Roman Empire]], while maintaining trade contacts via the [[Amber Road]].

From the 9th to the 11th centuries, coastal Balts were subjected to raids by the [[Vikings]].  comprised mainly the culturally different regions of [[Samogitia]] (known for its early medieval skeletal burials), and further east [[Aukštaitija]], or [[ proper]] (known for its early medieval cremation burials). The area was remote and unattractive to outsiders, including traders, which accounts for its separate linguistic, cultural and religious identity and delayed integration into general European patterns and trends. Traditional [[ mythology| pagan customs and mythology]], with many archaic elements, were long preserved. Rulers' bodies were cremated up until the conversion to Christianity.

[[File: state in 13-15th centuries.png|thumb|Changes in the territory of  from the 13th to 15th century. At its peak,  was the largest state in Europe.]]
The first written record of the name for the country dates back to 1009 AD. Facing the [[Livonian Crusade| threat]], [[Mindaugas]] in the middle of the 13th century united a large part of the Baltic tribes and founded the State of , while in 1253 he was crowned as the Catholic [[Kingdom of |King of ]]. Moreover by taking advantage of the weakened territory of the former [[Kievan Rus']] due to the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Mongol invasion]], Mindaugas incorporated [[Black Ruthenia]] into . After Mindaugas' assassination in 1263, pagan  was again a target of the [[ Crusade|Christian crusades]] of the [[Teutonic Order]] and [[Livonian Order]]. [[Traidenis]] during his reign (1269–1282) reunified all  lands and achieved military successes against the crusaders, fighting alongside other Baltic tribes, but was unable to militarily assist the [[Old Prussians]] in their [[Prussian uprisings#The Great Prussian uprising (1260–1274)|Great Uprising]]. Traidenis' main residence was in [[Kernavė]].

From the late 13th century members of the [[Gediminids]] dynasty began ruling . Grand Duke [[Gediminas]] consolidated a [[hereditary monarchy]] and established [[Vilnius]] as the [[capital city]] in [[Letters of Gediminas|his letters]]. [[Christianization of | was christianized]] and incorporated [[East Slavs]]' territories (e.g. principalities of [[Principality of Minsk|Minsk]], [[Principality of Kiev|Kyiv]], [[Principality of Polotsk|Polotsk]], [[Principality of Vitebsk|Vitebsk]], [[Principality of Smolensk|Smolensk]], etc.) significantly expanding the [[Grand Duchy of ]]'s territory, expanding to ~650,000 km2 in the first half of the 14th century. At the end of the 14th century  was the largest country in [[Europe]]. In 1385,  formed a [[dynastic union]] with [[History of  during the Jagiellonian dynasty|]] through the [[Union of Krewo]]. By the 15th century [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] [[Jagiellonian dynasty|members]] of the  ruling Gediminids dynasty ruled  and , as well as [[Kingdom of  (1301–1526)|]], [[ in personal union with |]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and [[Moldavia]]. Wars with the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic State]] in [[––Teutonic War|1409-1411]] and [[Golub War|in 1422]] concluded with the [[Treaty of Melno]].

In the 15th century the strengthened [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] renewed the [[Muscovite– Wars]] for the -controlled [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] territories. Due to the unsuccessful beginning of the [[Livonian War]], loss of land to the [[Tsardom of ]], and pressure by monarch [[Sigismund II Augustus]] (a supporter of a close – union), the [[ nobility]] agreed to conclude the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569 with the [[Crown of the Kingdom of ]], which created the [[– Commonwealth]] with a joint monarch, but  remained a separate state. After concluding the [[real union]],  and  jointly managed to reach [[List of wars involving |military successes]] during the Livonian War, [[– occupation of Moscow|occupation of Moscow]] (1610), [[– War (1600–1611)|war with  (1600–1611)]], [[Smolensk War|Smolensk war with  (1632–1634)]], etc. In 1588, [[Sigismund III Vasa]] personally confirmed the [[Statutes of #Third Statute|Third Statute of ]] where it was stated that  and  have equal rights within the Commonwealth and ensured the [[separation of powers]]. The real union strongly intensified the [[Polonization]] of  and  nobility.

The mid-17th century was marked with disastrous military losses for  as during the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]] most of the territory of  was annexed by the Tsardom of , and [[Battle of Vilnius (1655)|Vilnius was captured]] for the first time by a foreign army and ravaged. In 1655,  unilaterally [[Union of Kėdainiai|seceded from ]], declared  King [[Charles X Gustav]] as the Grand Duke of  and fell under the [[ |protection of the  Empire]]. However, by 1657  was once again a part of the – Commonwealth following the  revolt against the Swedes. Vilnius was recaptured from the Russians in 1661.

In the second half of the 18th century the – Commonwealth was three times [[Partitions of |partitioned]] by three neighboring countries which completely [[Dissolution (politics)|dissoluted]] both independent  and  from the political map in 1795 after a failed [[Kościuszko Uprising]] and short-lived [[Vilnius uprising (1794)|recapture of Vilnius]] in 1794. Most of 's territory was [[ Partition|annexed by the  Empire]], while {{Interlanguage link|Užnemunė|lt=Užnemunė|lt}} was annexed by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].

===Efforts to restore statehood===

Following the annexation the [[Tsarist autocracy| Tsarist]] authorities implemented [[Russification]] policies in , which then made a part of a new administrative region [[Northwestern Krai]]. In 1812 [[Napoleon]] during the [[ invasion of ]] established the puppet [[ Provisional Governing Commission]] to support his war efforts. After Napoleon's defeat the  rule was reinstated in .

During the [[November Uprising]] (1830–1831) the Lithuanians and Poles jointly attempted to restore their statehoods, however the  victory resulted in stricter Russification measures: the [[ language]] was introduced in all government institutions, [[Vilnius University]] was closed in 1832, and theories that  had been a "Western " state since its establishment were propagated. Subsequently, the Lithuanians once again tried to restore statehood by participating in the [[January Uprising]] (1863–1864), but yet another  victory resulted in even stronger Russification policies with the introduction of the [[ press ban]], pressure on the [[Catholic Church in ]] and [[Mikhail Muravyov-Vilensky]]'s repressions. Lithuanians resisted Russification through an extensive network of [[ book smugglers]], secret  publishing and homeschooling. Moreover, the [[ National Revival]], inspired by  history, language and culture, laid the foundations for the reestablishment of an independent . The [[Great Seimas of Vilnius]] was held in 1905 and its participants adopted resolutions which demanded a wide [[Autonomy#Politics|autonomy]] for .

During [[World War I]] the [[ Empire]] annexed  territories from the  Empire and they became a part of ''[[Ober Ost]]''. In 1917, the Lithuanians organized the [[Vilnius Conference]] which adopted a resolution, featuring the aspiration for the restoration of 's sovereignty and military alliance with  and elected the [[Council of ]]. In 1918, the short-lived [[Kingdom of  (1918)|Kingdom of ]] was proclaimed; however on 16 February 1918 the Council of  adopted the [[Act of Independence of ]] which restored  as a democratic republic with its capital in Vilnius and without any political ties that existed with other nations in the past. 

In 1918–1920 Lithuanians defended the statehood of  against [[–Soviet War|Bolsheviks]], [[–Bermontian War|Bermontians]] and [[– War|Poles]] during the [[ Wars of Independence]]. The aims of the newly restored  clashed with [[Józef Piłsudski]]'s plans to create a federation ([[Intermarium]]) in territories previously ruled by the [[Jagiellonian dynasty|Jagiellonians]]. The  authorities prevented the [[1919  coup attempt in ]], and in 1920 during the [[Żeligowski's Mutiny]] the  forces captured [[Vilnius Region]] and established a puppet state of the [[Republic of Central ]], which in 1922 was incorporated into . Consequently, [[Kaunas]] became the [[temporary capital of ]] where the [[Constituent Assembly of ]] was held and other primary  institutions operated until 1940. In 1923, the [[Klaipėda Revolt]] was organized which unified the [[Klaipėda Region]] with . The [[1926  coup d'état]] replaced the democratically elected government and [[Kazys Grinius#President (1926)|president]] with an authoritarian regime led by [[Antanas Smetona]].

In the late 1930s  accepted the [[1938  ultimatum to |1938  ultimatum]], [[1939  ultimatum to |1939  ultimatum]] and transferred the Klaipėda Region to [[Nazi ]]. The 1939 [[Soviet– Mutual Assistance Treaty]] allowed the presence of Soviet troops in . In 1940  accepted the [[Soviet ultimatum to |Soviet ultimatum]] and recovered the control of its historical capital Vilnius, however, the acceptance resulted in the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|Soviet occupation of ]] and its transformation into the [[ Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In 1941 during the [[June Uprising in ]] it was attempted to restore independent  and the [[Red Army]] was expelled from its territory, however in a few days  was [[ occupation of  during World War II|occupied by Nazi ]]. In 1944  was [[Soviet re-occupation of the Baltic states (1944)|re-occupied by the Soviet Union]], and [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|Soviet political repressions]] along with [[Soviet deportations from ]] resumed. Thousands of [[ partisans]] and their supporters attempted to militarily restore independent , but their resistance was eventually suppressed in 1953 by the [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet authorities]] and their [[extermination battalion|collaborators]]. [[Jonas Žemaitis]], the chairman of the [[Union of  Freedom Fighters]], was captured and executed in 1954, his successor as chairman [[Adolfas Ramanauskas]] was brutally tortured and executed in 1957. Since the late 1980s [[Sąjūdis]] movement sought for the restoration of independent , and in 1989 the [[Baltic Way]] was held.
