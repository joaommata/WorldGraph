[[Madam Buya]], a fossil found at an  archaeological site by  anthropologists, has been identified as among the oldest [[hominid]] fossils found to date. This fossil has been said to reveal significant stages in human evolution and to represent a possible link between the earlier ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and an archaic ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]''. Her remains have been dated to 1 million years old, making her the oldest skeletal find of her kind. It is believed that the [[Danakil Depression]] in  was a major site of human evolution and may contain other archaeological links between ''Homo erectus'' hominids and [[anatomically modern humans]].

During the last interglacial period, the [[Red Sea]] coast of  was occupied by early anatomically modern humans. It is believed that the area was on the route out of Africa that some scholars suggest was used by early humans to colonize the rest of the Old World. In 1999, the  Research Project Team (which was composed of , , , , and  scientists) discovered a [[Paleolithic]] site with stone and obsidian tools dated to more than 125,000 years old, near the [[Gulf of Zula]], south of [[Massawa]], along the Red Sea [[Littoral zone|littoral]]. The tools are believed to have been used by early humans to harvest marine resources such as clams and oysters.

=== Antiquity ===
{{main|Gash Group|Land of Punt|Dʿmt}}
Tools found in the [[Barka River|Barka Valley]], dating from 8,000 BC, appear to offer the first concrete evidence of human settlement in the area. Research also shows that many of the ethnic groups of  were the first to inhabit these areas.

Excavations in and near [[Agordat]], in central , yielded the remains of an ancient pre-Aksumite civilization known as the [[Gash Group]]. This included ceramics dated to between 2,500 and 1,500 BC.

Around 2,000 BC, parts of  were likely part of the [[Land of Punt]], a kingdom first mentioned in the twenty-fifth century BC. It was known for producing and exporting [[gold]], aromatic [[resin]]s, [[Dalbergia melanoxylon|blackwood]], [[ebony]], [[ivory trade|ivory]], and wild animals. The region is known from ancient  records of trade expeditions, especially a well-documented expedition to Punt in approximately 1,469 BC, during the reestablishment of disrupted trade routes by [[Hatshepsut]] and shortly after the beginning of her rule as the pharaoh of ancient .

Excavations at [[Sembel]] found evidence of an ancient, pre-[[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite]] civilization in greater Asmara. This culture is believed to have been among the oldest pastoral and agricultural communities in [[East Africa]]. Artifacts at the site have been dated to between 800 BC and 400 BC, contemporaneous with other pre-Aksumite settlements in the  and  highlands during the mid-first millennium BC.

[[Dʿmt]] was a kingdom that existed from the tenth to fifth centuries BC in what is now  and northern . Evidence of a massive temple complex at [[Yeha]] suggests that it was most likely Dʿmt's capital. [[Qohaito]], often identified as the town of Koloe in the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', and [[Matara, |Matara]] were important Dʿmt cities located in southern .

The realm developed [[irrigation]] schemes, used [[plow]]s, grew [[millet]], and made [[iron]] tools and weapons. After Dʿmt fell in the fifth century BC, the plateau was dominated by smaller successor kingdoms. This lasted until the first century, when one of these polities, the [[Kingdom of Aksum]], was able to reunite the area.

The [[Kingdom of Aksum]] (or Axum) was a trading empire centered in  and northern . It existed from approximately 100–940 AD, growing from the proto-Aksumite [[Iron Age]] period around the fourth century BC and achieving prominence by the first century AD.

According to the medieval ''Liber Axumae'' ([[Book of Aksum]]), Aksum's first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush. The capital was later moved to [[Axum]] in northern . The kingdom used the name "" as early as the fourth century.

The Aksumites erected a number of large [[Stele|stelae]], which served a religious purpose in pre-[[Christianity|Christian]] times. One of these granite columns, the [[Obelisk of Aksum]], is the largest such structure in the world, standing at {{convert|90|ft|m|abbr=off}}. Under [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 320–360), Aksum later adopted Christianity.

Christianity was the first [[world religion]] adopted in modern . The oldest monastery, [[Debre Sina (monastery)|Debre Sina]], dates back to the fourth century, and [[Debre Libanos ()|Debre Libanos]] was built in the late fifth or early sixth century. Originally located in the village of Ham, it was moved to an inaccessible location on the edge of a cliff below the Ham plateau. Its church contains the Golden Gospel, a metal-covered bible dating to the thirteenth century, during which Debre Libanos was a seat of religious power.

In the seventh century AD, early [[Muslim]]s from [[Mecca]], at least [[Sahaba|companions]] of the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], sought refuge from [[Quraysh]]i [[persecution of Muslims by the Meccans|persecution]] by travelling to the kingdom, a journey known in [[Islamic history]] as the [[Migration to Abyssinia|First Hijrah]]. They reportedly built the [[Al-Fatah Mosque, Kigali|first]] African [[mosque]]: the [[Mosque of the Companions]] in Massawa.

The kingdom is mentioned in the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'' as an important market place for [[Ivory trade|ivory]], which was exported throughout the ancient world. At the time, Aksum was ruled by [[Zoskales]], who also governed the port of [[Adulis]]. The Aksumite rulers facilitated trade by minting their own [[Aksumite currency]].

Pre-colonial  had four distinct regions, divided by geography and in limited contact with each other. The [[Abyssinian people|Abyssinian]], [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]]-speaking Christians controlled the highlands, the nomadic [[Tigre people|Tigre]] and [[Beni-Amer people|Beni Amer]] clans the western lowlands, the Arabic Muslims the regions [[Massawa]] and Dahlak, and the [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] [[Afar people|Afar]]s the [[Southern Red Sea Region|Dankalia]] region.

After the decline of Aksum, the  highlands fell under the domain of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Zagwe dynasty]], and later the influence of the [[ Empire]]. The area was first known as ''Ma'ikele Bahri'' ("between the seas/rivers", i.e. the land between the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Mareb River|Mereb river]]), and later renamed the Medri Bahri ("Sea land" in Tigrinya). The region, ruled by a local governor called the ''[[ aristocratic and court titles#Important regional offices|Bahr Negash]]'', was first documented in an obscure land grant of the 11th-century [[Zagwe dynasty|Zagwe]] king [[Tatadim]]. He considered the unnamed Bahr Negash one of his ''seyyuman'' or "appointed ones".  Emperor [[Zara Yaqob]] strengthened imperial presence in the area by increasing the power of the Bahr Negash and placing him above other local chiefs, establishing a military colony of settlers from [[Shewa]], and forcing the Muslims on the coast to pay tribute.

The first Westerner to document a visit to  was  explorer [[Francisco Álvares]] in 1520. He recounted his journey through the principality ruled by the Bahr Negash, highlighting three key cities, with [[Debarwa]] as the capital. He then detailed the border demarcation at the [[Mereb River]] with the province of Tigray and recounted the difficulties in transporting certain goods across the border. His books have the first description of the local powers of [[Tigray Region|Tigray]] and the Bahr Negash.

The contemporary coast of  formed a route to the region of Tigray, where the  had a small colony, and to the interior [[]]n allies of the . Massawa was also the stage for the 1541 landing of troops by [[Cristóvão da Gama]] in the military campaign that eventually defeated the [[Adal Sultanate]] in the [[battle of Wayna Daga]] in 1543.

By 1557, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] had succeeded in occupying all of northeastern present-day  for the following two decades, an area that stretched from Massawa to [[Suakin|Swakin]] in . The territory became an Ottoman governorate, known as the [[Habesh Eyalet]], with a capital at Massawa. When the city became of secondary economic importance, the administrative capital moved across the Red Sea to [[Jeddah]].
The Turks tried to occupy the highlands of  in 1559, but withdrew after they encountered resistance, pushed back by the Bahri Negash and highland forces. In 1578 they tried to expand into the highlands with the help of Bahri Negash Yisehaq, who had switched alliances due to a power struggle.  Emperor [[Sarsa Dengel]] made a punitive expedition against the Turks in 1588 in response to their raids in the northern provinces, and apparently, by 1589, they were once again compelled to withdraw to the coast. The Ottomans were eventually driven out in the last quarter of the sixteenth century. However, they retained control over the seaboard until the establishment of [[ ]] in the late 1800s.

In 1734, the [[Afar people|Afar]] leader Kedafu established the [[Mudaito Dynasty]] in , which later also came to include the southern Denkel lowlands of , thus incorporating the southern Denkel lowlands into the [[Sultanate of Aussa]]. The northern coastline of Denkel was dominated by a number of smaller Afar sultanates, such as the Sultanate of [[Rahayta]], the Sultanate of [[Beylul]] and the Sultanate of [[Bidu (woreda)|Bidu]].

The boundaries of present-day  were established during the [[Scramble for Africa]]. On 15 November 1869, the ruling local chief sold lands surrounding the Bay of [[Assab]] to the  missionary [[Giuseppe Sapeto]], on behalf of the [[Società di Navigazione Rubattino|Rubattino Shipping Company]]. The area served as a [[coaling station]] along the [[shipping lane]]s introduced by the recently completed [[Suez Canal]]. In 1882, the  government formally took possession of the [[Assab]] colony from its commercial owners and expanded their control to include [[Massawa]] (and most of the  coastal lowlands) after the  withdrew from  in February 1885.

In the [[power vacuum]] that followed the [[Battle of Gallabat|1889 death]] of [[Emperor of |Emperor]] [[Yohannes IV|Yohannes&nbsp;IV]], Gen. [[Oreste Baratieri]] occupied the highlands along the  coast and  proclaimed the establishment of [[ ]], a colony of the [[Kingdom of ]]. In the [[Treaty of Wuchale]] (It.&nbsp;''Uccialli'') signed the same year, [[Menelik II]] of [[Shewa]], a southern  kingdom, recognized the  occupation of his rivals' lands of [[Bogos]], [[Hamasien]], [[Akkele Guzay]], and [[Serae]] in exchange for guarantees of financial assistance and continuing access to European arms and ammunition. His subsequent victory over rival kings and enthronement as Emperor [[Menelik II of |Menelik&nbsp;II]] (r.&nbsp;1889–1913) made the treaty formally binding upon the entire territory.

In 1888, the  administration launched its first development projects in the new colony. The [[ Railway]] was completed to Saati in 1888, and reached [[Asmara]] in the highlands in 1911. The [[Asmara-Massawa Cableway|Asmara–Massawa Cableway]] was the longest line in the world during its time but was later dismantled by the  in World War II. Besides major infrastructural projects, the colonial authorities invested significantly in the agricultural sector. They also oversaw the provision of urban amenities in Asmara and Massawa, and employed many  in public service, particularly in the police and public works departments. Thousands of  were concurrently enlisted in the  army, serving during the [[Italo- War]] in  as well as the [[First Italo- War|First]] and [[Second Italo- War|Second]] Italo-Abyssinian Wars.

Additionally, the   administration opened many new factories that produced buttons, cooking oil, pasta, construction materials, packing meat, tobacco, hide, and other household commodities. In 1939, there were approximately 2,198 factories and most of the employees were  citizens. The establishment of industry also increased the populations of  and  residing in cities. The number of  in the territory increased from 4,600 to 75,000 in five years; and with the involvement of  in the industry, trade and fruit plantations were expanded across the nation. Some plantations were owned by .

In 1922, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s rise to power in  brought profound changes to the colonial government in  . After ''[[il Duce]]'' declared the birth of the [[ Empire]] in May 1936,   (enlarged with northern 's regions) and [[ Somaliland]] were merged with the just-conquered  into the new [[ East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana''). This [[Fascists|Fascist]] period was characterized by imperial expansion in the name of a "new Roman Empire".  was chosen by the  government to be the industrial center of  East Africa.

After 1935, [[art deco]] architecture was widely employed in Asmara. The  designed more than 400 buildings in a construction boom that only halted with 's involvement in [[World War II]]. These included the [[Fiat Tagliero Building]] and [[Cinema Impero]].{{unreliable source?|date=October 2024}} In 2017, the city was declared a [[World Heritage Site]], described by [[UNESCO]] as featuring ''eclectic and rationalist built forms, well-defined open spaces, and public and private buildings, including cinemas, shops, banks, religious structures, public and private offices, industrial facilities, and residences''.)

Through the 1941 [[Battle of Keren]], the  expelled the  and took over the administration of the country. The decade of  administration saw significant restructuring of the  economy. Until 1945, the  and  relied on  equipment and skilled labor for wartime needs and Allied support in the Middle East. This economic boom, fueled by substantial  involvement, lasted until the end of the war, when the  economy faced a combination of recession and depression. War factories that had employed thousands shut down, and  began to be repatriated. Additionally, many small manufacturing plants established between 1936 and 1945 were forced to close due to intense competition from factories in Europe and the Middle East.

In the absence of agreement amongst the Allies concerning 's status, the  administration continued until 1950.  During the immediate postwar years, the  proposed that  be divided along religious community lines and annexed partly to the  colony of  and partly to . After the peace treaty with  was signed in 1947, the [[United Nations]] sent a Commission of Enquiry to decide the fate of the colony.

In the 1950s, the  feudal administration under Emperor [[Haile Selassie of |Haile Selassie]] sought to annex  and  Somaliland. Selassie laid claim to both territories in a letter to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the Paris Peace Conference and the First Session of the United Nations. In the United Nations, the debate over the former  colonies continued. The  and  preferred to cede all of  except the Western province to the , as a reward for their support during [[World War II]]. The Independence Bloc of  parties consistently requested for the United Nations General Assembly to hold an immediate referendum to settle the question of  sovereignty.

The United Nations Commission of Enquiry arrived in  in early 1950, and after about six weeks, returned to New York to submit its report. Two reports were presented. The minority report, presented by  and , proposed that  be independent after a period of trusteeship. The majority report, presented by , , and the Union of , called for  to be incorporated into .

In 1958, a group of  founded the  Liberation Movement (ELM). The organization mainly consisted of  students, professionals, and intellectuals. It engaged in clandestine political activities intended to cultivate resistance to the centralizing policies of the imperial  state. On 1 September 1961, the [[ Liberation Front]] (ELF), under the leadership of [[Hamid Idris Awate]], waged an armed struggle for independence. In 1962, Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] unilaterally dissolved the  parliament and [[Annexation|annexed]] the territory. The ensuing [[ War of Independence]] went on for 30 years against successive  governments until 1991, when the [[ People's Liberation Front]] (EPLF), a successor of the [[ Liberation Front|ELF]], defeated the  forces in  and helped a coalition of [[ People's Revolutionary Democratic Front| rebel forces]] take control of the  capital [[Addis Ababa]].

In the 1980s, a non-government organization called the  Inter-Agency Consortium (EIAC) aided in the development projects for the  Liberation movement.

Following a [[1993  independence referendum|referendum in ]] supervised by the United Nations (dubbed UNOVER) in which the  people overwhelmingly voted for independence,  declared its independence and gained international recognition in 1993. The EPLF seized power, established a one-party state along nationalist lines and banned further political activity. As of 2024, there have been no elections.
