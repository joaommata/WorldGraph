=== Prehistory ===
Human presence in the region now known as  dates back approximately 13,000 years, with evidence of [[hunter-gatherer]] communities. It is estimated that at the time of the first contact with Europeans in the 16th century, there were about 9,000 [[Charrúa]] and 6,000 [[Chaná people|Chaná]] and some [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] island settlements.

There is an extensive archeological collection of man-made [[tumulus|tumuli]] known as "''[[Cerritos de Indios]]''" in the eastern part of the country, some of them dating back to 5,000 years ago. Very little is known about the people who built them as they left no written record, but evidence has been found in place of indigenous agriculture and of extinct [[Native  dogs|indigenous]] woolly dogs.

=== Colonial rule ===

The [[ discoveries| were]] the first Europeans to enter the region of present-day  in 1512. The [[ Empire|]] arrived in present-day  in 1515 but were the first to set foot in the area, claiming it for the crown. The indigenous peoples' fierce resistance to [[ colonization of the Americas|conquest]], combined with the absence of valuable resources, limited European settlement in the region during the 16th and 17th centuries.  then became a zone of contention between the  and  empires. In 1603, the  began introducing cattle, which became a source of regional wealth. The first permanent  settlement was founded in 1624 at [[Villa Soriano|Soriano]] on the [[Río Negro ()|Río Negro]]. In 1680, the  built a fort at [[Colonia del Sacramento]].

[[Montevideo]], the current capital of , was founded by the  in 1726 as a military stronghold. Its natural harbor soon developed into a commercial area competing with [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Río de la Plata]]'s capital, [[Buenos Aires]]. 's early 19th-century history was shaped by ongoing fights for dominance in the [[La Plata Basin|Platine region]] between British, , , and other colonial forces. In 1806 and 1807, the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata|British army attempted to seize Buenos Aires and Montevideo]] as part of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Montevideo was occupied by British forces from February to September 1807.

In 1811, [[José Gervasio Artigas]], who became 's national hero, launched a successful revolt against the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata| authorities]], defeating them on 18 May at the [[Battle of Las Piedras (1811)|Battle of Las Piedras]]. In 1813, the new government in Buenos Aires convened a constituent assembly where Artigas emerged as a champion of federalism, demanding political and economic autonomy for each area and the [[Banda Oriental]] in particular. The assembly refused to seat the delegates from the Banda Oriental; however, Buenos Aires pursued a system based on unitary centralism.

As a result, Artigas broke with Buenos Aires and besieged Montevideo, taking the city in early 1815. Once the troops from Buenos Aires had withdrawn, the Banda Oriental appointed its first autonomous government. Artigas organized the [[Liga Federal|Federal League]] under his protection, consisting of six provinces, five of which later became part of .

In 1816, 10,000  troops invaded the Banda Oriental from ; they took Montevideo in January 1817. After nearly four more years of struggle, the [[ of ,  and the Algarves| Kingdom of ]] annexed the ''Banda Oriental'' as a province under the name of "[[Cisplatina]]". The [[Empire of | Empire]] became independent of  in 1822. In response to the annexation, the [[Thirty-Three Orientals]], led by [[Juan Antonio Lavalleja]], declared independence on 25 August 1825, supported by the [[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]] (present-day ). This led to the 500-day-long [[Cisplatine War]]. Neither side gained the upper hand, and in 1828, the [[Treaty of Montevideo (1828)|Treaty of Montevideo]], fostered by the  through the diplomatic efforts of [[John Ponsonby, 1st Viscount Ponsonby|Viscount John Ponsonby]], gave birth to  as an independent state. 25 August is celebrated as Independence Day, a [[Public holidays in |national holiday]]. The nation's [[Constitution of |first constitution]] was adopted on 18 July 1830.

=== 19th century ===
{{see also| Civil War| War}}
At the time of independence,  had an estimated population of just under 75,000. The political scene in  became split between two parties: the conservative ''[[National Party ()|Blancos]]'' (Whites), headed by the second President [[Manuel Oribe]], representing the agricultural interests of the countryside, and the liberal ''[[Colorado Party ()|Colorados]]'' (Reds), led by the first President [[Fructuoso Rivera]], representing the business interests of Montevideo. The  parties received support from warring political factions in neighboring [[]], which became involved in  affairs.

The ''Colorados'' favored the exiled  liberal [[Unitarian Party|Unitarios]], many of whom had taken refuge in Montevideo, while the Blanco president Manuel Oribe was a close friend of the  ruler [[Manuel de Rosas]]. On 15 June 1838, an army led by the Colorado leader Rivera overthrew President Oribe, who fled to . Rivera declared war on Rosas in 1839. The conflict would last 13 years and become known as the [[ Civil War|Guerra Grande]] (the Great War). In 1843, an  army overran  on Oribe's behalf but failed to take the capital. The [[ Civil War#The Great Siege|siege of Montevideo]] began in February 1843 and lasted nine years. The besieged Uruguayans called on resident foreigners for help, which led to a  and an  legion being formed, the latter led by the exiled [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].

[[File:Boceto para la Jura de la Constitución de 1830.jpg|thumb|On 18 July 1830,  proclaimed its [[Constitution of  of 1830|first Constitution]], a significant event that marked the end of the independence process.]]
In 1845, Britain and  intervened against Rosas to restore commerce to normal levels in the region. Their efforts proved ineffective, and by 1849, tired of the war, both withdrew after signing a treaty favorable to Rosas. It appeared that Montevideo would finally fall when an uprising against Rosas, led by [[Justo José de Urquiza]], governor of 's [[Entre Ríos Province]], began. The  intervention in May 1851 on behalf of the ''Colorados'', combined with the uprising, changed the situation, and Oribe was defeated. The siege of Montevideo was lifted, and the ''Guerra Grande'' finally came to an end. Montevideo rewarded 's support by signing treaties that confirmed 's right to intervene in 's internal affairs.

In accordance with the 1851 treaties,  intervened militarily in  as often as it deemed necessary. In 1865, the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] was formed by the [[emperor of ]], the [[president of ]], and the Colorado general [[Venancio Flores]], the  head of government whom they both had helped to gain power. The Triple Alliance declared war on the  leader [[Francisco Solano López]]. The resulting [[ War]] ended with the invasion of  and its defeat by the armies of the three countries. Montevideo was used as a supply station by the  navy, and it experienced a period of prosperity and relative calm during the war.

The first railway line was assembled in  in 1867, and a branch consisting of a horse-drawn train was opened. The present-day [[State Railways Administration of ]] maintains {{convert|2900|km|abbr=on}} of extendable railway network.

The constitutional government of General [[Lorenzo Batlle y Grau]] (1868–72) suppressed the [[Revolution of the Lances]] by the [[National Party ()|Blancos]]. After two years of struggle, a peace agreement was signed in 1872 that gave the Blancos a share in the emoluments and functions of government through control of four of the [[departments of ]]. This establishment of the policy of co-participation represented the search for a new formula of compromise based on the coexistence of the party in power and the opposition party. Despite this agreement, the Colorado rule was threatened by the failed [[Tricolor Revolution]] in 1875 and the Revolution of the [[Quebracho, |Quebracho]] in 1886.

The Colorado effort to reduce Blancos to only three departments caused a Blanco uprising of 1897, which ended with creating 16 departments, of which the Blancos now had control over six. Blancos were given ⅓ seats in Congress. This division of power lasted until President [[Jose Batlle y Ordonez]] instituted his political reforms, which caused the last uprising by Blancos in 1904 that ended with the [[Battle of Masoller]] and the death of Blanco leader [[Aparicio Saravia]].

Between 1875 and 1890, the military became the center of power. During this authoritarian period, the government took steps toward the organization of the country as a modern state, encouraging its economic and social transformation. Pressure groups (consisting mainly of businessmen, ''[[hacendado]]s'', and industrialists) were organized and had a strong influence on the government. A transition period (1886–90) followed, during which politicians began recovering lost ground, and some civilian participation in government occurred. After the [[ Civil War|Guerra Grande]], there was a sharp rise in the number of immigrants, primarily from  and . By 1879, the total population of the country was over 438,500. The economy reflected a steep upswing (if demonstrated graphically, above all other related economic determinants) in livestock raising and exports. Montevideo became a major financial center of the region and an [[entrepôt]] for goods from , , and .

The Colorado leader [[José Batlle y Ordóñez]] was elected president in 1903. The following year, the Blancos led a rural revolt, and eight bloody months of fighting ensued before their leader, [[Aparicio Saravia]], was killed in battle. Government forces emerged victorious, leading to the end of the co-participation politics that had begun in 1872. [[José Batlle y Ordóñez|Batlle]] had two terms (1903–07 and 1911–15) during which he instituted major reforms, such as a welfare program, government participation in the economy, and a plural executive.

[[Gabriel Terra]] became president in March 1931. His inauguration coincided with the effects of the [[Great Depression]], and the social climate became tense as a result of the lack of jobs. There were confrontations in which police and leftists died. In 1933, Terra organized a coup d'état, dissolving the General Assembly and governing by decree. A new constitution was promulgated in 1934, transferring powers to the president. In general, the Terra government weakened or neutralized economic nationalism and social reform.

In 1938, general elections were held, and Terra's brother-in-law, General [[Alfredo Baldomir]], was elected president. Under pressure from organized labor and the National Party, Baldomir advocated free elections, freedom of the press, and a new constitution. Although Baldomir declared  neutral in 1939, British warships and the  ship {{ship| cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}} fought [[Battle of the River Plate|a battle]] not far off 's coast. The ''Admiral Graf Spee'' took refuge in [[Montevideo]], claiming sanctuary in a neutral port, but was later ordered out.

In 1945,  formally signed the [[Declaration by United Nations|Declaration by the United Nations]] and entered [[World War II]], leading the country to declare war on [[Nazi |]] and [[Empire of |]]. Following the end of the war, it became a founding member of the [[United Nations]].

An armed group of [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] urban guerrillas, known as the [[Tupamaros]], emerged in the 1960s, engaging in activities such as bank robbery, kidnapping, and assassination, in addition to attempting an overthrow of the government.

=== Civic-military dictatorship ===
[[File:Museo de la Memoria - 2022 03.jpg|thumb|Garments worn by prisoners during the dictatorship, exhibited at the [[Museo de la Memoria ()|Museum of Memory]]]]

President [[Jorge Pacheco Areco|Jorge Pacheco]] declared a state of emergency in 1968, followed by a further suspension of civil liberties in 1972. In 1973, amid increasing economic and political turmoil, the armed forces, asked by President [[Juan María Bordaberry]], disbanded Parliament and established a [[Civic-military dictatorship of |civilian-military regime]]. The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-backed campaign of political repression and state terror involving intelligence operations and assassination of opponents was called [[Operation Condor]].

According to one source, around 180 Uruguayans are known to have been killed and disappeared, with thousands more illegally detained and tortured during the 12-year civil-military rule from 1973 to 1985. Most were killed in  and other neighboring countries, with 36 of them having been killed in . According to Edy Kaufman (cited by David Altman),  at the time had the highest per capita number of political prisoners in the world. "Kaufman, who spoke at the U.S. Congressional Hearings of 1976 on behalf of [[Amnesty International]], estimated that one in every five Uruguayans went into exile, one in fifty were detained, and one in five hundred went to prison (most of them tortured)." Social spending was reduced, and many state-owned companies were privatized. However, the economy did not improve and deteriorated after 1980; the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) fell by 20%, and unemployment rose to 17%. The state intervened by trying to bail out failing companies and banks.{{rp|45}}

=== Return to democracy (1984–present) ===
[[File:Batlle1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Former  president [[Jorge Batlle]] with former U.S. president [[George H. W. Bush]] in 2003]]

A new constitution, drafted by the military, was rejected in a November 1980 referendum. Following the referendum, the armed forces announced a plan for the return to civilian rule, and national elections were held in 1984. [[Colorado Party ()|Colorado Party]] leader [[Julio María Sanguinetti]] won the presidency and served from 1985 to 1990. The first Sanguinetti administration implemented economic reforms and consolidated democracy following the country's years under military rule. The National Party's [[Luis Alberto Lacalle]] won the 1989 presidential election, and a referendum endorsed amnesty for human rights abusers. Sanguinetti was then reelected in 1994. Both presidents continued the economic structural reforms initiated after the reinstatement of democracy.

The 1999 national elections were held under a new electoral system established by a 1996 constitutional amendment. Colorado Party candidate [[Jorge Batlle]], aided by the support of the National Party, defeated [[Broad Front ()|Broad Front]] candidate [[Tabaré Vázquez]]. The formal coalition ended in November 2002, when the Blancos withdrew their ministers from the cabinet, although the Blancos continued to support the Colorados on most issues. Low commodity prices and economic difficulties in 's main export markets (starting in  with the devaluation of the [[ real|real]], then in [[ economic crisis (1999–2002)| in 2002]]) caused a severe recession; the economy contracted by 11%, unemployment climbed to 21%, and the percentage of Uruguayans in poverty rose to over 30%.

In 2004, Uruguayans elected [[Tabaré Vázquez]] as president while giving the Broad Front a majority in both houses of Parliament. Vázquez stuck to economic orthodoxy. As commodity prices soared and the economy recovered from the recession, he tripled foreign investment, cut poverty and unemployment, cut [[Government debt|public debt]] from 79% of GDP to 60%, and kept inflation steady. In 2009, [[José Mujica]], a former left-wing guerrilla leader (Tupamaros) who spent almost 15 years in prison during the country's military rule, emerged as the new president as the Broad Front won the election for a second time. [[Abortion in |Abortion]] was legalized in 2012, followed by [[Same-sex marriage in |same-sex marriage]] and [[Legality of cannabis in |cannabis]] in the following year, making  the first country in the modern era to legalize cannabis.

In 2014, Tabaré Vázquez was elected to a non-consecutive second presidential term, which began on 1 March 2015. In 2020, after 15 years of left-wing rule, he was succeeded by [[Luis Alberto Lacalle Pou]], a member of the conservative [[National Party ()|National Party]], as the 42nd President of . On 1 March 2025, [[Yamandú Orsi|Yamandu Orsi]] took office as 's new president, as the left-wing coalition of the Broad Front returned to power after a five-year interruption.
