[[File:Codex aureus Epternacensis folio 24 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Text page from the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]], an important surviving codex, was produced in the [[Abbey of Echternach]] in the 11th century.]]

The first traces of settlement in what is now  are dated back to the [[Paleolithic Age]], about 35,000 years ago. From the 6th century BC, [[Celtic tribes]] settled in the region between the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Meuse]].

Six centuries later the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] named the Celtic tribes inhabiting these exact regions collectively as the ''[[Treveri]]''. Many examples of archaeological evidence proving their existence in  have been discovered, the most famous being the Oppidum of [[Titelberg]].

In around 58 to 51 BC, the Romans invaded the country when [[Julius Caesar]] [[Gallic Wars|conquered Gaul]] and part of [[Germania]] up to the Rhine border, thus the area of what is now  became part of the [[Roman Empire]] for the next 450 years, living in relative peace under the [[Pax Romana]].

Similar to those in Gaul, the Celts of  adopted Roman culture, language, morals and a way of life, effectively becoming what historians later described as [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman civilization]]. Evidence from that period includes the [[Dalheim Ricciacum]] and the [[Vichten|Vichten mosaic]], on display at the [[National Museum of History and Art]] in  City.

The territory was infiltrated by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Franks]] from the 4th century, and was abandoned by Rome in AD 406,{{rp|page = 65}} after which it became part of the [[Kingdom of the Franks]]. The Salian Franks who settled in the area are often described as the ones having brought the Germanic language to present-day , since the [[Frankish language|old Frankish]] language spoken by them is considered by linguists to be a direct forerunner of the [[Moselle Franconian language|Moselle Franconian dialect]], which later evolved into, among others, the modern-day [[| language]].{{rp|page=70}}

The [[Christianization]] of  is usually dated back to the end of the 7th century. The most famous figure in this context is [[Willibrord]], a [[Northumbria]]n missionary , who together with other monks established the [[Abbey of Echternach]] in AD 698, and is celebrated annually in the [[dancing procession of Echternach]]. For a few centuries the abbey would become one of northern Europe's most influential abbeys. The [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]], an important surviving codex written entirely in gold ink, was produced here in the 11th century. The so-called [[Emperor's Bible]] and the [[Golden Gospels of Henry III]] were also produced in Echternach at this time.

=== Emergence and expansion (963–1312) ===

[[File:Charles IV-John Ocko votive picture-fragment.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], the 14th-century Holy Roman Emperor and King of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] from the [[House of ]]]]

When the [[Carolingian Empire]] was divided many times starting with the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843, today's  territory became successively part of the [[Kingdom of Middle Francia]] (843–855), the [[Kingdom of Lotharingia]] (855–959) and finally of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] (959–1059), which itself had become a state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

The recorded history of  begins with the acquisition of ''Lucilinburhuc'' (today [[ Castle]]) situated on the [[Bock ()|Bock]] rock by [[Siegfried of |Siegfried, Count of the Ardennes]], in 963 through an exchange act with [[St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier]]. Around this [[Fortifications|fort]], a town gradually developed, which became the center of a state of great strategic value within the Duchy of Lorraine. Over the years, the fortress was extended by Siegfried's descendants and by 1083, one of them, [[Conrad I, Count of |Conrad I]], was the first to call himself a "[[Count of ]]", and with it effectively creating the independent [[County of ]] (which was still a state within the Holy Roman Empire).

By the middle of the 13th century, the counts of  had managed to gain considerable wealth and power and had expanded their territory from the river [[Meuse]] to the [[Moselle]]. By the time of the reign of [[Henry V, Count of |Henry V the Blonde]], [[Bitburg]], [[La Roche-en-Ardenne]], [[Durbuy]], [[Arlon]], [[Thionville]], [[Marville, Meuse|Marville]], [[Longwy]], and in 1264 the competing [[County of Vianden]] (and with it [[St Vith]] and [[Schleiden]]) had either been incorporated directly or become [[vassal states]] to the [[County of ]]. The only major setback during their rise in power came in 1288, when [[Henry VI, Count of |Henry VI]] and his three brothers died at the [[Battle of Worringen]] while trying unsuccessfully to add the [[Duchy of Limburg]] to their realm. But despite the defeat, the Battle of Worringen helped the Counts of  to achieve military glory, which they had previously lacked, as they had mostly enlarged their territory by means of inheritances, marriages and fiefdoms.

The ascension of the Counts of  culminated when [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] became [[King of the Romans]], [[King of ]] and finally, in 1312, [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

With the ascension of Henry VII as Emperor, the dynasty of the [[House of ]] not only began to rule the [[Holy Roman Empire]], but rapidly began to exercise growing influence over other parts of Central Europe as well.

Henry's son, [[John the Blind]], in addition to being Count of , also became [[King of Bohemia]]. He remains a major figure in  history and [[folklore]] and is considered by many historians the epitome of [[chivalry]] in medieval times. He is also known for having founded the [[Schueberfouer]] in 1340 and for his heroic death at the [[Battle of Crécy]] in 1346. John the Blind is considered a [[Folk hero|national hero]] in .

In the 14th and early 15th centuries, three more members of the House of  reigned as Holy Roman Emperors and Bohemian Kings: John's descendants [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] (who also was [[King of |King of  and ]]), and [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia|Wenceslaus IV]]. Charles IV created the long-lasting [[Golden Bull of 1356]], a decree which fixed important aspects of the constitutional structure of the Empire.  remained an independent fief (county) of the Holy Roman Empire, and in 1354, Charles IV elevated it to the status of a [[duchy]] with his half-brother [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of |Wenceslaus I]] becoming the first [[Duke of ]]. While his kin were occupied ruling and expanding their power within the Holy Roman Empire and elsewhere, Wenceslaus, annexed the [[County of Chiny]] in 1364, and with it, the territories of the new [[Duchy of ]] reached its greatest extent.

During these 130 years, the House of  was contending with the [[House of Habsburg]] for supremacy within the Holy Roman Empire and Central Europe. It all came to end in 1443, when the House of  suffered a succession crisis, precipitated by the lack of a male heir to assume the throne. Since Sigismund and [[Elizabeth of Görlitz]] were both heirless, all possessions of the  Dynasty were redistributed among the European aristocracy. The Duchy of  become a possession of [[Philip the Good]], [[Duke of Burgundy]].

As the House of  had become extinct and  now became part of the [[Burgundian ]], this would mark the start of nearly 400 years of foreign rule over .

=== Habsburg rule and  invasions (1444–1794) ===
{{See also|Fortress of }}

In 1482, [[Philip the Handsome]] inherited all of what became then known as the [[Habsburg ]], and with it the Duchy of . For nearly 320 years  would remain a possession of the mighty House of Habsburg, at first under  rule (1506–1556), then under [[ | rule (1556–1714)]], before going back again to [[ | rule (1714–1794)]].<br />
With having become a Habsburg possession, the Duchy of  became, like many countries in Europe at the time, heavily involved in the many conflicts for dominance of Europe between the Habsburg-held countries and the [[Kingdom of ]].

In 1542, the [[King of ]], [[Francis I of |François I]], invaded  twice, but the Habsburgs under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] managed to reconquer the Duchy each time.

 became part of the [[ ]] in 1556, and when  and  [[Franco- War (1635–1659)|went to war in 1635]] it resulted in the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], in which [[Partitions of |the first partition of ]] was decided. Under the Treaty,  ceded the  fortresses of [[Stenay]], Thionville, and [[Montmédy]], and the surrounding territory to , effectively reducing the size of  for the first time in centuries.

In context of the [[Nine Years' War]] in 1684, [[Siege of  (1684)| invaded  again]], conquering and occupying the Duchy until 1697 when it was returned to the  to garner support for the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] cause during the prelude to the [[War of the  Succession]]. When the war broke out in 1701  and the   were administered by the pro- faction under the governor [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]] and sided with the Bourbons. The duchy was subsequently occupied by the pro- allied forces during the conflict and was awarded to  at its conclusion in 1714.

As the Duchy of  repeatedly passed back and forth from  and  to  rule, each of the conquering nations contributed to strengthening and expanding the [[Fortress of |Fortress]] that the Castle of  had become over the years. One example of this includes  military engineer [[Marquis de Vauban]] who advanced the fortifications around and on the heights of the city, fortification walls that are still visible today.

During the [[War of the First Coalition]], [[First  Republic|Revolutionary ]] invaded the  , and with it, . In the years 1793 and 1794 most of the Duchy was conquered relatively quickly and the [[ Revolutionary Army]] committed many atrocities and pillages against the  civilian population and abbeys, the most infamous being the massacres of [[Differdange]] and [[Dudelange]], as well as the destruction of the abbeys of [[Clairefontaine Abbey|Clairefontaine]], [[Abbey of Echternach|Echternach]] and [[Orval Abbey|Orval]]. However the Fortress of  [[Siege of  (1794–95)|resisted for nearly 7 months]] before the  forces holding it surrendered. 's long defence led [[Lazare Carnot]] to call  "the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar", giving rise to the city's nickname ''the Gibraltar of the North''.

 was annexed by , becoming the [[Forêts|''département des forêts'']] (department of forests), and the incorporation of the former Duchy as a ''département'' into  was formalized at the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] in 1797.
From the start of the occupation the new  officials in , who spoke only , implemented many republican reforms, among them the principle of [[laicism]], which led to an outcry in strongly Catholic . Additionally  was implemented as the only official language and  people were barred access to all civil services. When the  Army introduced military duty for the local population, riots broke out which culminated in 1798 when  peasants started a rebellion. Even though the  managed to rapidly suppress this revolt called ''[[Peasants' War (1798)|Klëppelkrich]]'', it had a profound effect on the historical memory of the country and its citizens.

However, many republican ideas of this era continue to have a lasting effect on ; one of the many examples features the implementation of the Napoleonic [[Napoleonic Code|Code Civil]] which was introduced in 1804 and is still valid today.

=== National awakening (1815–1890) ===
{{See also| question}}
After the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|defeat]] of [[Napoleon]] in 1815, the [[Congress of Vienna]] decided to restore the Duchy of . However, as the territory had been part of the Holy Roman Empire as well as the Habsburgian  in the past, both the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the newly formed [[ of the ]], which included both the present Kingdom of the  and , now claimed possession of the territory. Thus the great powers decided that  would become a member state of the newly formed [[ Confederation]], but at the same time would be joined with the  in [[personal union]] under [[King William I of the ]], the son of the last Stadtholder of the  Republic, William V, Prince of Orange. To satisfy Prussia, it was decided that not only would the [[Fortress of ]] be manned by [[Prussian Army|Prussian troops]], but also that large parts of  territory (mainly the areas around Bitburg and St. Vith) would become Prussian possessions. This marked the second time that the Duchy of  was reduced in size and is generally known as the [[Partitions of |Second Partition of ]]. To compensate the Duchy for this loss, it was decided to elevate the Duchy to a [[Grand Duchy]], thus giving the  monarchs the additional title of [[Grand Duke of ]]. However, from 1816 to 1830, [[William I of the |William I]] ignored the Duchy's sovereignty, treating  as a conquered nation while subjecting  to high taxes.

After  became an independent country following the victorious [[ Revolution| Revolution of 1830–1831]], it claimed the entire Grand-Duchy of  as being part of . However, neither the  King, who was also Grand Duke of , nor Prussia wanted to lose their grip on the mighty fortress of  and therefor did not agree with the  claims. The dispute would be resolved at the [[Treaty of London (1839)|1839 Treaty of London]], where the [[Partitions of |Third Partition of ]] was decided. This time the territory was reduced by more than half, as the predominantly [[francophone]] [[ ()|western part of the country]] (but also the then -speaking part of [[Arelerland]]) was transferred to the new Kingdom of  under [[Leopold I of ]], thereby giving  its modern-day borders. The treaty of 1839 also established full independence of the remaining Germanic-speaking Grand-Duchy of .

In 1842,  joined the  Customs Union (''[[Zollverein]]''). This resulted in the opening of the  market, the development of [[Steel industry in |'s steel industry]], and expansion of [[Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois|'s railway network]] from 1855 to 1875.

After the [[ Crisis]] of 1866 nearly led to war between Prussia and , as both were unwilling to see the other taking influence over  and its mighty fortress, the Grand Duchy's independence and neutrality were reaffirmed by the [[Treaty of London, 1867|Second Treaty of London]] and Prussia was finally willing to withdraw its troops from the Fortress of  under the condition that the fortifications would be dismantled. That happened the same year. At the time of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] in 1870, 's neutrality was respected, and neither  nor  invaded the country.

As a result of the recurring disputes between the major European powers, the people of  gradually developed a consciousness of independence and a national awakening took place in the 19th century. The people of  began referring to themselves as ''[[]]'', rather than being part of one of the larger surrounding nations. This consciousness of ''[[Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinn]]'' ("''We want to remain what we are")'' culminated in 1890, when the last step towards full independence was finally taken: due to a succession crisis the [[ monarchy]] ceased to hold the title Grand-Duke of . Beginning with [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of |Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg]], the Grand-Duchy would have [[Nassau-Weilburg|its own monarchy]], thus reaffirming its full independence.

===  occupations and interwar political crisis (1890–1945) ===

In August 1914, during [[World War I]], [[Imperial ]] violated 's [[Neutral country|neutrality]] by invading it to defeat . Nevertheless, despite the [[ occupation of  during World War I| occupation]],  was allowed to maintain much of its independence and political mechanisms. Unaware of the fact that  secretly planned to annex the Grand-Duchy in case of a  victory (the [[Septemberprogramm]]), the  government continued to pursue a policy of strict neutrality. However, the  population did not believe  had good intentions, fearing that it would annex . Around 1,000  served in the  army; their sacrifices have been commemorated at the [[Gëlle Fra]].

After the war, Grand-Duchess [[Marie-Adélaïde, Grand Duchess of |Marie-Adélaïde]] was seen by many people (including the  and  governments) as having collaborated with the  and calls for her abdication and the establishment of a Republic became louder. After the retreat of the [[ Imperial Army| army]], communists in  City and [[Esch-sur-Alzette]] tried to establish a [[Soviet republic (system of government)|soviet worker's republic]] similar to the [[ Revolution of 1918–1919|ones emerging in ]], but these attempts lasted only two days.

In November 1918, a motion in the [[Chamber of Deputies ()|Chamber of Deputies]] demanding the [[Abolition of monarchy|abolition of the monarchy]] was defeated narrowly by 21 votes to 19 (with three abstentions).

 questioned the  government's, and especially Marie-Adélaïde's, neutrality during the war, and calls for an annexation of  to either  or  grew louder in both countries. In January 1919, a company of the [[ Army]] rebelled, declaring itself to be the army of the new republic, but  troops intervened and put an end to the rebellion. Nonetheless, the disloyalty shown by her own armed forces was too much for Marie-Adélaïde, who abdicated in favour of her sister [[Grand Duchess Charlotte|Charlotte]] 5 days later. The same year, in a [[1919  referendum|popular referendum]], 77.8% of the  population declared in favour of maintaining monarchy and rejected the establishment of a republic. During this time,  pushed for an annexation of . However, all such claims were ultimately dismissed at the [[Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)|Paris Peace Conference]], thus securing 's independence.

In 1939, the  army increased to 425 due to Nazi  presence. On May 9, 1940  closed the defensive [[Schuster Line|Schuster line]] with ; one day later, 's neutrality was violated again when [[Nazi ]]'s ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' [[Invasion of |entered the country]] "entirely without justification". In contrast to the First World War, under the [[ occupation of  during World War II]], the country was treated as  territory and informally annexed to the adjacent province of [[Nazi ]], [[Gau Moselland]]. This time,  did not remain neutral as 's [[ government-in-exile|government in exile]] based in London supported the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], sending a small group of volunteers who participated in the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]], and multiple [[ Resistance|resistance groups]] formed inside the occupied country.

With 2.45% of its prewar population killed, and a third of all buildings in  being destroyed or heavily damaged (mainly due to the [[Battle of the Bulge]]),  suffered the highest such loss in Western Europe, but its commitment to the Allied war effort was never questioned. Around 1,000–2,500 of 's Jews were murdered in [[the Holocaust in |the Holocaust]].

[[Romani people]] were also exterminated in  by the Nazis.

=== Integration into NATO and European Union (1945–) ===

The Grand Duchy became a founding member of the United Nations in 1945. 's neutral status under the [[Constitution of |constitution]] formally ended in 1948, and in April 1949 it also became a founding member of [[NATO]]. During the [[Cold War]],  continued its involvements on the side of the [[Western Bloc]]. In the early fifties a small contingent of troops fought in the [[ War]].
 troops have also deployed to , to support [[ISAF]].

In the 1950s,  became one of the six founding countries of the [[European Communities]], following the 1952 establishment of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], and subsequent 1958 creations of the [[European Economic Community]] and [[European Atomic Energy Community]]. In 1993, the former two of these were incorporated into the European Union. With [[Robert Schuman]] (one of the founding fathers of the EU), [[Pierre Werner]] (considered the father of the [[Euro]]), [[Gaston Thorn]], [[Jacques Santer]] and [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] (all former presidents of the [[European Commission]]),  politicians contributed substantially to the EU's formation and establishment. In 1999,  joined the [[eurozone]]. Thereafter, the country was elected non-permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council]] (2013–14).

The [[steel industry]] exploiting the [[Red Lands]]' rich iron-ore grounds in the beginning of the 20th century drove 's industrialization. After the decline of the steel industry in the 1970s, the country focused on establishing itself as [[Economy of |a global financial center]] and developed into the banking hub it is reputed to be. Since the beginning of the 21st century, its governments have focused on developing the country into a [[knowledge economy]], with the founding of the [[University of ]] and a [[ Space Agency|national space program]]. In 2020,  became the first country in the world to provide [[free public transport]] at a national scale.

On 19 December 2023, 's [[Chamber of Deputies ()|Chamber of Deputies]] adopted a law to modernize the current investment tax credit. It took effect less than two weeks later on 1 January 2024.
