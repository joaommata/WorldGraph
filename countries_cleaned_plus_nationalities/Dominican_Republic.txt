The islands of the Caribbean were first settled around 6,000 years ago by hunter-gatherer peoples originating from Central America or northern South America. The [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan-speaking]] ancestors of the [[Taíno]] moved into the Caribbean from South America during the 1st millennium BCE, reaching Hispaniola by around 600 CE. These Arawakan peoples engaged in farming, fishing, hunting and gathering, and the widespread production of [[ceramic]] goods.

The estimates of Hispaniola's population in 1492 vary widely, ranging from tens of thousands to 2 million.

By 1492, the island was divided into five Taíno chiefdoms. The Taíno name for the entire island was either ''Ayiti'' or ''Quisqueya''.

===European colonization===
[[File:Basílica Menor de Santa María SD RD 02 2017 1947.jpg|thumb|[[Catedral Santa María La Menor]] is the oldest cathedral built in the Americas]]
[[Christopher Columbus]] arrived on the island on December 5, 1492, during the first of his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|four voyages]] to the Americas. He claimed the land for  and named it ''La Española'', due to its diverse climate and terrain, which reminded him of the [[|]] landscape. In 1496, [[Bartholomew Columbus]], Christopher's brother, built the city of [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Santo Domingo]], Western Europe's first permanent settlement in the "[[New World]]". The Spaniards created a [[plantation economy]].

Initially, after friendly relationships, the Taínos resisted the conquest, led by female Chief [[Anacaona]] of Xaragua and her ex-husband Chief [[Caonabo]] of Maguana, as well as Chiefs [[Guacanagaríx]], [[Guamá]], [[Hatuey]], and [[Enriquillo]]. The latter's successes gained his people an autonomous enclave on the island. Within a few years after 1492, the population of Taínos had declined drastically due to [[smallpox]], measles, and other diseases that arrived with the Europeans. African slaves were imported to replace the dwindling Taínos.

The last record of pure Taínos in the country was from 1864. Still, Taíno biological heritage survived due to intermixing. Census records from 1514 reveal that 40% of  men in Santo Domingo were married to Taíno women, and some present-day Dominicans have Taíno ancestry.

[[File:Treaty of Aranjuez .svg|thumb|Map showing the border situation on Hispaniola following the [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1777)]]]]
By the time of the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] in 1697, which ceded the western one-third of the island to , the population of Santo Domingo consisted of a few thousand whites, approximately 30,000 black slaves, and a few Taínos.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=341}} By 1789, the population had grown to 125,000, but Santo Domingo remained one of 's less wealthy and strategically important colonies in the New World.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=341}} The population composition of Santo Domingo sharply contrasted with that of the neighboring  colony of [[Saint-Domingue]]—the wealthiest colony in the Caribbean and whose population of half a million was 90% enslaved and four times as numerous as Santo Domingo.

In 1795,  ceded Santo Domingo to  by the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]] as a result of its defeat in the [[War of the Pyrenees]]. Saint-Domingue achieved independence as  from  on January 1, 1804. In 1809, the  were expelled from the island and Santo Domingo returned to [[España Boba| rule]].{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=342}}

===Ephemeral independence and  occupation===
{{Main|Republic of  | occupation of Santo Domingo}}
[[File:LaTrinitaria.jpg|thumb|In 1838, [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] and others established a secret patriotic society called ''[[La Trinitaria ()|La Trinitaria]]'', which helped undermine  occupation.]]
After a dozen years of discontent and failed independence plots by various opposing groups, including a [[1812 Mendoza and Mojarra conspiracy|failed 1812 revolt]] led by [[Freedman|freedmen]], Santo Domingo's former Lieutenant-Governor (top administrator), [[José Núñez de Cáceres]], declared the colony's independence from the [[ Empire| crown]] as [[Republic of  | ]], on November 30, 1821. This period is also known as the Ephemeral independence.

The newly independent republic ended two months later, when it was occupied and annexed by , then under the leadership of [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]]. For twenty-two years,  controlled Santo Domingo, which it called ''Partie de l'Est'', treating it as a colonial territory. The unpaid  army sustained itself by taking resources from the  people and land without compensation.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=343}}

===First Republic (1844–1861)===
[[File:Flag of the  (up to 1844).svg|thumb|Original [[flag of the ]] (up to 1849)]]
In 1838, [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] founded a secret society called [[La Trinitaria ()|La Trinitaria]], which sought the complete independence of Santo Domingo without any foreign intervention.{{rp|p147–149}} Also [[Francisco del Rosario Sánchez]] and [[Ramon Matias Mella]], despite not being among the founding members of La Trinitaria, were decisive in the fight for independence. Duarte, Mella, and Sánchez are considered the Founding Fathers of the .

On February 27, 1844, the members of ''La Trinitaria'' declared independence from . They were backed by [[Pedro Santana]], a wealthy cattle rancher, who became general of the army of the nascent republic. The decades that followed were filled with tyranny, factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of government, and exile for political opponents. Archrivals Santana and [[Buenaventura Báez]] held power most of the time, both ruling arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new nation to a major power. The 's first [[Constitution of the |constitution]] was adopted on November 6, 1844, and its population  in 1845 was approximately 230,000 people (100,000 whites; 40,000 blacks; and 90,000 mulattoes).{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=343}}

In March 1844,  invaded but the Dominicans put up stiff opposition and inflicted heavy casualties on the Haitians. By April 15,  forces had defeated the  forces on both land and sea.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=344}} In early July 1844, Duarte was urged by his followers to take the title of President of the Republic. Duarte agreed, but only if free elections were arranged. However, Santana's forces took Santo Domingo on July 12, and they declared Santana ruler of the . Santana then put Mella, Duarte, and Sánchez in jail. On February 27, 1845, Santana executed [[María Trinidad Sánchez]], heroine of La Trinitaria, and others for conspiracy.

After defeating a third  invasion in April 1849 at the [[Battle of Las Carreras]], Santana marched on Santo Domingo and deposed president [[Manuel Jimenes]] (who had ousted Santana as president) in a [[coup d'état]]. At his behest, Congress elected Buenaventura Báez as president, but Báez was unwilling to serve as Santana's puppet. In November–December 1849,  seamen raided the  coasts, plundered seaside villages, as far as [[Dame-Marie, Grand'Anse|Dame Marie]], and butchered crews of captured enemy ships. A fourth and final invasion by  in November 1855 was defeated by  forces by January 27, 1856, resulting in thousands of  casualties.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=347}} Again Santana and Báez plotted against each other for political dominance, with Báez winning the first encounter and expelling Santana in 1857, and Santana winning the second and expelling Báez in 1859.

===Restoration republic===
[[File:Jura del gobernador y capitán general de Santo Domingo, don Pedro Santana (Museo del Prado).jpg|thumb|Pedro Santana is sworn in as governor-general of the new  province.]]
In 1861, after imprisoning, exiling, and executing many of his opponents and due to political and economic reasons, Santana asked Queen [[Isabella II of ]] to retake control of the . , which had not come to terms with the loss of its mainland  colonies 40 years earlier, [[Annexation of the  to |annexed the country]]. The island was occupied by 30,000  troops bolstered by battalions of  and Puerto Rican volunteers and 12,000 Dominicans who aligned themselves with the  forces.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=347}} The  rebel [[Sylvain Salnave]], fearful of the reestablishment of  as colonial power, gave refuge and logistics to revolutionaries seeking to reestablish the independent nation. The ensuing civil war, known as the ''War of Restoration'', killed more than 50,000.

The war began on August 16, 1863. The  garrison of Santiago was forced to abandon its fort and retreat to [[Puerto Plata, |Puerto Plata]] by mid-September. The Dominicans bombarded the port of Puerto Plata and destroyed much of the town, including [[St. Philip the Apostle Cathedral, Puerto Plata|St. Philip the Apostle Cathedral]]. In the south,  forces were successful in driving the rebels out of several towns and into . However, the capture of [[Azua, |Azua]] proved to be a costly endeavor, with two months of fighting and a significant loss of lives for the .  forces from  attacked and captured [[Monte Cristi, |Monte Cristi]] on the north coast, but sustained heavy casualties.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=348}}
[[File:Monumento a los Héroes de la Restauración 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|"Monument to the Heroes of the Restoration"]]
By 1865, the  forces had confined the  troops to Santo Domingo, and the Spaniards were afraid to venture outside the capital.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=349}} After nearly two years of fighting,  abandoned the island in July 1865. One military historian estimates  casualties at 10,888 killed or wounded in action and thousands dead from [[yellow fever]], while the  forces fighting for  suffered 10,000 casualties.{{sfn|Clodfelter|2017|p=306}} Another military historian estimates that  lost 18,000 dead, a figure that does not include the Dominicans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans fighting alongside them.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=349}} The Dominicans fighting for independence against  suffered more than 4,000 dead.

Political strife again prevailed in the following years; warlords ruled, military revolts were extremely common, and the nation amassed debt. It was now Báez's turn to act on his [[Proposed annexation of Santo Domingo|plan of annexing the country to the ]], where two successive presidents were supportive. U.S. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] desired a naval base at [[Samaná Bay|Samaná]] and also a place for resettling newly freed African Americans. The treaty was defeated in the [[ Senate]] in 1870. Báez was toppled in 1874, returned, and was toppled for good in 1878.

Relative peace came to the country in the 1880s, which saw the coming to power of General [[Ulises Heureaux]]. "Lilís", as the new president was nicknamed, put the nation deep into debt while using much of the proceeds for his personal use and to maintain his police state. In 1899, he was assassinated. However, the relative calm over which he presided allowed improvement in the  economy. The sugar industry was modernized,{{rp|p10}} and the country attracted foreign workers and immigrants. , Syrians, Turks, and Palestinians began to arrive in the country during the latter part of the 19th century. During the U.S. occupation of 1916–24, peasants from the countryside, called Gavilleros, would not only kill U.S. Marines, but would also attack and kill Arab vendors traveling through the countryside.

===20th century (1900–1930)===
[[File:Alejandro Woss y Gil.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Alejandro Woss y Gil]] taking office in 1903]]
From 1902 on, short-lived governments were again the norm, with their power usurped by caudillos in parts of the country. Furthermore, the national government was bankrupt and, unable to pay its debts to European creditors, faced the threat of military intervention by , [[ Empire|]], and [[Kingdom of |]].  President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sought to prevent European intervention, largely to protect the routes to the future [[ Canal]]. He made a small military intervention to ward off European powers, to proclaim his famous [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], and also to obtain his 1905  agreement for U.S. administration of  customs, which was the chief source of income for the  government. A 1906 agreement provided for the arrangement to last 50 years. The  agreed to use part of the customs proceeds to reduce the immense foreign debt of the  and assumed responsibility for said debt.

After six years in power, President [[Ramón Cáceres]] (who had himself assassinated Heureaux) was assassinated in 1911. The result was several years of great political instability and [[ Civil War (1911–1912)|civil war]]. U.S. mediation by the [[William Howard Taft]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] administrations achieved only a short respite each time. A political deadlock in 1914 was broken after an ultimatum by Wilson telling the Dominicans to choose a president or see the U.S. impose one. A provisional president was chosen, and later the same year relatively free elections put former president (1899–1902) [[Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra]] back in power. With his former [[Secretary of War]] [[Desiderio Arias]] maneuvering to depose him and despite a U.S. offer of military aid against Arias, Jimenes resigned on May 7, 1916. Wilson thus ordered the U.S. occupation of the .

[[File:USMC Fortaleza Ozama from river 1922 restored.jpg|thumb|The flag of the [[]] waving over [[Fortaleza Ozama|Ozama Fortress]] during the U.S. occupation of the , {{Circa|1922}}]]
U.S. Marines landed on May 16, 1916, and seized the capital and other ports, while General Arias fell back to his inland Santiago stronghold.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=49}} A significant weaponry disparity led to Arias's defeat as his forces tried to block the Marines' advance on Santiago with trenches and black-powder rifles. The clashes with the U.S. Marines marked the first time the Dominicans had ever encountered a machine gun.{{sfn|Musicant|1990|p=252}} A peace delegation from Santiago surrendered the city on July 5, coinciding with General Arias' surrender to the  governor. The military government established by the U.S. under the Navy and Marine Corps on November 29, led by Vice Admiral [[Harry Shepard Knapp]], was widely repudiated by the Dominicans, but organized resistance ceased.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=52}}

The occupation regime kept most  laws and institutions and largely pacified the general population. The occupying government also revived the  economy, reduced the nation's debt, built a road network that at last interconnected all regions of the country, and created a professional National Guard to replace the warring partisan units. Additionally, with grass-roots support from local communities and assistance from both  and US officials, the  education system expanded significantly during US occupation. Between 1918 and 1920, more than three hundred schools were established nationwide. The system of forced labour used by the [[ occupation of |Marines in ]] was largely absent in the .{{sfn|Gleijeses|1978|p=17}}

The U.S. government's rule ended in October 1922, and elections were held in March 1924. The victor was former president (1902–03) [[Horacio Vásquez]]. He was inaugurated on July 13, 1924, and the last U.S. forces left in September.{{sfn|Musicant|1990|p=284}} In 1930, General [[Rafael Trujillo]], who was trained by the U.S. Marines during the occupation, seized power following a military revolt against the government of Vásquez.

Trujillo consolidated his power after [[Hurricane San Zenón]] devastated Santo Domingo in September 1930, killing 8,000 people. A few of the former caudillos initially opposed the new dictator. General Cipriano Bencosme led an uprising but was defeated and killed in November 1930 during a confrontation with the army near Puerto Plata. General Desiderio Arias was also unsuccessful, dying in combat near [[Mao, |Mao]] in June of the following year.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1978|p=22}}

===Trujillo Era (1930–1961)===
[[File:Rafael L. Trujillo en la silla presidencial (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rafael Trujillo]] imposed a dictatorship of 31 years (1930–1961).]]
There was considerable economic growth during [[Rafael Trujillo]]'s long and iron-fisted regime, although a great deal of the wealth was taken by the dictator and other regime elements. There was progress in healthcare, education, and transportation, with the building of hospitals, clinics, schools, roads, and harbors. Trujillo also carried out an important housing construction program and instituted a pension plan. He finally negotiated an undisputed border with  in 1935, and achieved the end of the 50-year customs agreement in 1941, well before it would have expired in 1956. He made the country debt-free in 1947. This was accompanied most noticeably by absolute repression and the copious use of murder, torture, and terrorist methods against the opposition.

Several Dominicans were assassinated in [[New York City]] after taking part in anti-Trujillo activities. In October 1937,  troops murdered 10,000 to 15,000  men, women, and children—mostly with machetes—along the - border under the orders of Trujillo.

During [[World War II]], Trujillo symbolically sided with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. During the course of the war,  U-boats torpedoed and sank two  merchant vessels—the ''San Rafael'' off the coast of , and the ''[[SS Presidente Trujillo|Presidente Trujillo]]'' off [[Fort-de-]]—along with four other -manned ships in the Caribbean. The country did not make a military contribution to the war, but  sugar and other agricultural products supported the Allied war effort, and the  also accepted Jewish refugees [[Évian Conference|fleeing Nazi persecution]].

The arsenal at [[San Cristóbal Province|San Cristóbal]], operated under Trujillo's regime, produced rifles, machine guns, and ammunition.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=175}} Trujillo also formed a Foreign Legion of 3,000 mercenaries to attempt to overthrow [[Fidel Castro]] in . Major [[William Alexander Morgan|William Morgan]] agreed to lead the attack for $1 million, but Castro learned of the plot and instructed Morgan to go along with it and report back. Trujillo was tricked into believing that Morgan had captured [[Trinidad, |Trinidad]]. On August 13, 1959, a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] transport flying from the  carrying military advisors and supplies landed at Trinidad airport. Castro seized the aircraft and the ten occupants and arrested some 4,000 suspects throughout .{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=240}} Earlier in June,  soldiers and -trained  guerrillas attempted an unsuccessful invasion of the . Between 1946 and 1949, the  government purchased military aircraft and warships from the British government, which were used to defeat the invasion by air and sea.

On November 25, 1960, Trujillo's henchmen killed three of the four [[Mirabal sisters]], nicknamed ''Las Mariposas'' (The Butterflies). Along with their husbands, the sisters were conspiring to overthrow Trujillo in a violent revolt. The [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]] is observed on the anniversary of their deaths.

[[File:1960. Junio, 24. Atentado a Rómulo Betancourt en Los Próceres.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of the June 24, 1960, assassination attempt.]]
For a long time, the U.S. and the  elite supported the Trujillo government. This support persisted despite the assassinations of political opposition, the [[parsley massacre|massacre of Haitians]], and Trujillo's plots against other countries. The U.S. finally broke with Trujillo in 1960, after Trujillo's agents attempted to assassinate the  president [[Rómulo Betancourt]] with a car bomb, as he was a fierce critic of Trujillo. The assassination attempt in [[Caracas]] wounded the  president and his Minister of Defense, and killed an air force colonel and a policeman. During Betancourt's earlier exile in , Trujillo's agents attempted to inject poison into him on a Havana street in broad daylight.

[[File:KMO 157030 03580 1 t236 204404.jpg|thumb|Trujillo's car following the May 30, 1961, assassination.]]
After its representatives confirmed Trujillo's complicity in the nearly successful assassination attempt, the [[Organization of  States]] (OAS), for the first time in its history, decreed sanctions against a member state.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1978|p=28}} The OAS voted unanimously to condemn the  for its aggression and imposed an arms embargo.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=256}} The  severed diplomatic relations with the  on August 26, 1960, and in January 1961 suspended the export of trucks, parts, crude oil, gasoline and other petroleum products. U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] also took advantage of OAS sanctions to drastically cut purchases of  sugar, the country's major export. This action ultimately cost the  almost $22,000,000 in lost revenues at a time when its economy was in a rapid decline. Trujillo had become expendable, and dissidents inside the  argued that assassination was the only certain way to remove him.

On May 30, 1961, Trujillo was shot and killed by  dissidents during a car chase.

On May 31, 1961, the following day,  arrested several individuals plotting to overthrow the government, armed with weapons traced to the .{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=257}}

===Post-Trujillo (1961–1996)===
[[File:Juan Bosch (1963).jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]], the first democratically elected president after Trujillo]] After the assassination, [[Ramfis Trujillo]], the dictator's son, remained in de facto control of the government for the next 6 months, as commander of the armed forces. Trujillo's brothers, Hector Bienvenido and Jose Arismendi Trujillo, returned to the country and plotted against President Balaguer. On November 18, 1961, as a planned coup became more evident, U.S. Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] issued a warning that the US would not "remain idle" if the Trujillos attempted to "reassert dictatorial domination". Following this warning, and the arrival of a 14-vessel U.S. naval task force within sight of Santo Domingo, Ramfis and his uncles fled the country on November 19. The OAS lifted its sanctions on January 4, 1962.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1978|p=62}}

In February 1963, a democratically elected government under leftist [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] took office but it was overthrown by a military coup in September. On April 24, 1965, a second military coup ousted the military-installed president [[Donald Reid Cabral]].{{sfn|Musicant|1990|p=363}} Despite tank assaults, [[strafing]], and aerial bombardment by the opposing Loyalists, the pro-Bosch Constitutionalists maintained control of most of the capital. By April 26, 5,000 armed civilians outnumbered the 1,500 original rebel military regulars. Radio Santo Domingo, now fully under rebel control, began to call for more violent actions and the killing of all police officers.

On April 28, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] deployed U.S. Marines from [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] to Santo Domingo to protect  citizens, with U.S. forces subsequently expanded to 24,000 troops. On April 30, two battalions of the [[82nd Airborne Division]] landed at [[San Isidro Air Base|San Isidro airfield]]. Hours later, U.S. troops crossed the Duarte Bridge to link up with Loyalists, who were to secure a corridor for the Marines guarding the U.S. Embassy. However, the Loyalists withdrew to San Isidro airfield instead.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=276}} On May 2, U.S. forces were authorized to link up, and the outgunned Constitutionalists retreated to the southeastern part of the city. A ceasefire was declared on May 5. The following day, U.S. diplomats persuaded the OAS to establish an [[Inter- Peace Force]] to support  troops. The following countries volunteered:  (1,250 soldiers),  (25 police),  (250 soldiers),  (164 soldiers), and  (286 soldiers).{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=277}}

U.S. and OAS peacekeeping troops remained in the country for over a year and left after supervising elections in 1966 won by [[Joaquín Balaguer]]. He had been Trujillo's last puppet-president. Balaguer remained in power as president for 12 years. His tenure was a period of repression of human rights and civil liberties. His rule was criticized for a growing disparity between rich and poor. It was, however, praised for an ambitious infrastructure program, which included construction of large housing projects, sports complexes, theaters, museums, aqueducts, roads, highways, and the massive [[Columbus Lighthouse]], completed in 1992 during a later tenure.

In 1978, Balaguer was succeeded to the presidency by opposition candidate [[Antonio Guzmán Fernández]], of the [[ Revolutionary Party]] (PRD). [[Hurricane David]] hit the  in August 1979, which left upwards of 2,000 people dead and 200,000 homeless. The hurricane caused over $1 billion in damage. Another PRD win in 1982 followed, under [[Salvador Jorge Blanco]]. Balaguer regained the presidency in 1986 and was re-elected in 1990 and 1994, in the latter defeating PRD candidate [[José Francisco Peña Gómez]], a former mayor of Santo Domingo.<!--some info needs to be added about Balaguer's performance 1986-96--> The 1994 elections were flawed, bringing international pressure, to which Balaguer responded by scheduling another presidential contest in 1996. Balaguer was not a candidate. The PSRC candidate was his Vice President [[Jacinto Peynado Garrigosa]].

===1996–present===
In 1996, with the support of Joaquín Balaguer and the Social Christian Reform Party in a coalition called the Patriotic Front, [[Leonel Fernández]] achieved the first-ever win for the [[ Liberation Party]] (PLD), which Bosch had founded in 1973 after leaving the PRD. Fernández oversaw a fast-growing economy: growth averaged 7.7% per year, unemployment fell, and exchange and inflation rates were stable.

[[File:Protestas dominicanas en Santo Domingo 2020.jpg|thumb|[[2020  protests]] in Plaza de La Bandera, Santo Domingo]]
In 2000, the PRD's [[Hipólito Mejía]] won the election. This was a time of economic troubles. Under Mejía, the  participated in the US-led coalition, as part of the Multinational [[Plus Ultra Brigade]], during the 2003 [[ War|invasion of ]], suffering no casualties. In 2008, Fernández was elected for a third term. Fernández and the PLD are credited with initiatives that moved the country forward technologically. His administrations were accused of corruption.

[[Danilo Medina]] of the PLD was elected president in 2012 and re-elected in 2016. A significant increase in crime, government corruption and a weak justice system threatened to overshadow their administrative period. He was succeeded by the opposition candidate [[Luis Abinader]] in the [[2020  general election|2020 election]] (weeks after [[2020  protests|protests erupted in the country]] against Medina's government), marking the end to 16 years in power of the centre-left  Liberation Party (PLD). In May 2024, President Luis Abinader won a second term in the [[2024  general election|elections]]. His tough policies towards migration from neighbouring  was popular among voters.
