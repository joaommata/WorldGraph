Evidence exists of human habitation in the area now known as  from about 15,000 years ago. Tools have been found on the high [[fluvial terrace|riverine terrace]]s of the [[Pedregal River|Rio Pedregal]] in western .{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|p=91}} [[Late Pleistocene]] hunting artifacts, including spear tips, have been found at a similar series of sites in northwestern ; according to [[radiocarbon dating]], these date from 13,000 to 7,000 BC.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|p=172}}

It is unknown how many people lived in  before the  conquest; it has been estimated at one million.{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}} In addition to Indigenous peoples known today, the population included groups such as the [[Kalina people|Kalina]] (Caribs), [[Auaké people|Auaké]], [[Caquetio]], [[Mariche]], and [[Timoto–Cuica people|Timoto–Cuicas]]. The Timoto–Cuica culture was the most complex society in Pre-Columbian , with pre-planned permanent villages, surrounded by irrigated, terraced fields.{{sfn|Mahoney|p=89}} Their houses were made of stone and wood with thatched roofs. They were peaceful and depended on growing crops. Regional crops included potatoes and [[ulluco]]s. They left behind art, particularly anthropomorphic ceramics, but no major monuments. They spun vegetable fibers to weave into textiles and mats for housing. They are credited with having invented the [[arepa]], a staple in [[ cuisine]].{{sfn|Salas|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6-1QnKS6xG4C&pg=PA142 142]}}

After the conquest, the population dropped markedly, mainly through the spread of infectious diseases from Europe.{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}} Two main north–south axes of pre-Columbian population were present, who cultivated maize in the west and [[manioc]] in the east.{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}} Large parts of the ''[[llanos]]'' were cultivated through a combination of [[slash and burn]] and permanent settled agriculture.{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}}

In 1498, during his third voyage to the Americas, [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed near the [[Orinoco Delta]] and landed in the [[Gulf of Paria]].{{sfn|Dickey|1892|p=103}} Amazed by the great offshore current of freshwater which deflected his course eastward, Columbus expressed in a letter to Isabella and Ferdinand that he must have reached Heaven on Earth (terrestrial paradise):
{{blockquote|Great signs are these of the Terrestrial Paradise... for I have never read or heard of such a large quantity of fresh water being inside and in such close proximity to salt water; the very mild temperateness also corroborates this; and if the water of which I speak does not proceed from Paradise then it is an even greater marvel, because I do not believe such a large and deep river has ever been known to exist in this world.{{sfn|Zamora|1993|loc=Voyage to Paradise}}}}

[[ colonization of the Americas|'s colonization of mainland ]] started in 1522, establishing its first permanent South  settlement in the {{As of |2008 |alt=present-day}} city of [[Cumaná]].

====  colonization ====
In the 16th century, the king of  granted a concession to the  [[Welser family]]. [[Klein-Venedig]]{{Refn|"Little Venice"; additionally the etymology of the name ""}} became the most extensive initiative in the [[ colonization of the Americas]] from 1528 to 1546. The Welsers were bankers to the Habsburgs and financiers of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]], who was King of  and had borrowed heavily from them to pay bribes for his [[Imperial election, 1519|Imperial election]].

In 1528, Charles V granted the Welsers the right to explore, rule and colonize the territory, as well as to seek the mythical golden town of [[El Dorado]]. The first expedition was led by [[Ambrosius Ehinger]], who established [[Maracaibo]] in 1529. After the deaths of first Ehinger (1533), then [[Nikolaus Federmann]], and [[Georg von Speyer]] (1540), [[Philipp von Hutten]] persisted in exploring the interior. In absence of von Hutten from the capital of the province, the crown of  claimed the right to appoint a governor. 

On Hutten's return to the capital, [[Santa Ana de Coro]], in 1546, the  governor [[Juan de Carvajal]] had Hutten and [[Bartholomeus VI. Welser]] executed. Subsequently, [[Emperor Charles V|Charles V]] revoked Welser's concession. The Welsers transported  miners to the colony, in addition to 4,000 African [[slaves]] to plant [[sugar cane]] plantations. Many  colonists died from tropical diseases, to which they had no [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]], or through wars with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous inhabitants]].

=== Late 15th century to early 17th century ===
Native ''[[cacique]]s'' (leaders) such as [[Guaicaipuro]] ({{circa|1530–1568}}) and [[Tamanaco]] (died 1573) attempted to resist  incursions, but the newcomers ultimately subdued them.

In the 16th century, during the  colonization, indigenous peoples such as the [[Mariches]], themselves descendants of the Kalina, were converted to [[Roman Catholicism]]. Some resisting tribes or leaders are commemorated in place names, including Caracas, [[Chacao Municipality|Chacao]] and [[Los Teques]]. The early colonial settlements focused on the northern coast,{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}} but in the mid-18th century, the  pushed farther inland along the [[Orinoco River]]. Here, the [[Ye'kuana]] organized resistance in 1775–76.{{sfn|Gott|2005|p=203}}

's eastern  settlements were incorporated into [[New Andalusia Province]]. Administered by the [[Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo]] from the early 16th century, most of  became part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] in the early 18th century, and was then reorganized as an autonomous [[Captaincy General of |Captaincy General]] starting in 1777. Caracas, founded in the central coastal region in 1567, was well-placed to become a key location, being near the coastal port of [[La Guaira]] and in a valley, in a mountain range, providing defensive strength against [[pirate]]s and a more fertile and healthy climate.{{sfn|Ewell|1984|p=4}}

=== Independence and 19th century ===
{{Main| War of Independence}}

After unsuccessful uprisings, , under the leadership of [[Francisco de Miranda]], a  marshal who had fought in the [[ Revolution|]] and [[ Revolution]]s, [[ Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] as the [[First Republic of ]] on 5 July 1811. This began the [[ War of Independence]]. A devastating [[1812 Caracas earthquake]], together with the rebellion of the  ''[[llanero]]s'', helped bring down the republic.{{sfn|Chasteen|2001|p=103}} [[Simón Bolívar]], new leader of the independentist forces, launched his [[Admirable Campaign]] in 1813 from [[United Provinces of New Granada|New Granada]], retaking most of the territory and being proclaimed as ''El Libertador'' ("The Liberator"). A [[Second Republic of ]] was proclaimed on 7 August 1813, but lasted only a few months before being crushed by [[Royalist (  independence)|royalist]] caudillo [[José Tomás Boves]] and his personal army of ''llaneros''.

The end of the [[Peninsular War| invasion]] of homeland  in 1814 allowed a large expeditionary force to come under general [[Pablo Morillo]], with the goal to regain the lost territory in  and New Granada. As the war reached a stalemate on 1817, Bolívar reestablished the [[Third Republic of ]] on the territory still controlled by the patriots, mainly in the [[Guayana Province|Guayana]] and [[Llanos]] regions. This republic was short-lived as only two years later, during the [[Congress of Angostura]] of 1819, the union of  with New Granada was decreed to form the Republic of .{{sfn|Gregory|1992|pp=89–90}} 

The war continued until full victory and sovereignty was attained after the [[Battle of Carabobo]] on 24 June 1821.{{sfn|Gregory|1992|pp=89–90}} On 24 July 1823, [[José Prudencio Padilla]] and [[Rafael Urdaneta]] helped seal  independence with their victory in the [[Battle of Lake Maracaibo]]. New Granada's congress gave Bolívar control of the Granadian army; leading it, he liberated several countries and founded the Republic of  ([[Gran ]]).{{sfn|Gregory|1992|pp=89–90}}

Sucre went on to liberate [[]] and become the second president of [[]].  remained part of Gran  until 1830, when a rebellion led by [[José Antonio Páez]] allowed the proclamation of a newly independent , on 22 September; Páez became the first president of the new [[State of ]]. Between one-quarter and one-third of 's population was lost during these two decades of war (including about half the [[Venezuelans of European descent]]), which by 1830, was estimated at 800,000. In the [[Flag of ]], the yellow stands for land wealth, the blue for the sea that separates  from , and the red for the blood shed by the heroes of independence.

[[Slavery]] in  was abolished in 1854. Much of 's 19th-century history was characterized by political turmoil and dictatorial rule, including the Independence leader José Antonio Páez, who gained the presidency three times and served 11 years between 1830 and 1863. This culminated in the [[Federal War]] (1859–63). In the latter half of the century, [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]], another ''caudillo'', served 13 years, between 1870 and 1887, with three other presidents interspersed.

[[File:Martin Tovar y Tovar 02.jpg|thumb|The signing of 's independence, by [[Martín Tovar y Tovar]]]]
In 1895, a longstanding dispute with Great Britain about the Essequibo territory, which Britain claimed as part of [[British Guiana]] and  saw as  territory, erupted into the [[ Crisis of 1895]]. The dispute became a diplomatic crisis when 's lobbyist, [[William Lindsay Scruggs|William L. Scruggs]], sought to argue that British behavior over the issue violated the [[]]' [[Monroe Doctrine]] of 1823, and used his influence in Washington, D.C., to pursue the matter. Then, U.S. president [[Grover Cleveland]] adopted a broad interpretation of the doctrine that declared an  interest in any matter within the hemisphere.{{sfn|Zakaria|1999|pp=145–146}} Britain ultimately accepted arbitration, but in negotiations over its terms was able to persuade the U.S. on many details. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the issue and in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British Guiana.

In 1899, [[Cipriano Castro]], assisted by his friend [[Juan Vicente Gómez]], seized power in Caracas. Castro defaulted on 's considerable foreign debts and declined to pay compensation to foreigners caught up in 's [[ civil wars|civil wars]]. This led to the [[ Crisis of 1902–1903]], in which Britain,  and  imposed a naval blockade before international arbitration at the new [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] was agreed. In 1908, [[- War|another dispute]] broke out with the , which was resolved when Castro left for medical treatment in  and was promptly overthrown by [[Juan Vicente Gómez]] (1908–35).

=== 20th century ===
[[File:Rómulo Betancourt, 1961.jpg|thumb|[[Rómulo Betancourt]] (president; 1945–1948, 1959–1964), one of the major democratic leaders of ]]
The discovery of massive [[oil field|oil deposits]] in Lake Maracaibo during World War I proved pivotal for  and transformed its economy from a heavy dependence on agricultural exports. It prompted a boom that lasted into the 1980s; by 1935, 's per capita gross domestic product was Latin America's highest.{{sfn|Crow|1980|pp=616–617}} Gómez benefited handsomely from this, as corruption thrived, but at the same time, the new source of income helped him centralize the state and develop its authority.

Gómez remained the most powerful man in  until his death in 1935. The ''gomecista'' dictatorship (1935–1945) system largely continued under [[Eleazar López Contreras]], but from 1941, under [[Isaías Medina Angarita]], was relaxed. Angarita granted a range of reforms, including the legalization of all political parties. After World War II, immigration from Southern Europe and poorer Latin  countries markedly diversified  society.

In 1945, a civilian-military coup overthrew Medina Angarita and ushered in [[El Trienio Adeco|a period of democratic rule]] (1945–1948) under the mass membership party [[Democratic Action ()|Democratic Action]], initially under [[Rómulo Betancourt]], until [[Rómulo Gallegos]] won the [[1947  presidential election]] (the first free and fair elections in ). Gallegos governed until overthrown by a military junta led by the triumvirate {{Interlanguage link|Luis Felipe Llovera Páez|es|Luis Llovera Páez}}, [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]], and Gallegos' Defense Minister, [[Carlos Delgado Chalbaud]], in the [[1948  coup d'état|1948  ''coup d'état'']].

[[File:Carlos Andrés Pérez.jpg|thumb|upright|President [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] was [[impeached]] on corruption charges in 1993.]]
The most powerful man in the military ''junta'' (1948–58) was Pérez Jiménez and he was suspected of being behind the death of Chalbaud, who died in a bungled kidnapping in 1950. When the junta unexpectedly lost the [[1952  presidential election|1952 presidential election]], it ignored the results and Jiménez was installed as president.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}} Jiménez was forced out on 23 January 1958. In an effort to consolidate a young democracy, the three major political parties ([[Acción Democrática]] (AD), [[COPEI]] and [[Unión Republicana Democrática]] (URD), with the notable exception of the [[Communist Party of ]]), signed the [[Puntofijo Pact]] power-sharing agreement. AD and COPEI dominated the political landscape for four decades.

During the presidencies of [[Rómulo Betancourt]] (1959–64, his second term) and [[Raúl Leoni]] (1964–69), substantial guerilla movements occurred. Most laid down their arms under [[Rafael Caldera]]'s first presidency (1969–74). Caldera had won the [[1968  presidential election|1968 election]] for COPEI, the first time a party other than Democratic Action took the presidency through a democratic election. The new democratic order had its antagonists. Betancourt [[Assassination attempt of Rómulo Betancourt|suffered an attack]] planned by the  dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] in 1960, and the leftists excluded from the Pact initiated an insurgency by organizing themselves into the Armed Forces of National Liberation, sponsored by the Communist Party and [[Fidel Castro]]. In 1962 they tried to destabilize the military corps, with failed revolts. Betancourt promoted a foreign policy, the [[Betancourt Doctrine]], in which he only recognized elected governments by popular vote.{{Request quotation|date=April 2018}}

The [[1973  presidential election]] of [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] coincided with an [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], in which 's income exploded as [[oil prices]] soared; oil industries were nationalized in 1976. This led to massive increases in public spending, but also increases in external debts, until the collapse of oil prices during the 1980s crippled the economy. As the government started to devalue the currency in 1983 to face its financial obligations, standards of living fell dramatically. Failed economic policies and increasing corruption in government led to rising poverty and crime, worsening social indicators, and increased political instability.

In the 1980s, the Presidential Commission for State Reform (COPRE) emerged as a mechanism of political innovation.  decentralized its political system and diversified its economy, reducing the size of the state. COPRE operated as an innovation mechanism, also by incorporating issues into the political agenda, that were excluded from public deliberation by the main actors of the democratic system. The most discussed topics were incorporated into the public agenda: decentralization, political participation, municipalization, judicial order reforms and the role of the state in a new economic strategy. The social reality made the changes difficult to apply.

Economic crises in the 1980s and 1990s led to a political crisis. Hundreds of people were killed by security forces and the military in the ''[[Caracazo]]'' riots of 1989, during the second presidential term of Carlos Andrés Pérez (1989–1993) and after the implementation of economic austerity measures. [[Hugo Chávez]], who in 1982 had promised to depose the bipartisanship governments, used the growing anger at economic austerity measures to justify a [[1992  coup d'état attempts|coup attempt in February 1992]]; a [[November 1992  coup attempt|second coup d'état attempt occurred in November]]. 

President Carlos Andrés Pérez (re-elected in 1988) was impeached under embezzlement charges in 1993, leading to the interim presidency of [[Ramón José Velásquez]] (1993–1994). Coup leader Chávez [[Rafael Caldera#Amnesty to the 1992 coup participants|was pardoned in March 1994]] by president Rafael Caldera (1994–1999, his second term), with a clean slate and his political rights reinstated, allowing Chávez to win and maintain the presidency continuously from 1999 until his death in 2013. Chávez won the elections of 1998, 2000, 2006 and 2012 and the presidential referendum of 2004.

=== Bolivarian government under Chávez: 1999–2013 ===
{{main|Bolivarian Revolution|History of  (1999–present)}}

[[File:Chavez Kirch Lula141597.jpg|thumb|[[Hugo Chávez]] with fellow leftist South  presidents [[Néstor Kirchner]] of  and [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]] of ]]
A collapse in confidence in the existing parties led to [[Hugo Chávez]] being elected president in 1998 and the subsequent launch of a "Bolivarian Revolution", beginning with a 1999 [[constituent assembly]] to write a new Constitution. The Revolution refers to a [[left-wing populism]] [[social movement]] and political process led by Chávez, who founded the [[Fifth Republic Movement]] in 1997 and the [[United Socialist Party of ]] in 2007. The "Bolivarian Revolution" is named after [[Simón Bolívar]]. 

According to Chávez and other supporters, the "Bolivarian Revolution" sought to build a mass movement to implement [[Bolivarianism]]—[[popular democracy]], economic independence, equitable distribution of revenues, and an end to political corruption. They interpret Bolívar's ideas from a [[populism|populist]] perspective, using [[Socialism|socialist]] rhetoric. This led to formation of the '''Fifth Republic of ''', commonly known as the '''Bolivarian Republic of ''', that continues to the present day.  has been considered the Bolivarian Republic following the adoption of the new [[Constitution of |Constitution of 1999]]. 

Following Chávez's election,  developed into a [[dominant-party system]], dominated by the [[United Socialist Party of ]]. In April 2002, Chávez was briefly ousted from power in the [[2002  coup d'état attempt]] following popular demonstrations by his opponents, but Chavez returned after two days as a result of demonstrations by poor Chávez supporters and actions by the military.{{sfn|Cannon|2004|p=295}}{{sfn|López Maya|2005|p=16}} Chávez remained in power after an all-out national strike that lasted [[ general strike of 2002–2003|from December 2002 to February 2003]], including a strike/lockout in the state oil company [[PDVSA]]. 

[[Capital flight]] before and during the strike led to the reimposition of [[Foreign exchange controls|currency control]]s. In the subsequent decade, the government was forced into currency devaluations. These devaluations did not improve the situation{{Vague|date=August 2024}} of the people who rely on imported products or locally produced products that depend on imported inputs, while dollar-denominated oil sales account for the majority of exports. The profits of the oil industry were lost to "social engineering" and corruption, instead of investments needed to maintain oil production.

Chávez survived further political tests, including an [[2004  recall referendum|August 2004 recall referendum]]. He was elected for another term [[2006  presidential election|in December 2006]] and for a third term in October 2012. However, he was never sworn in due to medical complications; he died in March 2013.

=== Bolivarian government under Maduro: 2013–present ===
{{main|Presidency of Nicolás Maduro}}
{{further|Crisis in }}
The presidential election that took place in April 2013, was the first since Chávez took office in 1999 in which his name did not appear on the ballot.{{Self-published inline|date=October 2022}}
Under the Bolivarian government,  went from being one of the richest countries in Latin America to one of the poorest. [[Economic policy of the Hugo Chávez administration|Hugo Chávez's socioeconomic policies]] of relying on oil sales and importing goods resulted in large amounts of debt, no change to [[corruption in ]] and culminated into a [[crisis in ]]. As a result, the [[ refugee crisis]], the largest emigration of people in Latin America's history, occurred, with over 7 million – about 20% of the country's population – emigrating. Chávez initiated [[Bolivarian missions]], programs aimed at helping the poor.

[[File:Dilma Rousseff receiving a Hugo Chávez picture from Nicolás Maduro.jpg|thumb|[[Nicolás Maduro]] with  President [[Dilma Rousseff]], 9 May 2013]]
Poverty began to increase into the 2010s. [[Nicolás Maduro]] was picked by Chavez as his successor, appointing him vice president in 2013.

Maduro has been [[president of ]] since 14 April 2013, when he won the [[2013  presidential election|presidential election]] after Chavez' death, with 51% of the vote, against [[Henrique Capriles]] on 49%. The [[Democratic Unity Roundtable]] contested Maduro's election as fraud, but an audit of 56% of the vote showed no discrepancies, and the [[Supreme Court of ]] ruled Maduro was the legitimate president. Opposition leaders and some international media consider Maduro's government a dictatorship. 

Since February 2014, hundreds of thousands have protested over high levels of criminal violence, corruption, hyperinflation, and chronic scarcity of basic goods due to government policies. Demonstrations and riots have resulted in over 40 fatalities in the unrest between Chavistas and opposition protesters and opposition leaders, including [[Leopoldo López]] and [[Antonio Ledezma]] were arrested. Human rights groups condemned the arrest of López. In the [[2015  parliamentary election]], the opposition gained a majority.
[[File:We Are Millions march .jpg|right|thumb|[[2017  protests]]]]
 devalued its currency in February 2013 due to rising shortages, [[shortages in |which included]] milk and other necessities. This led to an increase in malnutrition, especially among children. The economy had become dependent on the exportation of oil, with crude accounting for 86% of exports, and a high price per barrel to support social programs. Beginning in 2014 the [[price of oil]] plummeted from over $100 to $40. This placed pressure on the economy, which was no longer able to afford vast social programs. The Government began taking more money from [[PDVSA]], the state oil company, resulting in a lack of reinvestment in fields and employees. Production decreased from its height of nearly {{convert|3|to|1|e6oilbbl|e3m3|abbr=off|lk=on}} per day. 

In 2014,  entered a [[recession]], and in 2015, had the world's highest inflation, surpassing 100%. In 2017, [[Donald Trump]]'s administration imposed more [[economic sanctions]] against PDVSA and  officials. Economic problems, as well as crime, were the causes of the [[ protests (2014–present)|2014–present  protests]]. Since 2014, roughly 5.6 million people have [[ refugee crisis|fled ]].

In January 2016, Maduro decreed an "economic emergency", revealing the extent of the crisis and expanding his powers. In July 2016,  border crossings were temporarily opened to allow Venezuelans to purchase food and basic health items. In September 2016, a study indicated 15% of Venezuelans were eating "[[food waste]] discarded by commercial establishments". 200 prison riots had occurred by October 2016.

The Maduro-aligned [[Supreme Tribunal of Justice ()|Supreme Tribunal]], which had been overturning [[National Assembly ()|National Assembly]] decisions since the opposition took control, took over the functions of the assembly, creating the [[2017  constitutional crisis]]. In August 2017, the [[2017 Constituent National Assembly]] was elected and stripped the National Assembly of its powers.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} The election raised concerns of an emerging dictatorship. In December 2017, Maduro declared opposition parties barred from the following year's presidential vote after they boycotted mayoral polls.

Maduro won the [[2018  presidential election|2018 election]] with 68% of the vote. The result was challenged by , , , , , ,  and the US who deemed it fraudulent and recognized [[Juan Guaidó]] as president. Other countries continued to recognize Maduro, although , facing financial pressure over its position, began hedging by decreasing loans, cancelling joint ventures, and signaling willingness to work with all parties. In August 2019, Trump imposed an economic embargo against . In March 2020, Trump indicted Maduro and  officials, on charges of drug trafficking, [[narcoterrorism]], and corruption.

In June 2020, a report documented [[enforced disappearance]]s that occurred in 2018–19. 724 enforced disappearances of [[Political prisoner|political detainees]] were reported. The report stated that security forces subjected victims to [[Torture in |torture]]. The report stated the government used enforced disappearances to silence opponents and other critical voices.

[[Nicolás Maduro|Maduro]] ran for a third consecutive term in the [[2024  presidential election|2024 presidential election]], while former diplomat [[Edmundo González Urrutia]] represented the [[Unitary Platform]] ({{langx|es|Plataforma Unitaria Democrática}}; PUD), the main opposition political alliance. Polls conducted before the election indicated that González would win by a wide margin. After the government-controlled [[National Electoral Council ()|National Electoral Council]] (CNE) announced partial results showing a narrow Maduro victory on 29 July, [[International reactions to the 2024  presidential election|world leaders predominantly expressed skepticism of the claimed results]] and did not recognize the CNE claims with only some exceptions. 

Both González and Maduro proclaimed themselves winners of the election. The results of the election were not recognized by the [[Carter Center]] and [[Organization of  States]] due to the lack of granular results, and disputed by the opposition, which claimed a landslide victory and released access to vote tallies collected by [[poll watchers]] from a majority of polling centers as proof.

In the [[2024  presidential election#Aftermath|aftermath]] of the announcement of results by the election authorities, [[2024  protests|protests broke out across the country]].
