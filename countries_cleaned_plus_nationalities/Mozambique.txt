===Bantu migrations===
{{Further|Bantu expansion}}

[[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples migrated into  as early as the 4th century BC. It is believed between the 1st and 5th centuries AD, waves of migration from the west and north went through the [[Zambezi]] River valley and then gradually into the plateau and coastal areas of Southern Africa. They established agricultural communities or societies based on herding cattle. They brought with them the technology for smelting and smithing iron.

===Swahili Coast===

From the late first millennium AD, vast [[ Ocean trade]] networks extended as far south as present day [[Vilankulo]], as evidenced by the ancient port town of [[Chibuene]]. Beginning in the 9th century, a growing involvement in  Ocean trade led to the development of numerous port towns along the entire East African coast, including modern day . Largely autonomous, these towns broadly participated in the incipient [[Swahili culture]]. Islam was often adopted by urban elites, facilitating trade. In , [[Sofala]], [[Angoche]], and  Island were regional powers by the 15th century.

The towns traded with merchants from both the African interior and the broader  Ocean world. Particularly important were the gold and ivory caravan routes. Inland states like the [[Kingdom of ]] and [[Kingdom of Mutapa]] provided the coveted gold and ivory, which were then exchanged up the coast to larger port cities like [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] and [[Mombasa]].

The [[Island of ]], after which the country is named, is a small coral island at the mouth of Mossuril Bay on the [[Nacala]] coast of northern , and was first explored by Europeans in the late 15th century.

When  explorers reached  in 1498, Arab-trading settlements had existed along the coast and outlying islands for several centuries. From about 1500,  trading posts and forts displaced the Arabic commercial and military hegemony, becoming regular ports of call on the new European sea route to the east, the first steps in what was to become a process of colonisation.

The voyage of [[Vasco da Gama]] around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1498 marked the  entry into trade, politics, and society of the region. The  gained control of the Island of  and the port city of Sofala in the early 16th century, and by the 1530s, small groups of  traders and prospectors seeking gold penetrated the interior regions. Here they set up garrisons and trading posts at [[Sena, |Sena]] and [[Tete, |Tete]] on the Zambezi and tried to gain exclusive control over the gold trade.

In the central part of the  territory, the  attempted to legitimise and consolidate their trade and settlement positions through the creation of ''[[prazo]]s''. These land grants tied emigrants to their settlements, and inland  was largely left to be administered by ''prazeiros'', the grant holders, while central authorities in  concentrated their direct exercise of power on, in their view, the more important  possessions in Asia and the Americas. Slavery in  pre-dated European-contact. African rulers and chiefs dealt in enslaved people, first with Arab Muslim traders, who sent the enslaved to Middle East Asia cities and plantations, and later with  and other European traders. In a continuation of the trade, slaves were supplied by warring local African rulers, who raided enemy tribes and sold their captives to the ''prazeiros''. The authority of the ''prazeiros'' was exercised and upheld amongst the local population by armies of these enslaved men, whose members became known as ''[[Chikunda]]''. Continuing emigration from  occurred at comparatively low levels until late in the nineteenth century, promoting "Africanisation". While ''prazos'' were originally intended to be held solely by  colonists, through intermarriage and the relative isolation of ''prazeiros'' from ongoing  influences, the ''prazos'' became African- or African-.

Although  influence gradually expanded, its power was limited and exercised through individual settlers and officials who were granted extensive autonomy. The  were able to wrest much of the coastal trade from Arab Muslims between 1500 and 1700, but, with the Arab Muslim seizure of 's key foothold at [[Fort Jesus]] on [[Mombasa Island]] (now in ) in 1698, the pendulum began to swing in the other direction. As a result, investment lagged while [[Lisbon]] devoted itself to the more lucrative trade with  and the Far East and to the colonisation of .

The [[Mazrui]] and [[History of | Arabs]] reclaimed much of the  Ocean trade, forcing the  to retreat south. Many ''prazos'' had declined by the mid-19th century, but several of them survived. During the 19th century other European powers, particularly the British ([[British  Company]]) and the  (), became increasingly involved in the trade and politics of the region around the  East African territories.

By the early 20th century the  had shifted the administration of much of  to large private companies, like the [[ Company]], the [[Zambezia Company]] and the [[Niassa Company]], controlled and financed mostly by British financiers such as [[Solomon Joel]], which established railroad lines to their neighbouring colonies ( and [[Rhodesia]]). Although slavery had been legally abolished in , at the end of the 19th century the chartered companies enacted a forced labour policy and supplied cheap—often forced—African labour to the mines and [[plantation]]s of the nearby British colonies and . The Zambezia Company, the most profitable chartered company, took over several smaller ''prazeiro'' holdings and established military outposts to protect its property. The chartered companies built roads and ports to bring their goods to market including a railroad linking present-day  with the  port of [[Beira, |Beira]].

Due to their unsatisfactory performance and the shift, under the [[corporatist]] [[Estado Novo ()|''Estado Novo'']] regime of [[Oliveira Salazar]], toward stronger state control of the [[ Empire]]'s economy, the companies' concessions were not renewed when they ran out. This was what happened in 1942 with the  Company, which, however, continued to operate in the agricultural and commercial sectors as a corporation, and had already happened in 1929 with the termination of the Niassa Company's concession. In 1951, the  overseas colonies in Africa were rebranded as Overseas Provinces of .

The [[Mueda massacre]] of 16 June 1960 resulted in the death of [[Makonde people|Makonde]] protestors, which provoked the struggle of independence from  rule of .

=== War of Independence (1964–1975)===

As [[communism|communist]] and [[Decolonization|anti-colonial]] ideologies spread out across Africa, many clandestine political movements were established in support of  independence. These movements claimed that since policies and development plans were primarily designed by the ruling authorities for the benefit of 's  population, little attention was paid to 's tribal integration and the development of its native communities. According to the official guerrilla statements, this affected a majority of the indigenous population who suffered both state-sponsored discrimination and enormous social pressure. As a response to the guerrilla movement, the  government from the 1960s and principally the early 1970s initiated gradual changes with new socioeconomic developments and egalitarian policies.

The Front for the Liberation of  ([[FRELIMO]]) initiated a guerrilla campaign against  rule in September 1964. This conflict—along with the two others already initiated in the other  colonies of [[ |]] and [[ ]]—became part of the so-called [[ Colonial War]] (1961–1974). From a military standpoint, the  regular army maintained control of the population centres while the guerrilla forces sought to undermine their influence in rural and tribal areas in the north and west. As part of their response to FRELIMO, the  government began to pay more attention to creating favourable conditions for social development and economic growth.

=== Independence (1975) ===
FRELIMO took control of the territory after ten years of sporadic warfare, as well as 's own return to democracy after the fall of the authoritarian [[Estado Novo ()|''Estado Novo'']] regime in the [[Carnation Revolution]] of April 1974 and the failed [[coup of 25 November 1975]]. Within a year, most of the 250,000  in  had left—some expelled by the government of the nearly independent territory, some left the country to avoid possible reprisals from the unstable government—and  became independent from  on 25 June 1975. A law had been passed on the initiative of the relatively unknown [[Armando Guebuza]] of the FRELIMO party, ordering the  to leave the country in 24 hours with only {{convert|20|kg|lb|abbr=off}} of luggage. Unable to salvage any of their assets, most of them returned to  penniless.

=== Civil War (1977–1992)===
{{Main|People's Republic of | Civil War}}
[[File:Land mine victim 2 (4364914733).jpg|thumb|left|A land mine victim in ]]
The [[People's Republic of |new government]] under President [[Samora Machel]] established a [[one-party state]] based on [[Marxism|Marxist]] principles. It received diplomatic and some military support from [[]] and the [[Soviet Union]] and proceeded to crack down on opposition. Starting shortly after independence, the country was plagued from 1977 to 1992 by a long and violent civil war between the opposition forces of anti-communist  National Resistance ([[RENAMO]]) rebel militias and the FRELIMO regime. This conflict characterised the first decades of  independence, combined with sabotage from the neighbouring states of [[Rhodesia]] and , ineffective policies, failed central planning, and the resulting economic collapse. This period was also marked by the exodus of  nationals and Mozambicans of  heritage, a collapsed infrastructure, lack of investment in productive assets, and government nationalisation of privately owned industries, as well as widespread famine.

During most of the civil war, the FRELIMO-formed central government was unable to exercise effective control outside urban areas, many of which were cut off from the capital. RENAMO-controlled areas included up to 50% of the rural areas in several provinces, and it is reported that health services of any kind were isolated from assistance for years in those areas. The problem worsened when the government cut back spending on health care. The war was marked by mass human rights violations from both sides of the conflict, with both RENAMO and FRELIMO contributing to the chaos through the use of terror and indiscriminate targeting of civilians. The central government executed tens of thousands of people while trying to extend its control throughout the country and sent many people to "re-education camps" where thousands died.

[[File:RhodesiaAllies1975-en.svg|thumb|The geopolitical situation in 1975; nations friendly to the FRELIMO are shown in orange.]]
During the war, RENAMO proposed a peace agreement based on the secession of RENAMO-controlled northern and western territories as the independent ''Republic of Rombesia'', but FRELIMO refused, insisting on the undivided sovereignty of the entire country. An estimated one million Mozambicans perished during the civil war, 1.7&nbsp;million took refuge in neighbouring states, and several million more were internally displaced. The FRELIMO regime also gave shelter and support to  ([[African National Congress]]) and  ([[ African National Union]]) rebel movements, while the governments of Rhodesia and later Apartheid  backed RENAMO in the civil war. Between 300,000 and 600,000 people died of famine during the war.

On 19 October 1986, Machel was on his way back from an international meeting in  when his [[1986  Tupolev Tu-134 crash|plane crashed]] in the [[Lebombo Mountains]] near [[Mbuzini]] in . President Machel and thirty-three others died, including ministers and officials of the  government. The United Nations' Soviet delegation issued a minority report contending that their expertise and experience had been undermined by the South Africans. Representatives of the Soviet Union advanced the theory that the plane had been intentionally diverted by a false [[VHF omnidirectional range|navigational beacon]] signal, using a technology provided by military intelligence operatives of the  government.

Machel's successor [[Joaquim Chissano]] implemented sweeping changes in the country, starting reforms such as changing from Marxism to capitalism and began peace talks with RENAMO. The new constitution enacted in 1990 provided for a [[multi-party system|multi-party political system]], a [[market economy|market-based economy]], and free elections. That same year,  abolished the people's republic as the country's official name. The civil war ended in October 1992 with the [[Rome General Peace Accords]], first brokered by the Christian Council of  (Council of Protestant Churches) and then taken over by [[Community of Sant'Egidio]]. Peace returned to , under the supervision of the [[United Nations Operation in |peacekeeping force of the United Nations]].

===Democratic era (1993–present)===

 held elections in 1994, which were accepted by most political parties as free and fair although still contested by many nationals and observers alike. FRELIMO won, under Joaquim Chissano, while RENAMO, led by [[Afonso Dhlakama]], ran as the official opposition. In 1995,  joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], becoming, at the time, the only member nation that had never been part of the [[British Empire]].

By mid-1995, over 1.7&nbsp;million refugees who had sought asylum in neighbouring countries had returned to , part of the largest repatriation witnessed in sub-Saharan Africa. An additional four million [[internally displaced person]]s had returned to their homes. In December 1999,  held elections for a second time since the civil war, which were again won by FRELIMO. RENAMO accused FRELIMO of fraud and threatened to return to civil war but backed down after taking the matter to the Supreme Court and losing.

In early 2000, a cyclone caused [[2000  flood|widespread flooding]], killing hundreds and devastating the already precarious infrastructure. There were widespread suspicions that foreign aid resources had been diverted by powerful leaders of FRELIMO. [[Carlos Cardoso (journalist)|Carlos Cardoso]], a journalist investigating these allegations, was murdered, and his death was never satisfactorily explained.

Indicating in 2001 that he would not run for a third term, Chissano criticised leaders who stayed on longer than he had, which was generally seen as a reference to  President [[Frederick Chiluba]] and  President [[Robert Mugabe]]. Presidential and National Assembly elections took place on 1–2 December 2004. FRELIMO candidate [[Armando Guebuza]] won with 64% of the popular vote, and Dhlakama received 32% of the popular vote. FRELIMO won 160 seats in Parliament, with a coalition of RENAMO and several small parties winning the 90 remaining seats. Guebuza was inaugurated as the President of  on 2 February 2005 and served two five-year terms. His successor, [[Filipe Nyusi]], became the fourth President of  on 15 January 2015.

From 2013 to 2019, a low-intensity [[RENAMO insurgency (2013–2021)|insurgency by RENAMO]] occurred, mainly in the country's central and northern regions. On 5 September 2014, Guebuza and Dhlakama signed the Accord on Cessation of Hostilities, which brought the military hostilities to a halt and allowed both parties to concentrate on the general elections to be held in October 2014. However, after the general elections, a new political crisis emerged. RENAMO did not recognise the validity of the election results and demanded the control of six provinces – Nampula, Niassa, Tete, Zambezia, Sofala, and Manica – where they claimed to have won a majority. About 12,000 refugees fled to [[]]. The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders]], and [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that government forces had torched villages and carried out [[summary execution]]s and [[Wartime sexual violence|sexual abuses]].

In October 2019, President Filipe Nyusi was re-elected after a landslide victory in [[2019  general election|general election]]. FRELIMO won 184 seats, RENAMO got 60 seats and the MDM party received the remaining 6 seats in the National Assembly. Opposition did not accept the results because of allegations of fraud and irregularities. FRELIMO secured two-thirds majority in parliament which allowed FRELIMO to re-adjust the constitution without needing the agreement of the opposition.

Since 2017, the country has faced an [[Insurgency in Cabo Delgado|ongoing insurgency by Islamist groups]]. In September 2020, [[Islamic State|ISIL]] insurgents captured and briefly occupied [[Vamizi Island]] in the  Ocean. In March 2021, dozens of civilians were killed and 35,000 others were displaced after [[Battle of Palma|Islamist rebels seized]] the city of [[Palma, |Palma]]. In December 2021, nearly 4,000 Mozambicans fled their villages after an intensification of jihadist attacks in [[Niassa Province|Niassa]].
