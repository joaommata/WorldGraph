 was first settled by Micronesians at least 3,000 years ago, and there is evidence of possible [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] influence. Comparatively little is known of  prehistory, although the island is believed to have had a long period of isolation, which accounts for the distinct language that developed among the inhabitants. There were traditionally twelve clans or tribes on , which are represented in the twelve-pointed star on the [[flag of |country's flag]]. Traditionally, [[Nauruans]] traced their descent [[Matrilineality|matrilineally]]. Inhabitants practised [[aquaculture]]: they caught juvenile [[milkfish]] (known as ''ibija'' in [[ language|]]), [[acclimatization|acclimatised]] them to freshwater, and raised them in [[Buada Lagoon]], providing a reliable food source. The other locally grown components of their diet included [[coconut]]s and [[pandanus tectorius|pandanus fruit]]. The name "" may derive from the  word ''{{lang|na|Anáoero}}'', which means 'I go to the beach.'

In 1798, the [[British people|British]] sea captain [[John Fearn (whaler)|John Fearn]], on his trading ship ''Hunter'' (300 tons), became the first Westerner to report sighting , calling it "Pleasant Island" because of its attractive appearance. From at least 1826, Nauruans had regular contact with Europeans on whaling and trading ships who called for provisions and fresh drinking water. The last [[whaler]] to call during the [[Age of Sail]] visited in 1904.

Around this time, [[desertion|deserters]] from European ships began to live on the island. The islanders traded food for alcoholic [[palm wine]] and firearms. The firearms were used during the 10-year [[ Civil War]] that began in 1878.

After an [[Anglo- Declarations about the Western Pacific Ocean|agreement with Great Britain]],  annexed  in 1888 and incorporated it into the  Protectorate for administrative purposes. The arrival of the [[Germans]] ended the civil war, and kings were established as rulers of the island. King [[Aweida|Auweyida]] was the most widely known. Christian missionaries from the [[Gilbert Islands]] arrived in 1888. The  settlers called the island "Nawodo" or "Onawero". The Germans ruled  for almost three decades. [[Robert Rasch]], a  trader who married a 15-year-old  girl, was the first administrator, appointed in 1890.

Phosphate was discovered on  in 1900 by the prospector [[Albert Fuller Ellis]]. The Pacific Phosphate Company began to exploit the reserves in 1906 by agreement with , exporting its first shipment in 1907. In 1914, following the outbreak of World War I,  was captured by  troops. In 1919, it was agreed by the [[Allies of World War I|Allied and Associated Powers]] that [[George V|George V of the ]] should be the administering authority under a League of Nations mandate. The  Island Agreement forged in 1919 among the governments of the , , and  provided for the administration of the island and extraction of the phosphate deposits by an intergovernmental [[British Phosphate Commission]] (BPC). The terms of the [[League of Nations]] mandate were drawn up in 1920.

The island experienced an [[influenza]] epidemic and ongoing colonial strife through the early 20th century, with a mortality rate of 18 per cent among native Nauruans. In 1923, the League of Nations gave  a trustee mandate over , with the  and  as co-trustees. On 6&nbsp;and 7 December 1940, the  auxiliary cruisers ''[[ auxiliary cruiser Komet|Komet]]'' and ''[[ auxiliary cruiser Orion|Orion]]'' [[ attacks on |sank five supply ships]] in the vicinity of . ''Komet'' then shelled 's phosphate mining areas, oil storage depots, and the shiploading cantilever.

 troops occupied  on 25 August 1942. The  built two airfields which were bombed for the first time on 25 March 1943, preventing food supplies from being flown to . The  deported 1,200 Nauruans to work as labourers in the [[Chuuk Islands]], which were also occupied by .  was finally taken back from the  on 13 September 1945, when commander Hisayaki Soeda surrendered the island to the  Army and the [[Royal  Navy]]. The surrender was accepted by [[Brigadier]] [[John Rowlstone Stevenson|J. R. Stevenson]], who represented [[Lieutenant general ()|Lieutenant General]] [[Vernon Sturdee]], the commander of the First  Army, aboard the warship [[HMAS Diamantina (K377)|HMAS ''Diamantina'']]. Arrangements were made to repatriate from Chuuk the 745&nbsp;Nauruans who survived  captivity there. They were returned to  by the BPC ship ''Trienza'' in January 1946.

In 1947, a trusteeship was established by the United Nations, with , , and the  as trustees. Under those arrangements, the UK, , and  were a joint administering authority. The  Island Agreement provided for the first administrator to be appointed by  for five years, leaving subsequent appointments to be decided by the three governments. In practice, administrative power was exercised by  alone.

The [[1948  riots]] occurred when  [[guano]] mining workers went on strike over pay and conditions. The  administration imposed a [[state of emergency]] with [[Native Police]] and armed volunteers of locals and  officials being mobilised. This force, using [[Submachine gun|sub-machine guns]] and other firearms, opened fire on the  workers, killing two and wounding sixteen. Around 50 of the workers were arrested; two of them were bayoneted to death while in custody. The trooper who bayoneted the prisoners was charged but later acquitted on grounds that the wounds were "accidentally received." The governments of the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] and [[Government of the Republic of |]] made official complaints against  at the United Nations over this incident.

In 1964, it was proposed to relocate the population of  to [[Curtis Island (Queensland)|Curtis Island]] off the coast of [[Queensland]], . By that time,  had been extensively mined for phosphate by companies from , Britain, and , damaging the landscape so much that it was thought the island would be uninhabitable by the 1990s. Rehabilitating the island was seen as financially impossible. In 1962, [[Prime Minister of | Prime Minister]] [[Robert Menzies]] said that the three countries involved in the mining had an obligation to provide a solution for the  people, and proposed finding a new island for them. In 1963, the  Government proposed to acquire all the land on Curtis Island (which was considerably larger than ) and then offer the Nauruans freehold title over the island and that the Nauruans would become [[Australians| citizens]]. The cost of resettling the Nauruans on Curtis Island was estimated to be {{ pound|10&nbsp;million||}} ([[ dollar|A$]]{{Format price|{{#expr:({{Inflation|AU|10000000|1963}}) *2 }}}} in {{Inflation/year|AU}}{{Inflation/fn|AU}}), which included housing and infrastructure and the establishment of [[Pastoralism|pastoral]], [[Agriculture|agricultural]], and [[fishing]] industries. However, the  people did not wish to become  citizens and wanted to be given sovereignty over Curtis Island to establish themselves as an independent nation;  would not agree.  chose instead to become an independent nation operating its own mines in .

 became self-governing in January 1966, and following a two-year constitutional convention, it became independent on 31 January 1968 under founding president [[Hammer DeRoburt]]. In 1967, the people of  purchased the assets of the British Phosphate Commissioners, and in June 1970, control passed to the locally owned [[Republic of  Phosphate Corporation| Phosphate Corporation]] (NPC). Income from the mines made Nauruans among the richest people in the world. In 1989,  took legal action against  in the [[International Court of Justice]] over 's administration of the island, particularly 's failure to remedy the environmental damage caused by phosphate mining. ''Certain Phosphate Lands:  v. '' led to an out-of-court settlement to rehabilitate the mined-out areas of .

In response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], a [[COVID-19 pandemic in |state of emergency was declared in  on 17 March 2020]].
