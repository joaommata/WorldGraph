[[File:Kingdom of Dahomy-1793.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]], 1793]]
Prior to 1600, present-day  comprised a variety of areas with different political systems and ethnicities. These included [[city-state]]s along the coast (primarily of the [[Aja people|Aja]] ethnic group and also including [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Gbe languages|Gbe]] peoples) and tribal regions inland (composed of [[Bariba people|Bariba]], Mahi, Gedevi, and Kabye peoples). The [[Oyo Empire]], located primarily to the east of , was a military force in the region, conducting raids and exacting tribute from the coastal kingdoms and tribal regions. The situation changed in the 17th and 18th centuries as the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]], consisting mostly of [[Fon people]], was founded on the [[Abomey]] plateau and began taking over areas along the coast. By 1727, King [[Agaja]] of the Kingdom of Dahomey had conquered the coastal cities of [[Allada]] and [[Ouidah|Whydah]]. Dahomey had become a tributary of the Oyo Empire, and rivaled but did not directly attack the Oyo-allied city-state of [[Porto-Novo]]. The rise of Dahomey, its rivalry with Porto-Novo, and tribal politics in the northern region persisted into the colonial and post-colonial periods.

In the [[Dahomey]], some younger people were apprenticed to older soldiers and taught the kingdom's military customs until they were old enough to join the army. Dahomey instituted an elite female soldier corps variously called [[Ahosi]] (the king's wives), Mino ("our mothers" in [[Fongbe]]) or the "Dahomean [[Amazons]]". This emphasis on military preparation and achievement earned Dahomey the nickname of "Black [[Sparta]]", from European observers and 19th-century explorers such as [[Sir Richard Burton]].

The kings of Dahomey sold their war captives into [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slavery]] or killed them ritually in a ceremony known as the [[Annual Customs of Dahomey|Annual Customs]]. By about 1750, the King of Dahomey was earning an estimated £250,000 per year by selling African captives to European slave-traders. The area was named the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|"Slave Coast"]] because of a flourishing slave trade. Court protocols which demanded that a portion of war captives from the kingdom's battles be decapitated, decreased the number of enslaved people exported from the area. The number went from 102,000 people per decade in the 1780s to 24,000 per decade by the 1860s.{{rp|15–16}} The decline was partly due to the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] banning the [[trans-Atlantic slave trade]] by Britain in 1808, followed by other countries. This decline continued until 1885 when the last slave ship departed the modern  Republic for , which had yet to abolish slavery. The capital [[Porto-Novo]] ("New Port" in ) was originally developed as a port for the slave trade.

Among the goods the [[ Empire|]] sought were carved items of ivory made by 's artisans in the form of carved saltcellars, spoons, and hunting horns – pieces of African art produced for sale abroad as exotic objects. Another major good sought by European settlers was palm oil. In 1856 approximately 2,500 tons of palm oil was exported by  companies which was valued at £112,500.

[[File:Bénin- 1893.jpg|thumb|A  depiction of the conquest of Dahomey in 1893]]
By the middle of the 19th century, Dahomey had "begun to weaken and lose its status as the [[regional power]]". The  took over the area in 1892. In 1899, the  included the land called [[ Dahomey]] within the larger [[ West Africa]] colonial region.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

 sought to benefit from [[Dahomey]] and the region "appeared to lack the necessary agricultural or [[mineral resources]] for large-scale [[capitalist development]]". As a result,  treated Dahomey as a sort of preserve in case future discoveries revealed resources worth developing.{{rp|15}}

The [[ government]] outlawed the capture and sale of slaves. Previous [[slaveowners]] sought to redefine their control over slaves as control over land, [[tenants]], and lineage members. This provoked a struggle among Dahomeans, "concentrated in the period from 1895 to 1920, for the redistribution of control over land and labor. Villages sought to redefine boundaries of lands and fishing preserves. Religious disputes scarcely veiled the factional struggles over control of land and commerce which underlay them. Factions struggled for the leadership of great families".{{rp|15–16}}

In 1958,  granted [[autonomy]] to the [[Republic of Dahomey]], and full independence on 1 August 1960 which is celebrated each year as [[Independence Day]], a [[Public holidays in |national holiday]]. The president who led the country to independence was [[Hubert Maga]].

===Post-colonial===
After 1960, there were coups and regime changes, with the figures of [[Hubert Maga]], [[Sourou Migan Apithy]], [[Justin Ahomadégbé]], and [[Émile Derlin Zinsou]] dominating; the first three each represented a different area and ethnicity of the country. These three agreed to form a [[Presidential Council ()|Presidential Council]] after violence marred the 1970 elections.

On 7 May 1972, Maga ceded power to Ahomadégbé. On 26 October 1972, Lt. Col. [[Mathieu Kérékou]] overthrew the ruling triumvirate, becoming president and stating that the country would not "burden itself by copying foreign ideology, and wants neither Capitalism, Communism, nor Socialism". On 30 November 1974, he announced that the country was officially [[Marxism|Marxist]], under control of the Military Council of the Revolution (CMR), which nationalized the petroleum industry and banks. On 30 November 1975, he renamed the country the [[People's Republic of ]]. The regime of the People's Republic of  underwent changes over the course of its existence: a [[Nationalism|nationalist]] period (1972–1974); a [[Socialism|socialist]] phase (1974–1982); and a phase involving an opening to Western countries and [[economic liberalism]] (1982–1990).

In 1974, the government embarked on a program to nationalize strategic sectors of the economy, reform the education system, establish agricultural cooperatives and new local government structures, and a campaign to eradicate "[[Feudalism|feudal]] forces" including [[tribalism]]. The regime banned opposition activities. Mathieu Kérékou was elected president by the National Revolutionary Assembly in 1980, re-elected in 1984. Establishing relations with , [[]], and [[]], he put "nearly all" businesses and economic activities under state control, causing foreign investment in  to dry up. Kérékou attempted to reorganize education, pushing his own aphorisms such as "Poverty is not a fatality". The regime financed itself by contracting to take nuclear waste, first from the Soviet Union and later from .

In the 1980s,  experienced higher economic growth rates (15.6% in 1982, 4.6% in 1983 and 8.2% in 1984), until the closure of the  border with  led to a drop in customs and tax revenues. The government was no longer able to pay civil servants' salaries. In 1989, riots broke out when the regime did not have enough money to pay its army. The banking system collapsed. Eventually, Kérékou renounced [[Marxism]], and a convention forced Kérékou to release political prisoners and arrange elections. [[Marxism–Leninism]] was abolished as the country's form of government.

The country's name was officially changed to the Republic of  on 1 March 1990, after the newly formed government's constitution was completed. Kérékou lost to [[Nicéphore Soglo]] in a 1991 election and became the first president on the African mainland to lose power through an election. Kérékou returned to power after winning the 1996 vote. In 2001, an election resulted in Kérékou winning another term, after which his opponents claimed election irregularities. In 1999, Kérékou issued a national apology for the substantial role that Africans had played in the Atlantic slave trade.

===21st century===
[[File:BoniYayi inauguration2006.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Boni Yayi]]'s 2006 presidential inauguration]]
Kérékou and former president Soglo did not run in the 2006 elections, as both were barred by the constitution's restrictions on age and total terms of candidates. The [[ presidential election, 2006]] resulted in a [[Two-round system|runoff]] between [[Thomas Boni Yayi]] and [[Adrien Houngbédji]]. The runoff election was held on 19 March and was won by Boni, who assumed office on 6 April. Boni was [[ presidential election, 2011|reelected in 2011]], taking 53.18% of the vote in the first round—enough to avoid a runoff election. He was the first president to win an election without a runoff since the restoration of democracy in 1991.

In the [[ presidential election, 2016|March 2016 presidential elections]] in which Boni Yayi was barred by the constitution from running for a third term, businessman [[Patrice Talon]] won the second round with 65.37% of the vote, defeating investment banker and former Prime Minister [[Lionel Zinsou]]. Talon was sworn in on 6 April 2016. Speaking on the same day that the Constitutional Court confirmed the results, Talon said that he would "first and foremost tackle constitutional reform", discussing his plan to limit presidents to a single term of 5 years to combat "complacency". He said that he planned to slash the size of the government from 28 to 16 members. In April 2021, President Patrice Talon was re-elected, with more than 86.3% of the votes cast in the [[2021  presidential election]]. The change in election laws resulted in total control of parliament by president Talon's supporters.

On 11 December 2020,  ratified the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]], making the use of nuclear weapons in the country illegal. It officially entered into force for  on 22 January 2021.

In February 2022,  saw its largest terrorist attack in history, the [[W National Park massacre]]. On 20 February 2022, President Talon inaugurated an exhibition with 26 pieces of sacred art returned to  by , 129 years after they were looted by colonial forces.

In March 2025, the government of  adopted a law, recognizing 16 kingdoms, 80 senior chiefs and 10 traditional chiefs through a new law. The pre-colonial period starting in 1894 for the south and 1897 for the north served as a historical reference for the bill, identifying traditional territories and rules to institutionalize chieftaincy.

In July 2025, the My Afro Origins law went into effect, granting the right of provisional  citizenship to members of the [[African diaspora]] whose ancestry was impacted by the transatlantic slave trade.

The land that is now  either bordered or was situated within a series of historic African empires before the  arrived in the 1890s and claimed the terrain as part of colonial [[ West Africa]].  declared independence from  on 2 October 1958. From independence until the [[ presidential election, 2010|presidential election]] of 2010,  was governed by multiple [[Autocracy|autocratic]] rulers.

=== West African empires and kingdoms ===
{{main|Imamate of Futa Jallon|Wassoulou Empire}}

What is now  sat on the fringes of various West African empires. The earliest, the [[ Empire]], grew on trade and ultimately fell after repeated incursions of the [[Almoravids]]. It was in this period that Islam first arrived in the region by way of North African traders. The [[Sosso Empire]] came and stayed from 12th to 13th centuries; later, the [[ Empire]] came when [[Sundiata Keita|Soundiata Kéïta]] defeated the Sosso ruler [[Soumaoro Kanté|Soumangourou Kanté]] at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in {{circa|1235}}. The  Empire was ruled by [[Mansa (title)|Mansa]] (Emperors), including [[Musa I of |Kankou Moussa]], who made a [[hajj]] to Mecca in 1324. After his reign, the  Empire began to decline and was ultimately supplanted by its [[vassal]] states in the 15th century.

The [[Songhai Empire]] expanded its power in about 1460. It continued to prosper until a civil war, over succession, followed the death of [[Askia Daoud]] in 1582. The empire [[ invasion of the Songhai Empire|fell to invaders]] from [[]] in 1591, but the kingdom later split into smaller kingdoms. After the fall of some of the West African empires, various kingdoms existed in what is now . [[Fulani]] Muslims migrated to [[Futa Jallon]] in Central , and established an Islamic state from 1727 to 1896 with a written constitution and alternate rulers. The [[Wassoulou Empire|Wassoulou or Wassulu Empire]] (1878–1898) was led by [[Samori Ture|Samori Toure]] in the predominantly [[Mandinka people|Malinké]] area of what is now upper  and southwestern [[]] (Wassoulou). It moved to [[]] before being conquered by the .

=== Colony ===
European traders competed for the cape trade from the 17th century onward and made inroads earlier. 's colonial period began with  military penetration into the area, and its establishment as a colony on 17 December 1891. As a result of various troubles,  occupied Timbo, the capital of Fouta, in 1896, and a definitive treaty was signed in 1897. The defeat of the armies of [[Samori Touré]], Mansa (or Emperor) of the [[Ouassoulou]] state and leader of Malinké descent, in 1898 gave  control of what today is  and adjacent areas. The boundaries of the South Rivers were fixed in 1899.

 negotiated 's present boundaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the  for [[]], the  for their  colony (now [[-Bissau]]), and [[]]. Under the , the country formed the [[ |Territory of ]] within [[ West Africa]], administered by a governor general resident in [[Dakar]]. Lieutenant governors administered the individual colonies, including .

[[File:Ahmed Sékou Touré na obisku v Ljubljani 1961 (3).jpg|thumb|President [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]] was supported by Communist states and, in 1961, visited [[Yugoslavia]].]]
In 1958, the [[ Fourth Republic]] collapsed due to political instability and its failures in dealing with its colonies, especially [[Indochina]] and [[]]. The [[ Fifth Republic]] gave the colonies the choice of [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]] in a new [[ Community]] or immediate independence in the [[1958  constitutional referendum|referendum]] of 28 September 1958.  voted overwhelmingly for independence. It was led by [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]], whose [[Democratic Party of -African Democratic Rally]] (PDG) had won 56 of 60 seats in the 1957 territorial elections.

The  later withdrew, and on 2 October 1958,  proclaimed itself a sovereign and independent republic, with Sékou Touré as president. Later, [[Opération Persil]] was planned by [[Jacques Foccart]]; they planned to create large quantities of forged [[ franc]]s to [[Hyperinflation|hyperinflate]] 's economy and to arm Touré's opposition figures. However, the operation was leaked, and soon, the  was issuing a number of official complaints.

=== Post-colonial ===

==== Under Touré's rule ====
In 1960, Touré declared the [[Democratic Party of  – African Democratic Rally|Democratic Party of ]] the country's only legal political party, and for the next 24 years, the government and PDG were one. Touré was re-elected unopposed to four 7-year terms as president, and every 5 years voters were presented with a single list of PDG candidates for the National Assembly.

On 22 November 1970,  forces from neighbouring [[ ]] staged [[Operation Green Sea]], a raid on Conakry by several hundred exiled  opposition forces. Among their goals, the  military wanted to kill or capture Sekou Touré due to his support of [[PAIGC]], an independence movement and rebel group that had carried out attacks inside   from their bases in . After some fighting, the -backed forces retreated.  was elected as a non-permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] 1972–73.

In 1977, a declining economy and a ban on all private economic transactions led to the [[ Market Women's Revolt|Market Women's Revolt]], a series of anti-government riots started by women working in Conakry's [[Marché Madina (Conakry)|Madina Market]]. Touré vacillated from supporting the Soviet Union to supporting the . The late 1970s and early 1980s saw some economic reforms. After the election of [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] as  president, trade increased and the two countries exchanged diplomatic visits.

==== Under Conté's rule ====
Sékou Touré died on 26 March 1984 after a heart operation in the , and was replaced by Prime Minister [[Louis Lansana Beavogui]], who was to serve as interim president, pending new elections. PDG was due to elect a new leader on 3 April 1984. Under the constitution, that person would have been the only candidate for president. Hours before that meeting, Colonels [[Lansana Conté]] and [[Diarra Traoré]] seized power in a [[1984  coup d'état|bloodless coup]]. Conté assumed the role of president, with Traoré serving as prime minister, until December.

Conté denounced the previous regime's record on human rights, releasing 250 political prisoners and encouraging approximately 200,000 more to return from exile. He made explicit the turn away from socialism. In 1992, Conté announced a return to civilian rule, with a presidential poll in 1993, followed by elections to parliament in 1995 (in which his party—the [[Unity and Progress Party|Party of Unity and Progress]]—won 71 of 114 seats). In September 2001, the opposition leader [[Alpha Condé]] was imprisoned for endangering state security and pardoned 8 months later. Subsequently, he spent time in exile in .

In 2001, Conté organized and won a referendum to lengthen the presidential term, and in 2003, began his third term after elections were boycotted by the opposition. In January 2005, Conté survived a suspected assassination attempt while making a public appearance in Conakry. His opponents claimed that he was a "tired dictator", whose departure was inevitable, whereas his supporters believed that he was winning a battle with dissidents. According to ''[[Foreign Policy]]'',  was in danger of becoming a [[failed state]].

In 2000,  suffered as rebels crossed the borders from [[]] and [[]]. Some thought that the country was headed towards a civil war. Conté blamed neighbouring leaders for coveting 's natural resources, and these claims were denied. In 2003,  agreed to plans with her neighbours to tackle the insurgents. The [[2007  general strike]] resulted in the appointment of a new prime minister.

==== Political violence and Ebola outbreak ====
Conté remained in power until his death on 23 December 2008. Several hours after his death, [[Moussa Dadis Camara]] seized control in a [[2008  coup d'état|coup]], declaring himself head of a [[military junta]]. Protests against the coup became violent, and 157 people were killed when, on 28 September 2009, the junta ordered its soldiers to attack people gathered to protest Camara's attempt to become president. The soldiers went on a rampage of rape, mutilation, and murder, which caused some foreign governments to withdraw their support for the new regime.

On 3 December 2009, an aide shot Camara during a dispute over the rampage in September. Camara went to  for medical care. Vice-president (and defense minister) [[Sékouba Konaté]] flew from [[]] to run the country. After meeting in [[Ouagadougou]] on 13 and 14 January 2010, Camara, Konaté and [[Blaise Compaoré]], President of [[]], produced a formal statement of 12 principles promising a return of  to civilian rule within six months. The presidential election of 27 June brought allegations of fraud, and a second election was held on 7 November. Voter turnout was "high", and the elections went "relatively smoothly". [[Alpha Condé]], leader of the opposition party [[Rally of the  People]] (RGP), won the election, promising to reform the security sector and review mining contracts.

In February 2013, [[2013  clashes|political violence erupted]] after street protests over the transparency of the upcoming [[2013  parliamentary election|May elections]]. The protests were fueled by the opposition coalition's decision to step down from the elections in protest of the lack of transparency in the preparations for elections. Nine people were killed during the protests, and around 220 were injured. Some deaths and injuries were caused by security forces using live ammunition on protesters. The violence led to ethnic clashes between the [[Malinke]] and [[Fula people|Fula]], who supported and opposed President Condé, respectively. On 26 March 2013, the opposition party backed out of negotiations with the government over the election, saying that the government had not respected them, and had broken all agreements.[[File:Acte2 FNDC.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[2019–2020  protests]] against the rule of [[Alpha Condé]]]]
On 25 March 2014, the [[World Health Organization]] stated that [[Ministry of Health ()|'s Ministry of Health]] had reported [[Ebola virus epidemic in |an outbreak]] of [[Ebola virus disease]] in . This initial outbreak had 86 cases, including 59 deaths. By 28 May, there were 281 cases, with 186 deaths. It is believed that the first case was Emile Ouamouno, a two-year-old boy in the village of [[Meliandou]]. He fell ill on 2 December 2013 and died on 6 December. On 18 September 2014, eight members of an Ebola education health care team [[Womey Massacre|were murdered]] by villagers in the town of [[Womey]]. As of 1 November 2015, there had been 3,810 cases and 2,536 deaths in .

[[2019–2020  protests|Mass civil unrest and violent protests broke out]] against the rule of Alpha Conde on 14 October 2019, against constitutional changes. More than 800 were killed in clashes. After the [[2020  presidential election]], Alpha Condé's election to a third term was challenged by the opposition, who accused him of fraud. Condé claimed a [[2020  constitutional referendum|constitutional referendum from March 2020]] allowed him to run despite the 2-term limit.

==== Under military rule ====
On 5 September 2021, after hours of gunfire near the presidential palace, Lieutenant Colonel [[Mamady Doumbouya]] seized control of state television and declared that President [[Alpha Condé|Alpha Conde]]'s government had been dissolved and the nation's borders closed. By the evening, the putschists had declared control of all of Conakry and the country's armed forces. According to ''Guinée Matin'', by 6 September, the military fully controlled the state administration and started to replace the civil administration with its military counterpart. The [[United Nations]], [[European Union]], [[African Union]], [[ECOWAS]] (which suspended 's membership), and [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|La Francophonie]] denounced the coup, and called for President Condé's unconditional release. Similar responses came from some neighboring and Western countries (including the [[]]), and from [[]] (which relies on  for half of its aluminum ore, facilitated by its connections to President Condé). Despite these, on 1 October 2021, Mamady Doumbouya was sworn in as interim president.

On 11 May 2023, at least seven people were shot dead in anti-government demonstrations in cities across . The anti-government movement became involved in peaceful protests and called on rulers to end military rule in  and transition the country to democracy. On 18 December 2023, an [[Conakry oil depot explosion|explosion occurred]] at the country's main oil depot in Conakry, killing 24 people and causing extensive fuel shortages in the country in the following weeks. Existing civil and economic unrest in the country temporarily worsened as a result, with several confrontations between protestors and police in Conakry, increased fuel and travel costs, and general price inflation throughout the country.

Doumbouya initially set 31 December 2024 as the deadline to launch a democratic transition. But he missed the deadline, leading to protests and criticism from activists and the opposition. Under pressure, he promised in his New Year’s message that a decree for the constitutional referendum would be signed. Authorities have further added that all elections would be held in 2025, without committing to a particular date. A [[2025  constitutional referendum|constitutional referendum]] was held on 21 September 2025, which established a new constitution replacing the one approved in [[2020  constitutional referendum|2020]] and marked the first step towards civilian rule.

===Bantu migrations===
{{Further|Bantu expansion}}

[[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples migrated into  as early as the 4th century BC. It is believed between the 1st and 5th centuries AD, waves of migration from the west and north went through the [[Zambezi]] River valley and then gradually into the plateau and coastal areas of Southern Africa. They established agricultural communities or societies based on herding cattle. They brought with them the technology for smelting and smithing iron.

===Swahili Coast===
[[File:Slaves ruvuma.jpg|thumb|Arab-Swahili slave traders and their captives on the [[Ruvuma River]]]]
From the late first millennium AD, vast [[ Ocean trade]] networks extended as far south as present day [[Vilankulo]], as evidenced by the ancient port town of [[Chibuene]]. Beginning in the 9th century, a growing involvement in  Ocean trade led to the development of numerous port towns along the entire East African coast, including modern day . Largely autonomous, these towns broadly participated in the incipient [[Swahili culture]]. Islam was often adopted by urban elites, facilitating trade. In , [[Sofala]], [[Angoche]], and  Island were regional powers by the 15th century.

The towns traded with merchants from both the African interior and the broader  Ocean world. Particularly important were the gold and ivory caravan routes. Inland states like the [[Kingdom of ]] and [[Kingdom of Mutapa]] provided the coveted gold and ivory, which were then exchanged up the coast to larger port cities like [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] and [[Mombasa]].

The [[Island of ]], after which the country is named, is a small coral island at the mouth of Mossuril Bay on the [[Nacala]] coast of northern , and was first explored by Europeans in the late 15th century.

When  explorers reached  in 1498, Arab-trading settlements had existed along the coast and outlying islands for several centuries. From about 1500,  trading posts and forts displaced the Arabic commercial and military hegemony, becoming regular ports of call on the new European sea route to the east, the first steps in what was to become a process of colonisation.

The voyage of [[Vasco da Gama]] around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1498 marked the  entry into trade, politics, and society of the region. The  gained control of the Island of  and the port city of Sofala in the early 16th century, and by the 1530s, small groups of  traders and prospectors seeking gold penetrated the interior regions. Here they set up garrisons and trading posts at [[Sena, |Sena]] and [[Tete, |Tete]] on the Zambezi and tried to gain exclusive control over the gold trade.

In the central part of the  territory, the  attempted to legitimise and consolidate their trade and settlement positions through the creation of ''[[prazo]]s''. These land grants tied emigrants to their settlements, and inland  was largely left to be administered by ''prazeiros'', the grant holders, while central authorities in  concentrated their direct exercise of power on, in their view, the more important  possessions in Asia and the Americas. Slavery in  pre-dated European-contact. African rulers and chiefs dealt in enslaved people, first with Arab Muslim traders, who sent the enslaved to Middle East Asia cities and plantations, and later with  and other European traders. In a continuation of the trade, slaves were supplied by warring local African rulers, who raided enemy tribes and sold their captives to the ''prazeiros''. The authority of the ''prazeiros'' was exercised and upheld amongst the local population by armies of these enslaved men, whose members became known as ''[[Chikunda]]''. Continuing emigration from  occurred at comparatively low levels until late in the nineteenth century, promoting "Africanisation". While ''prazos'' were originally intended to be held solely by  colonists, through intermarriage and the relative isolation of ''prazeiros'' from ongoing  influences, the ''prazos'' became African- or African-.

[[File:Lourenco-Marques-pc-c1905.jpg|thumb|View of the Central Avenue in Lourenço Marques, now Maputo, ca. 1905]]

Although  influence gradually expanded, its power was limited and exercised through individual settlers and officials who were granted extensive autonomy. The  were able to wrest much of the coastal trade from Arab Muslims between 1500 and 1700, but, with the Arab Muslim seizure of 's key foothold at [[Fort Jesus]] on [[Mombasa Island]] (now in ) in 1698, the pendulum began to swing in the other direction. As a result, investment lagged while [[Lisbon]] devoted itself to the more lucrative trade with  and the Far East and to the colonisation of .

The [[Mazrui]] and [[History of | Arabs]] reclaimed much of the  Ocean trade, forcing the  to retreat south. Many ''prazos'' had declined by the mid-19th century, but several of them survived. During the 19th century other European powers, particularly the  ([[  Company]]) and the  (), became increasingly involved in the trade and politics of the region around the  East African territories.

By the early 20th century the  had shifted the administration of much of  to large private companies, like the [[ Company]], the [[Zambezia Company]] and the [[Niassa Company]], controlled and financed mostly by  financiers such as [[Solomon Joel]], which established railroad lines to their neighbouring colonies ( and [[Rhodesia]]). Although slavery had been legally abolished in , at the end of the 19th century the chartered companies enacted a forced labour policy and supplied cheap—often forced—African labour to the mines and [[plantation]]s of the nearby  colonies and . The Zambezia Company, the most profitable chartered company, took over several smaller ''prazeiro'' holdings and established military outposts to protect its property. The chartered companies built roads and ports to bring their goods to market including a railroad linking present-day  with the  port of [[Beira, |Beira]].

Due to their unsatisfactory performance and the shift, under the [[corporatist]] [[Estado Novo ()|''Estado Novo'']] regime of [[Oliveira Salazar]], toward stronger state control of the [[ Empire]]'s economy, the companies' concessions were not renewed when they ran out. This was what happened in 1942 with the  Company, which, however, continued to operate in the agricultural and commercial sectors as a corporation, and had already happened in 1929 with the termination of the Niassa Company's concession. In 1951, the  overseas colonies in Africa were rebranded as Overseas Provinces of .

The [[Mueda massacre]] of 16 June 1960 resulted in the death of [[Makonde people|Makonde]] protestors, which provoked the struggle of independence from  rule of .

=== War of Independence (1964–1975)===
{{Main| War of Independence}}

As [[communism|communist]] and [[Decolonization|anti-colonial]] ideologies spread out across Africa, many clandestine political movements were established in support of  independence. These movements claimed that since policies and development plans were primarily designed by the ruling authorities for the benefit of 's  population, little attention was paid to 's tribal integration and the development of its native communities. According to the official guerrilla statements, this affected a majority of the indigenous population who suffered both state-sponsored discrimination and enormous social pressure. As a response to the guerrilla movement, the  government from the 1960s and principally the early 1970s initiated gradual changes with new socioeconomic developments and egalitarian policies.

The Front for the Liberation of  ([[FRELIMO]]) initiated a guerrilla campaign against  rule in September 1964. This conflict—along with the two others already initiated in the other  colonies of [[ |]] and [[ ]]—became part of the so-called [[ Colonial War]] (1961–1974). From a military standpoint, the  regular army maintained control of the population centres while the guerrilla forces sought to undermine their influence in rural and tribal areas in the north and west. As part of their response to FRELIMO, the  government began to pay more attention to creating favourable conditions for social development and economic growth.

=== Independence (1975) ===
FRELIMO took control of the territory after ten years of sporadic warfare, as well as 's own return to democracy after the fall of the authoritarian [[Estado Novo ()|''Estado Novo'']] regime in the [[Carnation Revolution]] of April 1974 and the failed [[coup of 25 November 1975]]. Within a year, most of the 250,000  in  had left—some expelled by the government of the nearly independent territory, some left the country to avoid possible reprisals from the unstable government—and  became independent from  on 25 June 1975. A law had been passed on the initiative of the relatively unknown [[Armando Guebuza]] of the FRELIMO party, ordering the  to leave the country in 24 hours with only {{convert|20|kg|lb|abbr=off}} of luggage. Unable to salvage any of their assets, most of them returned to  penniless.

=== Civil War (1977–1992)===
{{Main|People's Republic of | Civil War}}
[[File:Land mine victim 2 (4364914733).jpg|thumb|left|A land mine victim in ]]
The [[People's Republic of |new government]] under President [[Samora Machel]] established a [[one-party state]] based on [[Marxism|Marxist]] principles. It received diplomatic and some military support from [[]] and the [[Soviet Union]] and proceeded to crack down on opposition. Starting shortly after independence, the country was plagued from 1977 to 1992 by a long and violent civil war between the opposition forces of anti-communist  National Resistance ([[RENAMO]]) rebel militias and the FRELIMO regime. This conflict characterised the first decades of  independence, combined with sabotage from the neighbouring states of [[Rhodesia]] and , ineffective policies, failed central planning, and the resulting economic collapse. This period was also marked by the exodus of  nationals and  of  heritage, a collapsed infrastructure, lack of investment in productive assets, and government nationalisation of privately owned industries, as well as widespread famine.

During most of the civil war, the FRELIMO-formed central government was unable to exercise effective control outside urban areas, many of which were cut off from the capital. RENAMO-controlled areas included up to 50% of the rural areas in several provinces, and it is reported that health services of any kind were isolated from assistance for years in those areas. The problem worsened when the government cut back spending on health care. The war was marked by mass human rights violations from both sides of the conflict, with both RENAMO and FRELIMO contributing to the chaos through the use of terror and indiscriminate targeting of civilians. The central government executed tens of thousands of people while trying to extend its control throughout the country and sent many people to "re-education camps" where thousands died.

[[File:RhodesiaAllies1975-en.svg|thumb|The geopolitical situation in 1975; nations friendly to the FRELIMO are shown in orange.]]
During the war, RENAMO proposed a peace agreement based on the secession of RENAMO-controlled northern and western territories as the independent ''Republic of Rombesia'', but FRELIMO refused, insisting on the undivided sovereignty of the entire country. An estimated one million  perished during the civil war, 1.7&nbsp;million took refuge in neighbouring states, and several million more were internally displaced. The FRELIMO regime also gave shelter and support to  ([[African National Congress]]) and  ([[ African National Union]]) rebel movements, while the governments of Rhodesia and later Apartheid  backed RENAMO in the civil war. Between 300,000 and 600,000 people died of famine during the war.

On 19 October 1986, Machel was on his way back from an international meeting in  when his [[1986  Tupolev Tu-134 crash|plane crashed]] in the [[Lebombo Mountains]] near [[Mbuzini]] in . President Machel and thirty-three others died, including ministers and officials of the  government. The United Nations' Soviet delegation issued a minority report contending that their expertise and experience had been undermined by the . Representatives of the Soviet Union advanced the theory that the plane had been intentionally diverted by a false [[VHF omnidirectional range|navigational beacon]] signal, using a technology provided by military intelligence operatives of the  government.

Machel's successor [[Joaquim Chissano]] implemented sweeping changes in the country, starting reforms such as changing from Marxism to capitalism and began peace talks with RENAMO. The new constitution enacted in 1990 provided for a [[multi-party system|multi-party political system]], a [[market economy|market-based economy]], and free elections. That same year,  abolished the people's republic as the country's official name. The civil war ended in October 1992 with the [[Rome General Peace Accords]], first brokered by the Christian Council of  (Council of Protestant Churches) and then taken over by [[Community of Sant'Egidio]]. Peace returned to , under the supervision of the [[United Nations Operation in |peacekeeping force of the United Nations]].

===Democratic era (1993–present)===

 held elections in 1994, which were accepted by most political parties as free and fair although still contested by many nationals and observers alike. FRELIMO won, under Joaquim Chissano, while RENAMO, led by [[Afonso Dhlakama]], ran as the official opposition. In 1995,  joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], becoming, at the time, the only member nation that had never been part of the [[ Empire]].

By mid-1995, over 1.7&nbsp;million refugees who had sought asylum in neighbouring countries had returned to , part of the largest repatriation witnessed in sub-Saharan Africa. An additional four million [[internally displaced person]]s had returned to their homes. In December 1999,  held elections for a second time since the civil war, which were again won by FRELIMO. RENAMO accused FRELIMO of fraud and threatened to return to civil war but backed down after taking the matter to the Supreme Court and losing.

In early 2000, a cyclone caused [[2000  flood|widespread flooding]], killing hundreds and devastating the already precarious infrastructure. There were widespread suspicions that foreign aid resources had been diverted by powerful leaders of FRELIMO. [[Carlos Cardoso (journalist)|Carlos Cardoso]], a journalist investigating these allegations, was murdered, and his death was never satisfactorily explained.

Indicating in 2001 that he would not run for a third term, Chissano criticised leaders who stayed on longer than he had, which was generally seen as a reference to  President [[Frederick Chiluba]] and  President [[Robert Mugabe]]. Presidential and National Assembly elections took place on 1–2 December 2004. FRELIMO candidate [[Armando Guebuza]] won with 64% of the popular vote, and Dhlakama received 32% of the popular vote. FRELIMO won 160 seats in Parliament, with a coalition of RENAMO and several small parties winning the 90 remaining seats. Guebuza was inaugurated as the President of  on 2 February 2005 and served two five-year terms. His successor, [[Filipe Nyusi]], became the fourth President of  on 15 January 2015.

From 2013 to 2019, a low-intensity [[RENAMO insurgency (2013–2021)|insurgency by RENAMO]] occurred, mainly in the country's central and northern regions. On 5 September 2014, Guebuza and Dhlakama signed the Accord on Cessation of Hostilities, which brought the military hostilities to a halt and allowed both parties to concentrate on the general elections to be held in October 2014. However, after the general elections, a new political crisis emerged. RENAMO did not recognise the validity of the election results and demanded the control of six provinces – Nampula, Niassa, Tete, Zambezia, Sofala, and Manica – where they claimed to have won a majority. About 12,000 refugees fled to [[]]. The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders]], and [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that government forces had torched villages and carried out [[summary execution]]s and [[Wartime sexual violence|sexual abuses]].

In October 2019, President Filipe Nyusi was re-elected after a landslide victory in [[2019  general election|general election]]. FRELIMO won 184 seats, RENAMO got 60 seats and the MDM party received the remaining 6 seats in the National Assembly. Opposition did not accept the results because of allegations of fraud and irregularities. FRELIMO secured two-thirds majority in parliament which allowed FRELIMO to re-adjust the constitution without needing the agreement of the opposition.

Since 2017, the country has faced an [[Insurgency in Cabo Delgado|ongoing insurgency by Islamist groups]]. In September 2020, [[Islamic State|ISIL]] insurgents captured and briefly occupied [[Vamizi Island]] in the  Ocean. In March 2021, dozens of civilians were killed and 35,000 others were displaced after [[Battle of Palma|Islamist rebels seized]] the city of [[Palma, |Palma]]. In December 2021, nearly 4,000  fled their villages after an intensification of jihadist attacks in [[Niassa Province|Niassa]].

===Pre-Columbian era===
Archaeological knowledge of Pre-Columbian civilization in  is poor, due to its high population density limiting excavation, as well as volcanic eruptions blanketing potential archaeological sites. This lack of knowledge particularly affects the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era or Formative Period|Preclassic Period]] and earlier.

A notable archaeological site in western  is {{ill|Chalchuapa|es|Chalchuapa#Época prehispánica|preserve=y}}, which was first settled around 1200 BC, and became a major urban settlement on the periphery of the [[Mayan civilization|Maya civilization]] during the Preclassic Period and was heavily involved in the trading of valuable items like ceramics, obsidian, cacao and hematite. The settlement was heavily damaged around 430 AD by a volcanic eruption, after which it never regained its former prominence. Another major Pre-Columbian settlement is [[Cara Sucia (Mesoamerican site)|Cara Sucia]] in the far west of the country, which began as a small settlement around 800 BC at the beginning of the Middle Preclassic, during the [[Late Classic]] (600–900 AD), Cara Sucia emerged as a major urban settlement, before being abruptly destroyed during the 10th century. [[File:Temazcal en Joya de Cerén.jpg|thumb|A [[temazcal]] in [[Joya de Cerén]]]]

The [[Pipil people]], [[Nahuan languages|Nahua]] speaking groups migrated from [[Anahuac (Aztec)|Anahuac]] beginning around 800 AD and occupied the central and western regions of . The Nahua Pipil were the last indigenous people to arrive in . They called their territory ''Kuskatan'', a [[Nawat language|Nawat]] word meaning "The Place of Precious Jewels", [[back-formation|back-formed]] into [[Classical Nahuatl]] ''Cōzcatlān'', and as ''Cuzcatlán''. It was the largest domain in  territory up until European contact. The term ''Cuzcatleco'' is commonly used to identify someone of  heritage, although the majority of the eastern population has an indigenous heritage of Lenca origin, as do their place names such as [[Intipucá|Intipuca]], [[Chirilagua]], and [[Lolotique]].

Most of the archaeological sites in western  such as [[Lake Güija|Lago de Guija]] and [[Joya de Cerén|Joya De Ceren]] indicate a pre-Columbian Mayan culture. [[Cihuatán|Cihuatan]] shows signs of material trade with northern Nahua culture, eastern Mayan and Lenca culture, and southern  and  indigenous culture. [[Tazumal]]'s smaller B1-2 structure shows a [[Talud-tablero|talud]]-[[Talud-tablero|tablero]] style of architecture that is associated with Nahua culture and corresponds with their migration history from Anahuac. In eastern , the Lenca site of [[Quelepa]] is highlighted as a major pre-Columbian cultural centre and demonstrates links to the Mayan site of [[Copán|Copan]] in western  as well as the previously mentioned sites in Chalchuapa, and Cara Sucia in western . An investigation of the site of La Laguna in [[Usulután|Usulutan]] has also produced Copador items that link it to the Lenca-Maya trade route.

=== European arrival (1522) ===
By 1521, the indigenous population of the Mesoamerican area had been drastically reduced by the [[History of smallpox|smallpox epidemic]] that was spreading throughout the territory, although it had not yet reached pandemic levels in Cuzcatlán or the northern portion Managuara. The first known visit by Spaniards to what is now  territory was made by the admiral [[Andrés Niño]], who led an expedition to Central America. He disembarked in the [[Gulf of Fonseca]] on 31 May 1522, at [[Meanguera del Golfo|Meanguera island]], naming it Petronila, and then traversed to [[Jiquilisco Bay]] on the mouth of [[Lempa River]]. The first indigenous people to have contact with the  were the Lenca of eastern .

====Conquest of Cuzcatlán and Managuara====
{{main| conquest of }}
[[File:Pedro de Alvarado (Tomás Povedano).jpg|thumb|upright| Conquistador [[Pedro de Alvarado]]]]

In 1524, after participating in the [[ conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztec Empire]], [[Pedro de Alvarado]], his brother Gonzalo, and their men crossed the [[Paz River|Rio Paz]] southwards into Cuzcatlec territory. Upon their arrival, Spaniards were disappointed to discover that the Pipil had little gold compared to what they had found in  or . The small amount of gold that was available had to be panned so that it could be obtained. Eventually, the Spaniards recognized the richness of the land's volcanic soil. Following this discovery, the  crown began granting land based on the terms of the encomienda system.

Pedro Alvarado led the first incursion to extend their dominion to the domain of Cuzcatlan in June 1524. When he arrived at the borders of the kingdom, he saw that civilians had been evacuated. Cuzcatlec warriors moved to the coastal city of [[Acajutla]] and waited for Alvarado and his forces. Alvarado approached, confident that the result would be similar to what occurred in  and . He thought he would easily deal with this new indigenous force since the  allies on his side and the Pipil spoke a similar language.

Alvarado described the Cuzcatlec soldiers as having shields decorated with colourful exotic feathers, a vest-like armour made of three inch cotton which arrows could not penetrate, and long spears. Both armies suffered many casualties, with a wounded Alvarado retreating and losing a lot of his men, especially among the   auxiliaries. Once his army had regrouped, Alvarado decided to head to the Cuzcatlan capital and again faced armed Cuzcatlec. Wounded, unable to fight and hiding in the cliffs, Alvarado sent his  men on their horses to approach the Cuzcatlec to see if they would fear the horses, but they did not retreat, Alvarado recalls in his letters to [[Hernán Cortés]].

The Cuzcatlec attacked again, and on this occasion stole  weaponry. Alvarado retreated and sent  messengers to demand that the Cuzcatlec warriors return the stolen weapons and surrender to their opponent's king. The Cuzcatlec responded with the famous response, "If you want your weapons, come get them". As days passed, Alvarado, fearing an ambush, sent more  messengers to negotiate, but these messengers never came back and were presumably executed.

[[File:Tazumal 10.jpg|thumb|[[Tazumal]], built between AD 250–1200, a Maya site in [[Santa Ana Department]]]]

The  efforts were firmly resisted by Pipil and their Mayan-speaking neighbours. They defeated the Spaniards and what was left of their [[Tlaxcala]]n allies, forcing them to withdraw to . After being wounded, Alvarado abandoned the war and appointed his brother, [[Gonzalo de Alvarado]], to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) brought the Pipil under  control, since the Pipil also were weakened by a regional epidemic of smallpox. In 1525, the conquest of Cuzcatlán was completed and the city of San Salvador was established. The  faced much resistance from the Pipil and were not able to reach eastern , the area of the Lencas.

In 1526, the  founded the garrison town of [[San Miguel, |San Miguel]] in northern Managuara—territory of the Lenca, headed by another explorer and conquistador, [[Luis de Moscoso Alvarado]], nephew of Pedro Alvarado. Oral history holds that a Maya-Lenca crown princess, Antu Silan Ulap I, organized resistance to the conquistadors. The commonwealth of the Lenca was alarmed by de Moscoso's invasion, and Antu Silan travelled from village to village, uniting all the Lenca towns in present-day  and  against the Spaniards. Through surprise attacks and overwhelming numbers, they were able to drive the  out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison.

For ten years the Lencas prevented the  from building a permanent settlement. Then the  returned with more soldiers, including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in . They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of [[Intibucá Department|Intibucá]].

Antu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] (also called Empira). Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the  by wearing their clothes after capturing them and using their weapons captured in battle. Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in Managuara until he was killed in battle. The remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills. The  were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537.

=== Colonial period (1525–1821) ===
[[File:Iglesia Colonial Metapan.jpg|thumb|Colonial Church of San Pedro Apóstol in [[Metapán]], built between 1736 and 1743]]
[[File:Proclama de libertad (indep. Centroamérica).jpg|thumb|A painting of the First Independence Movement celebration in San Salvador. At the centre, [[José Matías Delgado]].]]
During the colonial period, San Salvador and San Miguel were part of the Captaincy General of , also known as the Kingdom of  ({{langx|es|Reino de }}), created in 1609 as an administrative division of [[New ]]. The  territory was administered by the mayor of Sonsonate, with San Salvador being established as an ''[[Intendancy of San Salvador|intendencia]]'' in 1786.

In 1811, a combination of internal and external factors motivated Central  elites to attempt to gain independence from the  Crown. The most important internal factors were the desire of local elites to control the country's affairs free of involvement from  authorities, and the long-standing Creole aspiration for independence. The main external factors motivating the independence movement were the success of the [[ Revolution|]] and [[ Revolution|]] revolutions in the 18th century, and the weakening of the  Crown's military power as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the resulting inability to control its colonies effectively.

In November 1811  priest [[José Matías Delgado]] rang the bells of Iglesia La Merced in San Salvador, calling for insurrection and launching the [[1811 Independence Movement]]. This insurrection was suppressed, and many of its leaders were arrested and served sentences in jail. Another insurrection was launched in 1814, which was also suppressed.

=== Independence (1821) ===
In 1821, in light of unrest in ,  authorities capitulated and signed the [[Act of Independence of Central America]], which released all of the Captaincy General of  (comprising current territories of , , ,  and  and the  state of [[Chiapas]]) from  rule and declared its independence. In 1821,  joined , ,  and  in a union named the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].
[[File:Vergara detalle firmaacta1821.JPG|thumb|left|[[José Matías Delgado]] signing the [[Act of Independence of Central America]], 15 September 1821]]
In early 1822, the authorities of the newly independent Central  provinces, meeting in  City, [[Central America under  rule|voted to join]] the newly constituted [[First  Empire]] under [[Agustín de Iturbide]].  resisted, insisting on autonomy for the Central  countries. A  military detachment marched to San Salvador and suppressed dissent, but with the fall of Iturbide on 19 March 1823, the army decamped back to .

Shortly thereafter, the authorities of the provinces revoked the vote to join , deciding instead to form a [[Federation|federal union]] of the five remaining provinces (Chiapas permanently joined  at this juncture) known as the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].  declared its independence from the Federal Republic of Central America on 30 January 1841.  joined  and  in 1896 to form the [[Greater Republic of Central America]], which dissolved in 1898.

[[File:Woman and girl in  making bread.png|thumb|A woman and a girl in  making bread, 1910]]
After the mid-19th century, the economy was based on coffee growing. As the world market for indigo withered away, the economy prospered or suffered as the world coffee price fluctuated. The enormous profits that coffee yielded as a monoculture export served as an impetus for the concentration of land into the hands of an oligarchy of just a few families.

Throughout the last half of the 19th century, a succession of presidents from the ranks of the  oligarchy, nominally both conservative and liberal, generally agreed on the promotion of coffee as the predominant [[cash crop]], the development of infrastructure (railroads and port facilities) primarily in support of the coffee trade, the elimination of communal landholdings to facilitate further coffee production, the passage of anti-[[vagrancy]] laws to ensure that displaced ''[[Peasant|campesinos]]'' and other rural residents provided sufficient labour for the coffee ''fincas'' (plantations), and the suppression of rural discontent. In 1912, the national guard was created as a rural police force.

===20th century===
[[File:Tomas Regalado1.jpg|thumb|upright|Gen. [[Tomás Regalado ( politician)|Tomás Regalado]]]]

In 1898, General [[Tomás Regalado ( politician)|Tomás Regalado]] gained power by force, deposing General [[Rafael Antonio Gutiérrez]] and ruling as president until 1903. Once in office he revived the practice of presidents designating their successors. After serving his term, he remained active in the  Army and was killed on 11 July 1906, at El Jicaro, during a [[Totoposte Wars|war against ]]. Until 1913  was politically stable, with undercurrents of popular discontent. When President [[Manuel Enrique Araujo]] was killed in 1913, many hypotheses were advanced for the political motive of his murder.

Manuel Enrique Araujo's administration was followed by the [[Meléndez–Quiñónez dynasty]] that lasted from 1913 to 1927. [[Pío Romero Bosque]], a former minister and a trusted collaborator of the dynasty, succeeded President [[Alfonso Quiñónez Molina]], and in 1930 announced free elections, in which [[Arturo Araujo]] came to power on 1 March 1931, in what was considered the country's first freely contested election. His government lasted only nine months before it was overthrown by junior military officers, who accused his [[ Laborist Party]] of lacking political and governmental experience and of using its government offices inefficiently. Arturo Araujo faced general popular discontent, as the people had expected economic reforms and the redistribution of land. There were demonstrations in front of the National Palace from the first week of his administration. His vice president and minister of war was General [[Maximiliano Hernández Martínez]].

[[File:General Maximiliano Hernández Martínez, President of .jpg|thumb|left| General [[Maximiliano Hernández Martínez]], President of  (1931–1944)|248x248px]]

In December 1931, a [[1931  coup d'état|coup d'état was organized]] by junior officers and led by Martínez. Only the First Regiment of Cavalry and the National Police defended the presidency (the National Police had been on its payroll), but later that night, after hours of fighting, the badly outnumbered defenders surrendered to rebel forces. The Directorate, composed of officers, hid behind a shadowy figure, a rich anti-communist banker called Rodolfo Duke, and later installed the vice-president Martínez as president. The revolt was probably caused by the army's discontent at not having been paid by President Araujo for some months. Araujo left the National Palace and unsuccessfully tried to organize forces to defeat the revolt.

The U.S. Minister in  met with the Directorate and later recognized the government of Martínez, which agreed to hold presidential elections. He resigned six months prior to running for re-election, winning back the presidency as the only candidate on the ballot. He ruled from 1935 to 1939, then from 1939 to 1943. He began a fourth term in 1944 but resigned in May after a general strike. Martínez had said he was going to respect the constitution, which stipulated he could not be re-elected, but he refused to keep his promise.

==== La Matanza ====
{{Main|La Matanza}}
Beginning in January 1932, there was brutal suppression of a rural revolt known as [[La Matanza]]. In the unstable political climate of the previous few years, social activist and revolutionary leader [[Farabundo Martí]] helped found the Communist Party of Central America, and led a communist alternative to the Red Cross, called "[[International Red Aid]]", serving as one of its representatives. Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged  through the use of [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] ideology.

In December 1930, at the height of the country's economic and social depression, Martí was once again exiled because of his popularity among the nation's poor and rumours of his upcoming nomination for president the following year. Once Araujo was elected president in 1931, Martí returned to  and, along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata, began the movement that was later truncated by the military.

On 22 January 1932, thousands of poorly armed peasants in the western part of  revolted against 
the government and Martínez.The rebellion occurred amid widespread unrest over suppression of democratic political freedoms following the cancellation of the results of the&nbsp;1932 legislative election. The rebels were led by&nbsp;[[Feliciano Ama]]&nbsp;and&nbsp;[[Farabundo Martí]] and were largely composed of indigenous people and communists. The rebellion made gains initially, capturing several towns and cities across the western&nbsp;part of the country, killing an estimated 2,000 people. The government suppressed the rebellion brutally, killing between 10,000 and 40,000 people, mostly, [[Pipil people|Pipil]] peasants. Many of the rebellion's leaders, including Ama and Martí, were&nbsp;captured and executed.

Historically, the high  population density has contributed to tensions with neighbouring [[]], as land-poor  emigrated to less densely populated  and established themselves as squatters on unused or underused land. This phenomenon was a major cause of the [[Football War|1969 Football War]] between the two countries. As many as 130,000  were forcibly expelled or fled from .

[[File: Jose Napoleon Duarte 1980-1990.jpg |thumb|[[José Napoleón Duarte]]]]
The [[Christian Democratic Party ()|Christian Democratic Party]] (PDC) and the [[National Coalition Party ()|National Conciliation Party]] (PCN) were active in  politics from 1960 until 2011, when they were disbanded by the Supreme Court because they had failed to win enough votes in the 2004 presidential election. Both parties have since reconstituted. They share common ideals, but one represents the middle class and the latter the interests of the  military.

PDC leader [[José Napoleón Duarte]] was the mayor of San Salvador from 1964 to 1970, winning three elections during the regime of PCN president, [[Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo]], who allowed free elections for mayors and the National Assembly. Duarte later ran for president with a political grouping called the [[National Opposition Union ()|National Opposition Union]] (UNO) but was defeated in the 1972 presidential elections. He lost to the ex-minister of interior, Colonel [[Arturo Armando Molina]], in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent; Molina was declared the winner even though Duarte was said to have received a majority of the votes. Duarte, at some army officers' requests, supported a revolt to protest the election fraud, but was captured, tortured and later exiled. Duarte returned to the country in 1979 to enter politics after working on projects in  as an engineer.

[[Carlos Humberto Romero]] was the final president of the [[Military dictatorship in |country's military dictatorship which began in 1931]]. The U.S. had been Romero's biggest supporter, but by October 1979, the Carter administration decided that  needed regime change.

On 15 October 1979, a [[1979  coup d'état|coup d'état]] brought the [[Revolutionary Government Junta of |Revolutionary Government Junta]] (JRG) to power. It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land. The purpose of this new junta was to stop the revolutionary movement already underway in response to Duarte's stolen election. Nevertheless, the oligarchy opposed [[agrarian reform]], and a junta formed with young reformist elements from the army such as Colonels [[Adolfo Arnoldo Majano]] and [[Jaime Abdul Gutiérrez]], as well as with progressives such as [[Guillermo Ungo]] and Alvarez.

[[File: O.Romero 1979 autographed photo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Archbishop Romero]] spoke out against social injustice and violence amid the escalating conflict between the military government and left-wing insurgents that led to the  Civil War.]]

Pressure from the oligarchy soon dissolved the junta because of its inability to control the army in its repression of the people fighting for unionization rights, agrarian reform, better wages, accessible health care and freedom of expression. In the meantime, the guerrilla movement was spreading to all sectors of  society. Middle and high school students were organized in MERS (Movimiento Estudiantil Revolucionario de Secundaria, Revolutionary Movement of Secondary Students); college students were involved with AGEUS (Asociacion de Estudiantes Universitarios Salvadorenos; Association of  College Students); and workers were organized in BPR (Bloque Popular Revolucionario, Popular Revolutionary Block). In October 1980, several other major guerrilla groups of the  left had formed the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]], or FMLN. By the end of the 1970s, government-contracted death squads were killing about 10 people each day. Meanwhile, the FMLN had 6,000 to 8,000 active guerrillas and hundreds of thousands of part-time militia, supporters, and sympathizers.

The U.S. supported and financed the creation of a second junta to change the political environment and stop the spread of a leftist insurrection. Napoleón Duarte was recalled from his exile in  to head this new junta. However, a revolution was already underway and his new role as head of the junta was seen by the general population as opportunistic. He was unable to influence the outcome of the insurrection.

[[Óscar Romero]], the [[Roman Catholic]] Archbishop of San Salvador, denounced injustices and massacres committed against civilians by government forces. He was considered "the voice of the voiceless", but he was assassinated by a [[Death squads in |death squad]] while saying Mass on 24 March 1980. Some consider this to be the beginning of the full [[ Civil War]], which lasted from 1980 to 1992.

An unknown number of people "disappeared" during the conflict, and the UN reports that more than 75,000 were killed. The [[ Army]]'s US-trained [[Atlácatl Battalion]] was responsible for the [[El Mozote massacre]] where more than 800 civilians were murdered, over half of them children, the [[El Calabozo massacre]], and the [[murder of UCA scholars]].

On 16 January 1992, the government of , represented by president [[Alfredo Cristiani]], and the FMLN, represented by the commanders of the five guerrilla groups – [[Schafik Hándal]], [[Joaquín Villalobos]], [[Salvador Sánchez Cerén]], Francisco Jovel and [[Fermán Cienfuegos|Eduardo Sancho]], all signed peace agreements brokered by the United Nations ending the 12-year civil war. This event, held at [[Chapultepec Castle]] in , was attended by U.N. dignitaries and other representatives of the international community. After signing the armistice, the president stood and shook hands with the newly ex-guerrilla commanders, an action which was widely admired.

=== Post-war (1992–2019) ===
The [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]] mandated reductions in the size of the army, and the dissolution of the National Police, the Treasury Police, the National Guard and the Civilian Defence, a paramilitary group. A new Civil Police was to be organized. Judicial immunity for crimes committed by the armed forces ended; the government agreed to submit to the recommendations of a [[Commission on the Truth for ]] ''(Comisión de la Verdad Para )'', which would "investigate serious acts of violence occurring since 1980, and the nature and effects of the violence, and...recommend methods of promoting national reconciliation". In 1993 the Commission delivered its findings reporting human rights violations on both sides of the conflict. Five days later the  legislature passed an amnesty law for all acts of violence during the period.

From 1989 until 2004,  favoured the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]] (ARENA), voting in ARENA presidents in every election ([[Alfredo Cristiani]], [[Armando Calderón Sol]], [[Francisco Flores Pérez]], [[Antonio Saca]]) until 2009. The unsuccessful attempts of the left-wing party to win presidential elections led to its selection of a journalist rather than a former guerrilla leader as a candidate. On 15 March 2009, [[Mauricio Funes]], a television figure, became the first president from the FMLN. He was inaugurated on 1 June 2009. One focus of the Funes government has been revealing the alleged corruption from the past government.

ARENA formally expelled Saca from the party in December 2009. With 12 loyalists in the National Assembly, Saca established his own party, the [[Grand Alliance for National Unity]] (GANA), and entered into a tactical legislative alliance with the FMLN.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}} After three years in office, with Saca's GANA party providing the FMLN with a legislative majority, Funes had not taken action to either investigate or to bring corrupt former officials to justice.

Economic reforms since the early 1990s brought major benefits in terms of improved social conditions, diversification of the export sector, and access to international financial markets at investment grade level. Crime remains a major problem for the investment climate. Early in the new millennium, 's government created the Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales&nbsp;— the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN)&nbsp;— in response to climate change concerns.  adopted the [[ dollar]] as its currency on 1 January 2001.

In March 2014, former FMLN guerrilla leader Cerén narrowly won the [[2014  presidential election|election]]. He was sworn in as president on 31 May 2014. He was the first former guerrilla to become the president of .

In October 2017, an  court ruled that former president Funes and one of his sons had illegally enriched themselves. Funes had sought asylum in  in 2016.

In September 2018, former president Saca was sentenced to 10 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to diverting more than US$300 million in state funds to his own businesses and third parties.

=== 2019–present ===

[[File: Nayib Bukele talks at his inauguration ceremony.jpg|thumb|Nayib Bukele speaks at his inauguration ceremony.]]
On 1 June 2019, [[Nayib Bukele]] became the new president of . Bukele was the winner of February [[2019  presidential election|2019 presidential election]]. He represented GANA, as he was denied participating with the newly formed Nuevas Ideas party. ARENA and the FMLN, 's two main parties, had dominated politics in  over the past three decades.

According to a report by the [[International Crisis Group]] (ICG) 2020, the homicide rate in  had dropped by as much as 60% since Bukele became president in June 2019. Although the government officially denied any collusion with organised crime, press reports based on testimony from government members and security officials stated a "non-aggression deal" between parts of the government and the gangs existed.

The party [[Nuevas Ideas]] (NI, "New Ideas"), founded by Bukele, with its ally (GANA) won around 63% of the vote in the February 2021 [[2021  legislative election|legislative elections]]. His party and allies won 61 seats, well over the coveted supermajority of 56 seats in the 84-seat parliament, allowing for uncontested decisions at the legislative level. The supermajority permits President Bukele's party to appoint judiciary members and pass laws with little to no opposition, for instance, to remove presidential term limits.

On 8 June 2021, at the initiative of President Bukele, pro-government deputies in the [[Legislative Assembly of |Legislative Assembly]] voted [[Bitcoin Law|legislation]] to make [[bitcoin]] [[legal tender]] in . In September 2021, 's Supreme Court ruled to allow Bukele to run for a second term in 2024, despite the fact that the constitution prohibits the president to serve two consecutive terms in office. The decision was organized by judges appointed to the court by Bukele. On 25 February 2021,  became the first Central  country to be awarded certification for the elimination of [[malaria]] by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]].

In January 2022, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) urged  to reverse its decision to make [[cryptocurrency]] legal tender. Bitcoin had rapidly lost about half of its value, meaning economic difficulties and, as of May 2022, with government bonds trading at 40% of their original value, the prospect of a looming [[sovereign default]]; however, as of April 2025, the value of bitcoin since it was declared legal tender is trading twice the price that it was when  made it legal tender. Bukele announced back in January 2022 plans to build [[Bitcoin City]] at the base of a volcano in .

In 2022, the  government initiated a massive [[2022  gang crackdown|fight against criminal gangs]] and gang-related violence. A state of emergency was declared on 27 March and was extended on 20 July. More than 53,000 suspected gang members were arrested, precipitating the highest reported [[List of countries by incarceration rate|incarceration rate]] in the world. The crackdown has reportedly produced hundreds of deaths of detainees, with international human rights organizations such as [[Amnesty International]] declaring it the worst abuse of human rights in the country since its civil war.

On 30 November 2023, the Legislative Assembly granted Bukele and Vice President Felix Ulloa a leave of absence so that they could focus on their [[2024  presidential election|2024 re-election campaign]]. Bukele was succeeded by [[Claudia Rodríguez de Guevara]] as acting president, the first female president in  history.

In January 2024, it was announced that homicide rate dropped nearly 70% year over year, with 154 in 2023 compared to 495 homicides in 2022. On 4 February 2024, Bukele won re-election with 84% of the vote in the [[2024  presidential election|presidential election]]. His party Nuevas Ideas won 58 of the parliament's 60 seats. On 1 June 2024, he was sworn in for his second five-year term. In February 2025, ’s Congress agreed to remove Bitcoin's legal tender status, following pressure from the [[International Monetary Fund]]. In late-July 2025, the Legislative Assembly approved of changes to the [[Constitution of ]], which would remove presidential term-limits, and extend individual terms from 5 years to 6. The Legislative Assembly also moved the next presidential election from 2029 to [[2027  presidential election|2027]] (making it coterminous with [[2027  legislative election|the legislative elections]] that year), after which the constitutional changes would take effect.

Excavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now  at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world. An important site of early historical activities, many believe that  compares to [[]] in the historical value of its archaeological sites. Artifacts typical of the [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]], and [[Iron Age]]s have been found in . Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of [[Mundigak]] (near [[Kandahar]] in the south of the country) was a center of the [[Helmand culture]]. More recent findings established that the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] stretched up towards modern-day . An Indus Valley site has been found on the [[Oxus River]] at [[Shortugai]] in northern .

After 2000 BCE successive waves of semi-nomadic people from Central Asia began moving south into ; among them were many [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]-speaking [[Indo-]]. These tribes later migrated further into South Asia, Western Asia, and toward Europe via the area north of the [[Caspian Sea]]. The region at the time was referred to as [[Ariana]]. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenids overthrew the [[Medes]] and incorporated [[Arachosia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]], and [[Bactria]] within its eastern boundaries. An [[Epigraphy|inscription]] on the tombstone of [[Darius I of Persia]] mentions the [[Kabulistan|Kabul Valley]] in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered. The region of [[Arachosia]], around [[Kandahar]] in modern-day southern , used to be primarily Zoroastrian and played a key role in the transfer of the Avesta to [[Persis|Persia]] and is thus considered by some to be the "second homeland of Zoroastrianism".
[[File:ScythianBelt.jpg|thumb|A "Bactrian gold" [[Scythian]] belt depicting [[Dionysus]], from [[Tillya Tepe]] in the ancient region of [[Bactria]]]]

[[Alexander the Great]] and his  forces arrived in  in 330 BCE after defeating [[Darius III of Persia]] a year earlier in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]]. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the [[Seleucid Empire]] controlled the region until 305 BCE, when they gave much of it to the [[Maurya Empire]] as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans controlled the area south of the [[Hindu Kush]] until they were overthrown in about 185 BCE. Their decline began 60 years after [[Ashoka]]'s rule ended, leading to the [[Hellenistic]] reconquest by the [[Greco-Bactrians]]. Much of it soon broke away and became part of the [[Indo- Kingdom]]. They were defeated and expelled by the [[Indo-Scythians]] in the late 2nd century BCE.{{sfn|Runion|2007|page=44}}
The [[Silk Road]] appeared during the first century BCE, and  flourished with trade, with routes to , , Persia, and north to the cities of [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]], and [[Khiva]] in present-day . Goods and ideas were exchanged at this center point, such as  silk, Persian silver and Roman gold, while the region of present  was mining and trading [[lapis lazuli]] stones mainly from the [[Badakhshan]] region.

During the first century BCE, the [[Parthian Empire]] subjugated the region but lost it to their [[Indo-Parthian]] vassals. In the mid-to-late first century CE the vast [[Kushan Empire]], centered in , became great patrons of Buddhist culture, making [[Buddhism]] flourish throughout the region. The Kushans were overthrown by the [[Sassanids]] in the 3rd century CE, though the [[Indo-Sassanids]] continued to rule at least parts of the region. They were followed by the [[Kidarite]]s who, in turn, was replaced by the [[Hephthalites]]. They were replaced by the [[Turk Shahi]] in the 7th century. The Buddhist Turk Shahi of Kabul was replaced by a Hindu dynasty before the Saffarids conquered the area in 870, this Hindu dynasty was called [[Hindu Shahi]]. Much of the northeastern and southern areas of the country remained dominated by [[Buddhist]] culture.

[[File:Ghurid Empire according to Schwartzberg Atlas, p.147.png|thumb|right|The [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurids]] originated from [[Ghor Province]] in central .]]

[[Arab]] [[Muslim]]s brought Islam to [[Herat]] and [[Zaranj]] in 642&nbsp;CE and began spreading eastward; some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted. Before the [[Islamic conquest of |arrival of Islam]], the region used to be home to various beliefs and cults, often resulting in [[Syncretism]] between the dominant religions such as [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Buddhism]] or [[Greco-Buddhism]], [[Ancient  religion]]s, [[Hinduism]], Christianity, and Judaism. An exemplification of the syncretism in the region would be that people were patrons of Buddhism but still worshipped local  gods such as [[Ahura Mazda]], [[Nana (Kushan goddess)|Lady Nana]], [[Anahita]] or [[Mithra|Mihr (Mithra)]] and portrayed [[ mythology| gods]] as protectors of Buddha. The [[Zunbils]] and Kabul Shahi were first conquered in 870&nbsp;CE by the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarid]] Muslims of Zaranj. Later, the [[Samanids]] extended their Islamic influence south of the Hindu Kush. The [[Ghaznavids]] rose to power in the 10th century.

By the 11th century, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] had defeated the remaining Hindu rulers and effectively [[Islamized]] the wider region,{{sfn|Ewans|2002|page=22–23}} with the exception of [[Kafiristan]]. Mahmud made [[Ghazni]] into an important city and patronized intellectuals such as the historian [[Al-Biruni]] and the poet [[Ferdowsi]]. The [[Ghaznavid dynasty]] was [[Siege of Lahore (1186)|overthrown by the Ghurids in 1186]], whose architectural achievements included the remote [[Minaret of Jam]].

In 1219 CE, [[Genghis Khan]] and his [[Mongol invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire|Mongol army overran the region]]. His troops are said to have annihilated the Khwarazmian cities of [[Herat]] and [[Balkh]] as well as [[Siege of Bamyan|Bamyan]]. The destruction caused by the Mongols forced many locals to return to an agrarian rural society. Mongol rule continued with the [[Ilkhanate]] in the northwest while the [[Khalji dynasty]] administered the  tribal areas south of the Hindu Kush until the invasion of [[Timur]] (aka Tamerlane), who established the [[Timurid Empire]] in 1370. Under the rule of [[Shah Rukh]], the city of Herat served as the focal point of the [[Timurid Renaissance]], whose glory matched [[Florence]] of the [[ Renaissance]] as the center of a cultural rebirth.

In 1709, [[Mirwais Hotak]], a local [[Ghilzai]] tribal leader, successfully rebelled against the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]]. He defeated [[Gurgin Khan]], the  governor of Kandahar under the Safavids, and established his own kingdom. Mirwais died in 1715, and was succeeded by his brother [[Abdul Aziz Hotak|Abdul Aziz]], who was soon killed by Mirwais's son [[Mahmud Hotak|Mahmud]] for possibly planning to sign a peace with the Safavids. Mahmud led the  army in 1722 to the Persian capital of [[Isfahan]], and captured the city after the [[Battle of Gulnabad]] and proclaimed himself King of Persia. The  dynasty was ousted from Persia by [[Nader Shah]] after the 1729 [[Battle of Damghan (1729)|Battle of Damghan]].

In 1738, [[Nader Shah]] and his [[Afsharid dynasty|forces]] captured Kandahar in the [[siege of Kandahar]], the last Hotak stronghold, from Shah [[Hussain Hotak]]. Soon after, the Persian and  forces [[Nader Shah's invasion of |invaded ]], Nader Shah had plundered Delhi, alongside his 16-year-old commander, [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] who had assisted him on these campaigns. Nader Shah was assassinated in 1747.

===Durrani Empire===
{{Main|Durrani Empire|Ahmad Shah Durrani}}

After the death of Nader Shah in 1747, [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] had returned to Kandahar with a contingent of 4,000 [[Pashtuns]]. The Abdalis had "unanimously accepted" Ahmad Shah as their new leader. With his ascension in 1747, Ahmad Shah had led multiple campaigns against the [[Mughal empire]], [[Maratha empire]], and then-receding [[Afsharid |Afsharid empire]]. Ahmad Shah had captured [[Kabul]] and [[Peshawar]] from the Mughal appointed governor, Nasir Khan. Ahmad Shah had then conquered [[Herat]] in 1750, and had also captured [[Kashmir]] in 1752. Ahmad Shah had launched two campaigns into [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], 1750–1751 and 1754–1755. His first campaign had seen the siege of [[Mashhad]], however, he was forced to retreat after four months. In November 1750, he moved to siege [[Khanate of Nishapur|Nishapur]], but he was unable to capture the city and was forced to retreat in early 1751. [[Durrani Campaign to Khorasan (1754-55)|Ahmad Shah returned in 1754]]; he captured [[Ferdows|Tun]], and on 23 July, he sieged [[Mashhad]] once again. Mashhad had fallen on 2 December, but [[Shahrokh Shah|Shahrokh]] was [[Afsharid |reappointed]] in 1755. He was forced to give up [[Torshiz]], [[Bakharz]], [[Torbat-e Jam|Jam]], [[Khaf, |Khaf]], and [[Torbat-e Heydarieh|Turbat-e Haidari]] to the , as well as accept  sovereignty. Following this, Ahmad Shah sieged [[Khanate of Nishapur|Nishapur]] once again, and captured it.

He met Mughal armies at the [[Battle of Manupur (1748)]], where he was defeated and forced to retreat back to . He returned the next year in 1749 and captured the area around [[Lahore]] and [[Punjab]], presenting it as an  victory for this campaign.{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=122–123}} From 1749 to 1767, Ahmad Shah led six more invasions, the most important being the last; the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] created a power vacuum in northern , halting [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] expansion.

Ahmad Shah Durrani died in October 1772, and a civil war over succession followed, with his named successor, [[Timur Shah Durrani]], succeeding him after the defeat of his brother, Suleiman Mirza.{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=149}} Timur Shah Durrani ascended to the throne in November 1772, having defeated a coalition under Shah Wali Khan and Humayun Mirza. Timur Shah began his reign by consolidating power toward himself and people loyal to him, purging Durrani Sardars and influential tribal leaders in [[Kabul]] and [[Kandahar]]. One of Timur Shah's reforms was to move the capital of the [[Durrani Empire]] from [[Kandahar]] to [[Kabul]]. Timur Shah fought multiple series of rebellions to consolidate the empire, and he also led campaigns into [[Punjab]] against the Sikhs like his father, though more successfully. The most prominent example of his battles during this campaign was when he led his forces under Zangi Khan Durrani – with over 18,000 men total of , Qizilbash, and Mongol cavalrymen – against over 60,000 Sikh men. The Sikhs lost over 30,000 in this battle and staged a Durrani resurgence in the [[Punjab]] region. The Durranis lost [[Multan]] in 1772 after Ahmad Shah's death. Following this victory, Timur Shah was able to lay siege to [[Multan]] and recapture it, incorporating it into the Durrani Empire once again, reintegrating it as a province until the [[Siege of Multan (1818)]]. Timur Shah was succeeded by his son [[Zaman Shah Durrani]] after his death in May 1793. Timur Shah's reign oversaw the attempted stabilization and consolidation of the empire. However, Timur Shah had over 24 sons, which plunged the empire in civil war over succession crises.{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=155}}

[[Zaman Shah Durrani]] succeeded to the [[Durrani Empire|Durrani Throne]] following the death of his father, Timur Shah Durrani. His brothers [[Mahmud Shah Durrani]] and Humayun Mirza revolted against him, with Humayun centered in [[Kandahar]] and Mahmud Shah centered in [[Herat]].{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=158}} Zaman Shah would defeat Humayun and force the loyalty of Mahmud Shah Durrani.{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=158}} Securing his position on the throne, Zaman Shah led three campaigns into [[Punjab]].

By the early 19th century, the  empire was under threat from the [[Qajar dynasty|Persians]] in the west and the [[Sikh Empire]] in the east. [[Fateh Khan Barakzai|Fateh Khan]], leader of the [[Barakzai dynasty|Barakzai tribe]], installed many of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire. Fateh Khan was [[Torture and Execution of Fateh Khan Barakzai|brutally murdered]] in 1818 by [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]]. As a result, the brothers of Fateh Khan and the [[Barakzai]] tribe rebelled, and a civil war brewed. During this turbulent period,  fractured into many states, including the [[Principality of Qandahar]], [[Herat (1793–1863)|Emirate of Herat]], [[Kunduz Khanate|Khanate of Qunduz]], [[Maimana Khanate]], and numerous other warring polities. The most prominent state was the [[Emirate of |Emirate of Kabul]], ruled by [[Dost Mohammad Khan]].

With the collapse of the Durrani Empire, and the exile of the [[Durrani dynasty|Sadozai Dynasty]] to be left to rule in [[Herat (1793–1863)|Herat]], Punjab and Kashmir were lost to [[Ranjit Singh]], ruler of the [[Sikh Empire]], who invaded [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] in March 1823 and captured the city of [[Peshawar]] following the [[Battle of Nowshera]]. In 1834, Dost Mohammad Khan led numerous campaigns, firstly [[Dost Mohammad's Campaign to Jalalabad (1834)|campaigning to Jalalabad]], and then allying with his rival brothers in [[Principality of Qandahar|Kandahar]] to defeat [[Shah Shuja Durrani]] and the  in the [[Expedition of Shuja ul-Mulk]].{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=205}} In 1837, Dost Mohammad Khan attempted to conquer Peshawar and sent a large force under his son [[Wazir Akbar Khan]], leading to the [[Battle of Jamrud]]. [[Wazir Akbar Khan|Akbar Khan]] and the  army failed to capture the [[Jamrud Fort]] from the [[Sikh Khalsa Army]], but killed Sikh Commander [[Hari Singh Nalwa]], thus ending the [[-Sikh Wars]]. By this time the  were advancing from the east, capitalizing on the decline of the Sikh Empire after it had its own period of turbulence following the death of [[Ranjit Singh]], which engaged the [[Emirate of |Emirate of Kabul]] in the [[First Anglo- War|first major conflict]] during "[[The Great Game]]".

In 1839 a [[ Army|]] expeditionary force marched into , invading the [[Principality of Qandahar]], and in August 1839, seized [[Kabul]]. Dost Mohammad Khan defeated the  in the [[Parwan Campaign (1840)|Parwan campaign]], but surrendered following his victory. He was replaced with the former Durrani ruler [[Shah Shuja Durrani]] as the new [[List of heads of state of |ruler]] of [[Kabul]], a de facto puppet of the .

Following this, Dost Mohammad pursued a myriad of campaigns to unite most of  in his reign, launching numerous incursions including against the surrounding states such as the [[Hazarajat Campaign of 1843|Hazarajat campaign]], [[ Conquest of Balkh|conquest of Balkh]], [[ Conquest of Kunduz|conquest of Kunduz]], and the [[conquest of Kandahar]]. Dost Mohammad led his final campaign against [[Herat (1793–1863)|Herat]], conquering it and re-uniting . During his campaigns of re-unification, he held friendly relations with the  despite the First Anglo- War, and affirmed their status in the [[Second Anglo- Treaty (1857)|Second Anglo- treaty]] of 1857, while [[Emirate of Bukhara|Bukhara]] and internal religious leaders pressured Dost Mohammad to invade  during the [[ Rebellion of 1857]].

Dost Mohammad died in June 1863, a few weeks after his successful [[Herat campaign of 1862–1863|campaign]] to Herat. Following his death, a civil war ensued among his sons, prominently [[Mohammad Afzal Khan]], [[Mohammad Azam Khan]], and [[Sher Ali Khan]]. Sher Ali won the resulting [[ Civil War (1863–1869)]] and ruled  until his death in 1879. In his final years, the  returned to  in the [[Second Anglo- War]] to fight perceived  influence in the region. Sher Ali retreated to northern , intending to create a resistance there similar to his predecessors, Dost Mohammad Khan, and Wazir Akbar Khan. His untimely death however, saw [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan|Yaqub Khan]] declared the new Amir, leading to Britain gaining control of 's foreign relations as part of the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] of 1879, making it an official [[ Protectorate| Protected State]].{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=359-366}} [[Siege of the  Residency in Kabul|An uprising]] however, re-started the conflict, and Yaqub Khan was deposed. During this tumultuous period, [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] began his rise to power, becoming an eligible candidate to become Amir after he seized [[Second Anglo- War#Exploits of Abdur Rahman Khan|much of Northern ]]. Abdur Rahman marched on [[Kabul]], and was declared Amir, being recognized by the  as well. Another uprising by [[Ayub Khan (Emir of )|Ayub Khan]] threatened the , where rebels confronted and defeated  forces in the [[Battle of Maiwand]].

During the [[First World War]], when  was neutral, Habibullah Khan was met by officials of the central powers in the [[Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition]]. They called on  to declare full independence from the , join them and attack  , as part of the [[Hindu– Conspiracy]]. The effort to bring  into the Central Powers failed, but it sparked discontent among the population about maintaining neutrality with the . Habibullah was assassinated in February 1919, and [[Amanullah Khan]] eventually assumed power. A staunch supporter of the 1915–1916 expeditions, Amanullah Khan invaded  , beginning the [[Third Anglo- War]], and entering   via the [[Khyber Pass]].

[[File:King Amanullah standing.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Amanullah Khan]] proclaimed himself [[King of ]] in June 1926.]]

After the end of the Third Anglo- War and the signing of the [[Anglo- Treaty of 1919|Treaty of Rawalpindi]] on 19 August 1919, [[Emir of |Emir]] Amanullah Khan declared the [[Emirate of ]] a [[sovereign state|sovereign]] and fully [[independent state]]. He moved to end his country's traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community, particularly with the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Weimar Republic]]. He proclaimed himself [[King of ]] on 9 June 1926, forming the [[Kingdom of ]]. He introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was [[Mahmud Tarzi]], an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of 's 1923 [[constitution of |constitution]], which made elementary education compulsory. [[Slavery]] was abolished in 1923. King Amanullah's wife, [[Soraya Tarzi|Queen Soraya]], was an important figure during this period in the fight for woman's education and against their oppression.

Some of the reforms, such as the abolition of the traditional [[burqa]] for women and the opening of co-educational schools, alienated many tribal and religious leaders, leading to the [[ Civil War (1928–1929)]]. King Amanullah abdicated in January 1929, and soon after Kabul fell to [[Saqqawist]] forces led by [[Habibullah Kalakani]]. [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]], Amanullah's cousin, defeated and killed Kalakani in October 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah. He abandoned the reforms of King Amanullah in favor of a more gradual approach to modernization, but was assassinated in 1933 by [[Abdul Khaliq Hazara (assassin)|Abdul Khaliq]].

Mohammed Zahir Shah succeeded to the throne and reigned as king from 1933 to 1973. During the [[ tribal revolts of 1944–1947|tribal revolts of 1944–1947]], King Zahir's reign was challenged by [[Zadran (Pashtun tribe)|Zadran]], [[Safi (Pashtun tribe)|Safi]], [[Mangal (Pashtun tribe)|Mangal]], and [[Wazir (Pashtun tribe)|Wazir]] tribesmen led by [[Mazrak Zadran]], [[Salemai]], and [[Faqir Ipi|Mirzali Khan]], among others – many of whom were [[Amanullah loyalist]]s.  joined the [[League of Nations]] in 1934. The 1930s saw the development of roads, infrastructure, the founding of a [[Da  Bank|national bank]], and increased education. Road links in the north played a large part in a growing cotton and textile industry. The country built close relationships with the [[Axis powers]], with [[Nazi ]] having the largest share in  development at the time.

Until 1946 King Zahir ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of [[Prime Minister of |prime minister]] and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another uncle, [[Shah Mahmud Khan]], became prime minister in 1946 and experimented with allowing greater political freedom. He was replaced in 1953 by [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], a [[Pashtun]] nationalist who sought the creation of a [[Pashtunistan]], leading to highly tense relations with . Daoud Khan pressed for social modernization reforms and sought a closer relationship with the [[Soviet Union]]. Afterward, the [[1964 Constitution of |1964 constitution]] was formed, and the first non-royal prime minister was sworn in.

Zahir Shah, like his father Nadir Shah, had a policy of maintaining national independence while pursuing gradual modernization, creating nationalist feeling, and improving relations with the .  was neither a participant in [[World War II]] nor aligned with either power bloc in the [[Cold War]]. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the  vied for influence by building 's main highways, airports, and other vital infrastructure.

In April 1978, the communist [[People's Democratic Party of ]] (PDPA) seized power in a bloody coup d'état against then-President [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], in what is called the [[Saur Revolution]]. The PDPA declared the establishment of the [[Democratic Republic of ]], with its first leader named as [[People's Democratic Party of |People's Democratic Party]] General Secretary [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]].{{sfn|Ewans|2002|page=186–88}} This would trigger a series of events that would dramatically turn  from a peaceful (albeit poor and secluded) country to a hotbed of conflict and terrorism. The PDPA initiated various social, symbolic, and land distribution reforms that provoked strong opposition, while also brutally oppressing political dissidents. This caused unrest and quickly expanded into a state of [[ conflict|civil war]] by 1979, waged by guerrilla ''[[mujahideen]]'' (and smaller [[Maoist]] guerrillas) against regime forces countrywide. It quickly turned into a [[proxy war]] as the  government provided these rebels with covert training centers, the  [[Operation Cyclone|supported]] them through 's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI), and the [[Soviet Union]] sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA regime. Meanwhile, there was increasingly hostile friction between the competing factions of the PDPA&nbsp;– the dominant [[Khalq]] and the more moderate [[Parcham]].

In October 1979, PDPA General Secretary Taraki was assassinated in an internal coup orchestrated by then-prime minister [[Hafizullah Amin]], who became the new general secretary of the PDPA. The situation in the country deteriorated under Amin, and thousands of people went missing. Displeased with Amin's government, the [[Soviet Army]] invaded the country in December 1979, heading for Kabul and killing Amin.{{sfn|Barfield|2012|page=234}} A Soviet-organized regime, led by Parcham's [[Babrak Karmal]] but inclusive of both factions (Parcham and Khalq), filled the vacuum. Soviet troops in more substantial numbers were deployed to stabilize  under Karmal, marking the beginning of the [[Soviet– War]]. Lasting nine years, the war caused the deaths of between 562,000 and 2&nbsp;million ,{{efn|Attributed to multiple sources: }} and displaced about 6&nbsp;million people who subsequently fled , mainly to [[ in |]] and [[ in |]]. Heavy air bombardment destroyed many countryside villages, millions of [[landmine]]s were planted, and some cities such as [[Herat]] and [[Kandahar]] were also damaged from bombardment. After the [[Soviet withdrawal from |Soviet withdrawal]], another [[ Civil War (1989-92)|civil war ensued]] until the communist regime under PDPA leader [[Mohammad Najibullah]] collapsed in 1992.{{sfn|Barfield|2012|pp=239, 244}}

The Soviet– War had drastic social effects on . The militarization of society led to heavily armed police, private bodyguards, openly armed civil defense groups and the like becoming the norm in  for decades thereafter. The traditional power structure had shifted from clergy, community elders, intelligentsia, and military in favor of powerful [[warlords]].

Another civil war broke out after the [[Peshawar Accords|creation]] of a dysfunctional coalition [[Islamic State of |government]] between leaders of various ''mujahideen'' factions. Amid a state of anarchy and factional infighting, various ''mujahideen'' factions committed widespread rape, murder and extortion, while Kabul was heavily bombarded and partially destroyed by the fighting. Several failed reconciliations and alliances occurred between different leaders. The [[Taliban]] emerged in September 1994 as a movement and militia of students (''talib'') from Islamic [[Madrassas in |madrassas (schools) in ]], who soon had military support from .

Taking control of [[Kandahar]] city that year, they conquered more territories until finally driving out the government of [[Burhanuddin Rabbani|Rabbani]] from Kabul in 1996, where they established an [[Islamic Emirate of  (1996–2001)|emirate]]. The Taliban were condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic [[sharia]] law, which resulted in the brutal treatment of many , especially [[Taliban treatment of women|women]]. During their rule, the Taliban and their allies committed massacres against  civilians, denied UN food supplies to starving civilians and conducted a policy of [[scorched earth]], burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes.{{efn|Attributed to multiple sources: }}

In December 2001, after the Taliban government was overthrown, the [[ Interim Administration]] under [[Hamid Karzai]] was formed. The [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) was established by the [[UN Security Council]] to help assist the [[Karzai administration]] and provide basic security.

The  government was able to build some democratic structures, adopting a constitution in 2004 with the name [[Islamic Republic of ]]. Attempts were made, often with the support of foreign donor countries, to improve the country's economy, healthcare, education, transport, and agriculture. ISAF forces also began to train the [[ National Security Forces]]. Following 2002, nearly five million [[ diaspora|]] were repatriated. The number of NATO troops present in  peaked at 140,000 in 2011, dropping to about 16,000 in 2018. In September 2014 [[Ashraf Ghani]] became president after the [[ presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]] where for the first time in 's history power was democratically transferred. On 28 December 2014, NATO formally ended ISAF combat operations and transferred full security responsibility to the  government. The NATO-led [[Operation Resolute Support]] was formed the same day as a successor to ISAF. Thousands of NATO troops remained in the country to train and advise  government forces and continue their fight against the Taliban. A report titled ''Body Count'' concluded that 106,000–170,000 civilians had been killed as a result of the fighting in  at the hands of all parties to the conflict.

On 19 February 2020, the [[US–Taliban deal]] was made in . The deal was one of the critical events that caused the collapse of the [[ National Security Forces]] (ANSF); following the signing of the deal, the US dramatically reduced the number of air attacks and deprived the ANSF of a critical edge in fighting the [[Taliban insurgency]], leading to the Taliban takeover of Kabul.

===Second Taliban era===
{{Further|Aftermath of the  War (2001–2021)}}

NATO Secretary General [[Jens Stoltenberg]] announced on 14 April 2021 that the alliance had agreed to start [[2020–2021 US troop withdrawal from |withdrawing its troops from ]] by 1 May. Soon after NATO troops began withdrawing, the [[Taliban]] launched an [[2021 Taliban offensive|offensive against the  government]] and quickly advanced in front of collapsing  government forces. The Taliban [[Fall of Kabul (2021)|captured the capital city of Kabul]] on 15 August 2021, after regaining control over a vast majority of . Several foreign diplomats and  government officials, including president Ashraf Ghani, were evacuated from the country, with many  civilians attempting to flee along with them.

However, by 6 September, the Taliban had taken control of most of [[Panjshir province]], with resistance fighters retreating to the mountains. Clashes in the valley ceased mid-September.

According to the [[Costs of War Project]], 176,000 people were killed in the conflict, including 46,319 civilians, between 2001 and 2021. According to the [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]], at least 212,191 people were killed in the conflict. Though the state of war in the country ended in 2021, armed conflict persists in some regions amid [[Islamic State–Taliban conflict|fighting between the Taliban and the local branch of the Islamic State]], as well as an anti-Taliban [[Republican insurgency in |Republican insurgency]].

The Taliban government is led by [[Head of the Islamic Emirate of |supreme leader]] [[Hibatullah Akhundzada]] and acting prime minister [[Hasan Akhund]], who took office on 7 September 2021. Akhund is one of the four founders of the Taliban and was a deputy prime minister of the previous emirate; his appointment was seen as a compromise between moderates and hardliners. A [[Cabinet of |new, all-male cabinet]] was formed, which included [[Abdul Hakim Haqqani]] as minister of justice. On 20 September 2021, [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] [[António Guterres]] received a letter from acting [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs ()|minister of foreign affairs]] [[Amir Khan Muttaqi]] to formally claim 's seat as a member state for their official spokesman in [[Doha]], [[Suhail Shaheen]]. The United Nations did not recognize the previous Taliban government and chose to work with the then government-in-exile instead.

Western nations suspended most of their humanitarian aid to  following the Taliban's August 2021 takeover of the country; the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] also halted their payments. More than half of 's 39 million people faced an acute [[Food security|food shortage]] in October 2021. Human Rights Watch reported on 11 November 2021 that  was facing widespread [[famine]] due to an economic and banking crisis.

The [[Taliban]] have significantly tackled corruption, improving on the [[Corruption Perceptions Index|corruption perceptions index]] from 174th to 150th best out of 180 countries from 2021 to 2022, but dropping to 162nd in 2023. The Taliban have also reportedly reduced bribery and extortion in public service areas.

The earliest evidences of human presence in  territory have been dated to approximately 12,500 [[Common Era|BCE]] in the [[Huaca Prieta]] settlement.  Andean societies were based on agriculture, using techniques such as [[irrigation]] and [[Terrace (earthworks)|terracing]]; [[camelid]] husbandry and fishing were also important. Organization relied on [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] and [[Redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]] because these societies had no notion of market or money. The oldest known complex society in , the [[Caral–Supe civilization|Caral-Supe civilization]], flourished along the coast of the Pacific Ocean between 3,000 and 1,800 BCE. These early developments were followed by archaeological cultures that developed mostly around the coastal and Andean regions throughout . The [[Cupisnique]] culture which flourished from around 1000 to 200 BCE along what is now 's [[Pacific coast]] was an example of early pre-[[Inca Empire|Inca culture]].
[[File:Moche_earrings.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Moche culture|Moche]] earrings depicting warriors, made of turquoise and gold (1–800 CE)]]
The [[Chavín culture]] that developed from 1500 to 300 BCE was probably more of a religious than a political phenomenon, with their religious center in [[Chavín de Huantar]]. After the decline of the Chavin culture around the beginning of the 1st century CE, a series of localized and specialized cultures rose and fell, both on the coast and in the highlands, during the next thousand years. On the coast, these included the civilizations of the [[Paracas culture|Paracas]], [[Nazca culture|Nazca]], [[Wari culture|Wari]], and the more outstanding [[Chimú culture|Chimu]] and [[Moche culture|Moche]].

The Moche, who reached their apogee in the first millennium CE, were renowned for their irrigation system which fertilized their arid terrain, their sophisticated ceramic pottery, their lofty buildings, and clever metalwork. The Chimu were the great city builders of pre-Inca civilization; as a loose confederation of walled cities scattered along the coast of northern , the Chimu flourished from about 1140 to 1450. Their capital was at [[Chan Chan]] outside of modern-day [[Trujillo, |Trujillo]]. In the highlands, both the [[Tiwanaku Empire|Tiahuanaco]] culture, near [[Lake Titicaca]] in both  and , and the Wari culture, near the present-day city of [[Ayacucho]], developed large urban settlements and wide-ranging state systems between 500 and 1000 CE.

In the 15th century, the [[Inca Empire|Incas]] emerged as a powerful state which, in the span of a century, formed the [[Inca Empire|largest empire]] in the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian Americas]] with their capital in [[Cusco]]. The Incas of Cusco originally represented one of the small and relatively minor ethnic groups, the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]]. Gradually, as early as the thirteenth century, they began to expand and incorporate their neighbors. Inca expansion was slow until about the middle of the fifteenth century, when the pace of conquest began to accelerate, particularly under the rule of the emperor [[Pachacuti]]. Under his rule and that of his son, [[Topa Inca Yupanqui]], the Incas came to control most of the Andean region, with a population of 9 to 16 million inhabitants under their rule. Pachacuti also promulgated a comprehensive code of laws to govern his far-flung empire, while consolidating his absolute temporal and spiritual authority as the God of the Sun who ruled from a magnificently rebuilt Cusco. 

From 1438 to 1533, the Incas used a variety of methods, from conquest to peaceful assimilation, to incorporate a large portion of western South America, centered on the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain ranges, from southern  to northern , between the Pacific Ocean in the west and the Amazon rainforest in the east. The official language of the empire was [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], although hundreds of local languages and dialects were spoken. The Inca referred to their empire as {{lang|qu|Tawantinsuyu}} which can be translated as "The Four Regions" or "The Four United Provinces." Many local forms of worship persisted in the empire, most of them concerning local sacred {{lang|qu|[[Huaca|Huacas]]}}, but the Inca leadership encouraged the worship of [[Inti]], the sun god and imposed its sovereignty above other cults such as that of [[Pachamama]]. The Incas considered their King, the [[Sapa Inca]], to be the "[[Solar deity|child of the sun]]."

===Conquest and colonial period===
{{main| conquest of |Viceroyalty of }}
[[File:Luis Montero - The Funerals of Inca Atahualpa - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.21|''Los funerales de Atahualpa'' (1867) by Luis Montero. [[Atahualpa]] was the last [[Sapa Inca]], executed by the Spaniards on 29 August 1533.]]
[[Atahualpa]] (or Atahuallpa), the last [[Sapa Inca]], became emperor when he defeated and executed his older half-brother [[Huáscar]] in a civil war sparked by the death of their father, Inca Huayna Capac. In December 1532, a party of conquistadors (supported by the [[Chanka|Chankas]], [[Huanca people|Huancas]], [[Cañari|Cañaris]] and [[Chachapoya culture|Chachapoyas]] as [[ auxiliaries]]) led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] defeated and captured the Inca Emperor Atahualpa in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]]. After years of preliminary exploration and military conflicts, it was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting but ended in  victory and colonization of the region known as the [[Viceroyalty of ]] with its capital at [[Lima]], which was then known as {{lang|es|La Ciudad de los Reyes}} (The City of Kings). The conquest of  led to spin-off campaigns throughout the viceroyalty as well as expeditions towards the Amazon Basin as in the case of  efforts to quell Amerindian resistance. The last Inca resistance was suppressed when the Spaniards annihilated the [[Neo-Inca State]] in [[Vilcabamba, |Vilcabamba]] in 1572.

The Indigenous population dramatically collapsed overwhelmingly due to epidemic diseases introduced by the  as well as exploitation and socio-economic change. Viceroy [[Francisco de Toledo]] reorganized the country in the 1570s with gold and silver mining as its main economic activity and Amerindian [[Mit'a|forced labor]] as its primary workforce. With the discovery of the great silver and gold lodes at [[Potosí]] (present-day ) and [[Huancavelica]], the viceroyalty flourished as an important provider of mineral resources.  [[bullion]] provided revenue for the  Crown and fueled a complex trade network that extended as far as Europe and the . The commercial and population exchanges between Latin America and Asia undergone via the [[Manila Galleon|Manila Galleons]] transiting through Acapulco, had [[Callao]] at  as the furthest endpoint of the trade route in the Americas. In relation to this, Don [[Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera]], governor of  was also responsible for settling [[Zamboanga City]] in the  by employing  soldiers and colonists. [[History of slavery#Americas|African slaves]] were added to the labor population to expand the workforce. The expansion of a colonial administrative apparatus and bureaucracy paralleled the economic reorganization.

With the conquest started the spread of Christianity in South America; most people were forcefully converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], with  clerics believing like Puritan divines of  colonies later that the Native Peoples "had been corrupted by the Devil", who was working "through them to frustrate" their foundations. It only took a generation to convert the population. They built churches in every city and replaced some of the Inca temples with churches, such as the [[Coricancha]] in the city of Cusco. The church employed the [[Inquisition]], making use of torture to ensure that newly converted Catholics did not stray to other religions or beliefs, and monastery schools, educating girls, especially of the Inca nobility and upper class, "until they were old enough either to profess [to become a nun] or to leave the monastery and assume the role ('estado') in the Christian society that their fathers planned to erect" in .  Catholicism follows the [[syncretism]] found in many Latin  countries, in which religious native rituals have been integrated with Christian celebrations. In this endeavor, the church came to play an important role in the [[acculturation]] of the Natives, drawing them into the cultural orbit of the  settlers.

[[File:TupacAmaruII.jpg|thumb|210x210px|[[Túpac Amaru II]]]]
By the 18th century, declining silver production and economic diversification greatly diminished royal income. In response, the Crown enacted the [[Bourbon Reforms]], a series of [[Edict|edicts]] that increased taxes and partitioned the [[Viceroyalty]]. The new laws provoked [[Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II|Túpac Amaru II's rebellion]] and other revolts, all of which were suppressed. As a result of these and other changes, the Spaniards and their [[Creole peoples|creole]] successors came to monopolize control over the land, seizing many of the best lands abandoned by the massive native depopulation. However, the  did not resist the [[ colonization of the Americas| expansion of ]] across the meridian. The [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] was rendered meaningless between 1580 and 1640 while [[Iberian Union| controlled ]]. The need to ease communication and trade with  led to the split of the viceroyalty and the creation of new viceroyalties of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] and [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Rio de la Plata]] at the expense of the territories that formed the [[Viceroyalty of ]]; this reduced the power, prominence and importance of Lima as the viceroyal capital and shifted the lucrative [[Andes|Andean]] trade to [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Bogotá]], while the fall of the mining and textile production accelerated the progressive decay of the Viceroyalty of .

Eventually, the viceroyalty would dissolve, as with much of the  empire, when challenged by national independence movements at the beginning of the nineteenth century. These movements led to the formation of the majority of modern-day countries of South America in the territories that at one point or another had constituted the Viceroyalty of . The conquest and colony brought a mix of cultures and ethnicities that did not exist before the  conquered the  territory. Even though many of the Inca traditions were lost or diluted, new customs, traditions and knowledge were added, creating a rich mixed  culture. Two of the most important Indigenous rebellions against the  were that of [[Juan Santos Atahualpa]] in 1742, and Rebellion of [[Túpac Amaru II]] in 1780 around the highlands near Cuzco.

[[File:Batalla_de_Ayacucho_by_Martín_Tovar_y_Tovar_(1827_-_1902).jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Battle of Ayacucho]] was decisive in ensuring  independence.|left]]
In the early 19th century, while most South  nations were swept by [[Decolonization of the Americas|wars of independence]],  remained a [[Royalist (  Revolution)|royalist]] stronghold. As the elite vacillated between emancipation and loyalty to the  monarchy, [[Independence of |independence]] was achieved only after the occupation by military campaigns of [[José de San Martín]] and [[Simón Bolívar]].

The economic crises, the loss of power of  in Europe, the [[ Revolutionary War|war of independence in North America]], and Native uprisings all contributed to a favorable climate to the development of emancipation ideas among the [[Criollo people|C''riollo'']] population in South America. However, the Criollo oligarchy in  enjoyed privileges and remained loyal to the  Crown. The liberation movement started in  where autonomous juntas were created as a result of the loss of authority of the  government over its colonies.

After fighting for the independence of the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata, [[José de San Martín]] created the [[Army of the Andes]] and [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes]] in 21 days. Once in , he joined forces with  army General [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] and liberated the country in the battles of [[Battle of Chacabuco|Chacabuco]] and [[Battle of Maipú|Maipú]] in 1818. On 7 September 1820, a fleet of eight warships arrived in the port of [[Paracas (municipality)|Paracas]] under the command of General José de San Martín and [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane]], who was serving in the  Navy. Immediately on 26 October, they took control of the town of [[Pisco, |Pisco]]. San Martín settled in [[Huacho]] on 12 November, where he established his headquarters while Cochrane sailed north and blockaded the port of [[Callao]] in Lima. At the same time in the north, [[Guayaquil]] was occupied by rebel forces under the command of Gregorio Escobedo. Because  was the stronghold of the  government in South America, San Martín's strategy to liberate  was to use diplomacy. He sent representatives to Lima urging the [[Viceroy]] that  be granted independence, however, all negotiations proved unsuccessful.

[[File:Proclamación de la Independencia del Perú - Juan Lepiani.jpg|thumb|San Martín proclaiming the independence of . Painting by [[Juan Lepiani]].]]
The Viceroy of , [[Joaquín de la Pezuela, 1st Marquess of Viluma|Joaquín de la Pazuela]] named [[José de la Serna, 1st Count of the Andes|José de la Serna]] commander-in-chief of the loyalist army to protect Lima from the threatened invasion by San Martín. On 29 January, de la Serna organized a [[Coup d'état|coup]] against de la Pazuela, which was recognized by  and he was named Viceroy of . This internal power struggle contributed to the success of the liberating army. To avoid a military confrontation, San Martín met the newly appointed viceroy, José de la Serna, and proposed to create a [[constitutional monarchy]], a proposal that was turned down. De la Serna abandoned the city, and on 12 July 1821, San Martín occupied Lima and declared  independence on 28 July 1821. He created the first  flag. [[Upper ]] (present-day ) remained as a  stronghold until the army of [[Simón Bolívar]] liberated it three years later. José de San Martín was declared Protector of .  national identity was forged during this period, as Bolivarian projects for a [[Congress of |Latin  Confederation]] floundered and a [[– Confederation|union with ]] proved ephemeral.

Simón Bolívar launched his campaign from the north, liberating the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] in the Battles of [[Battle of Carabobo|Carabobo]] in 1821 and [[Battle of Pichincha|Pichincha]] a year later. In July 1822, Bolívar and San Martín gathered in the [[Guayaquil Conference]]. Bolívar was left in charge of fully liberating  while San Martín retired from politics after the first parliament was assembled. The newly founded [[Congress of the Republic of | Congress]] named Bolívar dictator of , giving him the power to organize the military.

With the help of [[Antonio José de Sucre]], they defeated the larger  army in the [[Battle of Junín]] on 6 August 1824 and the decisive [[Battle of Ayacucho]] on 9 December of the same year, consolidating the independence of  and Upper . Upper  was later established as . During the early years of the Republic, endemic struggles for power between military leaders caused political instability.

===19th century===
Once independence was proclaimed, San Martín assumed military-political command of the free departments of , under the title of Protector, according to a decree given on 3 August 1821. The works of the Protectorate contributed to the creation of the National Library (in favor of knowledge), the approval of the National Anthem, and the abolition of the mita (in favor of the indigenous people). On 27 December 1821, San Martín created three ministries: Ministry of State and Foreign Affairs, committing Juan García del Río; [[ Armed Forces|Ministry of War and Navy]], to Bernardo de Monteagudo; and Ministry of Finance, to Hipólito Unanue.

From the 1840s to the 1860s  enjoyed [[Guano Era|a period of stability]] under the presidency of [[Ramón Castilla]], through increased state revenues from [[guano]] exports. In 1864, a  expedition occupied the Chincha Islands (guano producers) and unleashed an international incident with great consequences in  internal politics, which led to a coup d'état against President [[Juan Antonio Pezet]], Mariano's government. , with the help of [[]], [[]] and [[]], sent a declaration of war on . After the battle of Callao on 2 May 1866, the  Navy withdrew from . The government of José Balta was lavish in infrastructure works (construction of the Central Railway) although the first signs of excess government spending were already perceived. By the 1870s the guano resources had been depleted, the country was heavily indebted, and political in-fighting was again on the rise.
[[File:Angamos2.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Battle of Angamos]], during the [[War of the Pacific]]]]
By 1859, some 41,000  had died in the constant civil wars that shook the country since 1829. Thanks to the money from the sale of guano,  began to modernize with different public works such as railways; the civil and military bureaucracy grew; The indigenous people stopped paying tribute and the slaves achieved their freedom; The migration policy of , ,  and  began.

On 5 April 1879,  declared war on , unleashing the [[War of the Pacific]], which lasted until 1884. The casus belli was the confrontation between [[]] and  over a tax problem in which  was compromised by the Treaty of Defensive Alliance signed with  in 1873. However,  historiography is unanimous in maintaining that the deep cause of ''this'' war was 's ambition to take over the nitrate and guano territories of southern . In the first stage of the war, the naval campaign, the  navy repelled the  attack until 8 October 1879, the day in which the naval combat of Angamos was fought, where the  navy with its ships Cochrane, Blanco Encalada, Loa and Covadonga cornered the monitor [[Huáscar (ironclad)|Huáscar]], the main ship of the  navy commanded by Admiral AP Miguel Grau, who died in the fray and since then became 's greatest hero.

[[File:Batalla de Arica.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Arica]], painted by [[Juan Lepiani]]]]

Almost five years of war ended with the loss of the [[Tarapacá Department ()|department of Tarapacá]] and the provinces of [[Tacna Province|Tacna]] and [[Arica Province ()|Arica]], in the Atacama region. [[Francisco Bolognesi]] and [[Miguel Grau Seminario|Miguel Grau]] are both renowned heros of the war. Originally  committed to a referendum for the cities of Arica and Tacna to be held years later, to self determine their national affiliation. However,  refused to apply the Treaty, and neither of the countries could determine the statutory framework. The War of the Pacific was the bloodiest war  has fought in. After the War of the Pacific, an extraordinary effort of rebuilding began. The government started to initiate a number of social and economic reforms to recover from the damage of the war. Political stability was achieved only in the early 1900s.

=== 20th century ===
[[File:Protocolo de Río.jpg|thumb|upright|The signing of the [[Rio Protocol]] in January 1942]]
Internal struggles after the war were followed by a period of stability under the [[Civilista Party]], which lasted until the onset of the authoritarian regime of [[Augusto B. Leguía]]. The [[Great Depression]] caused the downfall of Leguía, renewed political turmoil, and the emergence of the [[ Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] (APRA). The rivalry between this organization and a coalition of the elite and the military defined  politics for the following three decades. A final peace treaty in 1929, signed between  and  called the [[Treaty of Lima (1929)|Treaty of Lima]], returned [[Tacna]] to . Between 1932 and 1933,  was engulfed in a [[Leticia Incident|year-long war with ]] over a territorial dispute involving the [[Amazonas ( department)|Amazonas Department]] and its capital [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]].

In 1941  and  fought the [[– War]], after which the [[Rio Protocol]] sought to formalize the boundary between those two countries. In a military coup on 29 October 1948, General [[Manuel A. Odría]] became president. Odría's presidency was known as the {{lang|es|Ochenio}}. He came down hard on APRA, momentarily pleasing the oligarchy and all others on the right, but followed a [[Populism|populist]] course that won him great favor with the poor and lower classes. A thriving economy allowed him to indulge in expensive but crowd-pleasing social policies. At the same time, however, [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] were severely restricted and corruption was rampant throughout his regime. Odría was succeeded by [[Manuel Prado Ugarteche]]. However, widespread allegations of fraud prompted the  military to depose Prado and install a military junta, via a [[1962  coup d'état|coup d'état]] led by [[Ricardo Pérez Godoy]]. Godoy ran a short transitional government and held new elections in 1963, which were won by [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry]] who assumed presidency until 1968. Belaúnde was recognized for his commitment to the democratic process.

[[File:Junta Militar de 1968.jpg|thumb|left|Military Junta of 1968]]
On 3 October 1968 another [[1968  coup d'état|coup d'état]] led by a group of officers led by General [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] brought the army to power with the aim of applying a doctrine of "social progress and integral development", nationalist and reformist, influenced by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]] (UNECLAC) theses on dependence and underdevelopment. Six days after the golpe, Velasco proceeded to nationalize the ''International Petroleum Corporation'' (IPC), the North  company that exploited  oil, and then launched a reform of the state apparatus, an agrarian reform. It was the biggest agrarian reform ever undertaken in Latin America: it abolished the [[Latifundium|latifunda]] system and modernized agriculture through a more equitable redistribution of land (90% of the peasants formed cooperatives or agricultural societies of social interest). Land was to be owned by those who cultivated it, and large landowners were expropriated. The only large properties allowed were cooperatives. 

Between 1969 and 1976, 325,000 families received land from the state with an average size of {{convert|73.6|acre|hectare}}. The "revolutionary government" also planned massive investments in education, elevated the [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] language – spoken by nearly half the population but hitherto despised by the authorities – to a status equivalent to that of  and established equal rights for natural children.  wished to free itself from any dependence and carried out a third-world foreign policy. The [[]] responded with commercial, economic and diplomatic pressure. In 1973  seemed to triumph over the financial blockade imposed by Washington by negotiating a loan from the International Development Bank to finance its agricultural and mining development policy. The relations with  became very tense after the coup d'état of the [[general Pinochet]]. General [[Edgardo Mercado Jarrín|Edgardo Mercado Jarrin]] (Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Army) and Admiral Guillermo Faura Gaig (Minister of the Navy) both escaped assassination attempts within weeks of each other. In 1975 General [[Francisco Morales Bermúdez Cerruti]] seized power and broke with the policies of his predecessor. His regime occasionally participated in [[Operation Condor]] in collaboration with other  military dictatorships.

President [[Alan García]]'s economic policies distanced  from international markets further, resulting in lower foreign investment in the country. After the country experienced [[chronic inflation]], in mid-1985, the  [[ sol (1863–1985)|sol]] was replaced by the [[ inti|inti]], which itself was replaced by the [[ sol|nuevo sol]] in July 1991 (the new sol had a cumulative value of one billion old soles). At the end of the 1980s, the per capita annual income of  fell to $720 (below the level of 1960) and 's GDP dropped 20%, with national reserves running a $900 million deficit. The economic turbulence of the time acerbated social tensions in  and partly contributed to the rise of violent rebel rural insurgent movements, like [[Shining Path|Sendero Luminoso]] (Shining Path) and [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]], which caused [[Internal conflict in |great havoc]] throughout the country.

[[File:Alberto Fujimori en 1991.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|President [[Alberto Fujimori]] during his first term]]
The  armed forces, frustrated with the inability of the García administration to handle the nation's crises, drafted the {{lang|es|Plan Verde}}, which involved the genocide of impoverished and indigenous , the control or censorship of the [[media in ]], and the establishment of a [[neoliberal]] economy controlled by a [[military junta]]. [[Alberto Fujimori]] assumed the presidency in 1990 and, according to the head of the [[National Intelligence Service ()|National Intelligence Service (SIN)]] Rospigliosi, an understanding was established between Fujimori, [[Vladimiro Montesinos]], and some of the military officers involved in {{lang|es|Plan Verde}} to abide by the military's demands prior to Fujimori's inauguration. Fujimori would go on to adopt many of the policies outlined in {{lang|es|Plan Verde}}, which led to a precitious drop in inflation from 7,650% at the start of 1990 to 139% in 1991 and 57% in 1992. When Fujimori faced opposition to his reform efforts, he dissolved Congress, suspending the judiciary, arresting several opposition leaders and assuming full powers in the ''[[Self-coup|auto-golpe]]'' ("self-coup") of 5 April 1992. He then revised the constitution, called new congressional elections, and implemented substantial economic reform, including privatization of numerous state-owned companies, creation of an investment-friendly climate, and sound management of the economy. Nonetheless, these policies did not benefit the poorest much, and inequality persisted despite Fujimori's economic achievements.

Fujimori's administration was dogged by [[Insurgency|insurgent]] groups, most notably Shining Path, which carried out attacks across the country throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Fujimori cracked down on the insurgents and was successful in largely quelling them by the late 1990s, but the fight was marred by atrocities committed by both the  security forces and the insurgents: the [[Barrios Altos massacre]] and [[La Cantuta massacre]] by Government paramilitary groups, and the bombings of [[Tarata bombing|Tarata]] and [[Frecuencia Latina bombing|Frecuencia Latina]] by Sendero Luminoso. Fujimori would also broaden the definition of terrorism in an effort to criminalize as many actions possible to persecute left-wing political opponents. Using the {{lang|es|[[terruqueo]]}}, a [[fearmongering]] tactic that was used to accuse opponents of terrorism, Fujimori established a [[cult of personality]] by portraying himself as a hero and made left-wing ideologies an eternal enemy in . Those incidents subsequently came to symbolize the [[Human rights in |human rights]] violations committed in the last years of violence. His ''[[Programa Nacional de Población]]'', 'National Population Program' also resulted with the [[forced sterilization]] of at least 300,000 poor and indigenous women.

In early 1995, once again  and  clashed in the [[Cenepa War]], but in 1998 the governments of both nations signed a peace treaty that clearly demarcated the international boundary between them. In November 2000, Fujimori resigned from office and went into a self-imposed exile, initially avoiding prosecution for human rights violations and corruption charges by the new  authorities.

 tried to fight corruption while sustaining economic growth at the start of the 21st century, though [[Fujimorism]] held power over much of  society through maintaining control of institutions and legislation created in the 1993 constitution, which was written by Fujimori and his supporters without opposition participation. In spite of human rights progress since the time of insurgency, many problems are still visible and show the continued marginalization of those who suffered through the violence of the  conflict. A caretaker government presided over by [[Valentín Paniagua]] took on the responsibility of conducting new presidential and congressional elections. Afterwards [[Alejandro Toledo]] became president in 2001 to 2006. On 28 July 2006, former president [[Alan García]] became President of  after winning the [[2006  general election|2006 elections]]. In 2006, Alberto Fujimori's daughter, [[Keiko Fujimori]], entered 's political arena to continue her father's legacy and espouse Fujimorism. In May 2008,  became a member of the [[Union of South  Nations]]. In April 2009, former president [[Alberto Fujimori]] was convicted of human rights violations and [[Alberto Fujimori's arrest and trial|sentenced]] to 25 years in prison for his role in killings and kidnappings by the [[Grupo Colina]] [[death squad]] during his government's battle against leftist guerrillas in the 1990s.

During the presidencies of [[Ollanta Humala]], [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]] and [[Martín Vizcarra]], the right-wing Congress led by Keiko Fujimori obstructed much of the actions performed by the presidents. On 5 June 2011, [[Ollanta Humala]] was elected president, with his cabinet being [[Motion of no confidence|successfully censured]] by the Fujimorist Congress. Beginning with [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]], Congress used [[Vacancy due to moral incapacity ()|broadly interpreted]] [[impeachment]] wording in the 1993 Constitution of  that allowed impeachment of the president without cause to place pressure on the president, forcing him to [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski#Resignation|resign]] in 2018 amid various controversies surrounding his administration. Vice president [[Martín Vizcarra]] then assumed office in March 2018 with generally favorable approval ratings as he led the anti-corruption [[2018  constitutional referendum|constitutional referendum]] movement. 

The [[COVID-19 pandemic in |COVID-19 pandemic]] resulted with  experiencing the highest death rate from COVID-19 in the world, exposing much of the inequality that persisted since the Fujimori administration and triggering an economic crisis that led to [[Removal of Martín Vizcarra|Vizcara's removal from the presidency by Congress]]. Widely seen as a coup by Congress, its head, the newly seated President [[Manuel Merino]], faced [[2020  protests|protests]] across the country, and after five days, Merino resigned from the presidency. Merino was replaced by President [[Francisco Sagasti]], who led a provisional, centrist government, and enforced many of Vizcarra's former policies. [[2021  general election|Elections]] were held on 11 April 2021, and [[Pedro Castillo]] of the [[Free ]] party won the first round, followed closely by Keiko Fujimori, with right-wing parties allied with Fujimori maintaining positions in Congress.

On 28 July 2021, Pedro Castillo was sworn in as the new [[president of ]] after a narrow win in a tightly contested run-off election. That same year,  celebrated the [[Bicentennial of the Independence of |bicentenary of independence]]. Castillo [[Pedro Castillo#Removal attempts|faced multiple impeachment votes]] during his presidency from the right-wing controlled Congress and on 7 December 2022, just hours before Congress was set to begin a [[Third impeachment and removal of Pedro Castillo|third impeachment effort]], Castillo tried to prevent this by attempting to [[2022  self-coup d'état attempt|dissolve]] the opposition-controlled legislature and create an "exceptional emergency government." In response, Congress quickly held an emergency session on the same day, during which it voted 101–6 (with 10 abstentions) to remove Castillo from office and replace him with Vice President [[Dina Boluarte]]. She became the country's first female president. Castillo was arrested after trying to flee to the [[|]] embassy and was charged with the crime of rebellion.

The Boluarte government proved unpopular as she allied herself with the right-wing Congress and the military, betraying her constituents. This resentment led to the [[2022–2023  political protests]], which sought the removal of Boluarte and Congress, immediate general elections and the writing of a new constitution. Authorities responded to the protests violently, with the [[Ayacucho massacre]] and [[Juliaca massacre]] occurring at this time, resulting with the most violence experienced in the nation in over two decades. The strong response by the political elite in Lima raised concerns that they sought to establish an [[authoritarian]] or [[Military junta|civilian-military government]]. On 10 October 2025, ’s congress removed President Dina Boluarte from office and [[José Jerí|Jose Jeri]] was sworn in as ’s interim president.

It is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].|left]]

The [[Natufian culture]] was the first to become sedentary at around 12000 BC.

Evidence of early settlement in  was found in [[Byblos]], considered among the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously inhabited cities]] in the world. The evidence dates back to earlier than 5000 BC. Archaeologists discovered remnants of prehistoric huts with crushed limestone floors, primitive weapons, and [[Jar burial|burial jars]] left by the [[Neolithic]] and [[Chalcolithic]] fishing communities who lived on the shore of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] over 7,000 years ago.

 was part of northern [[Canaan]], and consequently became the homeland of Canaanite descendants, the [[Phoenicia]]ns, a seafaring people based in the coastal strip of the northern [[Levant]] who spread across the Mediterranean in the first millennium BC. The most prominent Phoenician cities were [[Byblos]], [[Sidon]] and [[Tyre, |Tyre]]. According to the [[Bible]], King [[Hiram I|Hiram of Tyre]] collaborated closely with [[Solomon]], supplying cedar logs for [[Solomon's Temple]] and sending skilled workers. The [[Canaanite languages|Phoenicians]] are credited with the invention of the [[Phoenician alphabet|oldest verified alphabet]], which subsequently inspired the [[ alphabet]] and the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] one thereafter.

In the 9th century BC, [[Phoenician colonies]], including [[Carthage]] in present-day [[]] and [[Cádiz]] in present-day [[]], flourished throughout the Mediterranean. Subsequently, foreign powers, starting with the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], imposed tribute and attacked non-compliant cities. The [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] took control in the 6th century BC. In 539 BC, The cities of Phoenicia were then incorporated into the [[Achaemenid Empire]] by [[Cyrus the Great]]. The Phoenician city-states were later incorporated into the empire of [[Alexander the Great]] following the [[Siege of Tyre (332 BC)|siege of Tyre in 332 BCE]].

[[File:PhoenicianTrade EN.svg|thumb|A map of [[Phoenicia]], trade routes and the Phoenician colony of [[History of Carthage|Carthage]]]]
In 64 BC, the Roman general [[Pompey]] had the region of  annexed into the [[Roman Republic]]. The area was then split into two [[Imperial province|Imperial Provinces]] under the [[Roman Empire]], [[Coele-]] and [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Phoenice]], the latter which the land of present-day  was a part of.

The region that is now , as with the rest of  and much of [[]], became a major center of Christianity in the [[Roman Empire]] during the early spread of the faith. During the late 4th and early 5th century, a hermit named [[Maron]] established a monastic tradition focused on the importance of [[monotheism]] and [[asceticism]] near the Mediterranean mountain range known as [[Mount ]]. The monks who followed Maron spread his teachings among  in the region. These Christians became known as [[Maronites]] and moved into the mountains to avoid religious persecution by Roman authorities. During the frequent [[Roman–Persian Wars]] that lasted for many centuries, the [[Sasanian Empire]] occupied what is now  from 619 till 629.

=== Middle Ages ===
During the 7th century, [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Muslims conquered ]] from the Byzantines, incorporating the region, including modern-day , under the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Islamic Caliphate]]. In the era of [[Uthman]]'s caliphate (644–656), Islam gained significant influence in Damascus, led by [[Mu'awiya I|Mu'awiya]], a relative of Uthman, serving as the governor. Mu'awiya sent forces to the coastal region of , prompting conversions to Islam among the coastal population. The mountainous areas retained their Christian or other cultural practices. Despite Islam and Arabic becoming officially dominant, the population's conversion from Christianity and [[Syriac language]] was gradual. The Maronite community, in particular, managed to maintain a large degree of autonomy despite the succession of rulers over  and . The relative  isolation of the  mountains meant the mountains served as a refuge in the times of religious and political crises in the [[Levant]]. As such, the mountains displayed religious diversity and the existence of several well-established sects and religions, notably, [[Maronites]], [[Druze]], [[Shia Islam|Shiite Muslims]], [[Isma'ilism|Ismailis]], [[Alawites]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobites]].

After the Islamic conquest, Mediterranean trade declined for three centuries due to conflicts with the Byzantines. The ports of Tyre, Sidon, Beirut, and Tripoli struggled to recover, sustaining small populations under [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] rule. Christians and Jews were often obligated to pay the ''[[jizya]]'', or poll tax levied on non-Muslims. During the 980s, the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] took control of the Levant, including Mount , resulting in the rejuvenation of Mediterranean trade along the  coast through renewed connections with Byzantium and . This resurgence saw Tripoli and Tyre flourishing well into the 11th century, focusing on exports such as textiles, sugar, and glassware.

During the 11th century, the [[Druze in |Druze]] religion emerged from a branch of [[Shia Islam]]. The new religion gained followers in the southern portion of Mount . The southern portion of Mount  was ruled by Druze feudal families till the early 14th century. The Maronite population increased gradually in Northern Mount  and the Druze have remained in Southern Mount  until the modern era. [[Keserwan District|Keserwan]], [[Jabal Amel]] and the [[Beqaa Valley]] was ruled by Shia feudal families under the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire. Major cities on the coast, [[Sidon]], [[Tyre, |Tyre]], [[Acre, |Acre]], [[Tripoli, |Tripoli]], [[Beirut]], and others, were directly administered by the Muslim Caliphs and the people became more fully absorbed by the Arab culture.[[File:Siege of Tripoli Painting (1289).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Fall of Tripoli (1289)|Fall of Tripoli]] to the  [[Mamluk]]s and destruction of the Crusader state, the County of Tripoli, 1289]]

Following the fall of Roman [[]] to the Muslim Turks, the Byzantines put out a call to the Pope in Rome for assistance in the 11th century. The result was a series of wars known as the [[Crusades]] launched by the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]] from Western Europe to reclaim the former Byzantine Christian territories in the Eastern Mediterranean, especially [[]] and [[ (region)|]] (the ''[[Levant]]''). The [[First Crusade]] succeeded in temporarily establishing the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[County of Tripoli]] as Roman Catholic Christian states along the coast. These crusader states made a lasting impact on the region, though their control was limited, and the region returned to full Muslim control after two centuries following the conquest by the Mamluks.

Among the most lasting effects of the Crusades in this region was the contact between the Franks (i.e., the ) and the Maronites. Unlike most other Christian communities in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], who swore allegiance to [[Constantinople]] or other local patriarchs, the Maronites proclaimed allegiance to the Pope in Rome. As such the Franks saw them as Roman Catholic brethren. These initial contacts led to centuries of support for the Maronites from  and , even after the fall of the Crusader states in the region.

[[File:DeirAlQamar-FakhredinePalace.jpg|thumb|[[Fakhreddine II Palace]], 17th century]]
In 1516,  became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], with governance administered indirectly through local [[emir]]s. 's area was organized into provinces: Northern and Southern Mount , Tripoli, Baalbek and Beqaa Valley, and [[Jabal Amil]].

In 1590, Druze tribal leader [[Fakhr al-Din II]] succeeded [[Mount  Emirate#Qurqumaz (1544–1585)|Korkmaz]] in southern Mount  and quickly asserted his authority as the paramount emir of the Druze in the Shouf region. Eventually, he was appointed [[Sanjak-bey]], overseeing various Ottoman sub-provinces and tax collection. Expanding his influence extensively, he even constructed a fort in [[Palmyra Castle|Palmyra]].

This expansion raised concerns for Ottoman Sultan Murad IV, leading to a punitive expedition in 1633. Fakhr al-Din II was captured, imprisoned for two years, and subsequently executed in April 1635, along with one of his sons. Surviving members of his family continued to govern a reduced area under closer Ottoman supervision until the late 17th century. On the death of the [[Ahmad Ma'n|last Maan emir]], various members of the Shihab clan ruled Mount  until 1830.

While the history of Druze-Christian relations in  has generally been marked by harmony and peaceful coexistence, there were occasional periods of tension, notably during the [[1860 civil conflict in Mount  and Damascus|1860 Mount  civil war]], during which around 10,000 Christians were killed by the Druze. Shortly afterwards, the [[Emirate of Mount ]], which lasted about 400 years, was replaced by the [[Mount  Mutasarrifate]], as a result of a European-Ottoman treaty called the [[Règlement Organique (Mount )|Règlement Organique]]. The ''Mount  Mutasarrifate'' (1861–1918, {{langx|ar|متصرفية جبل لبنان }}; {{langx|tr|Cebel-i Lübnan Mutasarrıflığı}}) was one of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s subdivisions following the [[Tanzimat]] reform. After 1861 there existed an autonomous Mount  with a Christian [[mutasarrıf]], which had been created as a homeland for the [[ Maronite Christians|Maronites]] under European diplomatic pressure following the 1860 massacres. The [[Maronite]] [[Catholic]]s and the [[Druze]] founded modern  in the early eighteenth century, through the ruling and social system known as the "[[Christianity and Druze|Maronite-Druze dualism]]" in Mount  Mutasarrifate.

The Baalbek and Beqaa Valley and Jabal Amel was ruled intermittently by various Shia feudal families, especially the [[El Assaad Family|Al Ali Alsagheer]] in Jabal Amel that remained in power until 1865 when Ottomans took direct ruling of the region. [[Youssef Bey Karam]], a  nationalist played an influential role in 's independence during this era.

 experienced profound devastation in the [[World War I|First World War]] when the [[Ottoman Army (1861–1922)|Ottoman army]] assumed direct control, disrupting supplies and confiscating animals, ultimately leading to a severe famine. During the war, approximately 100,000 people in Beirut and Mount  died due to starvation.

===  Mandate ===
Amidst the height of the [[World War I|First World War]], the [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]] of 1916, a secret pact between Britain and , delineated  and its surrounding areas as regions open to potential  influence or control. After the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] emerged victorious in the war, the [[Ottoman Empire]] ultimately collapsed, losing control over the area. Soon after the war, Patriarch [[Elias Peter Hoayek]], representing the Maronite Christians,  successfully campaigned for an expanded territory at the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)|Paris Peace Conference]], also including areas with significant Muslim and Druze populations in addition to the Christian-dominated Mount .

In 1920, King [[Faisal I of |Faisal I]] proclaimed the [[Arab Kingdom of ]]'s independence and asserted control over . However, following a defeat to the  at the [[Battle of Maysalun]], the kingdom was dissolved. Around the same time, at the [[San Remo conference|San Remo Conference]], tasked with deciding the fate of former Ottoman territories, it was determined that  and  would fall under  rule. Shortly afterward, the formal division of territories took place in the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], signed a few months later.

On 1 September 1920, [[Greater ]], or ''Grand Liban'', was established under  control as a [[League of Nations mandate|League of Nations Mandate]], following the terms outlined in the proposed [[Mandate for  and the ]]. Greater  united the regions of Mount , North , South , and the Bekaa, with Beirut as its designated capital. These specified boundaries later evolved into the present-day configuration of . This arrangement was ratified in July 1922. The  Republic was officially proclaimed on 1 September 1926, with the [[Constitution of |adoption of a constitution]] inspired by the  constitution on 23 May 1926. While a  government was established, the country continued to be under  control.

After the fighting ended in , General [[Charles de Gaulle]] visited the area. Under political pressure from both inside and outside , de Gaulle recognized the independence of . On 26 November 1941, General [[Georges Catroux]] announced that  would become independent under the authority of the [[Free ]] government. Elections were held in 1943 and on 8 November 1943 the new  government unilaterally abolished the mandate. The  reacted by imprisoning the new government.  nationalists declared a provisional government, and the  diplomatically intervened on their behalf. In the face of intense  pressure and protests by  nationalists, the  reluctantly released the government officials on 22 November 1943, and accepted the independence of .[[File:Beirut's Martyrs' Square during celebrations marking the release by the  of 's government from Rashayya prison on November 22, 1943, the day of 's independence.

=== Independence from Free  ===
Following the end of World War II in Europe the  mandate may be said to have been terminated without any formal action on the part of the [[League of Nations]] or its successor the [[United Nations]]. The mandate was ended by the declaration of the mandatory power, and of the new states themselves, of their independence, followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers, culminating in formal admission to the United Nations. Article 78 of the UN Charter ended the status of tutelage for any member state: "The trusteeship system shall not apply to territories which have become Members of the United Nations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality." So when the UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the [[United Nations Charter]] by the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]], as both  and  were founding member states, the  mandate for both was legally terminated on that date and full independence attained. The last  troops withdrew in December 1946.

's unwritten [[National Pact]] of 1943 required that its president be Maronite Christian, its [[Speaker (politics)|speaker of the parliament]] to be a [[ Shia Muslims|Shia Muslim]], its prime minister be [[ Sunni Muslims|Sunni Muslim]], and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament and the Deputy Prime Minister be [[  Orthodox Christians| Orthodox]].

's history since independence has been marked by alternating periods of political stability and turmoil interspersed with prosperity built on [[Beirut]]'s position as a regional center for finance and trade.

In 1958, during the last months of President [[Camille Chamoun]]'s term, [[1958  crisis|an insurrection]] broke out, instigated by  Muslims who wanted to make  a member of the [[United Arab Republic]]. Chamoun requested assistance, and 5,000 [[ Marines]] were briefly dispatched to Beirut on 15 July. After the crisis, a new government was formed, led by the popular former general [[Fouad Chehab]].

The relocation also led to sectarian tensions between  versus the Maronites and other  factions. In 1975, following increasing tensions, largely boosted by [[Fatahland| militant presence]] in the south, a full-scale civil war broke out in . The war pitted a coalition of Christian groups against the joint forces of the [[ Liberation Organization|PLO]], left-wing Druze and Muslim militias. In October 1976 the [[Arab League]] agreed to establish a predominantly  [[Arab Deterrent Force]], which was charged with restoring calm.  [[File:Green Line, Beirut 1982.jpg|thumb|The [[Green Line ()|Green Line]] that separated west and east Beirut, 1982|left]]PLO attacks from  into  in 1977 and 1978 escalated tensions between two countries. On 11 March 1978, Fatah militants in northern , hijacked two passenger buses, that killed 37  before being killed in a firefight with  forces.  [[Operation Litani|invaded]]  four days later and occupied most of the area south of the [[Litani River]]. The [[UN Security Council|UNSC]] passed the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 425|Resolution 425]] calling for immediate  withdrawal and creating the [[United Nations Interim Force in |U.N Interim Force in ]] (UNIFIL), charged with attempting to establish peace.  forces withdrew later in 1978, but retained control of the southern region by managing a {{convert|12|mi|km|0|adj=mid|-wide|order=flip}} security zone along the border. These positions were held by the [[South  Army]] (SLA), a Christian militia under the leadership of Major [[Saad Haddad]] backed by . The  Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]], compared the plight of the Christian minority in southern  (then about 5% of the population in SLA territory) to that of European Jews during World War II.

The PLO routinely [[ insurgency in South |attacked]]  during the period of the cease-fire, with over 270 documented attacks. People in Galilee regularly had to leave their homes during these shellings. Documents captured in PLO headquarters after the invasion showed they had come from . PLO leader [[Yasser Arafat]] refused to condemn these attacks on the grounds that the cease-fire was only relevant to . In April 1980 the killing of two UNIFIL soldiers and the injuring of a third by the South  Army, near [[At Tiri]], in the buffer zone led to a [[At Tiri incident|military conflict]]. On 17 July 1981,  aircraft bombed multi-story apartment buildings in Beirut that contained offices of PLO associated groups. The  delegate to the United Nations Security Council claimed that 300 civilians had been killed and 800 wounded. The bombing led to worldwide condemnation, and a temporary embargo on the export of U.S. aircraft to .

In August 1981, defense minister [[Ariel Sharon]] began to draw up plans to attack PLO military infrastructure in West Beirut, where PLO headquarters and command bunkers were located. In 1982, [[PLO in |PLO]] attacks from  on  led to [[1982  War|an  invasion]], aiming to support  forces in driving out the PLO. A [[Multinational Force in |multinational force]] of ,  and  contingents (joined in 1983 by a  contingent) were deployed in Beirut after [[Siege of Beirut|the  siege of the city]], to supervise the evacuation of the PLO. The civil war re-emerged in September 1982 after the assassination of President [[Bachir Gemayel]], an  ally, and subsequent fighting. During this time a number of sectarian massacres occurred, such as in [[Sabra and Shatila massacre|Sabra and Shatila]], and in [[War of the Camps|several refugee camps]]. The multinational force was withdrawn in the spring of 1984, following [[1983 Beirut barracks bombings|a devastating bombing attack]] during the previous year.

During the early 1980s, [[Hezbollah]], a Shiite Islamist militant group and political party, came into existence through the efforts of Shiite clerics who were [[Hezbollah– relations|financially supported and trained by ]]. Arising in the aftermath of the 1982 war and drawing inspiration from the [[ Revolution|Islamic Revolution in ]], Hezbollah actively engaged in combat against  as well as [[suicide attack]]s, [[car bomb]]ings and assassinations. Their objectives encompassed eliminating , fighting for the Shia cause in the civil war, ending Western presence in , and establishing a Shiite [[Khomeinism|Khomeinist]] [[Islamic state]].

In the late 1980s, as [[Amine Gemayel]]'s second term as president drew to an end, the  [[ pound|pound]] collapsed. At the end of 1987 US$1 was worth £L500. This meant the legal minimum wage was worth just $17 a month. Most goods in shops were priced in dollars. A [[Save the Children]] director estimated that 200,000–300,000 children were in need of assistance and were living almost entirely on bread, which was subsidized by the government. Those who could relied on foreign assistance. Hezbollah was receiving about $3–5 million a month from [[]]. In September 1988, the Parliament failed to elect a successor to President Gemayel as a result of differences between the Christians, Muslims, and . The Arab League Summit of May 1989 led to the formation of a –– committee to solve the crisis.

On 16 September 1989 the committee issued a peace plan which was accepted by all. A ceasefire was established, the ports and airports were re-opened and refugees began to return. In the same month, the parliament agreed to the [[Taif Agreement]], which included an outline timetable for  withdrawal from  and a formula for the de-confessionalization of the  political system. The civil war ended at the end of 1990 after 16 years; it had caused massive loss of human life and property and devastated the country's economy. It is estimated that 150,000 people were killed and another 200,000 wounded. Nearly a million civilians were displaced by the war, and some never returned. Parts of  were left in ruins. The agreement has still not been implemented in full and 's political system continues to be divided along sectarian lines.

Conflict between  and  militants continued, leading to a series of violent events and clashes including the [[Qana massacre]]. In May 2000,  forces fully withdrew from . Since then, 25 May is regarded by the  as the [[Resistance and Liberation Day ()|Liberation Day]]. The internal political situation in  significantly changed in the early 2000s. After the  withdrawal from southern  and the death of former  president [[Hafez al-Assad]] in 2000, the  military presence faced criticism and resistance from the  population.[[File:Cedar_Revolution_Demonstrators.jpg|thumb|Demonstrations in  triggered by the assassination of Rafik Hariri on 14 February 2005]]On 14 February 2005, former Prime Minister [[Rafic Hariri]] was assassinated in a [[car bomb]] explosion. Leaders of the [[March 14 Alliance]] accused [[]] of the attack, while  and the [[March 8 Alliance]] claimed that  was behind the assassination. It marked the beginning of a series of assassinations that resulted in the death of many prominent  figures and triggered the [[Cedar Revolution|demonstrations]] which demanded the withdrawal of the  troops from  and the establishment of an international commission to investigate the assassination. Under the pressure from the West,  began withdrew from  by 26 April. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1595|UNSC Resolution 1595]] called for an investigation into the assassination. The [[United Nations International Independent Investigation Commission|UN International Independent Investigation Commission]] published preliminary findings on 20 October 2005 in the [[Mehlis report]], which cited indications that the assassination was organized by  and  intelligence services.

=== Post-war revolution and spillover of the  conflict ===
{{main| civil war spillover in |2011  protests|17 October Revolution}}
On 12 July 2006, [[Hezbollah]] launched a series of rocket attacks and [[2006 Hezbollah cross-border raid|raids]] into  territory, where they killed three  soldiers and captured two others.  responded with [[airstrike]]s and [[artillery]] fire on targets in , and a ground invasion of [[southern ]], resulting in the [[2006  War]]. The conflict was officially ended by the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|UNSC Resolution 1701]] on 14 August 2006, which ordered a ceasefire, the withdrawal of  forces from , and the disarmament of Hezbollah. Some 1,191  and 160  were [[Casualties of the 2006  War|killed]] in the conflict. Beirut's southern suburb was heavily damaged by  airstrikes.

In 2007, the [[Nahr al-Bared]] refugee camp became the center of the [[2007  conflict]] between the  Army and [[Fatah al-Islam]]. At least 169 soldiers, 287 insurgents and 47 civilians were killed in the battle. Funds for the reconstruction of the area have been slow to materialize. Between 2006 and 2008, [[2006–2008  political protests|a series of protests]] led by groups opposed to the pro-Western Prime Minister [[Fouad Siniora]] demanded the creation of a national unity government, over which the mostly Shia opposition groups would have veto power. When [[Émile Lahoud]]'s presidential term ended in October 2007, the opposition refused to vote for a successor unless a power-sharing deal was reached, leaving  without a president.

On 7 May 2008, [[Hezbollah]] and [[Amal Movement|Amal]] forces, sparked by a government declaration that Hezbollah's communications network was illegal, seized western [[Beirut]], the most important Sunni center in , leading to an [[2008  conflict|intrastate military conflict]]. The  government denounced the violence as a coup attempt. At least 62 people died in the resulting clashes between pro-government and opposition militias. On 21 May 2008, the signing of the [[Doha Agreement (2008)|Doha Agreement]] ended the fighting. As part of the accord, which ended 18 months of political paralysis, [[Michel Suleiman]] became president and a national unity government was established, granting a veto to the opposition. The agreement was a victory for opposition forces, as the government caved in to all their main demands.

In early January 2011, the [[ government of November 2009|national unity government]] collapsed due to growing tensions stemming from the [[Special Tribunal for ]], which was expected to indict Hezbollah members for the Hariri assassination. The parliament elected [[Najib Mikati]], the candidate for the Hezbollah-led [[March 8 Alliance]], Prime Minister of , making him responsible for forming a new government. Hezbollah leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]] later accused  of assassinating Hariri. A report leaked by the [[Al Akhbar ()|Al-Akhbar]] newspaper in November 2010 stated that Hezbollah had drafted plans for a violent takeover of the country in case the Special Tribunal for  issued an indictment against its members.

In 2012, the [[ civil war]] threatened to spill over in , causing [[ civil war spillover in |incidents of sectarian violence]] and armed clashes between [[ Sunni Muslims|Sunnis]] and [[Alawites in |Alawites]] in Tripoli. According to [[UNHCR]], the number of [[Refugees of the  civil war| refugees]] in  increased from around 250,000 in early 2013 to 1,000,000 in late 2014. In 2013, The [[ Forces Party]], the [[Kataeb Party]] and the [[Free Patriotic Movement]] voiced concerns that the country's sectarian based political system is being undermined by the influx of  refugees. On 6 May 2015, [[UNHCR]] suspended registration of  refugees at the request of the  government. In February 2016, the  government signed the  Compact, granting a minimum of €400 million of support for refugees and vulnerable  citizens. As of October 2016, the government estimated that the country hosts 1.5 million .

=== National crisis (2019–present) ===
{{Main|17 October Revolution| liquidity crisis}}
[[File:-i---i- (49140926886).jpg|thumb|The [[Second Arab Spring|2019 protests]] were non-sectarian, crossing the Sunni–Shia Muslim / Christian sociological and religious divide.]]
On 17 October 2019, the first of a series of mass civil demonstrations erupted; they were initially triggered by planned taxes on gasoline, tobacco and online phone calls such as through [[WhatsApp]], but quickly expanded into a country-wide condemnation of [[sectarian]] rule, a [[ liquidity crisis|stagnant economy and liquidity crisis]], unemployment, endemic corruption in the public sector, legislation (such as banking secrecy) that is perceived to shield the ruling class from accountability and failures from the government to provide basic services such as electricity, water and sanitation.
[[File:WomenLine RiadElSolh 19Nov2019.jpg|thumb|Women protesters forming a line between riot police and protesters in Riad el Solh, [[Beirut]]; 19 November 2019]]
As a result of the protests,  entered a political crisis, with Prime Minister [[Saad Hariri]] tendering his resignation and echoing protestors' demands for a government of independent specialists. Other politicians targeted by the protests have remained in power. On 19 December 2019, former Minister of Education [[Hassan Diab]] was designated the next prime minister and tasked with forming a new cabinet. Protests and acts of [[civil disobedience]] have since continued, with protesters denouncing and condemning the designation of Diab as prime minister.  is suffering the worst [[ liquidity crisis|economic crisis]] in decades.  is the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to see its inflation rate exceed 50% for 30 consecutive days, according to Steve H. Hanke, professor of applied economics at the Johns Hopkins University. On 4 August 2020, [[2020 Beirut explosion|an explosion at the port of Beirut]], 's main port, destroyed the surrounding areas, killing over 200 people, and injuring thousands more. The cause of the explosion was later determined to be 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been unsafely stored, and accidentally set on fire that Tuesday afternoon. Protests resumed within days following the explosion, which resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister Hassan Diab and his [[Cabinet of Hassan Diab|cabinet]] on 10 August 2020, nonetheless continuing to stay in office in a [[Caretaker government|caretaker capacity]]. Demonstrations continued into 2021 with  blocking the roads with burned tires protesting against the poverty and the economic crisis.

On 11 March 2021 the [[Ministry of Energy and Water ()|caretaker minister of energy]] [[Raymond Ghajar]] warned that  was threatened with "total darkness" at the end of March if no money was secured to buy fuel for power stations. In August 2021, a [[2021 Akkar explosion|large fuel explosion in northern ]] killed 28 people.  September saw the formation of a [[Third Cabinet of Najib Mikati|new cabinet]] led by former prime minister [[Najib Mikati]]. On 9 October 2021, the entire nation lost power for 24 hours after its two main power stations ran out of power due to the currency and fuel shortage. Days later, [[2021 Beirut clashes|sectarian violence in Beirut]] killed a number of people in the deadliest clashes in the country since 2008. By January 2022, [[BBC News]] reported that the crisis in  had deepened further, with the value of the [[ pound]] plummeting and a [[2022  general election|scheduled general election expected to be delayed indefinitely]]. The postponement of parliamentary elections was said to prolong the political deadlock in the country. The [[European Parliament]] called 's present situation a 'man-made disaster caused by a handful of men across the political class'.

In May 2022,  held its first [[2022  general election|election]] since a painful economic crisis dragged it to the brink of becoming a [[failed state]]. 's crisis has been so severe that more than 80 percent of the population is now considered poor by the [[United Nations]]. In the election the Shia Muslim [[Hezbollah]] movement (and its allies) lost their parliamentary majority. Hezbollah did not lose any of its seats, but its allies lost seats. Hezbollah's ally, President [[Michel Aoun]]'s [[Free Patriotic Movement]], was no longer the biggest Christian party after the election. A rival Christian party, the [[ Forces]] led by [[Samir Geagea]], became the largest Christian-based party in parliament. The Sunni [[Future Movement]], led by former prime minister [[Saad Hariri]], did not participate in the election, leaving a political vacuum for other Sunni politicians to fill. The  crisis became so severe that multiple boats left the coast holding migrants in a desperate run from the country. Many proved unsuccessful and fatal. In April 2022, 6 people died and around 50 people were rescued after an overloaded boat sunk in [[Tripoli, |Tripoli]]. And on 22 September, at least 94 people were killed when a boat carrying migrants from  capsized off 's coast. 9 people survived. Many were declared missing and some were found either dead or injured. Dead bodies were sent to nearby hospitals. 40 people are still missing as of 24 September. On 1 February 2023, the [[Banque du Liban|central bank]] of  devalued the [[ pound]] by 90% amid the ongoing [[financial crisis]]. This was the first time  had devalued its official exchange rate in 25 years. As of 2023,  is considered to have become a [[failed state]], suffering from chronic  poverty, economic mismanagement and a banking collapse.

The [[Gaza war]] sparked a [[–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present)|renewed –Hezbollah conflict]]. Hezbollah has said it will not stop attacking  until  ceases its attacks in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]. Starting with the  [[2024  pager explosions|explosion of  pagers and walkie talkies]] in September 2024, the conflict escalated severely, with the [[September 2024  strikes|23 September 2024  airstrikes on ]] killing at least 558 people, and sparking a mass exodus from southern . On 27 September 2024, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was [[2024 Hezbollah headquarters strike|killed]] in an  airstrike. On 1 October 2024, [[2024  invasion of | was invaded by ]] with the objective of destroying infrastructure belonging to Hezbollah in the south of the country. In November 2024, a [[2024 – ceasefire agreement|ceasefire deal]] was signed between  and the  armed group Hezbollah to end 13 months of conflict. According to the agreement, Hezbollah was given 60 days to end its armed presence in southern  and  forces were obliged to withdraw from the area over the same period. [[Fall of the Assad regime|The fall of Assad's Baathist regime]] in  was  another blow to its  ally, Hezbollah, which was already weakened because of  military actions. The  regime change in December 2024 was said to start a new chapter in  politics. In January 2025, [[Joseph Aoun]], the  army commander, was elected  14th [[President of |president]] after a two-year vacancy. In February 2025, Prime Minister [[Nawaf Salam]], former president of the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), formed a new government of 24 ministers after two-year caretaker cabinet. On 26 February 2025,  's government of  Nawaf Salam won a confidence vote in parliament.
==History==
{{Main|History of -Bissau}}

=== Pre-European contact ===

The deep history of what is now -Bissau is poorly understood by historians. The earliest inhabitants were the [[Jola people|Jola]], [[Papel people|Papel]], [[Manjak people|Manjak]], [[Balanta people|Balanta]], and [[Biafada people|Biafada]] peoples.{{cn|date=September 2024}} Later the [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] and [[Fula people|Fulani]] migrated into the region, in the 13th and 15th centuries, respectively. They pushed the earlier inhabitants towards the coast and onto the [[Bijagos islands]].{{rp|20}}

The Balanta and Jola had weak or non-existent institutions of kingship but emphasised decentralization, with power invested in heads of villages and families.{{rp|64}} The Mandinka, Fula, Papel, Manjak, and Biafada chiefs were vassals to kings. The customs, rites, and ceremonies varied, but nobles commanded all the major positions, including the judicial system.{{rp|66–67, 73, 227}} Social stratification was seen in the clothing and accessories of the people, in housing materials, and in transportation options.{{rp|77–8}} Trade was widespread between ethnic groups. Items traded included pepper and kola nuts from the southern forests; kola nuts, iron, and iron utensils from the savannah-forest zone; salt and dried fish from the coast; and Mandinka cotton cloth.{{rp|4}}

==== Kingdom of Bissau ====
According to oral tradition, the Kingdom of [[Bissau]] was founded by the son of the king of Quinara (Guinala), who moved to the area with his pregnant sister, six wives, and subjects of his father's kingdom. Relations between the kingdom and the  colonisers were initially warm, but deteriorated over time.{{rp|55}} The kingdom strongly defended its sovereignty against the  'Pacification Campaigns', defeating them in 1891, 1894, and 1904. However, in 1915 the  under the command of Officer [[João Teixeira Pinto|Teixeira Pinto]] and warlord [[Abdul Injai]] fully absorbed the kingdom.

==== Biafada kingdoms ====
The [[Biafada people]] inhabited the area around the [[Rio Grande de Buba]] in three kingdoms: [[Biguba]], [[Guinala]], and Bissege.{{rp|65}} The former two were important ports with significant [[lançado]] communities.{{rp|63, 211}} They were subjects of the Mandinka mansa of Kaabu.{{rp|211}}

==== Bijagos Islands ====
In the [[Bijagos Islands]], people of different ethnic origins tended to settle in separate settlements. Great cultural diversity developed in the archipelago.{{rp|24}}{{rp|52}}

Bijago society was warlike. Men were dedicated to boatbuilding and raiding the mainland, attacking the coastal peoples as well as other islands. They believed that at sea they had no king. Women cultivated the land, constructed houses, and gathered and prepared foods. They could choose their husbands, and warriors with the best reputations ranked at the top of respected status. Successful warriors could have many wives and boats, and were entitled to one third of the spoils gained by warriors who used their boats in any expedition.{{rp|204–205}}

Bijago night raids on coastal settlements had significant effects on the societies attacked.  traders on the mainland tried to stop the raids, as they hurt the local economy. But the islanders also sold considerable numbers of villagers captured in raids as slaves to the Europeans. With colonisation underway in other parts of Africa and the Americas, demand for workers was high and the Europeans sometimes pushed for more captives to be taken.{{rp|205}}

The Bijagos were mostly safe from enslavement, as they were out of reach of mainland slave raiders. Europeans avoided having them as slaves.  sources say the children made good slaves but not the adults, who were likely to commit [[suicide]], lead rebellions aboard slave ships, or escape once reaching the [[New World]].{{rp|218–219}}

==== Kaabu ====
[[File:African slave trade.png|thumbnail|upright=1.2|States in medieval Africa]]
{{Main|Kaabu}}

[[Kaabu]] was established first as a province of [[ Empire|]] through the conquest in the 13th century of the [[Senegambia]] by [[Tiramakhan Traore]], a general under [[Sundiata Keita]]. By the 14th century much of  Bissau was under the administration of . It was ruled by a ''farim kaabu'' (commander of Kaabu).

 declined gradually, beginning in the 14th century. By the early 16th century, the expanding power of [[Koli Tenguella]] cut off formerly secure .

Kaabu became an independent federation of kingdoms.{{rp|13}} The ruling classes were composed of elite warriors known as the ''Nyancho'' (Ñaanco) who traced their patrilineal lineage to Tiramakhan Traore.{{rp|2}} The Nyancho were a [[warrior culture]], reputed to be excellent cavalry men and raiders.{{rp|6}} The Kaabu Mansaba was seated in Kansala, today known as [[Gabu (town)|Gabu]], in the eastern [[Gabú region]].{{rp|4}}

The slave trade dominated the economy, and the warrior classes grew rich with imported cloth, beads, metalware, and firearms.{{rp|8}} Trade networks with Arabs and others to North Africa were dominant up to the 14th century. In the 15th century, coastal trade with the Europeans began to increase.{{rp|3}} In the 17th and 18th centuries an estimated 700 slaves were exported annually from the region, many of them from Kaabu.{{rp|5}}

In the late 18th century, the rise of the [[Imamate of Futa Jallon]] to the east posed a powerful challenge to the animist Kaabu. During the first half of the 19th century, civil war erupted as local [[Fula people]] sought independence.{{rp|5–6}} This long-running conflict was marked by the 1867 [[Battle of Kansala]]; the [[Fuladu]] effectively defeated the Kaabu and dominated the area thereafter. But some smaller Mandinka kingdoms survived until their absorption into  colonies.{{cn|date=July 2025}}

=== European contact ===
{{main| | }}
[[File:Lesser coat of arms of  .svg|thumb|Lesser coat of arms of  -Bissau]]

==== 15th–16th centuries ====
The first Europeans to reach -Bissau were the Venetian explorer [[Alvise Cadamosto]] in 1455,  explorer [[Diogo Gomes]] in 1456,  explorer [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira|Duarte Pacheco Pareira]] in the 1480s, and Flemish explorer [[Eustache de la Fosse]] in 1479–1480.{{rp|7, 12–13, 16}}

Although the  authorities initially discouraged European settlement on the mainland, this prohibition was ignored by ''[[lançados]]'' and ''tangomãos'', who largely assimilated into indigenous culture and customs.{{rp|140}} They ignored  trade regulations that banned entering the region or trading without a royal licence, shipping out of unauthorised ports, or assimilating into the native community.{{rp|142}}

After 1520 trade and settlements increased on the mainland, populated by  and native traders, as well as some , [[Genoa|Genoese]], , , and .{{rp|145, 150}} The main ports were [[Cacheu]], [[Bissau]], and [[Guinala]]. Each river also had such trading centers as [[Farim|Toubaboudougou]] at their fall lines, the furthest navigable point. These posts traded directly with the peoples of the interior for resources such as [[gum arabic]], [[ivory]], hides, [[civet]], dyes, enslaved Africans, and gold.{{rp|153–160}} Local African rulers generally refused to allow Europeans into the interior, to ensure their own control of trade routes and goods.

Disputes became increasingly frequent and serious in the late 1500s as the foreign traders sought to influence the host societies to their benefit.{{rp|74}} Meanwhile, the  monopoly, always leaky, was being increasingly challenged. In 1580 the [[Iberian Union]] unified the crowns of  and [[]]. 's enemies launched attacks on  possessions in  Bissau and . , , and  ships increasingly came to trade with the natives and the independent-minded ''lançados''.{{rp|244–253}}

==== 17th–18th centuries ====

In the early 17th century the government attempted to force all  trade to go through [[Santiago, |Santiago]], and to promote trade and settlement on the mainland, while restricting the sale of weapons to the locals. These efforts were largely unsuccessful.{{rp|243–4}}

With the end of the Iberian Union in 1640, King [[John IV of |João IV]] attempted to restrict the  trade in  that had flourished for the previous 60 years. Afro- traders and colonists, however, were not in a position to deny the free trade that the African kings demanded, as they had come to rely on European products and goods as necessities.{{rp|261–3}}

The  were never able to maintain the monopoly they wanted; the economic interests of the native leaders and Afro-European traders and merchants never aligned with theirs. During this period the power of the [[ Empire]] in the region was dissipating. The ''[[farim]]'' of [[Kaabu]], the king of [[Kasa kingdom|Kassa]], and other local rulers began to assert their independence.{{rp|488}}

[[File:Flag of the Casa da Guiné.svg|thumb|left|Flag of the  [[Company of ]]]]

In the early 1700s the  abandoned [[Bissau]] and retreated to Cacheu after the captain-major was captured and killed by the local king. They did not return until the 1750s. Meanwhile, the [[Cacheu and  Company]] shut down in 1706.{{rp|xliii}}

For a brief period in the 1790s, the  tried to establish a foothold on [[Bolama Island]].

==== Slave trade ====

-Bissau was among the first regions whose people engaged in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. For centuries its warriors had sent captives as slaves to North Africa. While it did not produce the same number of enslaved people to export to the Americas as other regions, the effects were still significant.

In ,  slaves were instrumental in developing the labor-intensive [[plantation]] economy: they cultivated and processed, growing [[indigo]] and [[cotton]], and also wove the panos cloth that became a standard currency in West Africa. During the 17th and 18th centuries, thousands of captive Africans were taken from the region every year by , , and  companies. An average of 3000 persons were shipped every year from [[Guinala]] alone.{{rp|278}} Many of these captives were taken during the [[Fula jihads]] and, specifically, the wars between the [[Imamate of Futa Jallon]] and [[Kaabu]].{{rp|377}}

Wars were increasingly waged for the sole purpose of capturing slaves to sell to the Europeans in exchange for imported goods. They resembled man-hunts more than conflicts over territory or political power.{{rp|204, 209}} The nobles and kings benefited, while the common people bore the brunt of the raiding and insecurity. If a noble was captured, they were likely to be released, as the captors, whoever they were, would generally accept a ransom in exchange for freeing them.{{rp|229}} The relationship between kings and European traders was a partnership, with the two regularly making deals on how the trade was to be conducted, defining who could be enslaved and who could not, and the prices of the slaves. Contemporary chroniclers questioned multiple kings on their part in the slave trade, and noted that they recognised the trade as evil but participated because otherwise the Europeans would not buy any other goods from them.{{rp|230–4}}

Beginning in the late 18th century, European countries gradually began slowing and/or abolishing the slave trade.  abandoned slavery in 1869 and [[]] in 1888, but a system of [[contract labor]] replaced it that was only barely better for the workers.{{rp|377}}

===Colonialism===
[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913-v2.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]
Up until the late 1800s,  control of their 'colony' outside of their forts and trading posts was a fiction. -Bissau became the scene of increased European colonial competition beginning in the 1860s. The dispute over the status of [[Bolama (town)|Bolama]] was resolved in 's favor through the mediation of U.S. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in 1870, but  encroachment on  claims continued. In 1886 the [[Casamance]] region of what is now [[]] was ceded to them.

===Struggle for independence===
[[File:LG&CD - Guine Barro Jagudis 11.jpg|thumb|[[ Colonial War]] in [[ ]], 1968]]

The [[Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde|African Party for the Independence of  and ]] (PAIGC) was founded in 1956 under the leadership of [[Amílcar Cabral]]. Initially committed to peaceful methods, the 1959 [[Pidjiguiti massacre]] pushed the party towards more militarized tactics, leaning heavily on the political mobilization of the peasantry in the countryside. After years of planning and preparing from their base in [[Conakry]], the PAIGC launched the [[-Bissau War of Independence]] on 23 January 1963.{{rp|289}}

Unlike guerrilla movements in other [[ Empire| colonies]], the PAIGC rapidly extended its control over large portions of the territory. Aided by the jungle-like terrain, it had easy access to borders with neighbouring allies and large quantities of arms from [[]], [[]], the [[Soviet Union]], and left-leaning African countries. The PAIGC even managed to acquire a significant anti-aircraft capability in order to defend itself against aerial attack.{{rp|289–90}} By 1973, the PAIGC was in control of many parts of , although the movement suffered a setback in January 1973 when its founder and leader [[Amilcar Cabral]] was assassinated. After Cabral's death, party leadership fell to [[Aristides Pereira]], who would later become the first president of the [[Republic of ]].

[[File: Colonial War 1970.jpg|thumb|-held (green), disputed (yellow) and rebel-held areas (red) in - and other colonies 1970]]

=== Independence (1973–2000) ===
[[File:Hastear da bandeira da Guiné Bissau após o arrear da de .jpg|thumb|[[PAIGC]] forces raise the [[flag of -Bissau]] in 1974.]]

Independence was unilaterally declared on 24 September 1973, which is now celebrated as the country's Independence Day, a [[Public holidays in -Bissau|public holiday]]. The country was formally recognized as independent on 10 September 1974. [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]'s [[Socialist Republic of |]] was the first country to formally recognise -Bissau and the first to sign agreements with the [[African Party for the Independence of  and ]].

Upon the nation's independence, it declared "[[Esta É a Nossa Pátria Amada]]" as its national anthem. Until 1996, this was shared with [[]], which later adopted its own official national anthem "[[Cântico da Liberdade]]".

[[Luís Cabral]], brother of Amílcar and co-founder of PAIGC, was appointed the first [[president of -Bissau]]. Independence had begun under the best of auspices. The Bissau- diaspora had returned to the country en masse. A system of access to school for all had been created. Books were free and schools seemed to have a sufficient number of teachers.{{cn|date=July 2025}} The education of girls, previously neglected, was encouraged and a new school calendar, more adapted to the rural world, was adopted.

In 1980, economic conditions deteriorated significantly, leading to general discontent with the government in power. On 14 November 1980, [[João Bernardo Vieira]], known as "Nino Vieira", overthrew President Luís Cabral. The constitution was suspended and a nine-member Military Council of the Revolution, chaired by Vieira, was established. Since then, the country has moved toward a liberal economy. Budget cuts have been made at the expense of the social sector and education.

The country was controlled by the military council until 1984. The first multi-party [[1994 -Bissau general election|elections]] were held in 1994. An army uprising in May 1998 led to the [[-Bissau Civil War]] and the president's ousting in June 1999. Elections were held again in 2000, and [[Kumba Ialá]] was elected president.

===21st century===
In September 2003, a military coup was conducted. The military arrested Ialá on the charge of being "unable to solve the problems". After being delayed several times, [[-Bissau legislative election, 2004|legislative elections]] were held in March 2004. A mutiny in October 2004 over pay arrears resulted in the death of the head of the armed forces.

In June 2005, [[2005 -Bissau presidential election|presidential elections]] were held for the first time since the coup that deposed Ialá. Ialá returned as the candidate for the PRS, claiming to be the legitimate president of the country, but the election was won by former president [[João Bernardo Vieira]], deposed in the 1999 coup. Vieira beat [[Malam Bacai Sanhá]] in a run-off election. Sanhá initially refused to concede, claiming that [[electoral fraud|tampering]] and electoral fraud occurred in two [[constituencies]] including the capital, Bissau. [[Election monitoring|Foreign monitors]] described the elections as "calm and organized", despite some reports of arms entering the country prior to the election and few "disturbances during campaigning", including attacks on government offices by unidentified gunmen.

Three years later, Sanhá's PAIGC won a strong parliamentary majority, with 67 of 100 seats, in the parliamentary election held in November 2008. In November 2008, President Vieira's official residence was attacked by members of the armed forces, killing a guard but leaving the president unharmed.

On 2 March 2009, however, Vieira was assassinated by what preliminary reports indicated to be a group of soldiers avenging the death of the head of joint chiefs of staff, General [[Batista Tagme Na Waie|Batista Tagme Na Wai]], who had been killed in an explosion the day before. Vieira's death did not trigger widespread violence, but there were signs of turmoil in the country, according to the [[advocacy group]] [[Swisspeace]]. Military leaders in the country pledged to respect the constitutional order of succession. National Assembly Speaker [[Raimundo Pereira]] was appointed as an interim president until a nationwide [[-Bissau presidential election, 2009|election]] on 28 June 2009. It was won by Malam Bacai Sanhá, against [[Kumba Ialá]] as the presidential candidate of the PRS.

On 9 January 2012, President Sanhá died, and Pereira was again appointed as an interim president. On the evening of 12 April 2012, members of the country's military staged [[2012 -Bissau coup d'état|a ''coup d'état'']] and arrested the interim president and a leading presidential candidate. Former vice chief of staff, General [[Mamadu Ture Kuruma]], assumed control of the country in the transitional period and started negotiations with opposition parties.

The [[2014 -Bissau general election|2014 general election]] saw [[José Mário Vaz]] elected President of -Bissau. Vaz became the first elected president to complete his five-year mandate. At the same time, he was eliminated in the first round of the [[2019 -Bissau presidential election|2019 presidential elections]], ultimately seeing [[Umaro Sissoco Embaló]] emerge as the victor. Embaló, the first president to be elected without the backing of the PAIGC, took office in February 2020.

On 1 February 2022, there was [[2022 -Bissau coup attempt|an attempted coup d'état]] to overthrow President Umaro Sissoco Embaló. On 2 February 2022, state radio announced that four assailants and two members of the presidential guard had been killed in the incident. The [[African Union]] and [[Economic Community of West African States|ECOWAS]] both condemned the coup. Six days after the attempted coup d'état, on 7 February 2022, there was an attack on the building of Rádio Capital FM, a radio station critical of the Bissau- government; this was the second time the radio station suffered an attack of this nature in less than two years. A journalist working for the station recalled, while wishing to stay anonymous, that one of their colleagues had recognized one of the cars carrying the attackers as belonging to the presidency.

In 2022, Embaló became the first African ruler to visit  since the [[ invasion of | invasion of the country]] in February, meeting with President of  [[Volodymyr Zelenskyy]].

[[File:Putin-Embalo meeting (2022-10-25) 02.jpg|thumb|-Bissau President [[Umaro Sissoco Embaló]] with  President [[Vladimir Putin]] in Moscow, , 25 October 2022]]
In 2023, [[2023 -Bissau coup attempt|an attempted coup]] reportedly occurred in the capital, Bissau, leading Embaló to order the dissolution of the opposition-controlled parliament. On 11 September 2024, President Umaro Sissoco Embaló announced that he would not seek a second term in the upcoming presidential elections scheduled for November 2025. On 3 March 2025, President Umaro Sissoco Embaló said that he would run for a second term in November, contrary to his earlier vows to step down.

The pre-history of  goes back 125,000 years and possibly even as far back as 500,000 years. The era spans the [[Palaeolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], and early [[Iron Age]]s. Among the [[Paleolithic]] human settlements discovered in , [[Fa Hien Cave|Pahiyangala]] (37,000 BP), named after the [[ people|]] traveller [[Bhikkhu|monk]] [[Faxian]]; [[Batadombalena]] (28,500 BP); and [[Belilena]] (12,000 BP) are the most important. In these caves, archaeologists have found the remains of [[anatomy|anatomically]] modern [[humans]] which they have named [[Balangoda Man]], and other evidence suggesting that they may have engaged in [[agriculture]] and kept domestic dogs for driving game.

The earliest inhabitants of  were probably ancestors of the [[Vedda people]], an indigenous people numbering approximately 2,500 living in modern-day .

During the protohistoric period (1000–500 BCE)  was culturally united with southern , and shared the same megalithic burials, [[Black and red ware culture|pottery]], iron technology, farming techniques and [[megalithic graffiti symbols|megalithic graffiti]]. This cultural complex spread from southern  along with Dravidian clans such as the [[Velir]], prior to the migration of [[Prakrit]] speakers.

One of the first written references to the island is found in the  [[Epic poetry|epic]] [[Ramayana]], which provides details of a kingdom named ''[[Lanka]]'' that was created by the divine sculptor [[Vishwakarma|Vishvakarma]] for [[Kubera]], the God of Wealth. It is said that Kubera was overthrown by his [[rakshasa]] stepbrother, [[Ravana]].

According to the ''[[Mahāvaṃsa]]'', a [[Pali|Pāḷi]] chronicle written in the 5th century CE, the original inhabitants of  are said to be the [[Yaksha]]s and [[Naga people (Lanka)|Nagas]]. Sinhalese history traditionally starts in 543 BCE with the arrival of [[Prince Vijaya]], a semi-legendary prince who sailed with 700 followers to , after being expelled from [[Vanga kingdom]] (present-day [[Bengal]]). He established the [[Kingdom of Tambapanni]], near modern-day [[Mannar, |Mannar]]. Vijaya (Singha) is the first of the approximately [[List of  monarchs|189 monarchs of ]] described in chronicles such as the ''[[Dīpavaṃsa]]'', ''Mahāvaṃsa'', ''[[Cūḷavaṃsa]]'', and ''Rājāvaliya''.

Once [[Prakrit]] speakers had attained dominance on the island, the ''[[Mahāvaṃsa]]'' further recounts the later migration of royal brides and service castes from the Tamil [[Pandya kingdom]] to the [[Anuradhapura kingdom]] in the early historic period.

The [[Anuradhapura period]] (377 BCE{{snd}}1017 CE) began with the establishment of the [[Anuradhapura kingdom]] in 380 BCE during the reign of [[Pandukabhaya]]. Thereafter, Anuradhapura served as the capital city of the country for nearly 1,400 years. Ancient  excelled at building certain types of [[Ancient constructions of |structures]] such as [[ irrigation network|tanks]], [[Stupa|dagobas]] and palaces. Society underwent a major transformation during the reign of [[Devanampiya Tissa]], with the arrival of Buddhism from . In 250 BCE, [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], a [[bhikkhu]] and the son of the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] Emperor [[Ashoka]] arrived in [[Mihintale]] carrying the message of Buddhism. His mission won over the monarch, who embraced the faith and propagated it throughout the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese population]].

Succeeding kingdoms of  would maintain many [[schools of Buddhism|Buddhist schools]] and monasteries and support the propagation of Buddhism into other countries in Southeast Asia.  Bhikkhus studied in 's famous ancient Buddhist University of [[Nalanda]], which was destroyed by [[Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji|Bakhtiyar Khalji]]. It is probable that many of the scriptures from Nalanda are preserved in 's many monasteries and that the written form of the [[Tripiṭaka]], including Sinhalese Buddhist literature, were part of the University of Nalanda. In 245 BCE, [[bhikkhunī]] [[Sanghamitta]] arrived with the [[Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi]] tree, which is considered to be a sapling from the historical [[Bodhi Tree]] under which [[Gautama Buddha]] became enlightened. It is considered the oldest human-planted tree (with a continuous historical record) in the world. ([[Bodhivaṃsa]])

 experienced the first of many foreign invasions during the reign of [[Suratissa of Anuradhapura|Suratissa]], who was defeated by two horse traders named [[Sena and Guttika]] from South . The next invasion came immediately in 205 BCE by a [[Chola]] named [[Elara (monarch)|Elara]], who overthrew [[Asela of Anuradhapura|Asela]] and ruled the country for 44 years. [[Dutugamunu]], the eldest son of the southern regional sub-king, [[Kavan Tissa, Prince of Ruhuna|Kavan Tissa]], defeated Elara in the [[Battle of Vijithapura]]. During its two and a half millennia of existence, the [[Sinhala kingdom]] was invaded at least eight times by neighbouring South  dynasties such as the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]], [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya]], and [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]].{{citation needed|date=April 2023}} There also were incursions by the kingdoms of [[Kalinga (region)|Kalinga]] (modern [[Odisha]]) and from the [[Malay Peninsula]] as well.{{citation needed|date=April 2023}}

The [[Fourth Theravāda Council]] was held at the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya]] in  under the patronage of [[Valagamba]] in 25 BCE. The council was held in response to a year in which the harvests in  were particularly poor and many [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] subsequently died of starvation. Because the [[Pali Canon]] was at that time [[oral literature]] maintained in several recensions by ''dhammabhāṇaka''s ([[dharma]] reciters), the surviving monks recognised the danger of not writing it down so that even if some of the monks whose duty it was to study and remember parts of the Canon for later generations died, the teachings would not be lost.{{sfn | Buswell | Lopez | 2013 | p=200}} After the council, [[palm-leaf manuscript]]s containing the completed Canon were taken to other countries such as [[]], [[]], [[]] and [[]].

 was the first Asian country known to have a female ruler: [[Anula of Anuradhapura]] (r. 47–42 BCE).  monarchs undertook some remarkable construction projects such as [[Sigiriya]], the so-called "Fortress in the Sky", built during the reign of [[Kashyapa I]], who ruled between 477 and 495. The Sigiriya rock fortress is surrounded by an extensive network of ramparts and moats. Inside this protective enclosure were gardens, ponds, pavilions, palaces and other structures.

In 993 CE, the invasion of [[Chola dynasty|Chola emperor]] [[Rajaraja I]] forced the then Sinhalese ruler [[Mahinda V]] to flee to the southern part of . Taking advantage of this situation, [[Rajendra I]], son of Rajaraja I, launched a large invasion in 1017. Mahinda V was captured and taken to , and the Cholas [[Chola conquest of Anuradhapura|sacked the city of Anuradhapura]] causing the fall of [[Anuradhapura kingdom]]. Subsequently, they moved the capital to [[Polonnaruwa]].

=== Post-classical period ===
{{Main|Polonnaruwa period|Transitional period of }}

Following a 17-year-long campaign, [[Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa|Vijayabahu I]] successfully drove the Chola out of  in 1070, reuniting the country for the first time in over a century. Upon his request, ordained monks were sent from [[]] to  to re-establish Buddhism, which had almost disappeared from the country during the Chola reign. During the medieval period,  was divided into three sub-territories, namely, [[Principality of Ruhuna|Ruhunu]], Pihiti and [[Maya Rata|Maya]].

[[File:Gal Viharaya 02.jpg|thumb|The seated image of [[Gal Vihara]] in [[Polonnaruwa]], 12th century, which depicts the [[List of mudras (yoga)|dhyana mudra]], shows signs of [[Mahayana]] influence.]]
's [[ irrigation network|irrigation system]] was extensively expanded during the reign of [[Parakramabahu I of Polonnaruwa|Parākramabāhu the Great]] (1153–1186). This period is considered as a time when  was at the height of its power. He built 1,470 reservoirs – the highest number by any ruler in 's history – repaired 165 dams, 3,910 canals, 163 major reservoirs, and 2,376 mini-reservoirs. His most famous construction is the [[Parakrama Samudra]], the largest irrigation project of medieval . Parākramabāhu's reign is memorable for two major campaigns – in the south of  as part of a Pandyan war of succession, and a punitive strike against the kings of Ramanna ([[|]]) for various perceived insults to .

After his demise,  gradually decayed in power. In 1215, [[Kalinga Magha]], an invader with uncertain origins, identified as the founder of the Jaffna kingdom, invaded and captured the [[Kingdom of Polonnaruwa]]. He sailed from [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] 690 nautical miles on 100 large ships with a 24,000 strong army. Unlike previous invaders, he [[Looting|looted]], ransacked and destroyed everything in the ancient [[Anuradhapura kingdom|Anuradhapura]] and [[Kingdom of Polonnaruwa|Polonnaruwa]] Kingdoms beyond recovery. His priorities in ruling were to extract as much as possible from the land and overturn as many of the traditions of [[Rajarata]] as possible. His reign saw the massive migration of native [[Sinhalese people]] to the south and west of , and into the mountainous interior, in a bid to escape his power.

 never really recovered from the effects of Kalinga Magha's invasion. King Vijayabâhu III, who led the resistance, brought the kingdom to [[Kingdom of Dambadeniya|Dambadeniya]]. The north, in the meanwhile, eventually evolved into the [[Jaffna kingdom]]. The Jaffna kingdom never came under the rule of any kingdom of the south except on one occasion; in 1450, following the conquest led by king [[Parakramabahu VI of Kotte|Parâkramabâhu VI]]'s adopted son, [[Bhuvanaikabahu VI of Kotte|Prince Sapumal]]. He ruled the North from 1450 to 1467 CE.

The next three centuries starting from 1215 were marked by kaleidoscopically shifting collections of capitals in south and central , including Dambadeniya, [[Yapahuwa]], [[Gampola]], [[Raigama]], [[Kingdom of Kotte|Kotte]], [[Kingdom of Sitawaka|Sitawaka]], and finally, [[Kingdom of Kandy|Kandy]]. In 1247, the Malay kingdom of [[Tambralinga]] which was a vassal of [[Sri Vijaya]] led by their king [[Chandrabhanu]] briefly invaded  from [[Insular Southeast Asia]]. They were then expelled by the South  Pandyan dynasty. However, this temporary invasion reinforced the steady flow of the presence of various [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] merchant ethnic groups, from [[ Malays|Sumatrans]] () to [[– relations|Lucoes]] () into  which occurred since 200 BCE.  admiral [[Zheng He]] and his naval expeditionary force landed at Galle,  in 1409 and got into [[Ming-Kotte War|battle]] with the local king [[Vira Alakesvara of Gampola]]. Zheng He captured King Vira Alakesvara and later released him. Zheng He erected the [[Galle Trilingual Inscription]], a stone tablet at [[Galle]] written in three [[languages]] ([[ language|]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[Persian language|Persian]]), to commemorate his visit. The [[stele]] was discovered by S. H. Thomlin at Galle in 1911 and is now preserved in the [[National Museum of Colombo|Colombo National Museum]].

The early modern period of  begins with the arrival of  soldier and explorer [[Lourenço de Almeida]], the son of [[Francisco de Almeida]], in 1505. In 1517, the  built a fort at the port city of [[Colombo]] and gradually extended their control over the coastal areas. In 1592, after decades of intermittent warfare with the , [[Vimaladharmasuriya I]] moved his kingdom to the inland city of [[Kingdom of Kandy|Kandy]], a location he thought more secure from attack. In 1619, succumbing to attacks by the [[ Empire|]], the independent existence of the [[Jaffna kingdom]] came to an end.

During the reign of the [[Rajasinha II]],  explorers arrived on the island. In 1638, the king signed a [[Kandyan Treaty of 1638|treaty]] with the [[ East  Company]] to get rid of the  who ruled most of the coastal areas. The following [[– War]] resulted in a  victory, with Colombo falling into  hands by 1656. The  remained in the areas they had captured, thereby violating the treaty they had signed in 1638. The [[Burgher people]], a distinct ethnic group, emerged as a result of intermingling between the  and native  in this period.

The Kingdom of Kandy was the last independent monarchy of . In 1595, Vimaladharmasurya brought the sacred [[Relic of the tooth of the Buddha|Tooth Relic]]—the traditional symbol of royal and religious authority amongst the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]]—to Kandy and built the [[Temple of the Tooth]]. In spite of on-going intermittent warfare with Europeans, the kingdom survived. Later, a crisis of succession emerged in Kandy upon king [[Vira Narendra Sinha ]]'s death in 1739. He was married to a [[Telugu language|Telugu]]-speaking [[Nayaks of Madurai|Nayakkar]] princess from South  ([[Madurai]]) and was childless by her.

Eventually, with the support of [[bhikkhu]] Weliwita Sarankara and ignoring the right of ''"Unambuwe Bandara"'', the crown passed to the brother of one of Narendrasinha's princesses, overlooking Narendrasinha's own son by a Sinhalese [[Concubinage|concubine]]. The new king was crowned [[Sri Vijaya Rajasinha]] later that year. Kings of the Nayakkar dynasty launched several attacks on  controlled areas, which proved to be unsuccessful.

[[File:Sri Vikrama Rajasinha.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]] of Kandy, the last ruling native  monarch]]
During the [[ Revolutionary Wars]], fearing that  control of the  might deliver  to the , the [[ Empire]] occupied the coastal areas of the island (which they called the colony of [[ Ceylon]]) with little difficulty in 1796. Two years later, in 1798, [[Sri Rajadhi Rajasinha]], third of the four Nayakkar kings of , died of a fever. Following his death, a nephew of Rajadhi Rajasinha, eighteen-year-old Kannasamy, was crowned. The young king, now named [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]], faced a [[ Empire|]] invasion in 1803 but successfully retaliated. The First Kandyan War ended in a stalemate.

By then the entire coastal area was under the [[ East  Company]] as a result of the [[Treaty of Amiens]]. On 14 February 1815, [[Kingdom of Kandy|Kandy]] was occupied by the  in the [[Second Kandyan War]], ending 's independence. Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, the last native monarch of , was exiled to . The [[Kandyan Convention]] formally ceded the entire country to the  Empire. Attempts by  noblemen to undermine  power in 1818 during the [[Great Rebellion of 1817–1818|Uva Rebellion]] were thwarted by [[governors of  Ceylon|Governor]] [[Robert Brownrigg]].

The beginning of the modern period of  is marked by the [[Colebrooke–Cameron Commission|Colebrooke–Cameron reforms]] of 1833. They introduced a [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] political culture to the country based on the [[rule of law]] and amalgamated the Kandyan and maritime provinces as a single unit of government. An [[Executive Council of Ceylon|executive council]] and a [[Legislative Council of Ceylon|legislative council]] were established, later becoming the foundation of a representative legislature. By this time, experiments with [[coffee]] plantations were largely successful.

Soon, coffee became the primary commodity export of . Falling coffee prices as a result of the [[Panic of 1847|depression of 1847]] stalled economic development and prompted the governor to introduce a series of taxes on firearms, dogs, shops, boats, etc., and to reintroduce a form of ''rajakariya'', requiring six days free labour on roads or payment of a cash equivalent. These harsh measures antagonised the locals, and [[Matale rebellion|another rebellion]] broke out in 1848. A devastating leaf disease, ''[[Hemileia vastatrix]]'', struck the coffee plantations in 1869, destroying the entire industry within fifteen years. The  quickly found a replacement: abandoning coffee, they began cultivating tea instead. [[Tea production in ]] thrived in the following decades. Large-scale rubber plantations began in the early 20th century.

[[File:Kandyan Chiefs in 1905.JPG|upright=1.4|thumb|left| appointed [[Native headmen of Ceylon|Kandyan chief headmen]] in 1905.]]
By the end of the 19th century, a new educated [[social class]] transcending race and [[caste]] arose through  attempts to staff the [[Ceylon Civil Service]] and the legal, educational, engineering, and medical professions with natives. New leaders represented the various ethnic groups of the population in the [[Legislative Council of Ceylon|Ceylon Legislative Council]] on a communal basis. Buddhist and Hindu revivalists reacted against [[Christian missionary]] activities. The first two decades in the 20th century are noted by the unique harmony among Sinhalese and [[Tamils|Tamil]] political leadership, which has since been lost.

The [[1906 malaria outbreak in Ceylon]] actually started in the early 1900s, but the first case was documented in 1906.

In 1919, major Sinhalese and Tamil political organisations united to form the Ceylon National Congress, under the leadership of [[Ponnambalam Arunachalam]], pressing colonial masters for more constitutional reforms. But without massive popular support, and with the governor's encouragement for "communal representation" by creating a "Colombo seat" that dangled between Sinhalese and Tamils, the Congress lost momentum towards the mid-1920s.

The [[Donoughmore Constitution|Donoughmore reforms]] of 1931 repudiated the communal representation and introduced [[Universal suffrage|universal adult franchise]] (the franchise stood at 4% before the reforms). This step was strongly criticised by the Tamil political leadership, who realised that they would be reduced to a minority in the newly created [[State Council of Ceylon]], which succeeded the legislative council. In 1937, Tamil leader [[G. G. Ponnambalam]] demanded a 50–50 representation (50% for the Sinhalese and 50% for other ethnic groups) in the State Council. However, this demand was not met by the [[Soulbury Commission|Soulbury reforms]] of 1944–45.

The Soulbury constitution ushered in [[Dominion of Ceylon|dominion status]], with independence proclaimed on 4 February 1948. [[Don Stephen Senanayake|D. S. Senanayake]] became the first [[Prime Minister of |Prime Minister of Ceylon]]. Prominent [[Tamils|Tamil]] leaders including Ponnambalam and [[Arunachalam Mahadeva]] joined his cabinet. The [[Royal Navy| Royal Navy]] remained stationed at [[Trincomalee]] until 1956. A countrywide [[1953 Ceylonese Hartal|popular demonstration]] against withdrawal of the rice rations resulted in the resignation of prime minister [[Dudley Senanayake]].

[[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike]] was elected prime minister in 1956. His three-year rule had a profound influence through his self-proclaimed role of "defender of the besieged Sinhalese culture". He introduced the controversial [[Sinhala Only Act]], recognising [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] as the only official language of the government. Although partially reversed in 1958, the bill posed a grave concern for the Tamil community, which perceived in it a threat to their language and culture.

The [[Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi|Federal Party]] (FP) launched a movement of non-violent resistance ([[satyagraha]]) against the bill, which prompted Bandaranaike to reach an agreement ([[Bandaranaike–Chelvanayakam Pact]]) with [[S. J. V. Chelvanayakam]], leader of the FP, to resolve the looming ethnic conflict. The pact proved ineffective in the face of ongoing protests by opposition and the Buddhist clergy. The bill, together with various government [[ state-sponsored colonisation schemes|colonisation schemes]], contributed much towards the political rancour between Sinhalese and Tamil political leaders. Bandaranaike was [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike#Assassination|assassinated]] by an extremist Buddhist monk in 1959.

[[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]], the widow of Bandaranaike, took office as prime minister in 1960, and withstood an [[1962 Ceylonese coup d'état attempt|attempted coup d'état]] in 1962. During her second term as prime minister, the government instituted socialist economic policies, strengthening ties with the [[Soviet Union]] and , while promoting a policy of non-alignment. In 1971, Ceylon experienced a [[1971 JVP insurrection|Marxist insurrection]], which was quickly suppressed. In 1972, the country became a [[republic]] named , repudiating its dominion status. Prolonged minority grievances and the use of communal emotionalism as an election campaign weapon by both Sinhalese and Tamil leaders abetted a fledgling Tamil militancy in the north during the 1970s. The [[policy of standardisation]] by the Sirimavo government to rectify disparities created in university enrolment, which was in essence an [[affirmative action]] to assist geographically disadvantaged students to obtain tertiary education, resulted in reducing the proportion of Tamil students at university level and acted as the immediate catalyst for the rise of militancy. The assassination of [[Jaffna]] [[Mayor]] [[Alfred Duraiyappah]] in 1975 by the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) marked a crisis point.

The government of [[J. R. Jayawardene]] swept to power in 1977, defeating the [[United Front ()|United Front]] government. Jayawardene introduced a [[Constitution of |new constitution]], together with a [[free-market economy]] and a powerful [[Executive president|executive presidency]] modelled after that of . It made  the first [[South Asia]]n country to [[Liberalism|liberalise]] its economy. Beginning in [[Four Four Bravo|1983]], ethnic tensions were manifested in an [[ civil war|on-and-off insurgency]] against the government by the LTTE. An [[Four Four Bravo|LTTE attack on 13 soldiers]] resulted in the start of a civil war, and in response anti-Tamil [[Black July|race riots]] took place, allegedly backed by [[Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism|Sinhalese hard-line]] ministers, which resulted in more than 150,000 Tamil civilians fleeing the island, seeking asylum in other countries.

Lapses in foreign policy resulted in  strengthening the Tigers by providing arms and training. In 1987, the [[Indo- Accord]] was signed and the [[ Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF) was deployed in northern  to stabilise the region by neutralising the LTTE. The same year, the [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna|JVP]] launched its [[1987–89 JVP Insurrection|second insurrection]] in Southern , necessitating redeployment of the IPKF in 1990. In October 1990, the LTTE [[Expulsion of Muslims from the Northern province by LTTE|expelled  Moors]] (Muslims by religion) from northern . In 2002, the  government and LTTE signed a -mediated ceasefire agreement.

The [[2004  Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Asian tsunami]] killed over 30,000 and displaced over 500,000 people in . From 1985 to 2006, the  government and Tamil insurgents held four rounds of peace talks without success. Both LTTE and the government resumed fighting in 2006, and the government officially backed out of the ceasefire in 2008. In 2009, under the [[President of |Presidency]] of [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]], the [[ Armed Forces]] defeated the LTTE, bringing an end to the 26 year long civil war on 19 May 2009, and re-established control of the entire country by the  Government. Overall, between 60,000 and 100,000 people were killed during the course of the 26 year long conflict.

[[2019  Easter bombings]] carried out by the terrorist group [[National Thowheeth Jama'ath]] on 21 April 2019 resulted in the brutal death of 261 innocent people. On 26 April 2019 an anti [[Sainthamaruthu shootout|terrorist operation]] was carried out against the National Thowheeth Jama'ath by the [[ Army]] with the operation being successful and National Thowheeth Jama'ath's insurgency ending.
[[File:Anti-government protest in  2022.jpg|thumb|[[2022  protests| protesting]] in front of the [[Presidential Secretariat ()|Presidential Secretariat]] in Colombo, 13 April 2022]]
Economic troubles in  began in 2019, when a [[2019–present  economic crisis|severe economic crisis]] occurred caused by rapidly increasing foreign debt, massive government budget deficits due to tax cuts, falling foreign remittances, a food crisis caused by mandatory organic farming along with a ban on chemical fertilisers, and a multitude of other factors. The  Government officially declared the ongoing crisis to be the worst [[Economy of |economic crisis in the country]] in 73 years. In August 2021, a food emergency was declared. In June 2022, Prime Minister [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]] declared the collapse of the  economy in parliament. The crisis resulted in  defaulting on its $51 billion sovereign debt for the first time in its history, along with double-digit inflation, a crippling energy crisis that led to approximately 15 hour power cuts, severe fuel shortages leading to the suspension of fuel to all non-essential vehicles, and more such economic disorder. Due to the crisis, massive [[2022  protests|street protests]] erupted all over the country, with protesters demanding the resignation of the President [[Gotabaya Rajapaksa]]. The protests culminated with the storming and siege of the [[President's House, Colombo|President's House]] on 9 July 2022, and resulted in President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fleeing to  and later emailing his resignation to parliament, formally announcing his resignation and making him the first  president to resign in the middle of his term. On the same day the President's House was stormed, protesters besieged and stormed the [[115 Fifth Lane|private residence of the prime minister]] and burnt it down.

After [[Parliament of |Parliament]] elected the new president as [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]] on [[2022  presidential election|20 July 2022]], Wickremesinghe took oath as the ninth President of . He implemented various economic reforms in efforts to stabilise 's economy, which has shown slight improvement since. On 23 September 2024, [[Anura Kumara Dissanayake]] was sworn in as 's new president after winning the presidential [[2024  presidential election|election]] as a left-wing candidate. On 14 November 2024, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's [[National People's Power]] (NPP), a left-leaning alliance, received a two-thirds majority in parliament in  [[2024  parliamentary election|parliamentary election.]]

The presence of [[Oldowan]] artifacts in West Africa was confirmed by [[Michael Omolewa]], attesting to the presence of ancient humans.

Undated [[Acheulean]] ([[Early Stone Age]]) artifacts are well documented across [[West Africa]]. The emerging [[chronometric dating|chronometric record]] of the [[Middle Stone Age]] (MSA) indicates that [[lithic core|core]] and [[flake tool|flake]] technologies have been present in West Africa since at least the [[Chibanian]] (~780–126 thousand years ago or [[kiloannus|ka]]) in northern, open [[Sahel]]ian zones, and that they persisted until the [[Late Pleistocene|Terminal Pleistocene]]/[[Holocene]] boundary (~12&nbsp;ka) in both northern and southern zones of West Africa. This makes them the youngest examples of such MSA technology anywhere in Africa. The presence of MSA populations in forests remains an open question. Technological differences may correlate with various [[Afrotropical realm|ecological zones]]. [[Later Stone Age]] (LSA) populations evidence significant technological diversification, including both [[Microlitic industry|microlith]]ic and [[Stone tool#Neolithic industries|macrolithic]] traditions.

The record shows that [[aceramic]] and [[ceramic]] LSA assemblages in West Africa overlap chronologically, and that changing densities of [[microlithic industries]] from the coast to the north are geographically structured. These features may represent social networks or some form of cultural diffusion allied to changing ecological conditions.

Microlithic industries with ceramics became common by the [[Northgrippian|Mid-Holocene]], coupled with an apparent intensification of wild food exploitation. Between ~4–3.5&nbsp;ka, these societies gradually transformed into food producers, possibly through contact with northern pastoralists and agriculturalists, as the environment became more arid. Hunter-gatherers have survived in the more forested parts of West Africa until much later, attesting to the strength of ecological boundaries in this region.

The [[Pepper Coast]], also known as the Grain Coast, has been inhabited by indigenous peoples of Africa at least as far back as the 12th century. [[Mande peoples|Mande]]-speaking people expanded from the north and east, forcing many smaller ethnic groups southward toward the Atlantic Ocean. The [[Dei people|Dei]], [[Bassa ()|Bassa]], [[Kru people|Kru]], [[Gola (ethnic group)|Gola]], and [[Kissi people|Kissi]] were some of the earliest documented peoples in the area.

This influx of these groups was compounded by the decline of the [[ Empire]] in 1375 and the [[Songhai Empire]] in 1591. As inland regions underwent [[desertification]], inhabitants moved to the wetter coast. These new inhabitants brought skills such as cotton [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]], cloth [[weaving]], iron [[smelting]], [[rice]] and [[sorghum]] cultivation, and social and political institutions from the  and Songhai empires. Shortly after the [[Mane people|Mane]] conquered the region, the [[Vai people]] of the former  Empire immigrated into the [[Grand Cape Mount County]] region. The ethnic Kru opposed the influx of Vai, forming an alliance with the Mane to stop further influx of Vai.

People along the coast built [[canoe]]s and traded with other West Africans from [[Cap-Vert]] to the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]].

=== Early colonization ===
{{main|Colony of }}

Between 1461 and the late 17th century, [[ people|]], [[ people|]], and [[ people|]] traders had contacts and trading posts in the region. The  named the area ''Costa da Pimenta'' ("Pepper Coast") but it later came to be known as the [[Grain Coast]], due to the abundance of [[melegueta pepper]] grains. The traders would barter commodities and goods with local people.

In the , there was a movement to settle [[African ]], both free-born and formerly enslaved, in Africa. This was partially because they faced racial discrimination in the form of political disenfranchisement and the denial of civil, religious, and social rights. It was also partially because slave owners and politicians feared uprisings and rebellions of enslaved peoples. They believed these uprisings would be motivated by a desire to achieve the freedoms experienced by formerly enslaved peoples, specifically freedom from violence and reunions with separated family.

Formed in 1816, the [[ Colonization Society]] (ACS) was made up mostly of [[Quakers]] and slaveholders. Quakers believed black people would face better chances for freedom in Africa than in the U.S. While slaveholders opposed freedom for enslaved people, some viewed "[[repatriation]]" of free people of color as a way to avoid [[slave rebellion]]s.

In 1822, the ACS began sending free people of color to the Pepper Coast voluntarily to establish a colony. Mortality from [[tropical disease]]s was high—of the 4,571 emigrants who arrived in  between 1820 and 1843, only 1,819 survived. By 1867, the ACS (and state-related chapters) had assisted in the migration of more than 13,000 people of color from the  and the Caribbean to . These free African  and their descendants married within their community and came to identify as [[Americo-]]s. Many were of mixed race and educated in  culture; they did not identify with the indigenous natives of the tribes they encountered. They developed an ethnic group that had a cultural tradition infused with  notions of political republicanism and Protestant Christianity.

According to historian Henryatta Ballah, indigenous  cosmology was centralized around the existence of a supreme being and its worship through specific deities and ancestral spirits that they believed acted as intermediaries between themselves and the supreme being. Certain pieces of land were considered to be part of the spiritual land and were central to Indigenous ' resistance to their loss of land through colonization. Americo- and the  Colonization Society sought to eradicate all forms of Indigenous religious practices as a form of forced assimilation and to aid in their acquisition of land and political power. The term "witchcraft" was used to describe all Indigenous cosmologies in  and many missionaries described these religious practices as the most barbaric practices of all "native tribes". These ideas about Indigenous  cosmologies drove large-scale assimilation in the country beginning in the 1820s and continuing for decades.

[[File:Mitchell Map  colony 1839.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Map of  Colony in the 1830s, created by the ACS, and also showing Mississippi Colony and other state-sponsored colonies]]
The ACS, supported by prominent  politicians such as [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Henry Clay]], and [[James Monroe]], believed "repatriation" was preferable to having emancipated slaves remain in the . Similar state-based organizations established colonies in [[Mississippi-in-Africa]], [[Kentucky in Africa]], and the [[Republic of Maryland]], which  later annexed. Lincoln in 1862 described  as only "in a certain sense...a success", and proposed instead that free people of color be assisted to emigrate to [[Chiriquí Province|Chiriquí]], today part of .

The Americo- settlers did not relate well to the indigenous peoples they encountered, especially those in communities of the more isolated areas. The colonial settlements were raided by the [[Kru people|Kru]] and [[Grebo people|Grebo]] from their inland chiefdoms. Encounters with indigenous people in rural areas often became violent. Believing themselves to be different from and culturally and educationally superior to the indigenous peoples, the Americo- developed as an elite minority that created and held on to political power. The Americo- settlers adopted clothing such as [[hoop skirt]]s and [[tailcoat]]s and generally viewed themselves as culturally and socially superior to indigenous Africans. Indigenous people did not enjoy birthright citizenship in their own land until 1904.

=== Political formation ===
[[File:T. WILLIAMS (c1850) Residence of Joseph Roberts, President of the Republic of .jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Residence of [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], first President of , between 1848 and 1852]]

On July 26, 1847, the settlers issued a [[ Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and promulgated a [[ Constitution of 1847|constitution]]. Based on the political principles of the [[ Constitution]], it established the independent Republic of . On August 24,  adopted its 11-striped [[Flag of |national flag]]. The [[ of Great Britain and |]] was the first country to recognize 's independence. The  did not recognize  until 1862, after the Southern states, which had strong political power in the  government, declared their secession and the formation of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].

The leadership of the new nation consisted largely of the [[Americo-]]s, who at the beginning established political and economic dominance in the coastal areas that the ACS had purchased; they maintained relations with the  and contacts in developing these areas and the resulting trade. Their passage of the 1865 Ports of Entry Act prohibited foreign commerce with the inland tribes, ostensibly to "encourage the growth of civilized values" before such trade was allowed in the region. <!--How? -->

[[File:(1896) Departure of colored emigrants for  - The Illustrated , March 21, 1896.jpg|thumb|left|African  depart for , 1896. The ACS sent its last emigrants to  in 1904.]]

By 1877, the [[True Whig Party]] was the country's most powerful political entity. It was made up primarily of Americo-, who maintained social, economic and political dominance well into the 20th century, repeating patterns of European colonists in other nations in Africa. Competition for office was usually contained within the party; a party nomination virtually ensured election.

Pressure from the , which controlled [[]] to the northwest, and , with its interests in the north and east, led to a loss of 's claims to extensive territories. Both  and the  annexed territories.  struggled to attract investment to develop infrastructure and a larger, industrial economy.

There was a decline in the production of  goods in the late 19th century, and the government struggled financially, resulting in indebtedness on a series of international loans. On July 16, 1892, [[Martha Ann Erskine Ricks]] met [[Queen Victoria]] at Windsor Castle and presented her with a handmade quilt, 's first diplomatic gift. Born into slavery in Tennessee, Ricks said, "I had heard it often, from the time I was a child, how good the Queen had been to my people—to slaves—and how she wanted us to be free."

=== Early 20th century ===

==== World Wars and interwar period ====
{{further| in World War I| in World War II}}
In the early 1900s, 's export trade and merchant class largely collapsed. After the partition of Africa between the European powers in the 1800s,  businesses abandoned trade with  and turned to other countries in the Americas for tropical commodities. This abrupt change coupled with 's weak trading links between Britain and  caused  to sink into 'economic insignificance.' Despite this, some trade relations remained between  and , largely due to 's lack of tropical colonies.

At the beginning of the 20th century  was the only major country with an interest in  trade. By 1914,  owned one of the two banks in  as these trade routes strengthened. At the beginning of the first World War, the  Navy cut off  trade with , effectively severing all  trade. In 1917,  declared war on  following the U.S. in the hopes of receiving financial aid from the Allied Powers, specifically the . The [[ bombing of Monrovia]] was the only battle in which  was directly involved in [[World War I]]. Subsequently, it was [[List of participants to Paris Peace Conference, 1919–1920#Other national representatives|one of 32 nations]] to take part in the [[Versailles Peace Conference]] in 1919, which ended the war and established the [[League of Nations]];  was among the few African and non-Western nations to participate in the conference and the founding of the league.

Though aid from the  was promised to  in the amount of $5 million, the US Congress refused to sanction an official loan after the end of the First World War. When this aid did not come and trade continued to dwindle,  was forced to borrow from the Bank of  West Africa, furthering its debt from the $800,000 it owed in 1904. These financial difficulties helped pave the way for multinational foreign investment companies, specifically those interested in rubber, to make their way into  in the 1920s.

In the early 1920s, the  Empire controlled 67 percent of rubber output. As a result of the depression of 1921–1922, rubber prices fell. In order to protect  plantations, the  Empire placed export duties on rubber. In response, Firestone Tire and Rubber Company looked to begin a rubber plantation in . 's precarious financial situation and tensions with European powers following the first World War put them at risk for a losing conflict with the  and . Because of this,  agreed to a 99-year lease on one million acres of land in exchange for Firestone's aid in the liquidation of 's indebtedness. This eased tensions with the European banks to whom  owed money and allowed  to focus economically on infrastructure and defense. Despite this exchange,  and its peoples were hesitant about the agreement due to Firestone's proposed extensive involvement in the  economy and government. Regardless of opposition,  was unable to separate Firestone's involvement in the country's financial and governmental sectors due to the company's financial aid and 's debt.  eventually agreed to Firestone's terms at the urging of the  government.

The onset of the 1929 depression in the  caused an extreme drop in the price of rubber, significantly lowering rubber plantations' expected revenue. In light of this,  sought to relieve itself of its repayment obligations to Firestone. Firestone was not responsive to the ' requests, and in December 1932  unilaterally suspended repayment. Work on the plantation was suspended, and Firestone called on the U.S. government to send a warship to Monrovia. The dispute was settled in 1935, with Firestone advancing $650,000 to  and gaining exemption from the export tax and from personal income tax on its expatriate employees for the rest of the time it took to repay the loan.

Firestone was confronted with labor force issues within its  plantations. The  people had, up to that point, largely participated in subsistence agriculture and did not participate in a market economy. This made it difficult for Firestone to develop a wage-labor force. In response, the company attempted to redesign 's economic and labor system through impressment, tax systems designed to pry labor out of the traditional economy by creating need for cash income, and forced labor. Because of Firestone's existence as the only major employer besides the  government, these exploitative systems existed until they were abolished in the 1970s. However, scholars such as Animesh Ghoshal argue that these colonial structures still exist today in different forms.

In [[1927  general election|1927, the country's elections]] again showed the power of the True Whig Party, with electoral proceedings that have been called some of the most rigged ever; the winning candidate was declared to have received votes amounting to more than 15 times the number of eligible voters. (The loser actually received around 60% of the eligible vote.)

Soon after, allegations of [[modern slavery]] in  led the League of Nations to establish the [[Cuthbert Christy#Christy commission|Christy Commission]]. Findings included government involvement in widespread "forced or compulsory labour". Minority ethnic groups especially were exploited in a system that enriched well-connected elites. As a result of the report, President [[Charles D. B. King]] and Vice President [[Allen N. Yancy]] resigned.

In the mid-20th century,  gradually began to modernize with  assistance. During [[World War II]], the  made major infrastructure improvements to support its military efforts in Africa and Europe against . It built the [[Freeport of Monrovia]] and [[Roberts International Airport]] under the [[Lend-Lease]] program before its entry into the Second World War.

In 1944, President Tubman announced his "Open Door" policy. This policy, which encouraged foreign investment, gave  an attractive climate for foreign investment and increased involvement of multinational foreign investment in the country. Despite this, Firestone remained and still remains one of the largest influences on the  economy. This influence has raised concerns in regards to the effects of foreign investment on 's political and economic policies. Economists such as Elliot Berg have stated that economic growth may be confined to export goods with foreign producers, which removes some of 's economic autonomy. In international affairs, it was a founding member of the [[United Nations]], a vocal critic of [[]]n [[apartheid]], a proponent of African independence from European colonial powers, and a supporter of [[Pan-Africanism]].  also helped to fund the [[Organisation of African Unity]].

=== Late 20th-century political instability ===
[[File:Technical .jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A [[Technical (vehicle)|technical]] in Monrovia during the [[Second  Civil War]]]]

On April 12, 1980, [[1980  coup d'état|a military coup]] led by Master Sergeant [[Samuel Doe]] of the [[Krahn]] ethnic group overthrew and killed President [[William R. Tolbert Jr.]] Doe and the other plotters later executed most of Tolbert's cabinet and other Americo- government officials and True Whig Party members on a Monrovia beach. The coup leaders formed the [[People's Redemption Council]] (PRC) to govern the country. A strategic [[Cold War]] ally of the West, Doe received significant financial backing from the  while critics condemned the PRC for corruption and political repression.

After  adopted a [[Constitution of |new constitution]] in 1985, Doe was elected president in [[1985  general election|subsequent elections]] that were internationally condemned as fraudulent. On November 12, 1985, a failed coup was launched by [[Thomas Quiwonkpa]], whose soldiers briefly occupied the national [[radio station]]. Government repression intensified in response, as Doe's troops responded by executing members of the [[Gio people|Gio]] and [[Mano people|Mano]] ethnic groups in [[Nimba County]].

The [[National Patriotic Front of ]], a rebel group led by [[Charles Taylor ()|Charles Taylor]], launched an insurrection in December 1989 against Doe's government with the backing of neighboring countries such as [[]] and [[]]. This triggered the [[First  Civil War]]. By September 1990, Doe's forces controlled only a small area just outside the capital, and Doe was captured and executed in that month by rebel forces.

The rebels soon split into conflicting factions. The [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group|Economic Community Monitoring Group]] under the [[Economic Community of West African States]] organized an armed intervention. Between 1989 and 1997, around 60,000 to 80,000  died, and, by 1996, around 700,000 others had been displaced into refugee camps in neighboring countries. A peace deal between warring parties was reached in 1995, leading to [[1997  general election|Taylor's election as president in 1997]].

Under Taylor's leadership,  became a [[pariah state]] due to its use of [[blood diamond]]s and illegal [[timber]] exports to fund the [[Revolutionary United Front]] in the [[ Civil War]]. The [[Second  Civil War]] began in 1999 when [[ United for Reconciliation and Democracy]], a rebel group based in the northwest of the country, launched an armed insurrection against Taylor.

=== 21st century ===
In March 2003, a second rebel group, [[Movement for Democracy in ]], began launching attacks against Taylor from the southeast. Peace talks between the factions began in [[Accra]] in June of that year, and Taylor was indicted by the [[Special Court for ]] (SCSL) for crimes against humanity the same month. By July 2003, the rebels had launched an [[Siege of Monrovia|assault on Monrovia]]. Under heavy pressure from the international community and the domestic [[Women of  Mass Action for Peace]] movement, Taylor resigned in August 2003 and went into exile in [[]]. A peace deal was signed later that month.

The [[United Nations Mission in ]] began arriving in September 2003 to provide security and monitor the peace accord, and an interim government took power the following October. The subsequent [[2005  general election|2005 elections]] were internationally regarded as the freest and fairest in  history. [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], a US-educated economist, former Minister of Finance and future [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner, was elected as the first female president in Africa. Upon her inauguration, Sirleaf requested the extradition of Taylor from  and transferred him to the SCSL for trial in [[The Hague]].

In 2006, the government established a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission ()|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to address the causes and crimes of the civil war. In 2011, July 26 was proclaimed by President Sirleaf as National Independence Day. In October 2011, peace activist [[Leymah Gbowee]] received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in her work of leading a women's peace movement that brought to an end to the [[Second  Civil War]] in 2003. In November 2011, President Sirleaf was [[2011  general election|re-elected]] for a second six-year term.

Following the [[2017  general election]], former professional [[Association football|football]] striker [[George Weah]], considered one of the greatest African players of all time, was sworn in as president on January 22, 2018, becoming the fourth youngest serving president in Africa. The inauguration marked 's first fully democratic transition in 74 years. Weah cited fighting corruption, reforming the economy, combating illiteracy, and improving living conditions as the main targets of his presidency. Opposition leader [[Joseph Boakai]] defeated Weah in the tightly contested [[2023  general election|2023 presidential election]]. On January 22, 2024, Boakai was sworn in as 's new president.

The  archipelago has been inhabited since the time of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' or "[[Java Man]]," with fossils dating back 2 million to 500,000 BCE. Fossils of ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'', found on Flores, date around 700,000 to 60,000 BCE, while ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' arrived around 50,000 BCE. Sulawesi and Borneo are home to the world's oldest known [[cave painting]]s, dating back 40,000 to 60,000 years, and megalithic sites such as western Java's ''[[Gunung Padang]]'', Sulawesi's ''[[Lore Lindu National Park|Lore Lindu]]'', as well as Sumatra's Nias and Sumba reflect early human settlements and ceremonial practices.

Around 2,000 BCE, [[Austronesian peoples]] began arriving in Southeast Asia from the island of [[Taiwan]], gradually displacing native [[Melanesians]] to the far eastern part of the archipelago as they spread east,{{sfn|Taylor|2003|pp=5–7}} and would eventually form the majority of 's modern population. Favourable agricultural conditions and advancements like [[Paddy field|wet-field rice cultivation]] by the 8th century BCE{{sfn|Taylor|2003|pp=8–9}} enabled the growth of villages and kingdoms by the first century CE. The archipelago's strategic location fostered inter-island and international exchange with civilisations from the  subcontinent and mainland , profoundly influencing  history and culture through trade.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|pp=3, 9–11, 13–15, 18–20, 22–23}}{{sfn|Vickers|2005|pp=18–20, 60, 133–134}}{{sfn|Taylor|2003|pp=15–18}}

By the 7th century CE, the [[Srivijaya]] naval kingdom thrived on trade, adopting Hindu and Buddhist influences. The 8th to 10th centuries saw the rise and decline of the Buddhist [[Sailendra]] and Hindu [[Mataram Kingdom|Mataram]] dynasties, leaving monumental legacies like the [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]] temples. After the failed [[Mongol invasion of Java]] in the late 13th century, the Hindu [[Majapahit]] kingdom rose to dominate much of the archipelago under [[Gajah Mada]]'s leadership—a period often called the "Golden Age" of  history. Islam [[Spread of Islam in |arrived]] in the 13th century in northern Sumatra,{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=3–14}} and following gradual adoption in other islands, it became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the 16th century, blending with pre-existing traditions to form a distinct Islamic culture, particularly in Java.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=12–14}}

Over the next century and a half,  control over the archipelago was tenuous, as they faced continuous rebellions from local leaders like Prince [[Diponegoro]] in central Java, [[Imam Bonjol]] in central Sumatra, [[Pattimura]] in Maluku, and [[Aceh War|fighters in Aceh]].{{sfn|Schwarz|1994|pp=3–4}}{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=142}}{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=21}}  dominance only extended to 's modern boundaries in the early 20th century,{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=21}}{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=61–147}}{{sfn|Taylor|2003|pp=209–278}}{{sfn|Vickers|2005|pp=10–14}} with the establishment of  posts in [[New ]].

In the [[7th millennium BC]], ecological conditions in the northern half of  territory favoured human settlement, and its population increased considerably. Some of the most important [[African archaeology|African archaeological]] sites are found in , mainly in the [[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region]]; some date to earlier than 2000 BC.

[[File:Group of Kanem-Bu warriors.jpg|thumb|Group of Kanem-Bu warriors. The [[Kanem–Bornu Empire]] controlled almost all of what is today .]]

For more than 2,000 years, the  Basin has been inhabited by agricultural and [[sedentism|sedentary]] people. The region became a crossroads of civilisations. The earliest of these was the legendary [[Sao civilisation|Sao]], known from artifacts and oral histories. The Sao fell to the [[Kanem Empire]], the first and longest-lasting of the empires that developed in 's [[Sahel]]ian strip by the end of the 1st millennium AD. Two other states in the region, [[Sultanate of Bagirmi]] and [[Wadai Empire]], emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries. The power of Kanem and its successors was based on control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes that passed through the region. These states, at least tacitly [[Islam in Africa|Muslim]], never extended their control to the southern grasslands except to raid for slaves. In Kanem, about a third of the population were slaves.

The colonial administration in  was critically understaffed and had to rely on the dregs of the  civil service. Only the [[Sara people|Sara]] of the south was governed effectively;  presence in the Islamic north and east was nominal. The educational system was affected by this neglect.

The  administration's focus on cotton led to the formation of a precarious underclass of poorly-paid rural workers, a decrease in food production and even to [[famine]]s in some areas. Tensions between farmers and elites culminated in the 1952 [[Bébalem massacre]] by colonial authorities.

=== Tombalbaye rule (1960–1979) ===
Two years later, Tombalbaye banned opposition parties and established a one-party system. Tombalbaye's autocratic rule and insensitive mismanagement exacerbated inter-ethnic tensions. In 1965, Muslims in the north, led by the [[FROLINAT|National Liberation Front of ]] ({{langx|fr|Front de libération nationale du Tchad}}, FRONILAT), began a [[Transitional Government of National Unity ()|civil war]]. Becoming gradually more erratic, Tombalbaye's regime alienated even his southern base of support, notably through the forced introduction of ''yondo'' (ritual scarring) for [[Public service|public servants]] and the 1973 assassination of expatriate dissident [[Outel Bono]] in Paris. Tombalbaye was [[1975  coup d'état|overthrown and killed]] in 1975, but the insurgency continued. In 1979 the rebel factions led by [[Hissène Habré]] took the capital, and all central authority in the country collapsed. Armed factions, many from the north's rebellion, contended for power.

=== Dictatorship of Habré (1987–1990) ===
Habré consolidated his dictatorship through a power system that relied on corruption and violence with thousands of people estimated to have been killed under his rule. The president favoured his own [[Toubou people|Toubou]] ethnic group and discriminated against his former allies, the [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]]. His general, [[Idriss Déby]], overthrew him in 1990. Attempts to prosecute Habré led to his placement under house arrest in [[]] in 2005; in 2013, Habré was formally charged with war crimes committed during his rule. In May 2016, he was found guilty of human-rights abuses, including rape, sexual slavery, and ordering the killing of 40,000 people, and sentenced to life in prison.

[[File:Idriss Déby at the White House in 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Despite internal political opposition, coup attempts, and a civil war, [[Idriss Déby]] continuously ruled  from 1990 until his death in 2021]]

Déby attempted to reconcile the rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics.  approved a [[Constitution of |new constitution]] by [[1996  constitutional referendum|referendum]], and in 1996, Déby easily won a [[ presidential election, 1996|competitive presidential election]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of }}
[[African Pygmies|Pygmies]] likely once lived in the continental region that is now , but are today found only in isolated pockets in southern Río Muni. [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] migrations likely started around 2,000 BC from between south-east  and north-west  (the Grassfields). They must have settled continental  around 500 BC at the latest. The earliest settlements on Bioko Island are dated to AD 530. The [[Annobonese Creole|Annobón]] population, originally native to [[]], was introduced by the  via [[ island]].

=== First European contact and  rule (1472–1778) ===
[[File:1729 West Africa map ( & ).jpg|thumb|left|[[ Empire|]] rule in  lasted from the arrival of [[Fernão do Pó]] (Fernando Pó) in 1472 until the [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|1778 Treaty of El Pardo]]]]

The [[ Empire| explorer]] [[Fernão do Pó|Fernando Pó]], seeking a path to , is credited as being the first European to see the island of Bioko, in 1472. He called it ''Formosa'' ("Beautiful"), but it quickly took on the name of its European discoverer. [[Fernando Pó (island)|Fernando Pó]] and Annobón were colonized by  in 1474. The first factories were established on the islands around 1500 as the  quickly recognized the positives of the islands including volcanic soil and disease-resistant highlands. Despite natural advantages, initial  efforts in 1507 to establish a sugarcane plantation and town near what is now Concepción on Fernando Pó failed due to Bubi hostility and fever.

===Early  rule and lease to Britain (1778–1844)===
[[File:África Ecuatorial Española.svg|thumb|left|Evolution of  possessions and claims in the Gulf of , 1778–1968 (in )]]

In 1778,  and  signed the [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|Treaty of El Pardo]]. The treaty ceded [[Bioko]] and adjacent islets along with commercial rights to the [[Bight of Bonny|Bight of Biafra]] between the [[ River|]] and [[Ogoue River|Ogoue rivers]] to  in exchange for large areas of modern-day western [[]] being ceded to . [[Brigadier]] [[Felipe José, Count of Arjelejos]] of the [[ Navy]] formally took possession of Bioko from  on 21 October 1778. While sailing to Annobón to take possession of it, Arjelejos died from a tropical disease contracted on Bioko and his fever-ridden crew mutinied. The crew, after having lost over 80% of their men to sickness, instead landed on  where they were imprisoned by  colonial authorities. 

As a result of this disaster,  was subsequently hesitant to invest heavily in its new possession. However, despite such a setback,  merchants began to use the island as a base for engaging in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Between 1778 and 1810, the territory of what became  was administered by the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]], based in [[Buenos Aires]]. Unwilling to significantly invest in the development of Fernando Pó, from 1827 to 1843 the  leased a base in [[Bioko]] to the [[ of Great Britain and |]], which the  had sought as part of their efforts to suppress the slave trade. 

In the same year the  leased the base in Bioko, Britain unilaterally moved the headquarters of the [[Mixed Commission for the Suppression of Slave Traffic]] to Fernando Pó in 1827, before moving it back to [[]] under an agreement with  in 1843. 's decision to abolish its involvement in the slave trade under  pressure in 1817 damaged the colony's perceived value to the  and so leasing naval bases was an effective revenue earner from an otherwise unprofitable possession. Plans by  to sell its African colony to Britain was cancelled in 1841 due to opposition from  politicians and the public.

=== Late 19th century (1844–1900) ===
[[File:(1897) Golfo de .jpg|thumb|Map of the  possessions in 1897, before the [[Treaty of Paris (1900)]]]]

In 1844, the  returned the island to  control and the area became known as the "Territorios Españoles del Golfo de ". Due to epidemics,  did not invest much in the colony, and in 1862, an outbreak of [[yellow fever]] killed many of the whites that had settled on the island. Despite this, plantations continued to be established by private citizens through the second half of the 19th century.

The [[plantation]]s of [[Bioko|Fernando Pó]] were mostly run by a black [[Creole elite]], later known as [[Fernandino peoples|Fernandinos]]. The  settled some 2,000  and freed slaves there during their rule, and a trickle of immigration from West Africa and the West Indies continued after the  left. A number of freed  slaves, -African creoles and immigrants from , and  also began to be settled in the colony, where they quickly began to join the new group. To the local mix were added , , Jews and Spaniards of various colours, many of whom had been deported to Africa for political or other crimes, as well as some settlers backed by the government.

By 1870, the prognosis of whites that lived on the island was much improved after recommendations that they live in the highlands, and by 1884 much of the minimal administrative machinery and key plantations had moved to [[Pico Basilé|Basile]] hundreds of meters above sea level. [[Henry Morton Stanley]] had labeled Fernando Pó "a jewel which  did not " for refusing to enact such a policy. Despite the improved survival chances of Europeans living on the island, [[Mary Kingsley]], who was staying on the island, still described Fernando Pó as "a more uncomfortable form of execution" for Spaniards appointed there.

There was also a trickle of immigration from the neighboring  islands, escaped slaves, and prospective planters. Although a few of the [[Fernandino peoples|Fernandinos]] were Catholic and -speaking, about nine-tenths of them were Protestant and -speaking on the eve of the First World War, and [[pidgin ]] was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the island. The  were particularly well placed as planters while labor recruitment on the [[|Windward coast]] continued. The Fernandinos became traders and middlemen between the natives and Europeans. A freed slave from the West Indies by way of [[]] named William Pratt established the cocoa crop on Fernando Pó.

 had not occupied the large area in the [[Bight of Biafra]] to which it had right by [[treaty]], and the  had expanded their occupation at the expense of the territory claimed by . Madrid only partly backed the explorations of men like [[Manuel Iradier]] who had signed treaties in the interior as far as  and , leaving much of the land out of "effective occupation" as demanded by the terms of the 1885 [[Berlin Conference]]. Minimal government backing for mainland annexation came as a result of public opinion and a need for labour on Fernando Pó.

The eventual [[Treaty of Paris (1900)|treaty of Paris]] in 1900 left  with the continental [[enclave and exclave|enclave]] of Río Muni, only 26,000&nbsp;km{{sup|2}} out of the 300,000km{{sup|2}} stretching east to the [[Ubangi River|Ubangi river]] which the Spaniards had initially claimed. The humiliation of the Franco- negotiations, combined with the disaster in  led to the head of the  negotiating team, [[Pedro Gover y Tovar]], committing suicide on the voyage home on 21 October 1901. Iradier himself died in despair in 1911; decades later, the port of [[Cogo, |Cogo]] was renamed Puerto Iradier in his honour.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Land regulations issued in 1904–1905 favoured Spaniards, and most of the later big planters arrived from  after that.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} An agreement was made with  in 1914 to import cheap labor. Due to malpractice however, the  government eventually ended the treaty after revelations about the state of  workers on Fernando Pó in the Christy Report which brought down the country's president [[Charles D. B. King]] in 1930.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

[[File:Corisco-Saliendo de misa-1910.jpg|thumb|[[Corisco]] in 1910]]By the late nineteenth century, the Bubi were protected from the demands of the planters by  [[Claretians|Claretian]] missionaries, who were very influential in the colony and eventually organised the Bubi into little mission theocracies reminiscent of the famous [[Jesuit]] [[Reducciones|reductions]] in [[]]. Catholic penetration was furthered by two small insurrections in 1898 and 1910 protesting [[conscription]] of [[Forced labor|forced labour]] for the plantations. The Bubi were disarmed in 1917, and left dependent on the missionaries. Serious labour shortages were temporarily solved by a massive influx of refugees from  [[Kamerun]], along with thousands of white  soldiers who stayed on the island for several years.

Between 1926 and 1959, Bioko and Río Muni were united as the colony of [[ ]]. The economy was based on large [[cocoa bean|cacao]] and [[coffee]] plantations and [[logging]] concessions and the workforce was mostly immigrant [[contract labour]] from [[]], [[]], and [[Cameroun]]. Between 1914 and 1930, an estimated 10,000  went to Fernando Po under a labour treaty that was stopped altogether in 1930. With  workers no longer available, planters of Fernando Po turned to Río Muni. Campaigns were mounted to subdue the [[Fang people]] in the 1920s, at the time that  was beginning to cut back on recruitment. There were garrisons of the colonial guard throughout the enclave by 1926, and the whole colony was considered 'pacified' by 1929.

[[File:Iberia- vuelo inaugural a Bata () (1941) (5811105541).jpg|thumb|right|Inaugural flight with [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] from [[Madrid]] to [[Bata, |Bata]], 1941]]

The [[ Civil War]] had a major impact on the colony. A group of 150  whites, including the Governor-General and Vice-Governor-General of Río Muni, created a socialist party called the Popular Front in the enclave which served to oppose the interests of the Fernando Pó plantation owners. When the War broke out [[Francisco Franco]] ordered Nationalist forces based in the Canaries to ensure control over . In September 1936, Nationalist forces backed by Falangists from Fernando Pó took control of Río Muni, which under Governor-General Luiz Sanchez Guerra Saez and his deputy Porcel had backed the Republican government. By November, the Popular Front and its supporters had been defeated and  secured for Franco. The commander in charge of the occupation, Juan Fontán Lobé, was appointed Governor-General by Franco and began to exert more  control over the enclave interior.

Río Muni officially had a little over 100,000 people in the 1930s; escape into [[Cameroun]] or [[]] was easy. Fernando Pó thus continued to suffer from labour shortages. The  only briefly permitted recruitment in Cameroun, and the main source of labour came to be [[Igbo people|Igbo]] smuggled in canoes from [[Calabar]] in [[]]. This resolution led to Fernando Pó becoming one of Africa's most productive agricultural areas after the [[Second World War]].

=== Final years of  rule (1945–1968) ===

[[File:Fraga na sinatura da independencia de  Ecuatorial.jpg|thumb|Signing of the independence of  by the  minister [[Manuel Fraga]] together with the new Equatorial  president [[Macías Nguema]] on 12 October 1968]]

Politically, post-war colonial history has three fairly distinct phases: up to 1959, when its status was raised from "colonial" to "provincial", following the approach of the [[ Empire]]; between 1960 and 1968, when Madrid attempted a partial [[decolonisation]] aimed at keeping the territory as part of the  system; and from 1968 on, after the territory became an independent [[republic]]. The first phase consisted of little more than a continuation of previous policies; these closely resembled the policies of  and , notably in dividing the population into a vast majority governed as 'natives' or non-citizens, and a very small minority (together with whites) admitted to civic status as ''[[emancipados]]'', [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] to the metropolitan culture being the only permissible means of advancement.

This "provincial" phase saw the beginnings of [[nationalism]], but chiefly among small groups who had taken refuge from the ''[[Caudillo]]''{{'}}s paternal hand in Cameroun and . They formed two bodies: the [[Atanasio Ndongo Miyone|Movimiento Nacional de Liberación de la ]] (MONALIGE), and the [[Idea Popular de  Ecuatorial]] (IPGE). By the late 1960s, much of the African continent had been granted independence. Aware of this trend, the  began to increase efforts to prepare the country for independence. The [[Gross national income|gross national product]] per capita in 1965 was $466, which was the highest in black Africa; the  constructed an international airport at Santa Isabel, a television station and increased the literacy rate to 89%. In 1967, the number of hospital beds per capita in  was higher than  itself, with 1637 beds in 16 hospitals. By the end of colonial rule, the number of Africans in higher education was in only the double digits.

A decision of 9 August 1963, approved by a referendum of 15 December 1963, gave the territory a measure of autonomy and the administrative promotion of a 'moderate' group, the {{Interlanguage link|Movimiento de Unión Nacional de  Ecuatorial|es}} (MUNGE). This was unsuccessful, and, with growing pressure for change from the UN, Madrid was gradually forced to give way to the currents of nationalism. Two General Assembly resolutions were passed in 1965 ordering  to grant independence to the colony, and in 1966, a UN Commission toured the country before recommending the same thing. In response, the  declared that they would hold a constitutional convention on 27 October 1967 to negotiate a new constitution for an independent . The conference was attended by 41 local delegates and 25 Spaniards. The Africans were principally divided between Fernandinos and Bubi on one side, who feared a loss of privileges and 'swamping' by the Fang majority, and the Río Muni Fang nationalists on the other. At the conference, the leading Fang figure, the later first president [[Francisco Macías Nguema]], gave a controversial speech in which he claimed that [[Adolf Hitler]] had "saved Africa". After nine sessions, the conference was suspended due to deadlock between the "unionists" and "separatists" who wanted a separate Fernando Pó. Macías resolved to travel to the UN to bolster international awareness of the issue, and his firebrand speeches in New York contributed to  naming a date for both independence and general elections. In July 1968 virtually all Bubi leaders went to the UN in New York to try and raise awareness for their cause, but the world community was uninterested in quibbling over the specifics of colonial independence. The 1960s were a time of great optimism over the future of the former African colonies, and groups that had been close to European rulers, like the Bubi, were not viewed positively.

=== Independence under Macías (1968–1979) ===
[[File:Don Francisco Macias.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francisco Macías Nguema]], first [[president of ]] in 1968, became a dictator until he was overthrown in a coup d'état in 1979.]]
Independence from  was gained on 12 October 1968, at noon in the capital, Malabo. The new country became the Republic of  (the date is celebrated as the country's [[List of national independence days|Independence Day]]). Macías became president in the country's [[1968   general election|only free and fair election to date]]. The  (ruled by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]) had backed Macías in the election; much of his campaigning involved visiting rural areas of Río Muni and promising that they would have the houses and wives of the  if they voted for him.{{cn|date=March 2025}} He had won in the second round of voting.

During the [[ Civil War]], Fernando Pó was inhabited by many Biafra-supporting Ibo migrant workers and many refugees from the breakaway state fled to the island. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] began running relief flights out of , but Macías quickly shut the flights down, refusing to allow them to fly diesel fuel for their trucks nor oxygen tanks for medical operations. The Biafran separatists were starved into submission without international backing.

After the Public Prosecutor complained about "excesses and maltreatment" by government officials, Macías had 150 alleged coup-plotters executed in a purge on Christmas Eve 1969, all of whom were political opponents. Macias Nguema further consolidated his [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian powers]] by [[One-party state|outlawing opposition political parties]] in July 1970 and making himself [[president for life]] in 1972. He broke off ties with  and the West. In spite of his condemnation of [[Marxism]], which he deemed "[[Neo-colonialism|neo-colonialist]]",  maintained special relations with [[communist state]]s, notably , , [[East ]] and the [[USSR]]. Macias Nguema signed a preferential [[trade agreement]] and a shipping treaty with the Soviet Union. The Soviets also made loans to . The shipping agreement gave the Soviets permission for a pilot [[fishery]] development project and also a naval base at [[Luba, |Luba]]. In return, the USSR was to supply fish to .  and  also gave different forms of financial, military, and technical assistance to , which got them a measure of influence there. For the USSR, there was an advantage to be gained in the [[ Civil War|war in ]] from access to Luba base and later on to [[Malabo International Airport]].

In 1974, the [[World Council of Churches]] affirmed that large numbers of people had been murdered since 1968 in an ongoing [[revolutionary terror|reign of terror]]. A quarter of the entire population had fled abroad, they said, while 'the prisons are overflowing and to all intents and purposes form one vast concentration camp'. Out of a population of 300,000, an estimated 80,000 were killed. Apart from allegedly committing [[genocide]] against the ethnic minority [[Bubi people]], Macias Nguema ordered the deaths of thousands of suspected opponents, closed down churches and presided over the economy's collapse as skilled citizens and foreigners fled the country.

=== Obiang (1979–present) ===
[[File:Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo with Obamas 2014.jpg|thumb|Obiang and U.S. president [[Barack Obama|Obama]] with their wives in 2014]]
The nephew of Macías Nguema, [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo|Teodoro Obiang]] deposed his uncle on 3 August 1979, in a bloody ''[[1979  coup d'état|coup d'état]]''; over two weeks of civil war ensued until Macías Nguema was captured. He was tried and executed soon afterward, with Obiang succeeding him as a less bloody, but still authoritarian president.

In 1995, [[Mobil]], an  oil company, discovered oil in . The country subsequently experienced rapid economic development, but earnings from the country's oil wealth have not reached the population and the country ranks low on the UN human development index. 7.9% of children die before the age of 5, and more than 50% of the population lacks access to clean [[drinking water]]. Obiang is widely suspected of using the country's oil wealth to enrich himself and his associates. In 2006, ''Forbes'' estimated his personal wealth at $600 million.

In 2011, the government announced it was planning a new capital for the country, named [[Ciudad de la Paz|Oyala]]. The city was renamed [[Ciudad de la Paz]] ("City of Peace") in 2017.

{{as of|2016|February|}}, Obiang was Africa's second-longest serving dictator.  was elected as a non-permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council]] 2018–2019. On 7 March 2021, there were [[2021 Bata explosions|munition explosions]] at a military base near the city of [[Bata, |Bata]], causing 107 deaths. In November 2022, Obiang was re-elected in the [[2022 Equatorial  general election]] with 99.7% of the vote amid accusations of fraud by the opposition.

In 2024 it was published that mercenaries from the [[Wagner Group]] (now called "Africa Corps") had entered  at the request of Teodoro Obiang. According to opponents, the objective of the mercenaries was to help consolidate a hypothetical succession of Obiang's power to his son "[[Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue|Teodorín]]".

On 19 May 2025 the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) granted  sovereignty over [[Mbanie Island]], Cocoteros Island, and Conga Island in response to territorial claims that neighboring [[]] had been making since 1972.

On 10 November 2025 it was reported that the [[second Trump administration]] had sent $7.5M to the government of  to accept non-citizen deportees from the , an amount far exceeding the total amount of U.S. aid sent to the country in the past eight years according to Sen. [[Jeanne Shaheen]] of New Hampshire.

===Prehistory===

There is no archaeological evidence of any human presence on  until about 500. A group known as the "Redware people" after their pottery arrived circa 600, followed by the Taíno circa 800, who most likely came from [[South America]]. They practised an agrarian and fishing economy, and at their height are thought to have numbered some 60,000 people, grouped into around 200 villages headed by ''[[cacique]]s'' (chiefs). The south coast of  was the most populated, especially around the area now known as Old Harbour.

Though often thought to have become extinct following contact with Europeans, the Taíno in fact still inhabited  when the  took control of the island in 1655. Some fled into interior regions, merging with African [[ Maroons|Maroon]] communities. The  National Heritage Trust is attempting to locate and document any remaining evidence of the Taíno.

Christopher Columbus was the first European to see , claiming the island for  after landing there in 1494 on his second voyage to the Americas. His probable landing point was Dry Harbour, called [[Discovery Bay, |Discovery Bay]], and [[ Ann Parish|St. Ann's Bay]] was named " Gloria" by Columbus, as the first sighting of the land. He later returned in 1503; however, he was shipwrecked and he and his crew were forced to live on  for a year while waiting to be rescued.

One and a half kilometres west of St. Ann's Bay is the site of the first  settlement on the island, [[Sevilla la Nueva ()|Sevilla]], which was established in 1509 by [[Juan de Esquivel]] but abandoned around 1524 because it was deemed unhealthy. The capital was moved to [[ Town]], then called ''St. Jago de la Vega'', around 1534. Meanwhile, the Taínos began dying in large numbers, both from introduced diseases and from enslavement by the . As a result, the  began importing slaves from Africa to the island.

Many slaves managed to escape, forming autonomous communities in remote and easily defended areas in the interior of , mixing with the remaining Taino; these communities became known as [[ Maroons|Maroons]]. [[History of the Jews in |Many Jews fled the  Inquisition]] to live on the island. They lived as [[conversos]] and were often persecuted by the  rulers, and some turned to [[Jewish pirates|piracy against the  Empire's shipping]].

By the early 17th century it is estimated that no more than 2,500–3,000 people lived on .{{page needed|date=July 2019}}

===Early  period===
{{Main|Colony of }}
[[File:Morgan,Henry.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Morgan]] was a [[Piracy in the Caribbean|Caribbean pirate]], privateer, plantation owner and slaveholder; he had first come to the West Indies as an indentured servant, like most of the early  colonists.]]
The  began taking an interest in the island and, following a failed attempt to conquer [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] on [[Hispaniola]], [[William Penn (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral William Penn]] and General [[Robert Venables]] led an [[invasion of ]] in 1655. Battles at [[Battle of Ocho Rios|Ocho Rios in 1657]] and the [[Battle of Rio Nuevo|Rio Nuevo in 1658]] resulted in  defeats; in 1660 the Maroon community under the leadership of [[Juan de Bolas]] switched sides from the , and began supporting the . With their help, the  defeat was secured. In 1661  civil government was formed and [[Roundhead]] soldiers turned their attention to governance and agricultural responsibilities.

When the  captured , most  colonists fled, with the exception of  Jews, who chose to remain.  slave holders freed their slaves before leaving. Many slaves dispersed into the mountains, joining the already established [[maroon (people)|maroon]] communities. During the centuries of slavery, [[ Maroons]] established free communities in the mountainous interior of , where they maintained their freedom and independence for generations, under the leadership of Maroon leaders such as [[Juan de Serras]].

Meanwhile, the  made several attempts to re-capture the island, prompting the  to support pirates attacking  ships in the Caribbean; as a result piracy became rampant on , with the city of [[Port Royal]] becoming notorious for its lawlessness.  later recognised  possession of the island with the [[Treaty of Madrid (1670)]]. After that, the  authorities sought to rein in the worst excesses of the pirates. During this period, Cromwell had begun to extradite  criminals of war from [[Scotland]] to the island, with 1,200 Scots being sent to the island which had recently been colonised by England. The method of sending  prisoners of war to the island continued, and as a result, Scots played a significant role in the development of the island, being credited as "indentured and skilled labourers".

In 1660, the population of  was about 4,500 white and 1,500 black. By the early 1670s, as the  developed sugar cane plantations worked by large numbers of slaves, black Africans formed a majority of the population. The [[ people in | in ]] also formed a large part of the island's early population, making up two-thirds of the white population on the island in the late 17th century, twice that of the  population. They were brought in as indentured labourers and soldiers after the conquest of 1655. The majority of  were transported by force as political prisoners of war from  as a result of the ongoing [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. Migration of large numbers of  to the island continued into the 18th century.

A limited form of local government was introduced with the creation of the [[House of Assembly of ]] in 1664; however, it represented only a tiny number of rich plantation owners. In 1692, the colony was rocked by an [[1692  earthquake|earthquake]] that resulted in several thousand deaths and the almost complete destruction of Port Royal.

During the 1700s the economy boomed, based largely on sugar and other crops for export such as [[coffee]], [[cotton]] and [[indigo]]. All these crops were worked by black slaves, who lived short and often brutal lives with no rights, being the property of a small planter-class. In the 18th century, slaves ran away and joined the Maroons in increasing numbers, and resulted in The [[First Maroon War]] (1728 – 1739/40), which ended in stalemate. The  government sued for peace, and signed treaties with the Leeward Maroons led by [[Cudjoe]] and [[Accompong]] in 1739, and the Windward Maroons led by [[Quao]] and [[Queen Nanny]] in 1740.

A large slave rebellion, known as [[Tacky's War]], broke out in 1760 but was defeated by the  and their Maroon allies. After the [[Second Maroon War|second conflict]] in 1795–96, many Maroons from the Maroon town of [[Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town)]] were expelled to [[Nova Scotia]] and, later, [[]].[[File:Hakewill, A Picturesque Tour of the Island of , Plate 04.jpg|thumb|Harbour Street, Kingston, {{Circa|1820}}]]By the beginning of the 19th century, 's dependence on slave labour and a plantation economy had resulted in black people outnumbering [[white people]] by a ratio of almost 20 to 1. Although the  had outlawed the importation of slaves, some were still smuggled in from  colonies and directly from Africa.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} While planning the abolition of slavery, the  Parliament passed laws to improve conditions for slaves. They banned the use of whips in the field and flogging of women; informed planters that slaves were to be allowed religious instruction, and required a free day during each week when slaves could sell their produce, prohibiting Sunday markets to enable slaves to attend church.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The House of Assembly in  resented and resisted the new laws. Members, with membership then restricted to European-descended , claimed that the slaves were content and objected to Parliament's interference in island affairs. Slave owners feared possible revolts if conditions were lightened.
The  [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolished the slave trade]] in 1807, but not the institution itself. In 1831 a huge slave rebellion, known as the [[Baptist War]], broke out, led by the Baptist preacher [[Samuel Sharpe]]. The rebellion resulted in hundreds of deaths and the destruction of many plantations, and led to ferocious reprisals by the plantocracy class.

As a result of rebellions such as these, as well as the efforts of abolitionists, Britain outlawed slavery in its empire in 1834, with full [[Abolitionism in the |emancipation]] from chattel slavery declared in 1838. The population in 1834 was 371,070, of whom 15,000 were white, 5,000 free black; 40,000 "coloured" or [[Free people of color|free people of colour]] ([[mixed race]]); and 311,070 were slaves.

The resulting labour shortage prompted the  to begin to "import" [[indentured servant]]s to supplement the labour pool, as many freedmen resisted working on the plantations. Workers recruited from  began arriving in 1845,  workers in 1854.  Many  are descendants of South Asian and  people. Over the next 20 years, several epidemics of [[cholera]], [[scarlet fever]], and [[smallpox]] hit the island, killing almost 60,000 people (about 10 per day).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Nevertheless, in 1871 the census recorded a population of 506,154 people, 246,573 of whom were males, and 259,581 females. Their races were recorded as 13,101 white, 100,346 coloured (known as the Browning Class), and 392,707 black. There was an economic slump in this period, with many  living in poverty. Dissatisfaction with this, and continued racial discrimination and marginalisation of the black majority, led to the outbreak of the [[Morant Bay rebellion]] in 1865, led by [[Paul Bogle]], which was put down by Governor [[Edward John Eyre|John Eyre]] with such brutality that he was recalled from his position. His successor, [[John Peter Grant]], enacted a series of social, financial and political reforms while aiming to uphold firm  rule over the island, which became a Crown Colony in 1866. In 1872 the capital was transferred from  Town to Kingston.

In 1907,  was struck by [[1907 Kingston earthquake|an earthquake]] which, together with the subsequent fire, resulted in considerable destruction in Kingston and caused  the deaths of between 800 and 1,000 people.

Unemployment and poverty remained a problem for many . Various movements seeking political change arose as a result, most notably the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]] founded by [[Marcus Garvey]] in 1917. As well as seeking greater political rights and an improvement for the condition of workers, Garvey was also a prominent [[Pan-Africanist]] and proponent of the [[Back-to-Africa movement]]. He was also one of the chief inspirations behind Rastafari, a religion founded in  in the 1930s that combined Christianity with an [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] theology focused on the figure of [[Haile Selassie]], Emperor of [[]]. Despite occasional persecution, Rastafari grew to become an established faith on the island, later spreading abroad.

The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s hit  hard. As part of the [[ West  labour unrest of 1934–39]],  saw numerous strikes, culminating in a strike in 1938 that turned into a riot.
As a result, the  government instituted [[Report of West  Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|a commission]] to look into the causes of the disturbances; their report recommended political and economic reforms in Britain's Caribbean colonies. A new House of Representatives was established in 1944, elected by universal adult suffrage. During this period 's two-party system emerged, with the creation of the [[ Labour Party]] (JLP) under [[Alexander Bustamante]] and the [[People's National Party]] (PNP) under [[Norman Manley]].

 slowly gained increasing autonomy from the . In 1958 it became a province in the [[Federation of the West Indies]], a federation of several of [[ West Indies|Britain's Caribbean colonies]]. Membership of the Federation proved to be divisive, however, and a [[1961  Federation of the West Indies membership referendum|referendum]] on the issue saw a slight majority voting to leave. After leaving the Federation,  attained full [[Independence of |independence]] on 6 August 1962. The new state retained, however, its membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] (with the  monarch as head of state) and adopted a [[Westminster parliamentary system|Westminster-style parliamentary system]]. Bustamante, at the age of 78, became the country's first prime minister.

===Post-independence era===
{{Main|Independence of }}
Strong economic growth, averaging approximately 6% per year, marked the first ten years of independence under conservative JLP governments; these were led by successive Prime Ministers Alexander Bustamante, [[Donald Sangster]] (who died of natural causes within two months of taking office) and [[Hugh Shearer]]. The growth was fuelled by high levels of private investment in [[bauxite]]/[[alumina]], [[tourism]], the manufacturing industry and, to a lesser extent, the agricultural sector. In the [[1967  general election]], the JLP were victorious again, winning 33 out of 53 seats, with the PNP taking 20 seats.

In terms of foreign policy  became a member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], seeking to retain strong ties with Britain and the  whilst also developing links with Communist states such as .

[[File:Michael Manley.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michael Manley]], Prime Minister 1972–1980 and 1989–1992]]
The optimism of the first decade was accompanied by a growing sense of inequality among many Afro-, and a concern that the benefits of growth were not being shared by the urban poor, many of whom ended up living in crime-ridden shanty towns in Kingston. This led to the voters [[1972  general election|electing the PNP]] under [[Michael Manley]] in 1972. The PNP won 37 seats to the JLP's 16.

Manley's government enacted various social reforms, such as a higher [[minimum wage]], land reform, legislation for women's equality, greater housing construction and an increase in educational provision. Internationally he improved ties with the Communist bloc and vigorously opposed the [[apartheid]] regime in [[]].

In 1976, the PNP won another landslide, winning 47 seats to the JLP's 13. The turnout was a very high 85 percent. However, the economy faltered in this period due to a combination of internal and external factors (such as the oil shocks). The rivalry between the JLP and PNP became intense, and [[ political conflict|political and gang-related violence]] grew significantly in this period.

By 1980, 's gross national product had declined to some 25% below its 1972 level.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Seeking change, in 1980  voted the JLP [[1980  general election|back in]] under [[Edward Seaga]], the JLP winning 51 seats to the PNP's nine seats. Firmly anti-Communist, Seaga cut ties with  and sent troops to support the [[US invasion of ]] in 1983. The economic deterioration, however, continued into the mid-1980s, exacerbated by a number of factors. The largest and third-largest alumina producers, [[Alpart]] and [[Alcoa]], closed; and there was a significant reduction in production by the second-largest producer, [[Alcan]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Reynolds  Mines, Ltd. left the  industry. There was also a decline in tourism, which was important to the economy.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Owing to rising foreign and local debt, accompanied by large fiscal deficits, the government sought [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) financing, which was dependent on implementing various austerity measures. These resulted in strikes in 1985 and a decline in support for the Seaga government, exacerbated by criticism of the government's response to the devastation caused by [[Hurricane Gilbert]] in 1988. Having now de-emphasised socialism and adopting a more centrist position, Michael Manley and the PNP were [[1989  general election|re-elected in 1989]], winning 45 seats to the JLP's 15.

The PNP went on to win a string of elections, under Prime Ministers Michael Manley (1989–1992), [[P. J. Patterson]] (1992–2005) and [[Portia Simpson-Miller]] (2005–2007). In the [[1993  general election]], Patterson led the PNP to victory, winning 52 seats to the JLP's eight seats. Patterson also won the [[1997  general election]], by another landslide margin of 50 seats to the JLP's 10 seats. Patterson's third consecutive victory came in the [[2002  general election]], when the PNP retained power, but with a reduced seat majority of 34 seats to 26. Patterson stepped down on 26 February 2006, and was replaced by [[Portia Simpson-Miller]], 's first female Prime Minister. The turnout slowly declined during this period of time, from 67.4% in 1993 to 59.1% in 2002.

During this period various economic reforms were introduced, such as deregulating the finance sector and floating the  dollar, as well as greater investment in infrastructure, whilst also retaining a strong social safety net. Political violence, so prevalent in the previous two decades, declined significantly.

In [[2007  general election|2007]] the PNP was defeated by the JLP by a narrow margin of 32 seats to 28, with a turnout of 61.46%. This election ended 18 years of PNP rule, and [[Bruce Golding]] became the new prime minister. Golding's tenure (2007–2010) was dominated by the effects of the [[Great Recession|global recession]], as well as the fallout from [[2010 Kingston unrest|an attempt]] by  police and military to arrest drug lord [[Christopher Coke]] in 2010 which erupted in violence, resulting in over 70 deaths. As a result of this incident Golding resigned and was replaced by Andrew Holness in 2011.

Independence, however widely celebrated in , has been questioned in the early 21st century. In 2011, a survey showed that approximately 60% of  believe that the country would have been better off had it remained a  colony, with only 17% believing it would have been worse off, citing as problems years of social and fiscal mismanagement in the country. Holness and the JLP were defeated in the [[2011  general election]], which saw Portia Simpson-Miller and the PNP return to power. The number of seats had been increased to 63, and the PNP swept to power with a landslide 42 seats to the JLP's 21. The voter turnout was 53.17%.

Holness's JLP won the [[2016  general election|2016]] general election narrowly, defeating Simpson-Miller's PNP, on 25 February. The PNP won 31 seats to the JLP's 32. As a result, Simpson-Miller became Opposition Leader for a second time. The voter turnout dipped below 50% for the first time, registering just 48.37%.

In the [[2020  general election|2020 general election]], Andrew Holness secured a second consecutive win for the  Labour Party, winning 49 seats to 14 won by the PNP, led this time by [[Peter Phillips (politician)|Peter Phillips]]. The last time a consecutive win occurred for the JLP was in 1980. However, the turnout at this election was just 37%, probably affected by the coronavirus pandemic. However, this low turnout was a trend that continued in subsequent elections.

In the [[2025  general election]], Holness created history, securing a third consecutive term for the JLP, the first time the party had won three general elections in a row. However, this victory was achieved with a much-reduced majority. The JLP won 34 seats to the 29 won by the [[Mark Golding]] led PNP. The turnout was again low, at just 39.5%.

{{Main|Prehistoric Iberia}}

[[File:2014 Castro de Santa Trega. Galiza-2.jpg|thumb|Celtic castro in Galicia]]
Archaeological research at [[Archaeological site of Atapuerca|Atapuerca]] indicates the Iberian Peninsula was populated by [[hominid]]s 1.3&nbsp;million years ago.

[[Human|Modern humans]] first arrived in Iberia from the north on foot about 35,000 years ago. The best-known artefacts of these prehistoric human settlements are the paintings in the [[Altamira (cave)|Altamira cave]] of Cantabria in northern Iberia, which were created from 35,600 to 13,500 [[Before Common Era|BCE]] by [[Cro-Magnon]]. Archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the Iberian Peninsula acted as one of several major refugia from which northern Europe was repopulated following the end of the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]].

The two largest groups inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula before the Roman conquest were the [[Iberians]] and the [[Celts]]. The Iberians inhabited the Mediterranean side of the peninsula. The Celts inhabited much of the interior and Atlantic sides of the peninsula. [[Basques]] occupied the western area of the Pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas. Phoenician-influenced [[Tartessos|Tartessians]] flourished in the southwest. [[Lusitanians]] and [[Vettones]] occupied areas in the central west. Several cities were founded along the coast by [[Phoenicia]]ns. Trading outposts and colonies were established by [[ colonisation|]] in the East. Eventually, Phoenician-[[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] expanded inland towards the meseta. Due to the bellicose inland tribes, the Carthaginians settled on the coasts of the Iberian Peninsula.

=== Roman Hispania and the Visigothic Kingdom ===
{{Main|Hispania|Visigothic Kingdom}}

During the [[Second Punic War]], roughly between 210 and 205&nbsp;BCE, the expanding [[Roman Republic]] captured Carthaginian trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast. It took the Romans nearly two centuries to complete the [[Roman conquest of the Iberian peninsula|conquest of the Iberian Peninsula]]. They retained control of it for over six centuries. Roman rule was bound together by law, language, and the [[Roman road]]. The cultures of the pre-Roman populations were gradually [[Romanization of Hispania|Romanised]] (Latinised) at different rates depending on what part of the peninsula they lived in, with local leaders being admitted into the Roman aristocratic class.{{efn|The ''[[latifundia]]'' (sing., ''latifundium''), large estates controlled by the aristocracy, were superimposed on the existing Iberian landholding system.}}

Hispania, the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula, served as a granary for the Roman market, and its harbours exported gold, [[wool]], [[olive oil]], and wine. Agricultural production increased with the introduction of irrigation projects, some of which remain in use. Emperors [[Hadrian]], [[Trajan]], [[Theodosius I]], and the philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] were born in Hispania.{{efn|The poets [[Martial]], [[Quintilian]] and [[Lucan]] were also born in Hispania.}} Christianity was introduced into Hispania in the 1st century CE, and it became popular in the cities in the 2nd century. Most of 's present languages and religions, as well as the basis of its laws, originate from this period. Starting in 170 CE, incursions of North-African [[Mauri]] in the province of [[Hispania Baetica|Baetica]] took place.

The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]], together with the [[Sarmatian]] [[Alans]], entered the peninsula after 409, weakening the Western Roman Empire's jurisdiction over Hispania. The Suebi established a kingdom in north-western Iberia. The Vandals established themselves in the south of the peninsula by 420, before crossing over to North Africa in 429. As the western Roman empire disintegrated, the social and economic base became greatly simplified. The successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire, including Christianity and assimilation into the evolving Roman culture.

The [[Byzantine]]s established an occidental province, [[Spania]], in the south, with the intention of reviving Roman rule throughout Iberia. Eventually, however, Hispania was reunited under [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic rule]].

=== Muslim era and ''Reconquista'' ===
{{See also|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Al-Andalus|Reconquista}}
From 711 to 718, as part of the expansion of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] which had [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|conquered North Africa]] from the [[Byzantine Empire]], nearly all of the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by Muslims from across the Strait of Gibraltar, resulting in the collapse of the Visigothic Kingdom. Only a small area in the mountainous north of the peninsula stood out of the territory seized during the initial invasion. The [[Kingdom of Asturias|Kingdom of Asturias-León]] consolidated upon this territory. Other Christian kingdoms, such as [[kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] in the mountainous north, eventually surged upon the consolidation of counties of the Carolingian ''[[Marca Hispanica]]''. For several centuries, the fluctuating frontier between the Muslim and Christian-controlled areas of the peninsula was along the [[Ebro]] and [[Douro]] valleys.

Conversion to [[Islam]] proceeded at an increasing pace. The ''[[Muwallad|muladíes]]'' (Muslims of ethnic Iberian origin) are believed to have formed the majority of the population of Al-Andalus by the end of the 10th century. A series of [[Viking]] incursions raided the coasts of the Iberian Peninsula in the 9th and 10th centuries. The first recorded [[Viking raid on Seville|Viking raid on Iberia took place in 844]]. Seville was pillaged. It ended in failure with many Vikings killed by the Galicians' [[ballista]]s. Seventy of the Vikings' longships captured on the beach and burned by the troops of King [[Ramiro I of Asturias]]. In the 11th century, the Caliphate of Córdoba collapsed, fracturing into a series of petty kingdoms (''[[Taifa]]s''), often subject to the payment of a form of [[protection racket|protection money]] (''[[Parias]]'') to the Northern Christian kingdoms, which otherwise undertook a southward territorial expansion. The capture of the strategic city of [[Toledo, |Toledo]] in 1085 marked a significant shift in the balance of power in favour of the Christian kingdoms. The arrival from North Africa of the Islamic ruling sects of the [[Almoravids]] and the [[Almohads]] achieved temporary unity upon the Muslim-ruled territory, with a stricter, less tolerant application of Islam, and partially reversed some Christian territorial gains.

[[File:Ferdinand of Aragon, Isabella of Castile (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Catholic Monarchs of ]]]]

The [[Kingdom of León]] was the strongest Christian kingdom for centuries. In 1188, the first form (restricted to the bishops, the magnates, and 'the elected citizens of each city') of modern parliamentary session in Europe was held in [[León ()|León]] ([[Cortes of León]]). The [[Kingdom of Castile]], formed from Leonese territory, was its successor as the strongest kingdom. The kings and the nobility fought for power and influence in this period. The example of the Roman emperors influenced the political objective of the Crown, while the nobles benefited from [[feudalism]].

Muslim strongholds in the [[Guadalquivir Valley]] such as Córdoba (1236) and [[Seville]] (1248) fell to Castile in the 13th century. The [[County of Barcelona]] and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] entered in a dynastic union and gained territory and power in the Mediterranean. In 1229, [[Mallorca]] was conquered, as was [[Valencia]] in 1238. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the North-African [[Marinid]]s established some enclaves around the Strait of Gibraltar. Upon the conclusion of the [[Granada War]], the [[Kingdom of Granada|Nasrid Sultanate of Granada]] (the remaining Muslim-ruled polity in the Iberian Peninsula after 1246) capitulated in 1492 to the military strength of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], and it was integrated from then on in the Crown of Castile.

[[File:La sevilla del sigloXVI.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Late 16th-century Seville, the harbor enjoying the exclusive right to trade with the New World]]
In 1469, the crowns of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon were united by the marriage of their monarchs, Isabella I and Ferdinand II, respectively. In 1492, as part of the [[ Inquisition]], Jews were forced to choose between conversion to Catholicism or expulsion; as many as 200,000 Jews were [[Expulsion of Jews from |expelled from Castile and Aragon]]. The year 1492 also marked the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the [[New World]], during a voyage funded by Isabella. Columbus's first voyage crossed the Atlantic and reached the Caribbean Islands, beginning the European exploration and conquest of the Americas.

The [[Treaty of Granada]] guaranteed religious tolerance towards Muslims, for a few years before Islam was outlawed in 1502 in Castile and 1527 in Aragon, leading the remaining Muslim population to become nominally Christian ''[[Morisco]]s''. About four decades after the [[War of the Alpujarras]] (1568–1571), over 300,000 [[Expulsion of the Moriscos|''moriscos'' were expelled]], settling primarily in North Africa.

[[File: Empire (diachronic).svg|thumb|upright=1.2|A diachronic map of the  Empire]]
The unification of the crowns of Aragon and Castile by the marriage of their sovereigns laid the basis for modern  and the  Empire, although each kingdom of  remained a separate country socially, politically, legally, and in currency and language.

[[Habsburg ]] was one of the leading world powers throughout the 16th century and most of the 17th century, a position reinforced by trade and wealth from colonial possessions and became the world's leading [[ Navy|maritime power]]. It reached its apogee during the reigns of the first two  Habsburgs—[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V/I]] (1516–1556) and [[Philip II of |Philip II]] (1556–1598). This period saw the [[ conquest of the Aztec Empire| conquest of the Aztec]] and [[ conquest of the Inca Empire|Inca]] empires, the [[ Wars]], the [[Schmalkaldic War]], the [[ Revolt]], the [[War of the  Succession]], clashes with the [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|Ottomans]], intervention in the [[ Wars of Religion]], and the [[Anglo- War (1585–1604)|Anglo- War]].

[[File:Principales Rutas Comerciales del Imperio Español.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Main trade routes of the  Empire]]
Through exploration and conquest or royal marriage alliances and inheritance, the [[ Empire]] expanded across vast areas in the Americas, the Indo-Pacific, Africa as well as the European continent, including holdings in the  Peninsula, the [[Low Countries]] and the [[Franche-Comté]]. The so-called [[Age of Discovery]] featured explorations by sea and by land, the opening-up of new [[trade route]]s across oceans, conquests and the beginnings of European [[colonialism]]. [[Precious metal]]s, spices, luxuries, and previously unknown plants brought to the metropole played a leading part in transforming the European understanding of the globe. 
[[File:Plaza Mayor de Madrid 06.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Plaza Mayor of Madrid built in 1619 during the reign of Philip III.]]
The cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the [[ Golden Age]]. The expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the Americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from Europe devastated  indigenous populations. The rise of [[humanism]], the [[Counter-Reformation]] and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the [[School of Salamanca]], which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as [[international law]] and human rights.
's 16th-century maritime supremacy was demonstrated by the victory over the [[Ottoman Empire]] at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571 and over  at the [[Battle of Vila Franca do Campo|Battle of Ponta Delgada]] in 1582, and then after the setback of the [[ Armada]] in 1588, in a series of victories against [[England]] in the [[Anglo- War (1585–1604)|Anglo- War of 1585–1604]]. In the middle decades of the 17th century, 's maritime power went into a long decline with mounting defeats against the [[ Republic]] ([[Battle of the Downs]]) and then England in the [[Anglo- War (1654–1660)|Anglo- War of 1654–1660]]. By the 1660s,  was struggling to defend its overseas possessions from pirates and privateers.

The [[Protestant Reformation]] increased 's involvement in religiously charged wars, forcing ever-expanding military efforts across Europe and in the Mediterranean. By the middle decades of a war- and [[Great Plague of Seville|plague]]-ridden 17th-century Europe, the  Habsburgs had enmeshed  in continent-wide religious-political conflicts. These conflicts drained  of resources and undermined the economy generally.  managed to hold on to most of the scattered Habsburg empire, and help the imperial forces of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] reverse a large part of the advances made by Protestant forces.

In the latter half of the 17th century,  went into a gradual decline, during which it surrendered several small territories to  and England; however, it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire, which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century.

====18th century====
[[File:La familia de Felipe V (Van Loo).jpg|thumb|[[The Family of Philip V (1743)|The family of Philip V]]. During the [[Enlightenment in ]] a new royal family reigned, the [[House of Bourbon]].]]
The decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne, which consumed the first years of the 18th century. The [[War of the  Succession]] was a wide-ranging international conflict combined with a civil war, and cost the kingdom its European possessions and its position as a leading European power.

During this war, a new dynasty originating in , the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], was installed. The Crowns of Castile and Aragon had been long united only by the Monarchy and the common institution of the Inquisition's [[ Inquisition|Holy Office]]. A number of reform policies, the so-called [[Bourbon Reforms]], were pursued by the Monarchy with the overarching goal of centralised authority and administrative uniformity. They included the abolishment of many of the old regional privileges and laws, as well as the customs barrier between the Crowns of Aragon and Castile in 1717, followed by the introduction of new property taxes in the Aragonese kingdoms.

The 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the  empire. The predominant economic policy was an interventionist one, and the State also pursued policies aiming towards infrastructure development as well as the abolition of internal customs and the reduction of export tariffs. Projects of agricultural colonisation with new settlements took place in the south of mainland .{{Sfn|Martínez Shaw|2016|pp=14; 23}} [[Enlightenment in |Enlightenment]] ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom's elite and monarchy.

In 1793,  went to war against the revolutionary new [[First  Republic| Republic]] as a member of [[War of the First Coalition|the first Coalition]]. The subsequent [[War of the Pyrenees]] polarised the country in a reaction against the [[Francization|gallicised]] elites and following defeat in the field, peace was made with  in 1795 at the [[Peace of Basel]] in which  lost control over two-thirds of the island of [[Hispaniola]]. In 1807, a secret treaty between [[Napoleon I of |Napoleon]] and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against Britain and .  troops entered the country to invade  but instead occupied 's major fortresses. The  king abdicated and a puppet kingdom satellite to the  Empire was installed with [[Joseph Bonaparte]] as king.

The [[Dos de Mayo Uprising|2 May 1808 revolt]] was one of many uprisings across the country against the  occupation. These revolts marked the beginning of a devastating [[Peninsular War|war of independence]] against the Napoleonic regime.{{sfn|Gates|2001|p=20}} Further military action by  armies, [[guerrilla]] warfare and an Anglo- allied army, combined with [[Napoleon's Invasion of |Napoleon's failure on the  front]], led to the retreat of  imperial armies from the Iberian Peninsula in 1814, and the return of [[Ferdinand VII of |King Ferdinand VII]].{{sfn|Gates|2001|p=467}}

During the war, in 1810, a revolutionary body, the [[Cortes of Cádiz]], was assembled to coordinate the effort against the Bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution. It met as one body, and its members represented the entire  empire. In 1812, a [[ Constitution of 1812|constitution]] for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared, but after the fall of the Bonapartist regime, the  king dismissed the Cortes Generales, set on ruling as an [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]].

The  occupation of mainland  created an opportunity for overseas [[Criollo people|''criollo'']] elites who resented the privilege towards [[Peninsulars|Peninsular elites]] and demanded [[retroversion of the sovereignty to the people]]. Starting in 1809 the  colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence, leading to the [[  wars of independence]] that put an end to the metropole's grip over the [[ Main]]. [[Reconquista ( America)|Attempts to re-assert control]] proved futile with opposition not only in the colonies but also in the Iberian peninsula and army revolts followed. By the end of 1826, the only  colonies  held were [[Captaincy General of |]] and [[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]]. The Napoleonic War left  economically ruined, deeply divided and politically unstable. In the 1830s and 1840s, [[Carlism]] (a reactionary legitimist movement supportive of an alternative Bourbon branch), fought against the government forces supportive of Queen [[Isabella II of |Isabella II]]'s dynastic rights in the [[Carlist Wars]]. Government forces prevailed, but the conflict between [[Progressive Party ()|''progressives'']] and ''[[Moderate Party ()|moderates]]'' ended in a weak early constitutional period. The 1868 [[Glorious Revolution ()|Glorious Revolution]] was followed by the 1868–1874 progressive ''[[Sexenio Democrático]]'' (including the short-lived [[First  Republic]]), which yielded to a stable monarchic period, the [[Restoration ()|Restoration]] (1875–1931).

In the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the  and . In 1895 and 1896 the [[ War of Independence]] and the [[ Revolution]] broke out and eventually<!--For whatever reasons; it is not for here to go into long explanations!--> the  became involved. The [[– War]] was fought from April to August 1898 and resulted in  losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of North Africa. ''El Desastre'' (the Disaster), as the war became known in , gave added impetus to the [[Generation of '98]]. Although the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity, the 20th century brought little social peace.  played a minor part in the [[scramble for Africa]]. It remained neutral [[ during World War I|during World War I]]. The heavy losses suffered by the colonial troops in conflicts in northern  against Riffians forces brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy.

Industrialisation, the development of railways and incipient capitalism developed in several areas of the country, particularly in [[Barcelona]], as well as [[labour movement]] and socialist and anarchist ideas. The [[1870 Barcelona Workers' Congress]] and the [[1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition]] are good examples of this. In 1879, the [[ Socialist Workers' Party]] was founded. A trade union linked to this party, [[Unión General de Trabajadores]], was founded in 1888. In the anarcho-syndicalist trend of the labour movement in , [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] was founded in 1910 and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] in 1927. Catalanism and Vasquism, alongside other nationalisms and regionalisms in , arose in that period: the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] formed in 1895 and [[Regionalist League of Catalonia]] in 1901. Political corruption and repression weakened the democratic system of the constitutional monarchy of a two-parties system. The July 1909 [[Tragic Week ()|Tragic Week]] events and repression exemplified the social instability of the time. The [[La Canadiense strike]] in 1919 led to the first law limiting the working day to eight hours.

After a period of Crown-supported dictatorship from 1923 to 1931, the first elections since 1923, largely understood as a plebiscite on Monarchy, took place: the [[1931  local elections|12 April 1931 municipal elections]]. These gave a resounding victory to the Republican-Socialist candidacies in large cities and provincial capitals, with a majority of monarchist councilors in rural areas. The king left the country and the proclamation of the Republic on 14 April ensued, with the formation of a provisional government. A [[ Constitution of 1931|constitution]] for the country was passed in October 1931 following the [[1931  general election|June 1931 Constituent general election]], and a series of cabinets presided by [[Manuel Azaña]] supported by republican parties and the [[ Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] followed. In the election held in 1933 the right triumphed and in 1936, the left. During the [[Second  Republic|Second Republic]] there was a great political and social upheaval, marked by a sharp radicalisation of the left and the right. Instances of political violence during this period included the burning of churches, the [[Sanjurjada|1932 failed coup d'état led by José Sanjurjo]], the [[Revolution of 1934]] and numerous attacks against rival political leaders. On the other hand, it is also during the Second Republic when important reforms to modernise the country were initiated: a democratic constitution, agrarian reform, restructuring of the army, political decentralisation and [[Women's suffrage|women's right to vote]].

=== Civil War and Francoist dictatorship ===
{{Main| Civil War| Revolution of 1936|Francoist }}

[[File:Reemplazo republicano.jpg|thumb|Republican volunteers at [[Teruel]], 1936]]
[[File:Meeting at Hendaye (en.wiki).jpg|thumb|right| leader [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] at the [[Meeting at Hendaye]], 1940]]

The  Civil War broke out in 1936: on 17 and 18 July, part of the military [[ coup of July 1936|carried out a coup d'état]] that triumphed in only part of the country. The situation led to a civil war, in which the territory was divided into two zones: one [[Republican faction ( Civil War)|under the authority of the Republican government]], that counted on outside support from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[]] (and from [[International response to the  Civil War#International Brigades|International Brigades]]), and the other controlled by the putschists (the [[Nationalist faction ( Civil War)|Nationalist or rebel faction]]), most critically supported by [[Nazi ]] and [[Fascist  (1922–1943)|Fascist ]]. The Republic was not supported by the Western powers due to the -led policy of [[non-intervention]]. General [[Francisco Franco]] was sworn in as the supreme leader of the rebels on 1 October 1936. An uneasy relationship between the Republican government and the grassroots anarchists who had initiated a partial [[ Revolution of 1936|social revolution]] also ensued.

The civil war was viciously fought and there were [[ Civil War#Atrocities|many atrocities committed by all sides]]. The [[ Civil War|war]] claimed the lives of over 500,000 people and caused the flight of up to a half-million citizens from the country. On 1 April 1939, five months before the beginning of [[World War II]], the rebel side led by Franco emerged victorious, imposing a dictatorship over the whole country. Thousands were imprisoned after the civil war in [[Francoist concentration camps]].

The regime remained nominally "[[neutrality (international relations)|neutral]]" for much of the Second World War, although it was [[ in World War II|sympathetic]] to [[Axis Powers|the Axis]] and provided the Nazi [[Wehrmacht]] with [[Blue Division| volunteers in the Eastern Front]]. The only legal party under Franco's dictatorship was the [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS]] (FET y de las JONS), formed in 1937 upon the merging of the Fascist [[Falange Española de las JONS]] and the Carlist traditionalists and to which the rest of right-wing groups supporting the rebels also added. The name of "[[Movimiento Nacional]]", sometimes understood as a wider structure than the FET y de las JONS proper, largely imposed over the later's name in official documents along the 1950s.

After the war  was politically and economically isolated, and was kept out of the United Nations. This changed in 1955, during the [[Cold War]] period, when it became strategically important for the US to establish a military presence on the Iberian Peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the Soviet Union into the Mediterranean basin. US Cold War strategic priorities included the dissemination of  educational ideas to foster modernisation and expansion. In the 1960s,  registered an [[ miracle|unprecedented rate of economic growth]] which was propelled by [[ miracle#Industrialization|industrialisation]], a mass internal migration from rural areas to [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and the creation of a mass tourism industry. Franco's rule was also characterised by [[Francoist #Fascism and authoritarianism|authoritarianism]], [[Francoist # nationalism|promotion of a unitary national identity]], [[National Catholicism]], and [[Language policies of Francoist |discriminatory language policies]].

=== Restoration of democracy ===
{{Main| transition to democracy| society after the democratic transition}}

[[File:De proclamatie en beëdiging van Prins Juan Carlos tot Koning van Spanje tijdens , Bestanddeelnr 254-9763.jpg|thumb|Juan Carlos I before the Cortes Españolas, during his proclamation as King on 22 November 1975]]

In 1962, a group of politicians involved in the opposition to Franco's regime inside the country and in exile met in the congress of the [[European Movement]] in Munich, where they made a resolution in favour of democracy. With Franco's death in November 1975, [[Juan Carlos I of |Juan Carlos]] succeeded to the position of [[King of ]] and [[head of state]] in accordance with the Francoist law. With the approval of the new [[ Constitution of 1978]] and the [[ transition to democracy|restoration of democracy]], the State [[devolution|devolved]] much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on [[autonomous communities of |autonomous communities]]. The [[ 1977 Amnesty Law]] let people of Franco's regime continue inside institutions without consequences, even perpetrators of some crimes during transition to democracy like the [[Massacre of 3 March 1976 in Vitoria]] or [[1977 Massacre of Atocha]].<!-- The 'founding chairman' of the current leading political party in , the [[People's Party ()|People's Party]], was [[Manuel Fraga Iribarne|Manuel Fraga]] who had been a minister in Franco's government and yet continued with his political career until shortly before his death in 2012.-->

In the Basque Country, moderate [[Basque nationalism]] coexisted with a [[Basque Conflict|radical nationalist movement]] led by the armed organisation [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] until the latter's dissolution in May 2018. The group was formed in 1959 during Franco's rule but had continued to wage its violent campaign even after the restoration of democracy and the return of a large measure of regional autonomy.

On 23 February 1981, rebel elements among the security forces seized the Cortes in an attempt to impose [[23-F|a military-backed government]]. King Juan Carlos took personal command of the military and successfully ordered the coup plotters, via national television, to surrender.

During the 1980s the democratic restoration made possible a growing open society. New cultural movements based on freedom appeared, like [[La Movida Madrileña]]. In May 1982  joined [[NATO]], followed by [[1986  NATO membership referendum|a referendum]] after a strong social opposition. That year the [[ Socialist Workers Party]] (PSOE) came to power, the first left-wing government in 43 years. In 1986  joined the [[European Economic Community]], which later became the [[European Union]]. The PSOE was replaced in government by the [[People's Party ()|Partido Popular]] (PP) in 1996 after scandals around participation of the government of [[Felipe González]] in the [[GAL (paramilitary group)|Dirty war against ETA]].

===Economic prosperity and crash===

On 1 January 2002,  fully adopted the [[euro]], and  experienced strong economic growth, well above the EU average during the early 2000s. However, well-publicised concerns issued by many economic commentators at the height of the boom warned that extraordinary property prices and a high foreign trade deficit were likely to lead to a painful economic collapse.

[[File:Madrid October15.jpg|thumb|left|Demonstration against the crisis and high youth unemployment in Madrid, 15 October 2011]]

In 2002, the [[Prestige oil spill]] occurred with big ecological consequences along 's Atlantic coastline. In 2003 [[José María Aznar]] supported US president [[George W. Bush]] in the [[ War]], and a strong movement against war rose in  society. In March 2004 a local [[Islamist]] terrorist group inspired by [[Al-Qaeda]] carried out the largest terrorist attack in Western European history when they killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800 others by [[2004 Madrid train bombings|bombing commuter trains]] in Madrid. Though initial suspicions focused on the Basque terrorist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], evidence of Islamist involvement soon emerged. Because of the proximity of the [[2004  general election]], the issue of responsibility quickly became a political controversy, with the main competing parties PP and PSOE exchanging accusations over the handling of the incident. The PSOE won the election, led by [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]].

In the early 2000s, the proportion of [[Immigration to #Currently|'s foreign born population]] increased rapidly during its economic boom but then declined due to the [[2008 financial crisis]]. In 2005, the  government legalised [[Same-sex marriage in |same sex marriage]], becoming the third country worldwide to do so. Decentralisation was supported with much resistance of Constitutional Court and conservative opposition, so did gender politics like quotas or the law against gender violence. Government talks with ETA happened, and the group announced its permanent cease of violence in 2010.

The bursting of the [[ property bubble]] in 2008 led to the [[2008–2014  financial crisis]]. High levels of unemployment, cuts in government spending and corruption in [[Royal family]] and [[People's Party ()|People's Party]] served as a backdrop to the [[2011–12  protests]]. [[Catalan independentism]] also rose. In 2011, [[Mariano Rajoy]]'s conservative [[People's Party ()|People's Party]] won the election with 44.6% of votes. As prime minister, he implemented austerity measures for EU bailout, the EU Stability and Growth Pact. On 19 June 2014, the monarch, Juan Carlos, abdicated in favour of his son, who became [[Felipe VI]].

===Constitutional issues===
[[File:01.10.2017 Referendum 1-OCT (4).jpg|thumb|right|Catalans casting their votes in [[Barcelona]] during the [[2017 Catalan independence referendum]]]] 

In October 2017 a [[2017 Catalan independence referendum|Catalan independence referendum]] was held and the [[Catalan parliament]] voted to unilaterally declare [[2017 Catalonia declaration of independence|independence from ]] to form a Catalan Republic on the day the [[Senate of | Senate]] was discussing approving direct rule over Catalonia as called for by the  Prime Minister. On the same day the Senate granted the power to impose direct rule and Rajoy dissolved the Catalan parliament and called a new election. No country recognised Catalonia as a separate state.

In June 2018, the [[Congress of Deputies]] passed a [[2018 vote of no confidence in the government of Mariano Rajoy|motion of no-confidence against Rajoy]] and replaced him with the PSOE leader [[Pedro Sánchez (politician)|Pedro Sánchez]]. In 2019, the first ever coalition government in  was formed, between PSOE and Unidas Podemos. Between 2018 and 2024,  faced an [[2018–2023  institutional crisis|institutional crisis]] surrounding the mandate of the [[General Council of the Judiciary]] (CGPJ), until finally the mandate got renovated. In January 2020, the [[COVID-19]] virus was confirmed to have [[COVID-19 pandemic in |spread to ]], causing life expectancy to drop by more than a year. The European Commission economic recovery package [[Next Generation EU]] was created to support the EU member states to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, and will be in use in the period 2021–2026. In March 2021,  became the sixth nation in the world to make [[Legality of euthanasia|active euthanasia legal]]. 

Following the [[2023  general election|general election on 23 July 2023]], Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez once again formed a coalition government, this time with [[Sumar (electoral platform)|Sumar]] (successors of [[Unidas Podemos]]).
In 2024, the first non-independentist Catalan regional president in over a decade, [[Salvador Illa]], was elected, normalising the constitutional and institutional relations between the national and the regional administrations. According to latest polls, only 17.3% of Catalans feel themselves as "only Catalan". 46% of Catalans would answer "as  as Catalan", while 21.8% "more Catalan than ". Accordind to a 2024 poll of University of Barcelona, over 50% of Catalans would vote against independence, while less than 40% would vote in favour.

{{Main|History of }}

=== Pre-colonial era ===
{{further|Bantu expansion}}
[[File:Tower, Great Zimbabwe1.jpg|thumb|upright|Towers of [[Great ]]]]
Archaeological records date archaic human settlement of present-day  to at least 500,000 years ago. 's earliest known inhabitants were most likely the [[San people]], who left behind a legacy of arrowheads and cave paintings. Approximately 2,000 years ago, the first Bantu-speaking farmers arrived during the Bantu expansion.

Societies speaking proto-[[Shona languages]] first emerged in the middle [[Limpopo River]] valley in the 9th century before moving on to the  highlands. The  plateau became the centre of subsequent Shona states, beginning around the 10th century. Around the early 10th century, trade developed with [[Shirazi era|Arab merchants]] on the  Ocean coast, helping to develop the [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]] in the 13th century. This was the precursor to the Shona civilisations that dominated the region from the 13th century, evidenced by ruins at [[Great ]], near [[Masvingo]], and by other smaller sites. The main archaeological site used a unique dry stone architecture. The Kingdom of Mapungubwe was the first in a series of trading states which had developed in  by the time the first European explorers arrived from . These states traded gold, ivory, and copper for cloth and glass.

By 1300, the [[Kingdom of ]] eclipsed Mapungubwe. This Shona state further refined and expanded upon Mapungubwe's stone architecture. From {{circa}} 1450 to 1760, the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]] ruled much of the area of present-day , plus parts of central . It is known by many names including the Mutapa Empire, also known as ''Mwene Mutapa'' or ''Monomotapa'' as well as "Munhumutapa", and was renowned for its strategic trade routes with the Arabs and . The  sought to monopolise this influence and began a series of wars which left the empire in near collapse in the early 17th century.

As a direct response to increased European presence in the interior a new Shona state emerged, known as the [[Rozvi Empire|Rozwi Empire]]. Relying on centuries of military, political and religious development, the Rozwi (meaning "destroyers") expelled the  from the  plateau in 1683. Around 1821 the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] general [[Mzilikazi]] of the [[Khumalo clan]] successfully rebelled against King [[Shaka]] and established his own clan, the [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]]. The Ndebele fought their way northwards into the [[ Republic|Transvaal]], leaving a trail of destruction in their wake and beginning an era of widespread devastation known as the [[Mfecane]]. When  [[Boers|trekboers]] converged on the Transvaal in 1836, they drove the tribe even further northward, with the assistance of [[Tswana people|Tswana]] [[Barolong]] warriors and [[Griqua people|Griqua]] commandos. By 1838 the Ndebele had conquered the Rozwi Empire, along with the other smaller Shona states, and reduced them to [[vassal]]dom.

[[File:Harris - Ndebelekraal.png|thumb|A Matabele [[kraal]], as depicted by [[William Cornwallis Harris]], 1836]]
After losing their remaining  lands in 1840, Mzilikazi and his tribe permanently settled in the southwest of present-day  in what became known as Matabeleland, establishing [[Bulawayo]] as their capital. Mzilikazi then organised his society into a military system with regimental [[kraal]]s, similar to those of Shaka, which was stable enough to repel further Boer incursions. Mzilikazi died in 1868; following a violent power struggle, his son [[Lobengula]] succeeded him.

===Colonial era and Rhodesia (1888–1964)===
{{Main|Company rule in Rhodesia|Southern Rhodesia|Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland}}
[[File:Hoisting the flag at Fort Salisbury.png|thumb|The [[Union Jack]] was raised over [[Harare|Fort Salisbury]] on 13 September 1890.]]
In the 1880s, European colonists arrived with [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[  Company]] (chartered in 1889). In 1888, Rhodes obtained a [[Rudd Concession|concession for mining rights]] from King [[Lobengula]] of the Ndebele peoples. He presented this concession to persuade the government of the  to grant a [[royal charter]] to the company over Matabeleland, and its subject states such as [[Mashonaland]] as well. Rhodes used this document in 1890 to justify sending the [[Pioneer Column]], a group of Europeans protected by well-armed [[  Police]] (BSAP) through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury (present-day [[Harare]]), and thereby establish [[Company rule in Rhodesia|company rule]] over the area. In 1893 and 1894, with the help of their new [[Maxim gun|Maxim]] guns, the BSAP would go on to defeat the Ndebele in the [[First Matabele War]]. Rhodes additionally sought permission to negotiate similar concessions covering all territory between the Limpopo River and [[Lake Tanganyika]], then known as "Zambesia". In accordance with the terms of aforementioned concessions and treaties, mass settlement was encouraged, with the  maintaining control over labour as well as over precious metals and other mineral resources.

[[File:Battle of the Shangani.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of the Shangani]] on 25 October 1893]]

In 1895, the BSAC adopted the name [[Rhodesia (region)|"Rhodesia"]] for the territory, in honour of Rhodes. In 1898, "Southern Rhodesia" became the official name for the region south of the [[Zambezi]] river, which later adopted the name "". The region to the north, administered separately, was later termed [[Northern Rhodesia]] (present-day ). Shortly after the disastrous Rhodes-sponsored [[Jameson Raid]] on the [[ Republic]], the Ndebele rebelled against white rule, led by their charismatic religious leader, Mlimo. The [[Second Matabele War]] of 1896–1897 lasted in Matabeleland until 1896, when Mlimo was assassinated by  scout [[Frederick Russell Burnham]]. Shona agitators staged unsuccessful revolts (known as ''[[Chimurenga]]'') against company rule during 1896 and 1897.{{citation needed|date= September 2015}} Following these failed insurrections, the Rhodes administration subdued the Ndebele and Shona groups and organised the land with a disproportionate bias favouring Europeans, thus displacing many indigenous peoples.
[[File:Rhodesia & Nyasaland £5 1957 Obverse.png|thumb|[[Elizabeth II|The Queen]]'s portrait featured on Rhodesian banknotes and coins]]
The  annexed Southern Rhodesia on 12 September 1923. Shortly after annexation, on 1 October 1923, the first constitution for the new Colony of Southern Rhodesia came into force. Under the new constitution, Southern Rhodesia became a [[self-governing colony|self-governing]] [[ Empire| colony]], subsequent to a [[1922 Southern Rhodesian government referendum|1922 referendum]]. Rhodesians of all races served on behalf of the  during the two World Wars in the early-20th century. Proportional to the white population, Southern Rhodesia contributed more ''per capita'' to both the [[Southern Rhodesia in World War I|First]] and [[Southern Rhodesia in World War II|Second World Wars]] than any other part of the empire, including Britain.

The [[Land Apportionment Act of 1930|1930 Land Apportionment Act]] restricted black land ownership to certain segments of the country, setting aside large areas solely for the purchase of the white minority. This act, which led to rapidly rising inequality, became the subject of frequent calls for subsequent land reform. In 1953, in the face of African opposition, Britain consolidated the two Rhodesias with [[Nyasaland]] () in the ill-fated [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland| Federation]], which Southern Rhodesia essentially dominated. Growing [[African nationalism]] and general dissent, particularly in Nyasaland, persuaded Britain to dissolve the union in 1963, forming three separate divisions. While [[multiracial democracy]] was finally introduced to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Southern Rhodesians of European ancestry continued to enjoy [[Minoritarianism|minority rule]].
[[File: Decolonisation in Africa.png|thumb|left|[[ Empire|]] [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonisation]] in Africa.]]
Following [[ Independence Act 1964| independence]] (effective from October 1964), [[Ian Smith]]'s [[Rhodesian Front]] government in Salisbury dropped the designation "Southern" in 1964 (once ''Northern Rhodesia'' had changed its name to '''', having the word ''Southern'' before the name ''Rhodesia'' became unnecessary and the country simply became known as ''Rhodesia'' afterwards). Intent on effectively repudiating the recently adopted  policy of "[[no independence before majority rule]]", Smith issued a [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] (UDI) from the  on 11 November 1965. This marked the first such course taken by a rebel  colony since the [[ Declaration of Independence| declaration]] of 1776, which Smith and others indeed claimed provided a suitable precedent to their own actions.

===Declaration of independence and civil war (1965–1980)===
{{Main|Rhodesia|Rhodesian Bush War| Rhodesia|Lancaster House Agreement}}

[[File:Udi2-rho.jpg|thumb|[[Ian Smith]] signing the [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] on 11 November 1965 with his cabinet in audience]]
The  deemed the Rhodesian declaration an act of rebellion but did not re-establish control by force. The  government petitioned the United Nations for [[economic sanctions|sanctions]] against Rhodesia pending unsuccessful talks with Smith's administration in 1966 and 1968. In December 1966, the organisation complied, imposing the first mandatory trade embargo on an autonomous state. These sanctions were expanded again in 1968.

A civil war ensued when [[Joshua Nkomo]]'s [[ African People's Union]] (ZAPU) and Robert Mugabe's [[ African National Union]] (ZANU), supported actively by communist powers and neighbouring African nations, initiated [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla operations]] against Rhodesia's predominantly white government. ZAPU was supported by the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Warsaw Pact]] and associated nations such as , and adopted a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] ideology; ZANU meanwhile aligned itself with [[Maoism]] and the bloc headed by the People's Republic of . Smith declared Rhodesia a republic in 1970, following the results of a [[1969 Rhodesian constitutional referendum|referendum the previous year]], but this went unrecognised internationally. Meanwhile, Rhodesia's internal conflict intensified, eventually forcing him to open negotiations with the militant communists.

[[File:Lancaster-House-Agreement.png|thumb|right|Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]] signs the Lancaster House Agreement seated next to [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs| Foreign Secretary]] [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]].]]
In March 1978, Smith reached an accord with three African leaders, led by Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]], who offered to leave the white population comfortably entrenched in exchange for the establishment of a biracial democracy. As a result of the [[Internal Settlement]], [[1979 Rhodesian general election|elections were held in April 1979]], concluding with the [[United African National Council]] (UANC) carrying a majority of parliamentary seats. On 1 June 1979, Muzorewa, the UANC head, became prime minister and the country's name was changed to  Rhodesia. The Internal Settlement left control of the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]], civil service, judiciary, and a third of parliament seats to whites. On 12 June, the [[ Senate]] voted to lift economic pressure on the former Rhodesia.

Following the [[1979 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|fifth Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]], held in [[Lusaka]], , from 1 to 7 August in 1979, the  government invited Muzorewa, Mugabe, and Nkomo to participate in a constitutional conference at [[Lancaster House]]. The purpose of the conference was to discuss and reach an agreement on the terms of an independence constitution, and provide for elections supervised under  authority allowing  Rhodesia to proceed to legal independence. With Lord Carrington, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the , in the chair, these discussions were mounted from 10 September to 15 December in 1979, producing a total of 47 [[plenary session]]s. On 21 December 1979, delegations from every major interest represented reached the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], effectively ending the guerrilla war. Under the terms of the agreement, the country would temporarily revert to  rule until an election could be conducted, after which it would be granted independence under black majority rule.

On 11 December 1979, the Rhodesian House of Assembly voted 90 to nil to revert to  colonial status. With the arrival of [[Christopher Soames]], the new governor on 12 December 1979, Britain formally took control of  Rhodesia as the Colony of Southern Rhodesia. Britain lifted sanctions on 12 December and the United Nations on 16 December. During the [[1980 Southern Rhodesian general election]], Mugabe and the ZANU party secured a landslide victory. On 11 April 1980, Southern Rhodesia became the independent nation of . [[Charles III|Prince Charles]], as the representative of Britain, formally granted independence to  in a ceremony.

[[President of |'s first president]] after its independence was [[Canaan Banana]] in what was originally a mainly ceremonial role as [[head of state]]. Mugabe was the country's first prime minister and head of government. In 1980, [[Samora Machel]] told Mugabe that  was the "Jewel of Africa" but added: "Don't tarnish it!".

New names for 32 places were gazetted on 18 April 1982 and by February 1984, there had been 42 changes, which included three rivers (Umniati/[[Munyati River|Munyati]]; Lundi/[[Runde River|Runde]]; Nuanetsi/[[Mwenezi River|Mwenezi]]), and several changes from colonial names (such as Salisbury/Harare; Enkeldoorn/[[Chivhu]]; Essexvale/[[Esigodini]]; Fort Victoria/[[Masvingo]])

Opposition to what was perceived as a Shona takeover immediately erupted around Matabeleland. The Matabele unrest led to what has become known as ''[[Gukurahundi]]'' (Shona: 'the early rain which washes away the [[chaff]] before the spring rains'). The [[5th Brigade ()|Fifth Brigade]], a North -trained elite unit that reported directly to Mugabe, entered Matabeleland and massacred thousands of civilians accused of supporting "dissidents". Estimates for the number of deaths during the five-year ''Gukurahundi'' campaign ranged from 3,750 to 80,000. Thousands of others were tortured in military internment camps. The campaign officially ended in 1987 after Nkomo and Mugabe reached a unity agreement that merged their respective parties, creating the  African National Union – Patriotic Front ([[ZANU–PF]]). [[1990  general election|Elections in March 1990]] resulted in another victory for Mugabe and the ZANU–PF party, which claimed 117 of the 120 contested seats.

During the 1990s, students, trade unionists, and other workers often demonstrated to express their growing discontent with Mugabe and ZANU–PF party policies. In 1996, civil servants, nurses, and junior doctors went on strike over salary issues. The general health of the population also began to significantly decline; by 1997 an estimated 25% of the population had been infected by HIV in a pandemic that was affecting most of southern Africa. Land redistribution re-emerged as the main issue for the ZANU–PF government around 1997. Despite the existence of a "willing-buyer-willing-seller" land reform programme since the 1980s, the minority white  population continued to hold the majority of the country's most fertile agricultural land.

In 2000, the government pressed ahead with its [[Land reform in #Fast-track land reform and violence|Fast Track Land Reform]] programme, a policy involving compulsory land acquisition aimed at redistributing land from the minority white population to the majority black population. Confiscations of white farmland, continuous droughts, and a serious drop in external finance and other support led to a sharp decline in agricultural exports, which were traditionally the country's leading export-producing sector. Some 58,000 independent black farmers have since experienced limited success in reviving the gutted cash crop sectors through efforts on a smaller scale.

President Mugabe and the ZANU–PF party leadership found themselves beset by a wide range of international sanctions. In 2002, the nation was suspended from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] due to the reckless farm seizures and blatant [[Electoral fraud|election tampering]]. The following year,  officials voluntarily terminated its Commonwealth membership. In 2001, the  enacted the [[ Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001| Democracy and Economic Recovery Act]] (ZDERA). It came into effect in 2002 and froze credit to the  government.

By 2003, the country's economy had collapsed. It is estimated that up to a quarter of 's 11 million people had fled the country. Three-quarters of the remaining  were living on less than one U.S. dollar a day. Following [[ parliamentary election, 2005|elections in 2005]], the government initiated "[[Operation Murambatsvina]]", an effort to crack down on illegal markets and slums emerging in towns and cities, leaving a substantial section of urban poor homeless. The  government has described the operation as an attempt to provide decent housing to the population, although according to critics such as [[Amnesty International]], authorities have yet to properly substantiate their claims.

[[File:Food insecurity in .svg|thumb|Map showing the food insecurity in  in June 2008]]

On 29 March 2008,  held a [[ presidential election, 2008|presidential election]] along with a [[ parliamentary election, 2008|parliamentary election]]. The results of this election were withheld for two weeks, after which it was generally acknowledged that the [[Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai]] (MDC-T) had achieved a majority of one seat in the lower house of parliament. In September 2008, a [[2008–2009  political negotiations|power-sharing agreement]] was reached between [[Morgan Tsvangirai]] and President Mugabe, permitting the former to hold the office of prime minister. Due to ministerial differences between their respective political parties, the agreement was not fully implemented until 13 February 2009. By December 2010, Mugabe was threatening to completely expropriate remaining privately owned companies in  unless "western sanctions" were lifted.
[[File:Mugabe - Flickr - Al Jazeera .jpg|thumb| President [[Robert Mugabe]] attending the Independence Day celebrations in  in July 2011.]]
In late 2008, problems in  reached crisis proportions in the areas of living standards, public health (with a major [[ cholera outbreak|cholera outbreak]] in December) and various basic affairs. During this period, NGOs took over from government as a primary provider of food during this period of food insecurity in . A 2011 survey by [[Freedom House]] suggested that living conditions had improved since the power-sharing agreement. The United Nations [[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] stated in its 2012–2013 planning document that the "humanitarian situation has improved in  since 2009, but conditions remain precarious for many people".

A new constitution approved in the [[ constitutional referendum, 2013]] curtails presidential powers. Mugabe was re-elected president in the July 2013 [[2013  general election| general election]] which ''[[The Economist]]'' described as "rigged" and the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' as "stolen". The Movement for Democratic Change alleged massive fraud and tried to seek relief through the courts. In a surprising moment of candour at the ZANU–PF congress in December 2014, President Robert Mugabe accidentally let slip that the opposition had in fact won the contentious 2008 polls by an astounding 73%. After winning the election, the Mugabe ZANU–PF government re-instituted [[one party rule]], doubled the civil service and, according to ''The Economist'', embarked on "misrule and dazzling corruption". A 2017 study conducted by the [[Institute for Security Studies]] (ISS) concluded that due to the deterioration of government and the economy "the government encourages corruption to make up for its inability to fund its own institutions" with widespread and informal police roadblocks to issue fines to travellers being one manifestation of this.

In July 2016, [[2016  protests|nationwide protests]] took place regarding the economic collapse in the country. In November 2017, [[2017  coup d'état|the army led a coup d'état]] following the dismissal of Vice-president [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]], placing Mugabe under house arrest. The army denied that their actions constituted a [[coup]].  On 19 November 2017, ZANU–PF sacked Robert Mugabe as party leader and appointed former Vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa in his place. On 21 November 2017, Mugabe tendered his resignation prior to impeachment proceedings being completed. Although under the [[Constitution of ]] Mugabe should be succeeded by Vice-president [[Phelekezela Mphoko]], a supporter of [[Grace Mugabe]], ZANU–PF [[Chief Whip|chief whip]] Lovemore Matuke stated to the [[Reuters]] news agency that Mnangagwa would be appointed as president.

On 30 July 2018,  held its [[2018  general election|general elections]], which were won by the ZANU-PF party led by Mnangagwa. [[Nelson Chamisa]] who was leading the main opposition party [[MDC Alliance]] contested the election results claiming voter fraud, and subsequently filed a petition to the Constitution Court of . The court confirmed Mnangagwa's victory, making him the newly elected president after Mugabe.

In December 2017, the website  News, calculating the cost of the Mugabe era using various statistics, said that at the time of independence in 1980, the country was growing economically at about five per cent a year, and had done so for quite a long time. If this rate of growth had been maintained for the next 37 years,  would have, in 2016, a GDP of US$52 billion. Instead it had a formal sector GDP of only US$14 billion, a cost of US$38 billion in lost growth. The population growth in 1980 was among the highest in Africa at about 3.5 per cent per annum, doubling every 21 years. Had this growth been maintained, the population would have been 31 million. Instead, as of 2018, it is about 13 million. The discrepancies were believed to be partly caused by death from starvation and disease, and partly due to decreased fertility. The life expectancy has halved, and deaths from politically motivated violence sponsored by the government exceed 200,000 since 1980. The Mugabe government has directly or indirectly caused the deaths of at least three million  in 37 years. According to the [[World Food Programme]], over two million people are facing starvation because of the recent droughts the country is going through.

In 2018, President Mnangagwa announced that his government would seek to rejoin [[the Commonwealth]], which is as of 2023 conducting a fact-finding mission prior to asking the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] to issue a recommendation.

In August 2023, President Emmerson Mnangagwa won a second  term in an outcome of the [[2023  general election|election]] rejected by the opposition and questioned by observers. In September 2023,  signed control over almost 20% of the country's land to the [[carbon credit|carbon offset]] company [[Blue Carbon (company)|Blue Carbon]].

=== Early history ===
The area now called  has been inhabited by [[Austronesian peoples]] speaking the same [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic language]], from north to south, including the southernmost [[Nui (atoll)|Nui]], since sometime between 3000&nbsp;BC and 1300&nbsp;AD.{{sfn|Thomas|2003|p=5}} The area was not completely isolated; later, voyagers from [[]], [[]], and [[]] introduced some [[Polynesia]]n and [[Melanesia]]n cultural aspects, respectively. Intermarriage and intense navigation between the islands tended to blur cultural differences and resulted in a significant degree of cultural homogenization. Local oral historians chiefly in the form of lore keepers suggest that the area was first inhabited by a group of seafaring people from [[Melanesia]], who were described as being dark-skinned, frizzy-haired, and short in stature. These [[indigenous peoples]] were then visited by early [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] seafarers from the west, a place called Matang, orally described as being tall and fair-skinned. 
[[Image:Makin Islander.jpg|thumb|Portrait of a native of the [[Makin (islands)|Makin]] Islands, drawn by [[Alfred Thomas Agate]] (1841)]]

Around AD 1300, a mass departure occurred from [[]] leading to the addition of Polynesian ancestry into the mix of most Gilbertese people. These  later brought strong features of [[Polynesian languages]] and culture, creating clans based on their own  traditions and slowly intertwining with the indigenous clans and powers already dominant in . 

Around the 15th century, starkly contrasting systems of governance arose between the northern islands, primarily under chiefly rule (''uea''), and the central and southern islands, primarily under the rule of their council of elders (''unimwaane''). [[Tabiteuea]] could be an exception as the sole island that is known as maintaining a traditional [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] society.  

The name Tabiteuea stems from the root phrase ''Tabu-te-Uea'', meaning "chiefs are forbidden". Civil war soon became a factor, with acquisition of land being the main form of conquest. Clans and chiefs began fighting over resources, stimulated by hatred and reignited blood feuds, which had their origins months, years, or even decades before.
The turmoil lasted well into the European visitation and colonial era, which led to certain islands decimating their foes with the help of guns and cannon-equipped ships that Europeans provided to some I- leaders. 

The typical military arms of the I- at this time were shark tooth-embedded wooden spears, knives, and swords, and garbs of armour fashioned from dense coconut fibre. They chiefly used these instead of the gunpowder and weapons of steel available at the time, because of the strong sentimental value of the equipment handed down through generations. Ranged weapons, such as bows, slings, and javelins, were seldom used; [[Culture of # traditional martial arts|hand-to-hand combat]] was a prominent skill still practised today, though seldom mentioned because of various taboos associated with it, secrecy being the primary one. [[Abemama]]'s High Chief [[Tembinok']] was the last of the dozens of expansionist chiefs of Gilbert Islands of this period, despite Abemama historically conforming to the traditional southern islands' governance of their respective ''unimwaane''. He was immortalised in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s book ''In the South Seas'', which delved into the high chief's character and method of rule during Stevenson's stay in Abemama. The 90th anniversary of his arrival in the Gilbert Islands was chosen to celebrate the independence of  on 12 July 1979.

===Colonial era===
{{Main| Western Pacific Territories|Gilbert and Ellice Islands}}

Chance visits by European ships occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries, while those ships attempted circumnavigations of the world, or sought sailing routes from the south to north Pacific Ocean, a passing trade, whaling the On-The-Line grounds, and labour ships associated with the coercive labour recruitment practices, known as [[blackbirding]]. This recruitment of [[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|Kanaka]] workers in large numbers during the 19th century, had social, economic, political, religious and cultural consequences. More than 9,000 workers were sent abroad from 1845 to 1895, most of them not returning.

The passing trade gave rise to European, , , , and other residents from the 1830s; they included [[beachcombing|beachcombers]], castaways, traders, and missionaries. Dr [[Hiram Bingham II]] of the [[ Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] (ABCFM) arrived on [[Abaiang]] in 1857. The Roman Catholic faith was introduced on [[Nonouti]] around 1880 by 2 Gilbert islanders, Betero and Tiroi, who had become Christians in Tahiti. Father Joseph Leray, Father Edward Bontemps and Brother Conrad Weber, Roman Catholic [[Missionaries of the Sacred Heart]] arrived on Nonouti in 1888. The Protestant missionaries of the [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS) were also active in the southern Gilberts. On 15 October 1870, Rev. Samuel James Whitmee of the LMS arrived at [[Arorae]], and later that month he visited [[Tamana, |Tamana]], [[Onotoa]] and [[Beru (atoll)|Beru]]. In August 1872, [[George Pratt (missionary)|George Pratt]] of the LMS visited the islands.
[[File:Declaration of a protectorate on Abemama by Captain Davis, 27th May 1892.JPG|thumb| Declaration of a protectorate on [[Abemama]] by Captain [[Edward H.M. Davis|EHM Davis]], 27 May 1892]]

In 1886, an [[Anglo- Declarations about the Western Pacific Ocean|Anglo- agreement]] partitioned the "unclaimed" central Pacific, leaving [[]] in the  sphere of influence, while [[Banaba]] (known to Europeans as Ocean Island) and the future GEIC wound up in the [[ Empire| sphere of influence]]. In 1892, local Gilbertese authorities (an ''uea'', a chief from the Northern Gilbert Group, and ''atun te boti'' or head of clan) on each of the Gilbert Islands agreed to Captain [[Edward H.M. Davis|Edward Davis]] commanding [[HMS Royalist (1883)|HMS ''Royalist'']] of the [[Royal Navy]] declaring them part of a [[ protectorate]], along with the nearby [[Ellice Islands]]. They were administered by a [[Governor of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands|resident commissioner]] based first on [[Butaritari|Makin Islands]] (1893–95), then in [[Betio]], [[Tarawa]] (1896–1908) and Banaba (1908–1942), protectorate who was under the [[High Commissioner for the Western Pacific|Western Pacific High Commission]] (WPHC) based in . Banaba was added to the protectorate in 1900, because of the [[Phosphorite|phosphate rock]] of its soil (discovered in 1900). [[Phosphate mining in Banaba and |This discovery and the mining]] provided a significant amount of revenue, in the form of taxes and duties, to the WPHC.

The conduct of [[William Telfer Campbell]], the second resident commissioner of the Gilberts and Ellice Islands of 1896 to 1908, was criticised as to his legislative, judicial and administrative management (including allegations of forced labour exacted from islanders) and became the subject of the 1909 report by [[Arthur William Mahaffy|Arthur Mahaffy]]. In 1913, an anonymous correspondent to ''[[The New Age]]'' newspaper described the maladministration of W. Telfer Campbell and challenged the impartiality of Arthur Mahaffy, because he was a former colonial official in the Gilberts. The anonymous correspondent also criticised the operations of the [[Pacific Phosphate Company]] on Banaba.

The islands became the [[crown colony]] of the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] in 1916. The Northern Line Islands, including Christmas Island ([[Kiritimati]]), were added to the colony in 1919, and the [[Phoenix Islands]] were added in 1937 with the purpose of a [[Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme]]. On 12 July 1940, [[Pan Am]] Airways' ''[[Boeing 314 Clipper| Clipper]]'' landed at [[Kanton Island|Canton Island]] for the first time during a flight from [[Honolulu]] to [[Auckland]]. Sir [[Arthur Grimble]] was a cadet administrative officer based at Tarawa (1913–1919) and became Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony in 1926.{{sfn|Grimble|1952}}

[[File:Stamp Gilbert Ellice Islands 1939 3p.jpg|thumb|Stamp with portrait of [[George VI|King George VI]], 1939]]
In 1902, the [[Pacific Cable Station|Pacific Cable Board]] laid the first trans-Pacific telegraph cable from [[Bamfield]],  Columbia, to [[Fanning Island]] (Tabuaeran) in the Line Islands, and from  to Fanning Island, thus completing the [[All Red Line]], a series of telegraph lines circumnavigating the globe completely within the  Empire. The location of Fanning Island, one of the closest formations to Hawaii, led to its annexation by the  Empire in 1888. Nearby candidates including [[Palmyra Island]] were not favoured due to the lack of adequate landing sites.

The  eventually incorporated the Northern Line Islands into its territories, and did the same with the [[Phoenix Islands]], which lie between Gilberts and the Line Islands, including [[Howland Island|Howland]], [[Jarvis Island|Jarvis]], and [[Baker Island|Baker]] islands, thus causing a territorial dispute. That was eventually resolved and they finally became part of  under the [[Treaty of Tarawa]].
[[File:Tarawa.jpg|thumb|right| Marines assault a  bunker during the [[Battle of Tarawa]], November 1943]]

After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], during [[World War II]], [[Butaritari]] and Tarawa, and others of the Northern Gilbert group, were [[ occupation of the Gilbert Islands|occupied by ]] from 1941 to 1943. [[Betio]] became an airfield and supply base. The expulsion of the  forces in late 1943 involved one of the bloodiest battles in [[US Marine Corps]] history. Marines landed in November 1943 and the [[Battle of Tarawa]] ensued. As the headquarters of the colony, Banaba was bombed, evacuated and occupied by  in 1942 and not freed until 1945, after the massacre of all but one of the Gilbertese on the island by the  forces. [[Funafuti]] then hosted the provisional headquarters of the colony from 1942 to 1946, when Tarawa returned to host the headquarters.

At the end of 1945, most of the remaining inhabitants of Banaba, repatriated from [[Kosrae]], [[]] and Tarawa, were relocated to [[Rabi Island]], an island of  that the  government had acquired in 1942 for this purpose.

On 1 January 1953, the [[List of resident commissioners and governors of the | Western Pacific High Commissioner]] of the colony was transferred from  to the new capital of [[Honiara]], to the [[ ]], with the Gilberts' Resident Commissioner still located in Tarawa.

Further military operations in the colony occurred in the late 1950s and early 1960s when [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] was used by the  and  for [[nuclear weapons testing]] including [[thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bombs]].

Institutions of internal self-rule were established on Tarawa from about 1967. The Ellice Islands requested their separation from the rest of the colony in 1974 and were granted their own internal self-rule institutions. The separation entered into force on 1 January 1976. In 1978, the Ellice Islands became the independent state of [[]].

===Independence===
[[File:KiribatiPresidential Residence.jpg|thumb|The Presidential residence, former [[Government House]], [[Bairiki]]]]
The Gilbert Islands gained independence as the Republic of  on 12 July 1979. Then, in September, the  relinquished all claims to the sparsely inhabited [[Phoenix Islands|Phoenix]] and Line Islands, in a 1979 treaty of friendship with  ([[Treaty of Tarawa|ratified in 1983]]). Although the indigenous [[Gilbertese language|Gilbertese]] name for the Gilbert Islands proper is "Tungaru", the new state chose the name "", the Gilbertese spelling of "Gilberts", because it was more modern and as an equivalent of the former colony to acknowledge the inclusion of Banaba, the Line Islands, and the [[Phoenix Islands]]. The last two archipelagoes were never initially occupied by Gilbertese until the  authorities, and later the republic's government, resettled Gilbertese there under resettlement schemes. In 1982, the first [[1982  parliamentary election|elections since independence]] were held. A no-confidence vote provoked another [[1983  parliamentary election|election in 1983]]. In the post-independence period, [[overcrowding]] has been an issue, at least in  and aid organisations' eyes. In 1988, an announcement was made that 4,700 residents of the main island group would be resettled onto less populated islands. In September 1994, [[Teburoro Tito]] from the opposition was elected president.

In 1995,  unilaterally moved the [[International Date Line]] far to the east to encompass the Line Islands group, so that the country would no longer be divided by the date line. The move, which fulfilled one of President Tito's campaign promises, was intended to allow businesses across the expansive territory to keep the same business week. This also enabled  to become the first country to see the dawn of the [[third millennium]], an event of significance for tourism. Tito was re-elected in 1998. In 1999,  became a full member of the United Nations, 20 years after independence. In 2002,  passed a controversial law that enabled the government to shut down newspaper publishers. The legislation followed the launching of 's first successful non-government-run newspaper. President Tito was re-elected in 2003 but was removed from office in March 2003 by a no-confidence vote and replaced by a Council of State. [[Anote Tong]] of the opposition party [[Boutokaan Te Koaua]] was elected to succeed Tito in July 2003. He was re-elected in 2007 and in 2011.

In June 2008,  officials asked  and  to accept  citizens as permanent refugees.  is expected to be the first country to lose all its land territory to [[climate change]]. In June 2008,  President Anote Tong said that the country had reached "the point of no return." He added, "To plan for the day when you no longer have a country is indeed painful but I think we have to do that."

In January 2012, Anote Tong was re-elected for a third and last successive term. In early 2012, the government of  acquired the 2,200-hectare Natoavatu Estate on the second largest island of , [[Vanua Levu]]. At the time it was widely reported that the government planned to evacuate the entire population of  to . In April 2013, President Tong began urging citizens to evacuate the islands and migrate elsewhere. In May 2014, the Office of the President confirmed the purchase of some 5,460 acres of land on Vanua Levu at a cost of 9.3&nbsp;million  dollars.

In March 2016, [[Taneti Maamau]] was [[2016  presidential election|elected]] and took office as the fifth President of . In June 2020, President Maamau won [[2020  presidential election|re-election]] for a second four-year term. President Maamau was considered pro- and he supported closer ties with Beijing. On 16 November 2021, the  government announced it would open the world's largest marine protected area to commercial fishing. The [[2022  constitutional crisis]] started with the suspension of all five major justices of the [[judiciary of ]].

In 2020, [[COVID-19 pandemic in |'s response to the COVID-19 pandemic]], consistent with most of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Oceania|COVID-19 responses of Oceania island nations]], was to impose strict limits on tourism and commercial travel.  reported that it remained essentially COVID-free (two cases) until January 2022 when the first commercial international flight in two years included 36 passengers who tested positive. In 2024, 5,085 Coronavirus Cases were reported which caused 24 deaths, while 2,703 were reported to have recovered.

On 29 January 2023,  confirmed its intention to rejoin the [[Pacific Islands Forum]], ending a bitter two-year leadership split.

Approximately 10,000 years ago, [[desertification]] forced [[hunter-gatherer]] societies south into the Sahel regions of northern Central Africa, where some groups settled. Farming began as part of the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. Initial farming of [[Dioscorea rotundata|white yam]] progressed into [[millet]] and [[sorghum]], and before 3000{{Nbsp}}BCE the domestication of [[Elaeis guineensis|African oil palm]] improved the groups' nutrition and allowed for expansion of the local populations. This agricultural revolution, combined with a "Fish-stew Revolution", in which fishing began to take place and the use of boats, allowed for the transportation of goods. Products were often moved in [[ceramic]] pots.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

The [[Bouar|Bouar Megaliths]] in the western region of the country indicate an advanced level of habitation dating back to the very late [[Neolithic|Neolithic Era]] ({{Circa|3500–2700 BCE}}). [[Ferrous metallurgy|Ironwork]] developed in the region around 1000{{Nbsp}}BCE.

The [[Ubangian languages|Ubangian people]] settled along the [[Ubangi River]] in what is today the Central and East  while some [[Bantu peoples|Bantu people]] migrated from the southwest of [[]].

[[Banana]]s arrived in the region during the first millennium BCE and added an important source of carbohydrates to the diet; they were also used in the production of [[alcoholic beverages]]. Production of [[copper]], [[salt]], [[dried fish]], and [[textiles]] dominated the economic trade in the  region.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, [[History of slavery|slave trade]]rs began to raid the region as part of the expansion of the Saharan and Nile River slave routes. Their captives were enslaved and shipped to the Mediterranean coast, Europe, Arabia, the Western Hemisphere, or to the slave ports and factories along the West and North Africa or South along the Ubangui and  rivers. During the 18th century Bandia-Nzakara [[Azande]] peoples established the [[Bangassou]] Kingdom along the [[Ubangi River]]. In the mid 19th century, the [[Bangi language|Bobangi people]] became major slave traders and sold their captives to the Americas using the Ubangi river to reach the coast.

Modeled on [[Leopold II of |King Leopold]]'s [[ Free State]], concessions were doled out to private companies that endeavored to strip the region's assets as quickly and cheaply as possible before depositing a percentage of their profits into the  treasury. The concessionary companies [[corvée|forced local people]] to harvest rubber, coffee, and other commodities without pay and held their families hostage until they met their quotas.

In 1920, [[ Equatorial Africa]] was established and Ubangi-Shari was administered from [[Brazzaville]]. During the 1920s and 1930s the  introduced a policy of mandatory cotton cultivation, a network of roads were built, attempts were made to combat [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], and [[Protestant]] [[Mission (Christianity)|missions]] were established to spread Christianity. New forms of forced labour were also introduced and a large number of Ubangians were sent to work on the [[-Ocean Railway]]. Through the period of construction until 1934 there was a continual heavy cost in human lives, with total deaths among all workers along the railway estimated in excess of 17,000 of the construction workers, from a combination of both industrial accidents and diseases including [[malaria]]. In 1928, a major insurrection, the [[Kongo-Wara rebellion]] or 'war of the hoe handle', broke out in Western Ubangi-Shari and continued for several years. The extent of this insurrection, which was perhaps the largest anti-colonial rebellion in Africa during the interwar years, was carefully hidden from the  public because it provided evidence of strong opposition to  colonial rule and forced labour.
 colonization in Oubangui-Chari is considered to be the most brutal of the  colonial Empire.

In September 1940, during the [[Second World War]], [[Charles de Gaulle|pro-Gaullist]]  officers took control of Ubangi-Shari and [[General Leclerc]] established his headquarters for the [[Free  Forces]] in [[Bangui]]. In 1946 [[Barthélemy Boganda]] was elected with 9,000 votes to the [[ National Assembly]], becoming the first representative of the  in the  government. Boganda maintained a political stance against racism and the colonial regime but gradually became disheartened with the  political system and returned to the  to establish the [[Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa]] (''Mouvement pour l'évolution sociale de l'Afrique noire'', MESAN) in 1950.

=== Since independence (1960–present) ===
In the [[1957 Ubangi-Shari parliamentary election|Ubangi-Shari Territorial Assembly election]] in 1957, MESAN captured 347,000 out of the total 356,000 votes and won every legislative seat, which led to Boganda being elected president of the Grand Council of [[ Equatorial Africa]] and vice-president of the Ubangi-Shari Government Council. Within a year, he declared the establishment of the  and served as the country's first prime minister. MESAN continued to exist, but its role was limited. The  was granted autonomy within the  Community on 1 December 1958, a status which meant it was still counted as part of the  Empire in Africa.

After Boganda's death in a [[Barthélemy Boganda#Plane crash|plane crash]] on 29 March 1959, his cousin, [[David Dacko]], took control of MESAN. Dacko became the country's first president when the  formally received [[independence]] from  at midnight on 13 August 1960, a date celebrated by the country's [[List of national independence days|Independence Day]] holiday. Dacko threw out his political rivals, including [[Abel Goumba]], former Prime Minister and leader of [[Democratic Evolution Movement of Central Africa|Mouvement d'évolution démocratique de l'Afrique centrale]] (MEDAC), whom he forced into exile in . With all opposition parties suppressed by November 1962, Dacko declared MESAN as the official party of the state.

====Bokassa and the  Empire (1965–1979)====
{{Further| Empire}}
[[File:Bokassa with Ceausescu (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], self-crowned [[Emperor of Central Africa]]]]
On 31 December 1965, Dacko was overthrown in the [[-Sylvestre coup d'état]] by Colonel [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], who suspended the constitution and dissolved the National Assembly. President Bokassa declared himself President for Life in 1972 and named himself Emperor Bokassa I of the [[ Empire]] (as the country was renamed) on 4 December 1976. A year later, Emperor Bokassa [[Coronation of Bokassa I and Catherine|crowned himself in an expensive ceremony]].

In April 1979, young students protested against Bokassa's decree that all school pupils were required to buy uniforms from a company owned by one of his wives. The government violently suppressed the protests, killing 100 children and teenagers. Bokassa might have been personally involved in some of the killings. In September 1979, [[Operation Caban| overthrew Bokassa]] and restored Dacko to power (subsequently restoring the official name of the country and the original government to the ). Dacko, in turn, was again overthrown in a [[1981  coup d'état|coup]] by General [[André Kolingba]] on 1 September 1981.

====  under Kolingba ====
Kolingba suspended the constitution and ruled with a [[military junta]] until 1985. He introduced a new constitution in 1986 which was adopted by a nationwide referendum. Membership in his new party, the [[Rassemblement Démocratique Centrafricain]] (RDC), was voluntary. In 1987 and 1988, semi-free elections to parliament were held, but Kolingba's two major political opponents, [[Abel Goumba]] and [[Ange-Félix Patassé]], were not allowed to participate.

By 1990, inspired by the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], a pro-democracy movement arose. Pressure from the , , and from a group of locally represented countries and agencies called GIBAFOR (, the US, , , the EU, the [[World Bank]], and the [[United Nations]]) finally led Kolingba to agree, in principle, to hold free elections in October 1992 with help from the UN Office of Electoral Affairs. After using the excuse of alleged irregularities to suspend the results of the elections as a pretext for holding on to power, President Kolingba came under intense pressure from GIBAFOR to establish a "Conseil National Politique Provisoire de la République" (Provisional National Political Council, CNPPR) and to set up a "Mixed Electoral Commission", which included representatives from all political parties.

When a second round of elections were finally held in 1993, again with the help of the international community coordinated by GIBAFOR, Ange-Félix Patassé won in the second round of voting with 53% of the vote while Goumba won 45.6%. Patassé's party, the ''Mouvement pour la Libération du Peuple Centrafricain'' (MLPC) or Movement for the Liberation of the  People, gained a [[Plurality voting|plurality]] (relative majority) but not an [[Majority|absolute majority]] of seats in parliament, which meant Patassé's party required coalition partners.

==== Patassé government (1993–2003) ====
Patassé purged many of the Kolingba elements from the government and Kolingba supporters accused Patassé's government of conducting a "[[Witch-hunt#Figurative use of the term|witch hunt]]" against the Yakoma. A new constitution was approved on 28 December 1994 but had little impact on the country's politics. In 1996–1997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in the government's erratic behavior, three [[Mutiny|mutinies]] against Patassé's administration were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension. During this time (1996), the [[Peace Corps]] evacuated all its volunteers to neighboring . To date, the Peace Corps has not returned to the . The [[Bangui Agreements]], signed in January 1997, provided for the deployment of an inter-African military mission, to the  and re-entry of ex-mutineers into the government on 7 April 1997. The inter-African military mission was later replaced by a U.N. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1159|peacekeeping force (MINURCA)]]. Since 1997, the country has hosted almost a dozen peacekeeping interventions, earning it the title of "world champion of peacekeeping".

In 1998, parliamentary elections resulted in Kolingba's RDC winning 20 out of 109 seats. The next year, however, in spite of widespread public anger in urban centers over his corrupt rule, Patassé won a second term in the presidential election.

On 28 May 2001, rebels stormed strategic buildings in Bangui in an [[2001  coup d'état attempt|unsuccessful coup attempt]]. The army chief of staff, Abel Abrou, and General François N'Djadder Bedaya were killed, but Patassé regained the upper hand by bringing in at least 300 troops of the [[|]] rebel leader [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] and  soldiers.

In the aftermath of the [[2001  coup d'état attempt|failed coup]], militias loyal to Patassé sought revenge against rebels in many neighborhoods of [[Bangui]] and incited unrest including the murder of many political opponents. Eventually, Patassé came to suspect that General [[François Bozizé]] was involved in another coup attempt against him, which led Bozizé to flee with loyal troops to . In March 2003, Bozizé launched a surprise attack against Patassé, who was out of the country.  troops and some 1,000 soldiers of Bemba's  rebel organization failed to stop the rebels and Bozizé's forces succeeded in overthrowing Patassé.

==== Civil wars ====
[[File:Rebel in northern CAR 01.jpg|thumb|Rebel militia in the northern countryside, 2007]]
{{See also| Bush War| Civil War}}
[[François Bozizé]] suspended the constitution and named a new cabinet, which included most opposition parties. [[Abel Goumba]] was named vice-president. Bozizé established a broad-based National Transition Council to draft a new constitution, and announced that he would step down and run for office once the new constitution was approved.

In 2004, the [[ Bush War]] began as forces opposed to Bozizé took up arms against his government. In May 2005, Bozizé won the presidential election, which excluded Patassé, and in 2006 fighting continued between the government and the rebels. In November 2006, Bozizé's government requested  military support to help them repel rebels who had taken control of towns in the country's northern regions. Though the initial public details of the agreement pertained to logistics and intelligence, by December the  assistance included airstrikes by [[Dassault Mirage 2000]] fighters against rebel positions.

The Syrte Agreement in February and the Birao Peace Agreement in April 2007 called for a cessation of hostilities, the billeting of [[Democratic Front of the  People|FDPC]] fighters and their integration with FACA, the liberation of political prisoners, the integration of FDPC into government, an amnesty for the [[Union of Democratic Forces for Unity|UFDR]], its recognition as a political party, and the integration of its fighters into the national army. Several groups continued to fight but other groups signed on to the agreement or similar agreements with the government (e.g., UFR on 15 December 2008). The only major group not to sign an agreement at the time was the [[Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace|CPJP]], which continued its activities and signed a peace agreement with the government on 25 August 2012.

In 2011, Bozizé was reelected in an election which was widely considered fraudulent.

In November 2012, [[Séléka]], a coalition of rebel groups, took over towns in the northern and central regions of the country. These groups eventually reached a peace deal with Bozizé's government in January 2013, involving a power-sharing government. The deal later broke down, and the rebels seized the capital in March 2013 and Bozizé fled the country.
[[File:Refugees of the fighting in the  observe  soldiers being dropped off at Bangui M'Poko International Airport in the  Jan. 19, 2014 140119-F-RN211-760.jpg|thumb|left|[[Refugee]]s of the fighting in the , January 2014]]

[[Michel Djotodia]] took over as president. Prime Minister [[Nicolas Tiangaye]] requested a [[UN]] peacekeeping force from the [[UN Security Council]] and on 31 May former President Bozizé was indicted for crimes against humanity and incitement to genocide. By the end of the year, there were international warnings of a "genocide" and fighting was largely reprisal attacks on civilians by Seleka's predominantly Muslim fighters and Christian militias called "[[anti-balaka]]". By August 2013, there were reports of over 200,000 [[internally displaced persons]] (IDPs).

On 18 February 2014, [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] called on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] to immediately deploy 3,000 troops to the country, bolstering the 6,000 African Union soldiers and 2,000  troops already in the country, to combat civilians being murdered in large numbers. The ''Séléka'' government was said to be divided, and in September 2013, Djotodia officially disbanded Seleka, but many rebels refused to disarm, becoming known as ex-Seleka, and veered further out of government control. It is argued that the focus of the initial disarmament efforts exclusively on the Seleka inadvertently handed the anti-Balaka the upper hand, leading to the forced displacement of Muslim civilians by anti-Balaka in Bangui and western .

On 11 January 2014, Michael Djotodia and Nicolas Tiengaye resigned as part of a deal negotiated at a regional summit in neighboring [[]]. [[Catherine Samba-Panza]] was elected interim president by the National Transitional Council, becoming the first ever female  president. On 23 July 2014, following  mediation efforts, Séléka and anti-balaka representatives signed a ceasefire agreement in [[Brazzaville]]. By the end of 2014, the country was de facto partitioned with the anti-Balaka in the southwest and ex-Seleka in the northeast. In March 2015, [[Samantha Power]], the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said 417 of the country's 436 mosques had been destroyed, and Muslim women were so scared of going out in public they were giving birth in their homes instead of going to the hospital. On 14 December 2015, Séléka rebel leaders declared an independent [[Republic of Logone]].

==== Touadéra government (2016–present) ====
[[File:War_in_Central_African_Republic.svg|thumb|Current military situation in ]]
[[2015–16  general election|Presidential elections]] were held in December 2015. As no candidate received more than 50% of the vote, a second round of elections was held on 14 February 2016 with run-offs on 31 March 2016. In the second round of voting, former Prime Minister [[Faustin-Archange Touadéra]] was declared the winner with 63% of the vote, defeating [[Union for  Renewal]] candidate [[Anicet-Georges Dologuélé]], another former Prime Minister. While the elections suffered from many potential voters being absent as they had taken refuge in other countries, the fears of widespread violence were ultimately unfounded, and the [[African Union]] regarded the elections as successful.

Touadéra was sworn in on 30 March 2016. No representatives of the Seleka rebel group or the "anti-balaka" militias were included in the subsequently formed government.

[[2020–21  general election|Presidential elections]] were held on 27 December 2020. Former president [[François Bozizé]] announced his candidacy but was rejected by the Constitutional Court of the country, which held that Bozizé did not satisfy the "good morality" requirement for candidates because of an international warrant and [[United Nations]] sanctions against him for alleged assassinations, torture and other crimes.

As large parts of the country were at the time controlled by armed groups, the election could not be conducted in many areas of the country. Some 800 of the country's polling stations, or 14% of the total, were closed due to violence. Three [[]]an peacekeepers were killed and an additional two were wounded during the run-up to the election. President Faustin-Archange Touadéra was reelected.  mercenaries from the [[Wagner Group]] have supported President Faustin-Archange Touadéra in the fight against rebels. 's Wagner group has been accused of harassing and intimidating civilians. In December 2022, [[Roger Cohen]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'', "[[Wagner Group|Wagner]] shock troops form a Praetorian Guard for Mr. Touadéra, who is also protected by  forces, in return for an untaxed license to exploit and export the 's resources" and "one Western ambassador called the ...a 'vassal state' of the Kremlin."

===Prehistory===
[[File:El viajero ilustrado, 1878 602320 (3810561161).jpg|thumb|Solomon Islanders]]

The Solomons were first settled by people coming from the [[Bismarck Islands]] and [[New ]] during the [[Pleistocene]] era {{Circa}} 30,000–28,000 BC, based on archaeological evidence found at [[Kilu Cave]] on [[Buka Island]] in the [[Autonomous Region of Bougainville]], [[]]. At this point sea levels were lower and Buka and Bougainville were physically joined to the southern Solomons in one landmass ("Greater Bougainville"), though it is unclear precisely how far south these early settlers spread as no other archaeological sites from this period have been found. As sea levels rose as the [[Last Glacial Period|Ice Age]] ended {{Circa}} 4000–3500 BC, the Greater Bougainville landmass split into the numerous islands that exist today. Evidence of later human settlements dating to {{Circa}} 4500–2500 BC have been found at Poha Cave and Vatuluma Posovi Cave on [[Guadalcanal]]. The ethnic identity of these early peoples is unclear, though it is thought that the speakers of the [[Central Solomon languages]] (a self-contained language family unrelated to other languages spoken in the Solomons) likely represent the descendants of these earlier settlers.

From {{Circa}} 1200–800 BC, [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] [[Lapita culture|Lapita]] people began arriving from the Bismarcks with their characteristic [[ceramic]]s. Evidence for their presence has been found across the Solomon archipelago, as well at the [[Santa Cruz Islands]] in the south-east, with different islands being settled at different times. Linguistic and genetic evidence suggests that the Lapita people "leap-frogged" the already inhabited main  and settled first on the Santa Cruz group, with later back-migrations bringing their culture to the main group.  These peoples mixed with the native Solomon Islanders and over time their languages became dominant, with most of the 60–70 languages spoken there belonging to the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] branch of the [[Austronesian language family]]. Then, as now, communities tended to exist in small villages practising subsistence agriculture, though extensive inter-island trade networks existed. Numerous ancient burial sites and other evidence of permanent settlements have been found from the period AD 1000–1500 throughout the islands, one of the most prominent examples being the Roviana cultural complex centred on the islands off the southern coast of [[New ]], where a large number of megalithic shrines and other structures were constructed in the 13th century. The people of  were notorious for [[headhunting]] and [[Human cannibalism|cannibalism]] before the arrival of the Europeans.

===Arrival of Europeans (1568–1886)===
[[File:Alvaro de Mendaña de Neyra.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira]] (1542–1595), the first European to sight the Solomons]]

The first European to visit the islands was the  navigator [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira]], sailing from [[Viceroyalty of |]] in 1568. Landing on [[Santa Isabel Island|Santa Isabel]] on 7 February, Mendaña explored several of the other islands including [[Makira]], Guadalcanal and [[Malaita]]. Relations with the native Solomon Islanders were initially cordial, although they often soured as time went by. As a result, Mendaña returned to  in August 1568. He returned to the Solomons with a larger crew on a second voyage in 1595, aiming to colonise the islands. They landed on [[Nendö]] in the Santa Cruz Islands and established a small settlement at Gracioso Bay. However, the settlement failed due to poor relations with the native peoples and epidemics of disease amongst the  which caused numerous deaths, with Mendaña himself dying in October. The new commander [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]] thus decided to abandon the settlement and they sailed north to the  territory of the [[]]. Queirós later returned to the area in 1606, where he sighted [[Tikopia]] and [[Taumako]], though this voyage was primarily to  in the search of [[Terra Australis]].

Save for [[Abel Tasman]]'s sighting of the remote [[Ontong Java Atoll]] in 1648, no European sailed to the Solomons again until 1767, when the  explorer [[Philip Carteret]] sailed by the Santa Cruz Islands, Malaita, and, continuing further north, Bougainville and the Bismarck Islands.  explorers also reached the Solomons, with [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] naming [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]] in 1768 and [[Jean-François de Surville]] exploring the islands in 1769. In 1788 [[John Shortland (Royal Navy officer)|John Shortland]], captaining a supply ship for Britain's new [[]]n colony at [[Botany Bay]], sighted the [[Treasury Islands|Treasury]] and [[Shortland Islands]]. That same year the  explorer [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse|Jean-François de La Pérouse]] was wrecked on [[Vanikoro]]; a rescue expedition led by [[Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] sailed to Vanikoro but found no trace of La Pérouse. The fate of La Pérouse was not confirmed until 1826, when the  merchant [[Peter Dillon]] visited Tikopia and discovered items belonging to La Pérouse in the possession of the local people, confirmed by the subsequent voyage of [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] in 1828.

Some of the earliest regular foreign visitors to the islands were [[whaling]] vessels from Britain, the  and . They came for food, wood and water from late in the 18th century, establishing a trading relationship with the Solomon Islanders and later taking aboard islanders to serve as crewmen on their ships. Relations between the islanders and visiting seamen were not always good and sometimes there was bloodshed. A knock-on effect of the greater European contact was the spread of diseases to which local peoples had no immunity, as well as a shift in the balance of power between coastal groups, who had access to European weapons and technology, and inland groups who did not. In the second half of the 1800s more traders arrived seeking turtleshells, [[sea cucumbers]], [[copra]] and [[sandalwood]], occasionally establishing semi-permanent trading stations. However, initial attempts at more long-term settlement, such as [[Benjamin Boyd]]'s colony on Guadalcanal in 1851, were unsuccessful.

[[File: canoe crop.jpg|thumb|right|Solomon Island warriors, armed with spears, on board an ornamented war canoe (1895)]]
Beginning in the 1840s, and accelerating in the 1860s, islanders began to be recruited (or often kidnapped) as labourers for the colonies in ,  and  in a process known as "[[blackbirding]]". Conditions for workers were often poor and exploitative, and local islanders often [[List of massacres in the |violently]] attacked any Europeans who appeared on their island. The blackbird trade was chronicled by prominent Western writers, such as [[Joe Melvin]] and [[Jack London]]. Christian missionaries also began visiting the Solomons from the 1840s, beginning with an attempt by  Catholics under Jean-Baptiste Epalle to establish a mission on Santa Isabel, which was abandoned after Epalle was killed by islanders in 1845. Anglican missionaries began arriving from the 1850s, followed by other denominations, over time gaining a large number of converts.

===Colonial period (1886–1978)===
{{Main| | Western Pacific Territories| New }}

====Establishment of colonial rule====
In 1884, [[ Empire|]] annexed northeast New  and the Bismarck Archipelago and, in 1886, extended its rule over the [[North ]], covering Bougainville, Buka, Choiseul, Santa Isabel, the Shortlands and Ontong Java atoll. In 1886  and Britain confirmed this arrangement, with the  gaining a "sphere of influence" over the southern Solomons.  paid little attention to the islands, with  authorities based in New  not even visiting the area until 1888. The  presence, along with pressure from the missionaries to rein in the excesses of the coercive labour recruitment practices, known as [[blackbirding]], prompted the  to declare a protectorate over the southern Solomons in March 1893, initially encompassing New , Malaita, Guadalcanal, Makira, Mono Island and the central Nggela Islands.

In April 1896, colonial official [[Charles Morris Woodford]] was appointed as the  Acting Deputy Commissioner, and he was confirmed in his position in the following year. The Colonial Office appointed Woodford as the Resident Commissioner in the  on 17 February 1897. He was directed to control the coercive labour recruitment practices, known as [[blackbirding]], operating in the Solomon Island waters and to stop the illegal trade in firearms. Woodford set up an administrative headquarters on the small island of [[Tulagi]], having proclaimed it the protectorate capital in 1896. and in 1898 and 1899 the [[Rennell and Bellona Province|Rennell and Bellona Islands]], [[Sikaiana]], the Santa Cruz Islands and outlying islands such as Anuta, Fataka, Temotu and Tikopia were added to the protectorate. In 1900, under the terms of the [[Tripartite Convention|Tripartite Convention of 1899]],  ceded the Northern Solomon to Britain, minus Buka and Bougainville, the latter becoming part of [[ New ]] despite geographically belonging to the Solomons archipelago. This was when the Shortlands, Choiseul, Santa Isabel and Ontong Java became part of the Solomons.

Woodford's underfunded administration struggled to maintain law and order on the remote colony. From the late 1890s until the early 1900s, there were numerous instances of European merchants and colonists being killed by islanders; the  response was to deploy [[Royal Navy]] warships to launch [[punitive expedition]]s against the villages which were responsible for the murders. [[Arthur William Mahaffy|Arthur Mahaffy]] was appointed at the Deputy Commissioner in January 1898. He was based in [[Gizo, |Gizo]], his duties included suppressing [[Headhunting#Melanesia|headhunting]] in [[New ]] and neighbouring islands.

The  colonial government attempted to encourage the establishment of [[plantation]]s by colonists; however, by 1902, there were only about 80 European colonists residing on the islands. Attempts at economic development met with mixed results, though [[Levers Pacific Plantations]] Ltd., a subsidiary of [[Lever Brothers]], managed to establish a profitable copra plantation industry which employed many islanders. Small scale mining and logging industries were also developed. However, the colony remained something of a backwater, with education, medical and other social services being under the administration of the missionaries. Violence also continued, most notably with the [[Malaita massacre|murder]] of colonial administrator [[William R. Bell]] by [[Basiana]] of the [[Kwaio people]] on Malaita in 1927, as Bell attempted to enforce an unpopular head tax. Several Kwaio were killed in a retaliatory raid, and Basiana and his accomplices executed.

====World War II====
{{main| campaign| occupation of the }}

With the outbreak of the Second World War most planters and traders were evacuated to  and most cultivation ceased. Some of the most intense fighting of the war occurred in the Solomons.

From 1942 until the end of 1943, the  were the scene of several major land, sea, and air battles between the Allies and the [[Empire of ]]'s armed forces. Following the  [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, war was declared between  and the Allied Powers, and the , seeking to protect their southern flank, invaded South-East Asia and New . In May 1942, the  launched [[Operation Mo]], [[Invasion of Tulagi (May 1942)|occupying Tulagi]] and most of the western , including Guadalcanal where they began work on an airstrip. The  administration had already relocated to [[Auki]], Malaita, and most of the European population had been evacuated to . The Allies [[Guadalcanal campaign|counter-invaded Guadalcanal]] in August 1942, followed by the [[New  campaign]] in 1943, both of which were turning points in the [[Pacific War]], stopping and then countering the  advance. The conflict resulted in thousands of Allied,  and civilian deaths, and extensive destruction across the islands.  The  Campaign cost the Allies approximately 7,100 men, 29 ships, and 615 aircraft. The  lost 31,000 men, 38 ships, and 683 aircraft.

[[Coastwatchers]] from the  played a major role in providing intelligence and rescuing other Allied servicemen. U.S. Admiral [[William Halsey]], the commander of Allied forces during the Battle for Guadalcanal, recognised the coastwatchers' contributions by stating "The coastwatchers saved Guadalcanal and Guadalcanal saved the South Pacific." In addition, around 3,200 men served in the [[ Labour Corps]] and some 6,000 enlisted in the [[  Protectorate Defence Force]], with their exposure to the  leading to several social and political transformations. For example, the  had extensively developed [[Honiara]], with the capital shifting there from Tulagi in 1952, and the [[Pijin language]] was heavily influenced by the communication between  and the Islands inhabitants.

{{main| campaign|Guadalcanal campaign}}

The most significant of the Allied Forces' operations against the [[ Imperial]] Forces was launched on 7 August 1942, with simultaneous naval bombardments and amphibious landings on the [[Florida Islands]] at [[Tulagi]] and Red Beach on [[Guadalcanal]].
	
The [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] became an important and bloody campaign fought in the Pacific War as the Allies began to repulse the  expansion. Of strategic importance during the war were the [[coastwatchers]] operating in remote locations, often on  held islands, providing early warning and intelligence of  naval, army and aircraft movements during the campaign.

Islanders [[Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana]] were the first to find the shipwrecked [[John F. Kennedy]] and his crew of the [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]]. They suggested writing a rescue message on a coconut, and delivered the coconut by paddling a dugout canoe. The coconut was later kept on Kennedy's desk when he became [[President of the ]].

====Post-war period and the lead-up to independence====
In 1943–44 the Malaita-based chief Aliki Nono'ohimae had founded the [[Maasina Ruru|Maasina Rule]] movement (aka the Native Council Movement, literally "Brotherhood Rule"), and was later joined by another chief, Hoasihau. Their aims were to improve the economic well-being of native Solomon Islanders, gain greater autonomy and to act as a liaison between Islanders and the colonial administration. The movement was especially popular with ex-Labour Corp members and after the war its numbers swelled, with the movement spreading to other islands. Alarmed at the growth of the movement, the  launched "Operation De-Louse" in 1947–8 and arrested most of the Maasina leaders. Malaitans then organised a campaign of civil disobedience, prompting mass arrests. In 1950 a new Resident Commissioner, Henry Gregory-Smith, arrived and released the leaders of the movement, though the disobedience campaign continued. In 1952 new High Commissioner (later Governor) [[Robert Christopher Stafford Stanley|Robert Stanley]] met with leaders of the movement and agreed to the creation of an island council. In late 1952 Stanley formally moved the capital of the territory to Honiara. In the early 1950s the possibility of transferring sovereignty of the islands to  was discussed by the  and  governments; however, the  were reluctant to accept the financial burden of administering the territory and the idea was shelved.

With decolonisation sweeping the colonial world, and Britain no longer willing (or able) to bear the financial burdens of the Empire, the colonial authorities sought to prepare the Solomons for self-governance. Appointed Executive and [[Legislative Council of the |Legislative Councils]] were established in 1960, with a degree of elected Solomon Islander representation introduced in 1964 and then extended in 1967. A new constitution was drawn up in 1970 which merged the two Councils into one [[Governing Council of the |Governing Council]], though the  Governor still retained extensive powers. Discontent with this prompted the creation of a new constitution in 1974 which reduced much of the Governor's remaining powers and created the post of Chief Minister, first held by [[Solomon Mamaloni]]. Full self-government for the territory was achieved in 1976, a year after the independence of neighbouring  from . Meanwhile, discontent grew in the Western islands, with many fearing marginalisation in a future Honiara- or Malaita-dominated state, prompting the formation of the Western Breakaway Movement. A conference held in London in 1977 agreed that the Solomons would gain full independence the following year. Under the terms of the [[ Act 1978]] the country was annexed to [[dominion|Her Majesty's dominions]] and granted independence on 7 July 1978. The first prime minister was Sir [[Peter Kenilorea]] of the [[ United Party]] (SIUP), with [[Elizabeth II]] becoming [[Monarchy of |Queen of ]], represented locally by a [[Governor-General of |Governor General]].

===Independence era (1978–present)===
====Early post-independence years====
Peter Kenilorea went on to win the [[1980  general election]], serving as PM until 1981, when he was replaced by [[Solomon Mamaloni]] of the [[People's Alliance Party ()|People's Alliance Party]] (PAP) after a no confidence vote. Mamaloni created the Central Bank and national airline, and pushed for greater autonomy for individual islands of the country. Kenilorea returned to power after winning the [[1984  general election|1984 election]], though his second term lasted only two years before he was replaced by [[Ezekiel Alebua]] following allegations of misuse of  aid money. In 1986 the Solomons helped found the [[Melanesian Spearhead Group]], aimed at fostering cooperation and trade in the region. After winning the [[1989 election]] Mamaloni and the PAP returned to power, with Mamaloni dominating  politics from the early to mid 1990s (save for the one year Premiership of [[Francis Billy Hilly]]). Mamaloni made efforts to make the Solomons a republic; however, these were unsuccessful. He also had to deal with the effects of the [[Bougainville Civil War|conflict]] in neighbouring Bougainville which broke out in 1988, causing many refugees to flee to the Solomons. Tensions arose with  as PNG forces frequently entered Solomons territory in the pursuit of rebels. The situation calmed down and relations improved following the end of the conflict in 1998. Meanwhile, the country's financial situation continued to deteriorate, with much of the budget coming from the logging industry, often conducted at an unsustainable rate, not helped by Mamaloni's creation of a 'discretionary fund' for use by politicians, which fostered fraud and corruption. Discontent with his rule led to a split in the PAP, and Mamaloni lost the [[1993  general election|1993 election]] to Billy Hilly, though Hilly was later sacked by the Governor-General after a number of defections caused him to lose his majority, allowing Mamaloni to return to power in 1994, where he remained until 1997. Excessive logging, government corruption and unsustainable levels of public spending continued to grow, and public discontent caused Mamaloni to lose the [[1997  general election|1997 election]]. The new prime minister, [[Bartholomew Ulufa'alu]] of the [[ Liberal Party]], attempted to enact economic reforms; however, his premiership soon became engulfed in a serious ethnic conflict known as "The Tensions".

====Ethnic violence (1998–2003)====

Commonly referred to as ''the tensions'' or ''the ethnic tension'', the initial civil unrest was mainly characterised by fighting between the [[Isatabu Freedom Movement]] (IFM, also known as the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army and the Isatabu Freedom Fighters) and the [[Malaita Eagle Force]] (as well as the Marau Eagle Force). For many years people from the island of Malaita had been migrating to Honiara and Guadalcanal, attracted primarily by the greater economic opportunities available there. The large influx caused tensions with native Guadalcanal islanders (known as Guales), and in late 1998 the IFM was formed and began a campaign of intimidation and violence towards Malaitan settlers. Thousands of Malaitans subsequently fled back to Malaita or to Honiara, and in mid-1999 the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) was established to protect Malaitans on Guadalcanal. In late 1999, after several failed attempts at brokering a peace deal, Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu declared a four-month state of emergency, and also requested assistance from  and , but his appeal was rejected. Meanwhile, law and order on Guadalcanal collapsed, with an ethnically divided police unable to assert authority and many of their weapons depots being raided by the militias; by this point the MEF controlled Honiara with the IFM controlling the rest of Guadalacanal.

In April 2003, seven Christians of the [[Melanesian Brotherhood]] – Brother Robin Lindsay and his companions – were killed on the Weather Coast of Guadalcanal by the rebel leader [[Harold Keke]]. Six had gone in search of their Brother Nathaniel, who it turns out had already been tortured and killed. During the tensions Nathaniel had befriended the militant group but Harold Keke accused him of being a government spy and he was beaten to death; it was reported that he died singing hymns. They are commemorated by the Anglican church on 24 April.

On 5 June 2000, Ulufa'alu was kidnapped by the MEF who felt that, although he was a Malaitan, he was not doing enough to protect their interests. Ulufa'alu subsequently resigned in exchange for his release. [[Manasseh Sogavare]], who had earlier been Finance Minister in Ulufa'alu's government but had subsequently joined the opposition, was elected as prime minister by 23–21 over the Rev. [[Leslie Boseto]]. However, Sogavare's election was immediately shrouded in controversy because six MPs (thought to be supporters of Boseto) were unable to attend parliament for the crucial vote. On 15 October 2000, the [[Townsville Peace Agreement]] was signed by the MEF, elements of the IFM, and the  Government. This was closely followed by the Marau Peace agreement in February 2001, signed by the Marau Eagle Force, the IFM, the Guadalcanal Provincial Government, and the  Government. However, a key Guale militant leader, [[Harold Keke]], refused to sign the agreement, causing a split with the Guale groups. Subsequently, Guale signatories to the agreement led by Andrew Te'e joined with the Malaitan-dominated police to form the 'Joint Operations Force'. During the next two years the conflict moved to the remote Weathercoast region of southern Guadalcanal as the Joint Operations unsuccessfully attempted to capture Keke and his group.

[[File:New beginning for  (10709848893).jpg|thumb|right|Solomon Islanders at a peace protest in 2003]]
By early 2001, the economy had collapsed and the government was bankrupt. New [[2001  general election|elections]] in December 2001 brought [[Allan Kemakeza]] into the Prime Minister's chair, with the support of his People's Alliance Party and the Association of Independent Members. Law and order deteriorated as the nature of the conflict shifted: there was continuing violence on the Weathercoast, whilst militants in Honiara increasingly turned their attention to crime, extortion and banditry. The Department of Finance would often be surrounded by armed men when funding was due to arrive. In December 2002, Finance Minister [[Laurie Chan]] resigned after being forced at gunpoint to sign a cheque made out to some of the militants. Conflict also broke out in Western Province between locals and Malaitan settlers. The atmosphere of lawlessness, widespread extortion, and ineffective police prompted a formal request by the  Government for outside help; the request was unanimously supported in Parliament.

In July 2003,  and Pacific Islands police and troops arrived in  under the auspices of the -led [[Regional Assistance Mission to ]] (RAMSI). A sizeable international security contingent of 2,200 police and troops, led by  and , and with representatives from about 15 other Pacific nations, began arriving the next month under Operation Helpem Fren. The situation improved dramatically, with violence ending and Harold Keke surrendering to the force. Some 200 people had been killed in the conflict. Since this time, some commentators have considered the country a [[failed state]], with the nation having failed to build an inclusive national identity capable of overriding local island and ethnic loyalties. However, other academics argue that, rather than being a 'failed state', it is an unformed state: a state that never consolidated even after decades of independence. Furthermore, some scholars, such as Kabutaulaka (2001) and Dinnen (2002) argue that the 'ethnic conflict' label is an oversimplification.

====Post-conflict era====

Kemakeza remained in office until April 2006, when he lost the [[2006  general election]] and [[Snyder Rini]] became PM. However, allegations that Rini had used bribes from  businessmen to buy the votes of members of Parliament led to mass rioting in the capital [[Honiara]], concentrated on the city's Chinatown area. Resentment against the minority [[Han |]] business community led to much of [[Chinatown]] in the city being destroyed.  sent chartered aircraft to evacuate  out of the riots. Evacuation of  and  citizens was on a much smaller scale. Additional , , and  police and troops were dispatched to try to quell the unrest. Rini eventually resigned before facing a motion of no-confidence in Parliament, and Parliament elected [[Manasseh Sogavare]] as prime minister.

Sogavare struggled to assert his authority and was also hostile to the  presence in the country; after one failed attempt, he was removed in a no confidence vote in 2007 and replaced by [[Derek Sikua]] of the  Liberal Party. In 2008, a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission ()|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] was established to examine and help heal the wounds of the 'tension' years. Sikua lost the [[2010  general election]] to [[Danny Philip]], though after a vote of no-confidence in him following allegations of corruption, Philip was ousted and replaced by [[Gordon Darcy Lilo]]. Sogavare returned to power after the [[2014  general election|2014 election]], and oversaw the withdrawal of RAMSI forces from the country in 2017. Sogavare was ousted in a no-confidence vote in 2017, which saw [[Rick Houenipwela]] come to power; however, Sogavare returned to the prime ministership after winning the [[2019  general election|2019 election]], sparking rioting in Honiara. In 2019, Sogavare announced that the Solomons would be switching recognition from Taiwan to .

On 25 November 2019,  launched a national [[Ocean governance|ocean policy]] to achieve the sustainable development and use of the ocean for the benefit of the people of the island nation.

In [[2021  unrest|November 2021, there was mass rioting and unrest]]. The  Government requested assistance from  under the 2017 Bilateral Security Treaty and  provided a deployment of [[ Federal Police]] and [[ Defence Force|Defence Forces]].

In March 2022,  signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] (MOU) on policing cooperation with  and was also reported to be in the process of concluding a security agreement with . The agreement with  could allow an ongoing  military and naval presence in the Solomons. A spokesperson for 's [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ()|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] said that, while "Pacific Island nations have the right to make sovereign decisions",  "would be concerned by any actions that destabilise the security of our region". There are similar concerns in  and the .  donated a shipment of replica firearms to the  police for training.  and  signed a security co-operation agreement in April to promote social stability and long-term peace and security in . The BBC reported that, according to a leaked draft of the agreement verified by the  government, Beijing could deploy forces to  "to assist in maintaining social order". Prime Minister [[Manasseh Sogavare]] said the pact would not "undermine peace and harmony" in the region and was aimed at protecting the Solomon's internal security situation.  confirmed that the social-order clause had been maintained in the final agreement.

In February 2023, [[2023  protests|further protests broke out]] after the Premier of [[Malaita Province]] [[Daniel Suidani]] was removed from office after a vote of no confidence from the provincial legislature. In May 2024, [[Jeremiah Manele]] was elected as  new prime minister to succeed Manasseh Sogavare.

About 2 million years ago, representatives of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' migrated to the [[Taman Peninsula]] in southern . [[Flint]] tools, some 1.5 million years old, have been discovered in the [[North Caucasus]]. [[Radiocarbon dated]] specimens from [[Denisova Cave]] in the [[Altai Mountains]] estimate the oldest [[Denisovan]] specimen lived 195–122,700 years ago. Fossils of ''[[Denny (hybrid hominin)|Denny]]'', an [[archaic human]] hybrid that was half [[Neanderthal]] and half Denisovan, and lived some 90,000 years ago, was also found within the latter cave.  was home to some of the last surviving Neanderthals, from about 45,000 years ago, found in [[Mezmaiskaya cave]].

The first trace of an [[Ust'-Ishim man|early modern human]] in  dates back to 45,000 years, in [[Western Siberia]]. The discovery of high concentration cultural remains of [[Human|anatomically modern humans]], from at least 40,000 years ago, was found at [[Kostyonki–Borshchyovo]], and at [[Sungir]], dating back to 34,600 years ago—both in [[European |western ]]. Humans reached [[Far North ()|Arctic ]] at least 40,000 years ago, in [[Mamontovaya Kurya]]. [[Ancient North Eurasian]] populations from Siberia genetically similar to [[Mal'ta–Buret' culture]] and [[Afontova Gora]] were an important genetic contributor to [[Ancient Beringian|Ancient Native ]] and [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]]s.

Early [[Indo-European migrations]] from the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]] of  and  spread [[Yamnaya culture|Yamnaya]] ancestry and [[Indo-European languages]] across large parts of Eurasia. [[Nomadic pastoralism]] developed in the Pontic–Caspian steppe beginning in the [[Chalcolithic]]. Remnants of these steppe civilisations were discovered in places such as [[Ipatovo kurgan|Ipatovo]], [[Sintashta]], [[Arkaim]], and [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk]], which bear the earliest known traces of [[horses in warfare]]. The genetic makeup of speakers of the [[Uralic language family|Uralic]] language family in northern Europe was shaped by migration from [[Siberia]] that began at least 3,500 years ago.

In the 3rd to 4th centuries AD, the [[Goths|Gothic]] kingdom of [[Oium]] existed in southern , which was later overrun by [[Huns]]. Between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD, the [[Bosporan Kingdom]], which was a Hellenistic [[polity]] that succeeded the  colonies, was also overwhelmed by nomadic invasions led by warlike tribes such as the Huns and [[Pannonian Avars|Eurasian Avars]]. The [[Khazars]], who were of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic origin]], ruled the steppes between the Caucasus in the south, to the east past the Volga river basin, and west as far as Kyiv on the Dnieper river until the 10th century. After them came the [[Pechenegs]] who created a large confederacy, which was subsequently taken over by the [[Cumans]] and the [[Kipchaks]].

The ancestors of [[]] are among the [[List of ancient Slavic peoples|Slavic tribes]] that separated from the Proto-Indo-Europeans, who appeared in the northeastern part of Europe {{Circa|1500}} years ago. The East Slavs gradually settled western  (approximately between modern [[Moscow]] and [[-Petersburg]]) in two waves: one moving from [[Kyiv|Kiev]] towards present-day [[Suzdal]] and [[Murom]] and another from [[Polotsk]] towards [[Novgorod]] and [[Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast|Rostov]]. Prior to Slavic migration, that territory was populated by [[Finno-Ugrian]] peoples. From the 7th century onwards, the incoming East Slavs slowly assimilated the native Finno-Ugrians.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}}

The establishment of the first East Slavic states in the 9th century coincided with the arrival of [[Varangians]], the [[Vikings]] who ventured along the waterways extending from the eastern Baltic [[From the Varangians to the |to the Black]] and [[Volga trade route|Caspian]] Seas.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} According to the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', a Varangian from the [[Rus' people]], named [[Rurik]], was elected ruler of [[Novgorod]] in 862. In 882, his successor [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]] ventured south and conquered [[Kiev]], which had been previously paying tribute to the [[Khazars]].{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} Rurik's son [[Igor of Kiev|Igor]] and Igor's son [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav]] subsequently subdued all local [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] tribes to Kievan rule, destroyed the Khazar Khaganate, and launched several military expeditions to [[Sviatoslav's invasion of |]], [[Paphlagonian expedition of the Rus'|Byzantium]] and [[Caspian expeditions of the Rus'|Persia]].

In the 10th to 11th centuries, Kievan Rus' became one of the largest and most prosperous states in Europe. The reigns of [[Vladimir the Great]] (980–1015) and his son [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–1054) constitute the [[Golden Age]] of Kiev, which saw [[Christianisation of Kievan Rus'|the acceptance of]] Orthodox Christianity from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], and the creation of the first East Slavic written [[legal code]], the ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]''.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} The age of [[feudalism]] and decentralisation had come, marked by constant in-fighting between members of the [[Rurik dynasty]] that ruled Kievan Rus' collectively. Kiev's dominance waned, to the benefit of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] in the north-east, the [[Novgorod Republic]] in the north, and [[Galicia-Volhynia]] in the south-west.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2.

Led by Prince [[Alexander Nevsky]], Novgorodians repelled the invading [[Swedes]] in the [[Battle of the Neva]] in 1240, as well as the [[Northern Crusades|Germanic crusaders]] in the [[Battle on the Ice]] in 1242.

Kievan Rus' finally fell to the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Mongol invasion]] of 1237–1240, which resulted in the [[Siege of Kiev (1240)|sacking of Kiev]] and other cities, as well as the death of a major part of the population.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2.

The tsar [[Promulgation|promulgated]] a new code of laws ([[Sudebnik of 1550]]), established the first  feudal representative body (the [[Zemsky Sobor]]), revamped the military, curbed the influence of the clergy, and reorganised local government.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} During his long reign, Ivan nearly doubled the already large  territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates: [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] along the [[Volga]], and the [[Khanate of Sibir]] in southwestern Siberia. Ultimately, by the end of the 16th century,  expanded east of the [[Ural Mountains]].

The death of Ivan's sons marked the end of the ancient [[Rurik dynasty]] in 1598, and in combination with the disastrous [[ famine of 1601–03|famine of 1601–1603]], led to a civil war, the rule of pretenders, and foreign intervention during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the early 17th century. The [[– Commonwealth]], taking advantage, occupied parts of , extending into the capital Moscow. In 1612, the Poles were forced to retreat by the  volunteer corps, led by merchant [[Kuzma Minin]] and prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]]. The [[Romanov dynasty]] acceded to the throne in 1613 by the decision of the Zemsky Sobor, and the country started its gradual recovery from the crisis.

The officers who pursued Napoleon into Western Europe brought ideas of liberalism back to , and attempted to curtail the tsar's powers during the abortive [[Decembrist revolt]] of 1825. At the end of the conservative reign of [[Nicholas I of |Nicholas I]] (1825–1855), a zenith period of 's power and influence in Europe, was disrupted by defeat in the [[Crimean War]].

====Great liberal reforms and capitalism====

Nicholas's successor [[Alexander II of |Alexander&nbsp;II]] (1855–1881) enacted significant changes throughout the country, including the [[emancipation reform of 1861]]. These reforms spurred industrialisation, and modernised the Imperial  Army, which liberated much of the [[Balkans]] from Ottoman rule in the aftermath of the [[Russo- War (1877–1878)|1877–1878 Russo- War]]. During most of the 19th and early 20th century,  and [[ Empire|Britain]] colluded over [[Emirate of |]] and its neighbouring territories in [[Central Asia|Central]] and South Asia; the rivalry between the two major European empires came to be known as the [[Great Game]].

The late 19th century saw the rise of various socialist movements in . Alexander&nbsp;II was [[Assassination of Alexander II of |assassinated]] in 1881 by revolutionary terrorists. The reign of his son [[Alexander III of |Alexander&nbsp;III]] (1881–1894) was less liberal but more peaceful.

====Constitutional monarchy and World War====
Under last  emperor, [[Nicholas&nbsp;II]] (1894–1917), the [[Revolution of 1905]] was triggered by the humiliating failure of the [[Russo- War]]. The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms ([[ Constitution of 1906]]), including granting [[freedom of speech|freedoms of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], the legalisation of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the [[State Duma ( Empire)|State Duma]].

=== Revolution and civil war ===
{{main| Revolution| Civil War|Dissolution of the  Empire}}
[[File: Imperial Family 1913.jpg|thumb|left|Emperor [[Nicholas II of ]] and the [[House of Romanov|Romanovs]] were [[Execution of the Romanov family|executed]] by the Bolsheviks in 1918.]]
In 1914, [[ entry into World War I| entered World War&nbsp;I]] in response to [[-]]'s declaration of war on 's ally [[Kingdom of |]], and fought across multiple fronts while isolated from its [[Triple Entente]] allies. In 1916, the [[Brusilov Offensive]] of the Imperial  Army almost completely destroyed the [[Austro- Army]]. However, the already-existing public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war, [[World War I casualties|high casualties]], and rumors of corruption and treason. All this formed the climate for the [[ Revolution]] of 1917, carried out in two major acts.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} In early 1917, [[Nicholas II of |Nicholas II]] was [[February Revolution|forced to abdicate]]; he and his family were imprisoned and [[Shooting of the Romanov family|later executed]] during the [[ Civil War]]. The monarchy was replaced by a shaky coalition of political parties that declared itself the [[ Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], and proclaimed the [[ Republic]]. On {{OldStyleDateNY|19 January|6 January}}, 1918, the [[ Constituent Assembly]] declared  a democratic federal republic (thus ratifying the Provisional Government's decision). The next day the Constituent Assembly was dissolved by the [[All- Central Executive Committee]].{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}}

An alternative socialist establishment co-existed, the [[Petrograd Soviet]], wielding power through the democratically elected councils of workers and peasants, called ''[[Soviet (council)|soviets]]''. The rule of the new authorities only aggravated the crisis in the country instead of resolving it, and eventually, the [[October Revolution]], led by [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]], overthrew the Provisional Government and gave full governing power to the soviets, leading to the creation of the world's first [[socialist state]].{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} The [[ Civil War]] broke out between the [[anti-communist]] [[White movement]] and the Bolsheviks with its [[Red Army]]. In the aftermath of signing the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] that concluded hostilities with the [[Central Powers]] of [[World War I|World War&nbsp;I]], Bolshevist  surrendered most of its western territories, which hosted 34% of its population, 54% of its industries, 32% of its agricultural land, and roughly 90% of its coal mines.
[[File:Vladimir_Lenin_Speech_in_May_1920.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Lenin]] speaks in Moscow, 1920, with [[Leon Trotsky]] leaning against the podium]]
The [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] launched an unsuccessful [[Allied intervention in the  Civil War|military intervention]] in support of anti-communist forces. In the meantime, both the Bolsheviks and White movement carried out campaigns of deportations and executions against each other, known respectively as the [[Red Terror]] and [[White Terror ()|White Terror]]. By the end of the violent civil war, 's economy and infrastructure were heavily damaged, and as many as 10 million perished during the war, mostly civilians. Millions became [[White émigré]]s, and the [[ famine of 1921–1922]] claimed up to five&nbsp;million victims.

=== Soviet Union ===
{{Main|History of the Soviet Union}}
[[File:Soviet Union -  SFSR (1936).svg|thumb|left|Location of the [[ Soviet Federative Socialist Republic| SFSR]] (red) within the [[Soviet Union]] in 1936]]

====Command economy and Soviet society====
On 30 December 1922, Lenin and his aides [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|formed]] the [[Soviet Union]], by joining the [[ Soviet Federative Socialist Republic| SFSR]] into a single state with the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian]], [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian]], and [[ Soviet Socialist Republic|]] republics. Eventually internal border changes and annexations during World War II created a union of [[republics of the Soviet Union|15 republics]], the largest in size and population being the  SFSR, which dominated the union politically, culturally, and economically.

Following [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's death]] in 1924, a [[List of Troikas in the Soviet Union|troika]] was designated to take charge. Eventually [[Joseph Stalin]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], managed to suppress all opposition factions and consolidate power in his hands to become the country's dictator by the 1930s. [[Leon Trotsky]], the main proponent of [[world revolution]], was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1929, and Stalin's idea of [[Socialism in One Country]] became the official line. The continued internal struggle in the Bolshevik party culminated in the [[Great Purge]].

====Stalinism and modernisation====
[[File:Telegram Stalin STZ.jpg|thumb|Congratulations sent by [[Joseph Stalin]] on the opening of the [[Volgograd Tractor Plant|Stalingrad Tractor Plant]]]]
Under Stalin's leadership, the government launched a [[command economy]], [[Industrialization in the USSR|industrialisation of the largely rural country]], and [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivisation]] of [[Agriculture in the USSR|its agriculture]]. During this period of rapid economic and social change, millions of people were sent to [[Gulag|penal labour camps]], including many political convicts for their suspected or real opposition to Stalin's rule, and millions were [[population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported and exiled]] to remote areas of the Soviet Union. The transitional disorganisation of the country's agriculture, combined with the harsh state policies and a drought, led to the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933]], which killed 5.7 to 8.7 million, 3.3 million of them in the  SFSR. The Soviet Union, ultimately, made the costly transformation from a largely agrarian economy to a major industrial powerhouse within a short span of time.

====World War II and United Nations====

The Soviet Union entered [[World War II]] on 17 September 1939 with its [[Soviet invasion of |invasion of ]], in accordance with a secret protocol within the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] with [[Nazi ]].

Eventually, some 5 million [[Red Army]] troops were captured by the Nazis;{{rp|272}} the latter deliberately [[ mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|starved to death or otherwise killed]] 3.3&nbsp;million Soviet [[Prisoner of war|POW]]s, and a vast number of civilians, as the "[[Hunger Plan]]" sought to fulfil [[Generalplan Ost]].{{rp|175–186}} Although the [[Wehrmacht]] had considerable early success, their attack was halted in the [[Battle of Moscow]]. Subsequently, the  were dealt major defeats first at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in the winter of 1942–1943, and then in the [[Battle of Kursk]] in the summer of 1943. Another  failure was the [[Siege of Leningrad]], in which the city was fully blockaded on land between 1941 and 1944 by  and  forces, and suffered starvation and more than a million deaths, but never surrendered. Soviet forces steamrolled through Eastern and Central Europe in 1944–1945 and [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] in May 1945. In August 1945, the Red Army [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invaded Manchuria]] and [[Soviet– War|ousted the ]] from Northeast Asia, contributing to the Allied victory over .

The 1941–1945 period of World War&nbsp;II is known in  as the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]. The Soviet Union, along with the , the  and  were considered the Big Four of Allied powers in World War II, and later became the [[Four Policemen]], which was the foundation of the [[United Nations Security Council]].{{rp|27}} During the war, [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|Soviet civilian and military death were about 26–27 million]], accounting for about half of all [[World War&nbsp;II casualties]].{{rp|295}} The [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economy]] and infrastructure suffered massive devastation, which caused the [[Soviet famine of 1946–1947]]. However, at the expense of a large sacrifice, the Soviet Union emerged as a global superpower.

====Superpower and Cold War====
[[File:Yalta Conference (Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin) (B&W).jpg|thumb|The "[[Grand Alliance (World War II)|Big Three]]" at the [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945, [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]]]
After World War II, according to the [[Potsdam Conference]], the [[Red Army]] occupied parts of Eastern and Central Europe, including [[East ]] and the eastern regions of [[]]. Dependent communist governments were installed in the [[Eastern Bloc]] satellite states. After becoming the world's second [[ and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear power]], the Soviet Union established the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance, and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the [[Cold War]], with the rivalling  and [[NATO]].

====Khrushchev Thaw reforms and economic development====
After [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|Stalin's death]] in 1953 and a short period of [[Collective leadership|collective rule]], the new leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] denounced [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Stalin]] and launched the policy of [[de-Stalinization]], releasing many political prisoners from the [[Gulag]] labour camps. The general easement of repressive policies became known later as the [[Khrushchev Thaw]]. At the same time, Cold War tensions reached its peak when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the  [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter missiles]] in  and Soviet [[ Missile Crisis|missiles in ]].

In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial [[satellite]], ''[[Sputnik&nbsp;1]]'', thus starting the [[Space Age]].  [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first human to orbit the Earth, aboard the ''[[Vostok&nbsp;1]]'' crewed spacecraft on [[Cosmonautics Day|12 April 1961]].

====Period of developed socialism or Era of Stagnation====
Following the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, another period of [[Collectivity of leadership|collective rule]] ensued, until [[Leonid Brezhnev]] became the leader. The era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was later designated as the [[Era of Stagnation]]. The 1965 [[Kosygin reform]] aimed for partial [[decentralisation]] of the [[Soviet economy]]. In 1979, after a [[Saur Revolution|communist-led revolution]] in , Soviet forces invaded the country, ultimately starting the [[Soviet– War]]. In May 1988, the [[Soviet withdrawal from |Soviets started to withdraw from ]], due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens.

====Perestroika, democratisation and  sovereignty====
[[File:President Ronald Reagan greets a young boy while touring Red Square during the Moscow Summit in the USSR.jpg|thumb|Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and US President [[Ronald Reagan]] in [[Red Square]] during the [[Moscow Summit (1988)|Moscow Summit]], 31 May 1988]]
From 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring) in an attempt to end the [[Era of Stagnation|period of economic stagnation]] and to [[Demokratizatsiya (Soviet Union)|democratise the government]]. This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements across the country. Prior to 1991, the Soviet economy was the world's second-largest, but during its final years, it went into a crisis.

By 1991, economic and political turmoil began to boil over as the [[Baltic states]] chose to secede from the Soviet Union. On 17 March, a [[1991 Soviet Union referendum|referendum]] was held, in which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into a [[New Union Treaty|renewed federation]]. In June 1991, [[Boris Yeltsin]] became the first directly elected [[President of |President]] in  history when he was [[1991  presidential election|elected]] President of the  SFSR. In August 1991, [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|a coup d'état attempt]] by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led to the end of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. On 25 December 1991, following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], along with contemporary , fourteen other [[post-Soviet states]] emerged.

====Transition to a market economy and political crises====

The economic and political collapse of the Soviet Union led  into a deep and prolonged depression. During and after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, wide-ranging reforms including [[Privatization in |privatisation]] and [[free trade|market and trade liberalisation]] were undertaken, including radical changes along the lines of "[[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]". The privatisation largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government, which led to the rise of [[ oligarchs]]. Many of the newly rich moved billions in cash and assets outside of the country in an enormous [[capital flight]]. The depression of the economy led to the collapse of social services—the [[birth rate]] plummeted while the [[death rate]] skyrocketed, and millions plunged into poverty, while extreme corruption, as well as criminal gangs and organised crime rose significantly.

In late 1993, tensions between Yeltsin and the  parliament culminated in [[1993  constitutional crisis|a constitutional crisis]] which ended violently through military force. During the crisis, Yeltsin was backed by Western governments, and over 100 people were killed.

==== Modern liberal constitution, international cooperation and economic stabilisation ====
In December, a [[1993  constitutional referendum|referendum]] was held and approved, which introduced a new constitution, giving the president enormous powers. The 1990s were plagued by armed conflicts in the [[North Caucasus]], both local ethnic skirmishes and separatist [[Islamist]] insurrections. From the time [[Chechnya|Chechen]] separatists declared independence in the early 1990s, an [[First Chechen War|intermittent guerrilla war]] was fought between the rebel groups and  forces. [[Terrorism in |Terrorist attacks against civilians]] were carried out by Chechen separatists, claiming the lives of thousands of  civilians.{{efn|Most notably the [[Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis]], the [[ apartment bombings]], the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]], and the [[Beslan school siege]]}}

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union,  assumed responsibility for settling the latter's external debts. In 1992, most consumer price controls were eliminated, causing extreme inflation and significantly devaluing the rouble. High budget deficits coupled with increasing capital flight and inability to pay back debts, caused the [[1998  financial crisis]], which resulted in a further GDP decline.

====Movement towards a modernised economy, political centralisation and democratic backsliding====
{{Further|Putinism}}
On 31 December 1999, President Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned, handing the post to the recently appointed prime minister and his chosen successor, [[Vladimir Putin]]. Putin then won the [[2000  presidential election|2000 presidential election]], and defeated the Chechen insurgency in the [[Second Chechen War]].

Putin won a [[2004  presidential election|second presidential term]] in 2004. [[Price of petroleum|High oil prices]] and a rise in foreign investment saw the [[ economy]] and living standards improve significantly. Putin's rule increased stability, while transforming  into an [[Authoritarianism#Examples|authoritarian state]]. In 2008, Putin took the post of prime minister, while [[Dmitry Medvedev]] was [[2008  presidential election|elected President]] for one term, to hold onto power despite legal [[term limit]]s; this period has been described as a "[[Medvedev–Putin tandemocracy|tandemocracy]]".
Following a [[2008 Russo- diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis]] with neighbouring [[ (country)|]], the [[Russo- War]] took place during 1–12 August 2008, resulting in  recognising two separatist states in the territories that it [[occupied territories of |occupies in ]]. It was the first [[List of conflicts in Europe|European war]] of the 21st century. The [[2008 amendments to the Constitution of |2008 constitutional amendments]] saw the terms of the president extend to six years and the lower house (State Duma) to five years. Putin then went on to win the [[2012  presidential election|2012 presidential election]], which fueled the "[[2011–2013  protests|Snow Revolution]]" protests.

====Invasion of ====
{{Main| invasion of }}
[[File:Annexation of Southern and Eastern .svg|thumb|[[-occupied territories of ]] as of 30 September 2022 at the time their [[ annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts|annexation was declared]]]]

The annexation generated an insurgency in the [[Donbas]] region of , supported by  military intervention as part of [[Russo- War|an undeclared war against ]].  mercenaries and military forces, with the support of local separatist militias, waged a [[War in Donbas|war in eastern ]] against the new  government after the  government fostered anti-government and [[2014 pro- unrest in |pro- protests]] in the region, although most residents had opposed secession from . Amidst [[2017–2018  protests|nationwide protests against corruption]], Putin was re-elected for his second consecutive term in the [[2018  presidential election|2018 presidential election]].

In a major escalation of the conflict,  launched a full-scale [[ invasion of |invasion of ]] on 24 February 2022. The invasion marked the largest [[conventional warfare|conventional war]] in Europe since World War&nbsp;II, and was met with [[Reactions to the 2022  invasion of |international condemnation]], as well as [[International sanctions during the 2022  invasion of |expanded sanctions]] against .

As a result,  was expelled from the [[Council of Europe]] in March, and was suspended from the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in April. In September, following successful  counteroffensives, Putin announced a "[[2022  mobilization|partial mobilisation]]", 's first mobilisation since [[Operation Barbarossa]]. In the end of September, Putin proclaimed the [[Annexation of southeastern  by the  Federation|annexation of four partially-occupied  regions]], the largest annexation in Europe since World War&nbsp;II. Putin and -installed leaders signed treaties of accession, internationally unrecognised and widely [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/4|denounced as illegal]].

However, after negotiations between Wagner and the  government, the rebellion was called off. The leader of the rebellion, [[Yevgeny Prigozhin]], was later [[2023 Wagner Group plane crash|killed in a plane crash]]. Putin won his third consecutive term in the [[2024  presidential election|2024 presidential election]], by winning 88% of the vote, the highest percentage in a presidential election in post-Soviet .

[[ colonization of the Americas|'s colonization of mainland ]] started in 1522, establishing its first permanent South  settlement in the {{As of |2008 |alt=present-day}} city of [[Cumaná]].

====  colonization ====
In the 16th century, the king of  granted a concession to the  [[Welser family]]. [[Klein-Venedig]]{{Refn|"Little Venice"; additionally the etymology of the name ""}} became the most extensive initiative in the [[ colonization of the Americas]] from 1528 to 1546. The Welsers were bankers to the Habsburgs and financiers of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]], who was King of  and had borrowed heavily from them to pay bribes for his [[Imperial election, 1519|Imperial election]].

In 1528, Charles V granted the Welsers the right to explore, rule and colonize the territory, as well as to seek the mythical golden town of [[El Dorado]]. The first expedition was led by [[Ambrosius Ehinger]], who established [[Maracaibo]] in 1529. After the deaths of first Ehinger (1533), then [[Nikolaus Federmann]], and [[Georg von Speyer]] (1540), [[Philipp von Hutten]] persisted in exploring the interior. In absence of von Hutten from the capital of the province, the crown of  claimed the right to appoint a governor. 

On Hutten's return to the capital, [[Santa Ana de Coro]], in 1546, the  governor [[Juan de Carvajal]] had Hutten and [[Bartholomeus VI. Welser]] executed. Subsequently, [[Emperor Charles V|Charles V]] revoked Welser's concession. The Welsers transported  miners to the colony, in addition to 4,000 African [[slaves]] to plant [[sugar cane]] plantations. Many  colonists died from tropical diseases, to which they had no [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]], or through wars with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous inhabitants]].

=== Late 15th century to early 17th century ===
Native ''[[cacique]]s'' (leaders) such as [[Guaicaipuro]] ({{circa|1530–1568}}) and [[Tamanaco]] (died 1573) attempted to resist  incursions, but the newcomers ultimately subdued them.

In the 16th century, during the  colonization, indigenous peoples such as the [[Mariches]], themselves descendants of the Kalina, were converted to [[Roman Catholicism]]. Some resisting tribes or leaders are commemorated in place names, including Caracas, [[Chacao Municipality|Chacao]] and [[Los Teques]]. The early colonial settlements focused on the northern coast,{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}} but in the mid-18th century, the  pushed farther inland along the [[Orinoco River]]. Here, the [[Ye'kuana]] organized resistance in 1775–76.{{sfn|Gott|2005|p=203}}

Caracas, founded in the central coastal region in 1567, was well-placed to become a key location, being near the coastal port of [[La Guaira]] and in a valley, in a mountain range, providing defensive strength against [[pirate]]s and a more fertile and healthy climate.{{sfn|Ewell|1984|p=4}}

Much of 's 19th-century history was characterized by political turmoil and dictatorial rule, including the Independence leader José Antonio Páez, who gained the presidency three times and served 11 years between 1830 and 1863. This culminated in the [[Federal War]] (1859–63). In the latter half of the century, [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]], another ''caudillo'', served 13 years, between 1870 and 1887, with three other presidents interspersed.

In 1895, a longstanding dispute with Great Britain about the Essequibo territory, which Britain claimed as part of [[ Guiana]] and  saw as  territory, erupted into the [[ Crisis of 1895]]. The dispute became a diplomatic crisis when 's lobbyist, [[William Lindsay Scruggs|William L.

Then, U.S. president [[Grover Cleveland]] adopted a broad interpretation of the doctrine that declared an  interest in any matter within the hemisphere.{{sfn|Zakaria|1999|pp=145–146}} Britain ultimately accepted arbitration, but in negotiations over its terms was able to persuade the U.S. on many details. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the issue and in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to  Guiana.

In 1899, [[Cipriano Castro]], assisted by his friend [[Juan Vicente Gómez]], seized power in Caracas.

The discovery of massive [[oil field|oil deposits]] in Lake Maracaibo during World War I proved pivotal for  and transformed its economy from a heavy dependence on agricultural exports. It prompted a boom that lasted into the 1980s; by 1935, 's per capita gross domestic product was Latin America's highest.{{sfn|Crow|1980|pp=616–617}} Gómez benefited handsomely from this, as corruption thrived, but at the same time, the new source of income helped him centralize the state and develop its authority.

Gómez remained the most powerful man in  until his death in 1935. The ''gomecista'' dictatorship (1935–1945) system largely continued under [[Eleazar López Contreras]], but from 1941, under [[Isaías Medina Angarita]], was relaxed. Angarita granted a range of reforms, including the legalization of all political parties. After World War II, immigration from Southern Europe and poorer Latin  countries markedly diversified  society.

In 1945, a civilian-military coup overthrew Medina Angarita and ushered in [[El Trienio Adeco|a period of democratic rule]] (1945–1948) under the mass membership party [[Democratic Action ()|Democratic Action]], initially under [[Rómulo Betancourt]], until [[Rómulo Gallegos]] won the [[1947  presidential election]] (the first free and fair elections in ). Gallegos governed until overthrown by a military junta led by the triumvirate {{Interlanguage link|Luis Felipe Llovera Páez|es|Luis Llovera Páez}}, [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]], and Gallegos' Defense Minister, [[Carlos Delgado Chalbaud]], in the [[1948  coup d'état|1948  ''coup d'état'']].

[[File:Carlos Andrés Pérez.jpg|thumb|upright|President [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] was [[impeached]] on corruption charges in 1993.]]
The most powerful man in the military ''junta'' (1948–58) was Pérez Jiménez and he was suspected of being behind the death of Chalbaud, who died in a bungled kidnapping in 1950. When the junta unexpectedly lost the [[1952  presidential election|1952 presidential election]], it ignored the results and Jiménez was installed as president.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}} Jiménez was forced out on 23 January 1958. In an effort to consolidate a young democracy, the three major political parties ([[Acción Democrática]] (AD), [[COPEI]] and [[Unión Republicana Democrática]] (URD), with the notable exception of the [[Communist Party of ]]), signed the [[Puntofijo Pact]] power-sharing agreement. AD and COPEI dominated the political landscape for four decades.

During the presidencies of [[Rómulo Betancourt]] (1959–64, his second term) and [[Raúl Leoni]] (1964–69), substantial guerilla movements occurred. Most laid down their arms under [[Rafael Caldera]]'s first presidency (1969–74). Caldera had won the [[1968  presidential election|1968 election]] for COPEI, the first time a party other than Democratic Action took the presidency through a democratic election. The new democratic order had its antagonists. Betancourt [[Assassination attempt of Rómulo Betancourt|suffered an attack]] planned by the  dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] in 1960, and the leftists excluded from the Pact initiated an insurgency by organizing themselves into the Armed Forces of National Liberation, sponsored by the Communist Party and [[Fidel Castro]]. In 1962 they tried to destabilize the military corps, with failed revolts. Betancourt promoted a foreign policy, the [[Betancourt Doctrine]], in which he only recognized elected governments by popular vote.{{Request quotation|date=April 2018}}

The [[1973  presidential election]] of [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] coincided with an [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], in which 's income exploded as [[oil prices]] soared; oil industries were nationalized in 1976. This led to massive increases in public spending, but also increases in external debts, until the collapse of oil prices during the 1980s crippled the economy. As the government started to devalue the currency in 1983 to face its financial obligations, standards of living fell dramatically. Failed economic policies and increasing corruption in government led to rising poverty and crime, worsening social indicators, and increased political instability.

In the 1980s, the Presidential Commission for State Reform (COPRE) emerged as a mechanism of political innovation.  decentralized its political system and diversified its economy, reducing the size of the state. COPRE operated as an innovation mechanism, also by incorporating issues into the political agenda, that were excluded from public deliberation by the main actors of the democratic system. The most discussed topics were incorporated into the public agenda: decentralization, political participation, municipalization, judicial order reforms and the role of the state in a new economic strategy. The social reality made the changes difficult to apply.

Economic crises in the 1980s and 1990s led to a political crisis. Hundreds of people were killed by security forces and the military in the ''[[Caracazo]]'' riots of 1989, during the second presidential term of Carlos Andrés Pérez (1989–1993) and after the implementation of economic austerity measures. [[Hugo Chávez]], who in 1982 had promised to depose the bipartisanship governments, used the growing anger at economic austerity measures to justify a [[1992  coup d'état attempts|coup attempt in February 1992]]; a [[November 1992  coup attempt|second coup d'état attempt occurred in November]]. 

President Carlos Andrés Pérez (re-elected in 1988) was impeached under embezzlement charges in 1993, leading to the interim presidency of [[Ramón José Velásquez]] (1993–1994). Coup leader Chávez [[Rafael Caldera#Amnesty to the 1992 coup participants|was pardoned in March 1994]] by president Rafael Caldera (1994–1999, his second term), with a clean slate and his political rights reinstated, allowing Chávez to win and maintain the presidency continuously from 1999 until his death in 2013. Chávez won the elections of 1998, 2000, 2006 and 2012 and the presidential referendum of 2004.

{{main|Bolivarian Revolution|History of  (1999–present)}}

[[File:Chavez Kirch Lula141597.jpg|thumb|[[Hugo Chávez]] with fellow leftist South  presidents [[Néstor Kirchner]] of  and [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]] of ]]
A collapse in confidence in the existing parties led to [[Hugo Chávez]] being elected president in 1998 and the subsequent launch of a "Bolivarian Revolution", beginning with a 1999 [[constituent assembly]] to write a new Constitution. The Revolution refers to a [[left-wing populism]] [[social movement]] and political process led by Chávez, who founded the [[Fifth Republic Movement]] in 1997 and the [[United Socialist Party of ]] in 2007. The "Bolivarian Revolution" is named after [[Simón Bolívar]]. 

According to Chávez and other supporters, the "Bolivarian Revolution" sought to build a mass movement to implement [[Bolivarianism]]—[[popular democracy]], economic independence, equitable distribution of revenues, and an end to political corruption. They interpret Bolívar's ideas from a [[populism|populist]] perspective, using [[Socialism|socialist]] rhetoric. This led to formation of the '''Fifth Republic of ''', commonly known as the '''Bolivarian Republic of ''', that continues to the present day.  has been considered the Bolivarian Republic following the adoption of the new [[Constitution of |Constitution of 1999]]. 

Following Chávez's election,  developed into a [[dominant-party system]], dominated by the [[United Socialist Party of ]]. In April 2002, Chávez was briefly ousted from power in the [[2002  coup d'état attempt]] following popular demonstrations by his opponents, but Chavez returned after two days as a result of demonstrations by poor Chávez supporters and actions by the military.{{sfn|Cannon|2004|p=295}}{{sfn|López Maya|2005|p=16}} Chávez remained in power after an all-out national strike that lasted [[ general strike of 2002–2003|from December 2002 to February 2003]], including a strike/lockout in the state oil company [[PDVSA]]. 

[[Capital flight]] before and during the strike led to the reimposition of [[Foreign exchange controls|currency control]]s. In the subsequent decade, the government was forced into currency devaluations. These devaluations did not improve the situation{{Vague|date=August 2024}} of the people who rely on imported products or locally produced products that depend on imported inputs, while dollar-denominated oil sales account for the majority of exports. The profits of the oil industry were lost to "social engineering" and corruption, instead of investments needed to maintain oil production.

Chávez survived further political tests, including an [[2004  recall referendum|August 2004 recall referendum]]. He was elected for another term [[2006  presidential election|in December 2006]] and for a third term in October 2012. However, he was never sworn in due to medical complications; he died in March 2013.

{{further|Crisis in }}
The presidential election that took place in April 2013, was the first since Chávez took office in 1999 in which his name did not appear on the ballot.{{Self-published inline|date=October 2022}}
Under the Bolivarian government,  went from being one of the richest countries in Latin America to one of the poorest. [[Economic policy of the Hugo Chávez administration|Hugo Chávez's socioeconomic policies]] of relying on oil sales and importing goods resulted in large amounts of debt, no change to [[corruption in ]] and culminated into a [[crisis in ]]. As a result, the [[ refugee crisis]], the largest emigration of people in Latin America's history, occurred, with over 7 million – about 20% of the country's population – emigrating. Chávez initiated [[Bolivarian missions]], programs aimed at helping the poor.

Poverty began to increase into the 2010s. [[Nicolás Maduro]] was picked by Chavez as his successor, appointing him vice president in 2013.

Maduro has been [[president of ]] since 14 April 2013, when he won the [[2013  presidential election|presidential election]] after Chavez' death, with 51% of the vote, against [[Henrique Capriles]] on 49%. The [[Democratic Unity Roundtable]] contested Maduro's election as fraud, but an audit of 56% of the vote showed no discrepancies, and the [[Supreme Court of ]] ruled Maduro was the legitimate president. Opposition leaders and some international media consider Maduro's government a dictatorship. 

Since February 2014, hundreds of thousands have protested over high levels of criminal violence, corruption, hyperinflation, and chronic scarcity of basic goods due to government policies. Demonstrations and riots have resulted in over 40 fatalities in the unrest between Chavistas and opposition protesters and opposition leaders, including [[Leopoldo López]] and [[Antonio Ledezma]] were arrested. Human rights groups condemned the arrest of López. In the [[2015  parliamentary election]], the opposition gained a majority.

 devalued its currency in February 2013 due to rising shortages, [[shortages in |which included]] milk and other necessities. This led to an increase in malnutrition, especially among children. The economy had become dependent on the exportation of oil, with crude accounting for 86% of exports, and a high price per barrel to support social programs. Beginning in 2014 the [[price of oil]] plummeted from over $100 to $40. This placed pressure on the economy, which was no longer able to afford vast social programs. The Government began taking more money from [[PDVSA]], the state oil company, resulting in a lack of reinvestment in fields and employees. Production decreased from its height of nearly {{convert|3|to|1|e6oilbbl|e3m3|abbr=off|lk=on}} per day. 

In 2014,  entered a [[recession]], and in 2015, had the world's highest inflation, surpassing 100%. In 2017, [[Donald Trump]]'s administration imposed more [[economic sanctions]] against PDVSA and  officials. Economic problems, as well as crime, were the causes of the [[ protests (2014–present)|2014–present  protests]]. Since 2014, roughly 5.6 million people have [[ refugee crisis|fled ]].

In January 2016, Maduro decreed an "economic emergency", revealing the extent of the crisis and expanding his powers. In July 2016,  border crossings were temporarily opened to allow  to purchase food and basic health items. In September 2016, a study indicated 15% of  were eating "[[food waste]] discarded by commercial establishments". 200 prison riots had occurred by October 2016.

The Maduro-aligned [[Supreme Tribunal of Justice ()|Supreme Tribunal]], which had been overturning [[National Assembly ()|National Assembly]] decisions since the opposition took control, took over the functions of the assembly, creating the [[2017  constitutional crisis]]. In August 2017, the [[2017 Constituent National Assembly]] was elected and stripped the National Assembly of its powers.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} The election raised concerns of an emerging dictatorship. In December 2017, Maduro declared opposition parties barred from the following year's presidential vote after they boycotted mayoral polls.

Maduro won the [[2018  presidential election|2018 election]] with 68% of the vote. The result was challenged by , , , , , ,  and the US who deemed it fraudulent and recognized [[Juan Guaidó]] as president. Other countries continued to recognize Maduro, although , facing financial pressure over its position, began hedging by decreasing loans, cancelling joint ventures, and signaling willingness to work with all parties. In August 2019, Trump imposed an economic embargo against . In March 2020, Trump indicted Maduro and  officials, on charges of drug trafficking, [[narcoterrorism]], and corruption.

In June 2020, a report documented [[enforced disappearance]]s that occurred in 2018–19. 724 enforced disappearances of [[Political prisoner|political detainees]] were reported. The report stated that security forces subjected victims to [[Torture in |torture]]. The report stated the government used enforced disappearances to silence opponents and other critical voices.

[[Nicolás Maduro|Maduro]] ran for a third consecutive term in the [[2024  presidential election|2024 presidential election]], while former diplomat [[Edmundo González Urrutia]] represented the [[Unitary Platform]] ({{langx|es|Plataforma Unitaria Democrática}}; PUD), the main opposition political alliance. Polls conducted before the election indicated that González would win by a wide margin. After the government-controlled [[National Electoral Council ()|National Electoral Council]] (CNE) announced partial results showing a narrow Maduro victory on 29 July, [[International reactions to the 2024  presidential election|world leaders predominantly expressed skepticism of the claimed results]] and did not recognize the CNE claims with only some exceptions. 

Both González and Maduro proclaimed themselves winners of the election. The results of the election were not recognized by the [[Carter Center]] and [[Organization of  States]] due to the lack of granular results, and disputed by the opposition, which claimed a landslide victory and released access to vote tallies collected by [[poll watchers]] from a majority of polling centers as proof.

In the [[2024  presidential election#Aftermath|aftermath]] of the announcement of results by the election authorities, [[2024  protests|protests broke out across the country]].

The [[Mayflower Compact]] in Massachusetts and the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]] established precedents for local representative [[self-governance]] and [[constitutionalism]] that would develop throughout the  colonies.

To demonstrate their dissatisfaction and resolve, the [[First Continental Congress]] met in 1774 and passed the [[Continental Association]], a colonial boycott of  goods enforced by local "[[Committee of safety ( Revolution)|committees of safety]]" that proved effective. The  attempt to then disarm the colonists resulted in the 1775 [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], igniting the [[ Revolutionary War]]. At the [[Second Continental Congress]], the colonies appointed [[George Washington]] commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]], and created [[Committee of Five|a committee]] that named [[Thomas Jefferson]] to draft the [[ Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Two days after passing the [[Lee Resolution]] to create an independent nation the Declaration was adopted on July 4, 1776.

In the late 18th century,  settlers began to [[Territorial evolution of the |expand westward]] in larger numbers, many with a sense of [[manifest destiny]].{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=41–46}} The [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803 from  nearly doubled the territory of the . [[Origins of the War of 1812|Lingering issues with Britain remained]], leading to the [[War of 1812]], which was fought to a draw. [[Adams–Onís Treaty| ceded Florida]] and its Gulf Coast territory in 1819.

The [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820, which admitted [[Missouri]] as a [[Slave states and free states|slave state]] and [[Maine#Statehood|Maine]] as a free state, attempted to balance the desire of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery into new territories with that of southern states to extend it there. Primarily, the compromise prohibited slavery in all other lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the [[parallel 36°30′ north|36°30′ parallel]].

As  expanded further into territory inhabited by Native , the [[Federal  Policy|federal government implemented policies]] of [[ removal]] or [[Cultural assimilation of Native |assimilation]]. The most significant such legislation was the [[ Removal Act| Removal Act of 1830]], a key policy of President [[Andrew Jackson]]. It resulted in the [[Trail of Tears]] (1830–1850), in which an estimated 60,000 Native  living east of the [[Mississippi River]] were forcibly removed and displaced to lands far to the west, causing 13,200 to 16,700 deaths along the forced march.{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=45}} Settler expansion as well as this influx of Indigenous peoples from the East resulted in the [[  Wars]] west of the Mississippi.

During the colonial period, [[Slavery in the colonial history of the |slavery became legal in all the Thirteen colonies]], but by 1770 it provided the main labor force in the [[Plantation complexes in the Southern |large-scale]], [[Antebellum South#Economic structure|agriculture-dependent economies]] of the [[Southern Colonies]] from Maryland to . The practice began to be significantly questioned during the  Revolution, {{sfnm|1a1=Walker Howe|1y=2007|1p=52–54|2a1=Wright|2y=2022}} and spurred by an active [[abolitionism in the |abolitionist movement]] that had reemerged in the 1830s, states in [[Northern |the North]] enacted laws to prohibit slavery within their boundaries.{{sfnm|1a1=Walker Howe|1y=2007|1p=52–54|2a1=Rodriguez|2y=2015|2p=XXXIV|3a1=Wright|3y=2022}} At the same time, [[Pro-slavery ideology in the |support for slavery had strengthened in Southern states]], with widespread use of inventions such as the [[cotton gin]] (1793) having made slavery immensely profitable for [[Planter class|Southern elites]].{{sfn|Walker Howe|2007|p=478, 481–482, 587–588}} 

The  [[Texas annexation|annexed the Republic of Texas]] in 1845, and the 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]] led to U.S. control of the present-day [[Northwestern | Northwest]]. Dispute with  over Texas led to the [[– War]] (1846&ndash;1848). After the victory of the U.S.,  recognized U.S. sovereignty over Texas, [[New ]], and [[California]] in the 1848 [[ Cession]]; the cession's lands also included the future states of [[Nevada]], [[Colorado]] and [[Utah]]. The [[California gold rush]] of 1848–1849 spurred a huge migration of white settlers to the Pacific coast, leading to even more confrontations with Native populations. One of the most violent, the [[California genocide]] of thousands of Native inhabitants, lasted into the mid-1870s. Additional western territories and states were created.

[[File:US SlaveFree1858.gif|thumb|upright=1.3|left|[[Slave states and free states]] in 1858]]

Throughout the 1850s, the [[Slave states and free states|sectional conflict regarding slavery]] was further inflamed by national legislation in the U.S. Congress and decisions of the Supreme Court. In Congress, the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] mandated the forcible return to their owners in the South of slaves taking refuge in non-slave states, while the [[Kansas&ndash;Nebraska Act]] of 1854 effectively gutted the anti-slavery requirements of the Missouri Compromise. In its [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott decision]] of 1857, the Supreme Court ruled against a slave brought into non-slave territory, simultaneously declaring the entire Missouri Compromise to be unconstitutional. These and other [[Origins of the  Civil War|events exacerbated tensions between North and South]] that would culminate in the [[ Civil War]] (1861–1865).

Beginning with [[South Carolina]], 11 slave-state governments voted to [[Secession in the |secede from the ]] in 1861, joining to create the [[Confederate States of America]]. All other state governments remained loyal to [[Union ( Civil War)|the Union]].{{efn|The Confederate States of America was formed by the following states, each state government of which formally declared its [[Secession in the |secession]] from the : [[South Carolina in the  Civil War|South Carolina]], [[Mississippi in the  Civil War|Mississippi]], [[Florida in the  Civil War|Florida]], [[Alabama in the  Civil War|Alabama]], [[ in the  Civil War|]], [[Louisiana in the  Civil War|Louisiana]], [[Texas in the  Civil War|Texas]], [[Virginia in the  Civil War|Virginia]], [[Arkansas in the  Civil War|Arkansas]], [[Tennessee in the  Civil War|Tennessee]], and [[North Carolina in the  Civil War|North Carolina]].}}{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=236}} War broke out in April 1861 after the Confederacy [[Battle of Fort Sumter|bombarded Fort Sumter]].{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=273–274}} Following the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on January 1, 1863, many freed slaves joined the [[Union army]]. The war [[Turning point of the  Civil War|began to turn in the Union's favor]] following the 1863 [[Siege of Vicksburg]] and [[Battle of Gettysburg]], and the Confederates surrendered in 1865 after the Union's victory in the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House]].

=== Reconstruction, Gilded Age, and Progressive Era (1863&ndash;1917) ===

Efforts toward [[Reconstruction era|reconstruction in the secessionist South]] had begun as early as 1862,{{sfn|Dubois|1935|p=163}} but it was only after [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln's assassination]] that the three [[Reconstruction Amendments]] to the Constitution were ratified [[Civil rights movement (1865–1896)|to protect civil rights]]. The amendments codified nationally the abolition of slavery and involuntary servitude except as punishment for crimes, promised equal protection under the law for all persons, and prohibited discrimination on the basis of race or previous enslavement.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=66-7, 251-261, 446-449}} As a result, African  took an active political role in ex-Confederate states in the decade following the Civil War.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=xxv}}{{sfn|Dubois|1935|p=381-727}} The former Confederate states were readmitted to the Union, beginning with Tennessee in 1866 and ending with  in 1870.

National infrastructure, including [[First transcontinental telegraph|transcontinental telegraph]] and [[First transcontinental railroad|railroads]], spurred growth in the [[ frontier]]. This was accelerated by the [[Homestead Acts]], through which nearly 10 percent of the total land area of the  was given away free to some 1.6 million homesteaders. From 1865 through 1917, an unprecedented stream of [[immigrants]] arrived in the , including 24.4 million from Europe. Most came through the [[Port of New York and New Jersey|Port of New York]], and New York City and other large cities on the [[East Coast of the |East Coast]] became home to large [[History of the Jews in the |Jewish]], [[ |]], and [[ |]] populations. Many [[Northern Europe|Northern Europeans]] as well as significant numbers of [[ |]] and other [[Central Europe|Central Europeans]] moved to the [[Midwestern |Midwest]]. At the same time, about one million [[- | ]] migrated from [[Quebec]] to [[New England]]. During the [[Great Migration (African )|Great Migration]], millions of African  [[Jim Crow economy|left the rural South]] for urban areas in the North. [[Alaska Purchase|Alaska was purchased]] from [[ Empire|]] in 1867.

The [[Compromise of 1877]] is generally considered the end of the Reconstruction era, as it resolved the electoral crisis following the [[1876  presidential election|1876 presidential election]] and led President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] to reduce the role of federal troops in the South.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=xxvii, 575-587}} Immediately, the [[Redeemers]] began evicting the [[Carpetbaggers]] and quickly regained local control of Southern politics in the name of [[white supremacy]]. African  endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the [[nadir of  race relations]]. A series of Supreme Court decisions, including ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', emptied the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the  Constitution|Fourteenth]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the  Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]s of their force, allowing [[Jim Crow laws]] in the South to remain unchecked, [[sundown town]]s in the Midwest, and [[Racial segregation in the |segregation in communities across the country]], which would be reinforced by the policy of [[redlining]] later adopted by the federal [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]].

[[Second Industrial Revolution|An explosion of technological advancement]] accompanied by the exploitation of cheap immigrant labor led to [[Gilded Age|rapid economic expansion during the late 19th and early 20th centuries]], allowing the  to outpace the economies of England, , and  combined. This fostered the amassing of power by [[Robber baron (industrialist)|a few prominent industrialists]], largely by their formation of [[Trust (business)|trusts]] and [[Monopoly|monopolies]] to prevent competition.

The end of [[World War II]] in 1945 left the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union]] as [[superpower]]s, each with its own political, military, and economic [[sphere of influence]]. Geopolitical tensions between the two superpowers soon led to the [[Cold War]].

The [[Great Society]] plan of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s administration resulted in groundbreaking and broad-reaching laws, policies and [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the  Constitution|a constitutional amendment]] to counteract some of the worst effects of lingering [[institutional racism]].

The [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture movement]] in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes toward [[recreational drug use]] and [[Sexual revolution|sexuality]]. It also encouraged [[Draft evasion in the  War|open defiance of the military draft]] (leading to the [[Conscription in the |end of conscription]] in 1973) and [[Opposition to  involvement in the  War|wide opposition]] to [[ in the  War|U.S. intervention in ]], with the U.S. totally withdrawing in 1975. [[Women's liberation movement in the |A societal shift in the roles of women]] was significantly responsible for the large increase in female paid labor participation during the 1970s, and by 1985 the majority of  women aged 16 and older were employed.

The [[Revolutions of 1989|Fall of Communism]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] from 1989 to 1991 marked the [[end of the Cold War]] and [[Superpower#After the Cold War|left the  as the world's sole superpower]].

===Pre-Columbian era===
Humans first settled  around 6,000 years ago, descending from migrations from northern South America or Central America. The arrival of humans on  is associated with extinctions of the islands native fauna, particularly its [[Megalocnidae|endemic sloths]]. The [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]]-speaking ancestors of the [[Taíno]] people arrived in the Caribbean in a separate migration from South America around 1,700 years ago. Unlike the previous settlers of , the Taíno extensively produced pottery and engaged in intensive agriculture. The earliest evidence of the Taíno people on  dates to the 9th century. Descendants of the first settlers of  persisted on the western part of the island until Columbian contact, where they were recorded as the [[Guanahatabey]] people, who lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

After first landing on an island then called [[Guanahani]] on 12 October 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on  on 27 October 1492 and on the island's northeastern coast on 28 October. Columbus claimed the island for the new [[Habsburg |Kingdom of ]] and named it ''Isla Juana'' ("John's Island") after [[John, Prince of Asturias]].

[[File:DiegoVelazquezCuellar.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]], [[conquistador]] of ]]

In 1511, the first [[ colonization of the Americas| settlement]] was founded by [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] at [[Baracoa]]. Other settlements soon followed, including [[Havana|San Cristobal de la Habana]], founded in 1514 (southern coast of the island) and then in 1519 (current place), which later became the capital (1607). The indigenous Taíno individuals were forced to work under the ''[[encomienda]]'' system, which resembled the [[Feudalism|feudal system]] in medieval Europe. Within a century, the [[indigenous people]] faced high incidence of mortality due to multiple factors—primarily [[Eurasia]]n [[infectious diseases]] to which they had no [[acquired immunity]], aggravated by the harsh conditions of the repressive colonial subjugation. In 1529, a [[measles]] outbreak killed two-thirds of those few indigenous individuals who had previously survived [[smallpox]].

On 18 May 1539, [[conquistador]] [[Hernando de Soto]] departed from Havana with some 600 followers on an extensive expedition through the [[Southeastern ]] in search of gold, treasure, fame, and power.

By 1570, most residents of  had a mixture of , African, and Taíno heritages.  developed slowly and, unlike the plantation islands of the Caribbean, had a diversified agriculture. Most importantly, the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported the  colonial empire. By the mid-18th century, there were 50,000 slaves on the island. Estimates suggest that between 1790 and 1820, some 325,000 Africans were imported to  as slaves, which was four times the amount that had arrived between 1760 and 1790.

In 1812, the [[Aponte conspiracy|Aponte slave rebellion]] took place, but it was ultimately suppressed. The population of  in 1817 was 630,980 (of which 291,021 were white, 115,691 were [[free people of color]] (mixed-race), and 224,268 black slaves).{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=352}} The population in 1841 was 1,007,624, of whom 425,521 were black slaves, 418,291 were white.

In part due to  slaves working primarily in urbanized settings, by the 19th century, the practice of {{Lang|es|coartacion}} had developed (or "buying oneself out of slavery", a "uniquely  development"), according to historian [[Herbert S. Klein]]. Due to a shortage of white labor, blacks dominated urban industries "to such an extent that when whites in large numbers came to  in the middle of the nineteenth century, they were unable to displace Negro workers." A system of diversified agriculture, with small farms and fewer slaves, served to supply the cities with produce and other goods.

Around 200,000  troops outnumbered the much smaller rebel army, which relied mostly on [[Guerilla warfare|guerrilla]] and [[sabotage]] tactics. The Spaniards began a campaign of suppression. General [[Valeriano Weyler]], the military governor of , herded the rural population into what he called {{Lang|es|reconcentrados}}, described by international observers as "fortified towns".

In 1908, self-government was restored when [[José Miguel Gómez]] was elected president, but the U.S. continued intervening in  affairs. In 1912, the [[Partido Independiente de Color]] attempted to establish a separate [[Black separatism|black republic]] in [[Oriente Province]], but was suppressed by General Monteagudo with considerable bloodshed.

In 1924, [[Gerardo Machado]] was elected president. During his administration, tourism increased markedly, and -owned hotels and restaurants were built to accommodate the influx of tourists. The tourist boom led to increases in gambling and [[prostitution in ]]. The [[Wall Street crash of 1929]] led to a collapse in the price of sugar, political unrest, and repression. Protesting students, known as the Generation of 1930, turned to violence in opposition to the increasingly unpopular Machado. A general strike (in which the Communist Party sided with Machado), uprisings among sugar workers, and an army revolt forced Machado into exile in August 1933. He was replaced by [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada]].

====Revolution of 1933–1940====
{{Main| Revolution of 1933}}
[[File:1933-Pentarchy w Batista.jpg|thumb|The [[Pentarchy of 1933]]. [[Fulgencio Batista]], who controlled the armed forces, appears at far right]]
In September 1933, the [[Sergeants' Revolt]], led by Sergeant [[Fulgencio Batista]], overthrew Céspedes. A five-member executive committee (the [[Pentarchy of 1933]]) was chosen to head a provisional government. [[Ramón Grau San Martín]] was then appointed as provisional president. Grau resigned in 1934, leaving the way clear for Batista, who dominated  politics for the next 25 years, at first through a series of puppet-presidents. The period from 1933 to 1937 was a time of "virtually unremitting social and political warfare". On balance, during the period 1933–1940,  suffered from fragile political structures, reflected in the fact that it saw three different presidents in two years (1935–1936), and in the militaristic and repressive policies of Batista as head of the army.

==== Constitution of 1940 ====
{{Main|1940 Constitution of }}
A [[1940 Constitution of |new constitution]] was adopted in 1940 that engineered radically progressive ideas, including the right to labor and health care.{{sfn|Domínguez|1978|p={{page needed|date=December 2023}}}} Batista was elected president in the same year, holding the post until 1944. He is, as of 2004, the only non-white  to win the nation's highest political office. His government carried out major social reforms. Several members of the [[Communist Party of |Communist Party]] held office under his administration.{{sfn|Sweig|2004|p={{page needed|date=December 2023}}}}  armed forces were not greatly involved in combat during World War&nbsp;II—though president Batista did suggest a joint U.S.-Latin  assault on [[ State|Francoist ]] to overthrow its authoritarian regime.  lost six merchant ships during the war, and the  Navy was credited with sinking the {{GS|U-176}}.

Batista adhered to the 1940 constitution's strictures preventing his re-election. Ramon Grau San Martin was the winner of the next election, in 1944. Grau further corroded the base of the already teetering legitimacy of the  political system, particularly by undermining the deeply flawed—though not entirely ineffectual—Congress and Supreme Court. [[Carlos Prío Socarrás]], a protégé of Grau, became president in 1948. The two terms of the [[Auténtico Party]] brought an influx of investment, which fueled an economic boom, raised living standards for all segments of society, and created a middle class in most urban areas.

==== Batista regime ====
{{Main|1952  coup d'état| Revolution}}
[[File:HavanaSlums1954.jpg|thumb|right|[[Slum]] (''bohío'') dwellings in Havana,  in 1954, just outside [[Estadio Latinoamericano|Havana baseball stadium]]. In the background is advertising for a nearby [[casino]].]]
After finishing his term in 1944, Batista lived in Florida, returning to  to run for president in 1952. Facing inevitable electoral defeat, he led a [[1952  coup d'état|military coup]] that preempted the election. Back in power, and receiving financial, military, and logistical support from the  government, Batista suspended the 1940 constitution and revoked most political liberties, including the [[Strike action|right to strike]]. He then aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantations]], and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor . Batista outlawed the  Communist Party in 1952. After the coup,  had Latin America's highest per capita consumption rates of meat, vegetables, cereals, automobiles, telephones and radios, though about one-third of the population was considered poor and enjoyed relatively little of this consumption. However, in his "[[History Will Absolve Me]]" speech, Fidel Castro mentioned that national issues relating to land, industrialization, housing, unemployment, education, and health were contemporary problems.

In 1958,  was a well-advanced country compared to other Latin  regions.  was also affected by perhaps Latin America's largest labor union privileges, including bans on dismissals and mechanization. They were obtained in large measure "at the cost of the unemployed and the peasants", leading to disparities. Between 1933 and 1958,  extended economic regulations enormously, causing economic problems. Unemployment became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs. The middle class, which was comparable to that of the {{How|date=February 2022}}, became increasingly dissatisfied with unemployment and political persecution. The labor unions, manipulated by the previous government since 1948 through union "yellowness", supported Batista until the very end. Batista stayed in power until he resigned in December 1958 under the pressure of the US Embassy and as the revolutionary forces headed by Fidel Castro were winning militarily (Santa Clara city, a strategic point in the middle of the country, fell into the rebels hands on 31 December, in a conflict known as the [[Battle of Santa Clara]]).

In the 1950s, various organizations, including some advocating armed uprising, competed for public support in bringing about political change. In 1956, [[Fidel Castro]] and about 80 supporters landed from the yacht [[Granma (yacht)|''Granma'']] in an attempt to start a rebellion against the Batista government. In 1958, Castro's [[July 26th Movement]] emerged as the leading revolutionary group. The U.S. supported Castro by imposing a 1958 [[ embargo against |arms embargo]] against Batista's government. Batista evaded the  embargo and acquired weapons from the .

By late 1958, the rebels had broken out of the [[Sierra Maestra]] and launched a general [[ Revolution|popular insurrection]]. After Castro's fighters captured [[Santa Clara, |Santa Clara]], Batista fled to the  on 1 January 1959 with his family. Later, he went into exile on the  island of Madeira and finally settled in Estoril, near Lisbon. Fidel Castro's forces entered the capital on 8 January 1959. The liberal [[Manuel Urrutia Lleó]] became the provisional president.{{sfn|Falk|1988|p=67}}

Before the revolution, U.S. and other foreign investors dominated the  economy, controlling 75% of arable land, 90% of essential services, and 40% of sugar production. One of the goals of Castro's revolution was to achieve economic independence, but  instead became heavily dependent on Soviet subsidies, with additional economic aid provided by Eastern European countries through [[COMECON]].

Militant anti-Castro groups, funded by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and [[Rafael Trujillo]], carried out armed attacks and set up guerrilla bases in 's mountainous regions. This led to the unsuccessful [[Escambray rebellion]] (1959–65), which lasted longer and involved more soldiers than the  Revolution.

===Revolutionary government (1959–present)===
====Consolidation and nationalization (1959–1970)====
{{Main|Consolidation of the  Revolution|Revolutionary Offensive}}
[[File:CheyFidel.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Che Guevara]] and [[Fidel Castro]], photographed by [[Alberto Korda]] in 1961]]
The  government initially reacted favorably to the  Revolution, seeing it as part of a movement to bring democracy to Latin America. Castro's legalization of the Communist Party and the hundreds of executions of Batista agents, policemen, and soldiers that followed caused a deterioration in the relationship between the two countries. The promulgation of the [[Agrarian reforms in |Agrarian Reform Law]], expropriating thousands of acres of farmland (including from large U.S. landholders), further worsened relations. In response, between 1960 and 1964 the U.S. imposed a range of sanctions, eventually including a total ban on trade between the countries and a freeze on all -owned assets in the U.S. In February 1960, Castro signed a commercial agreement with Soviet Vice-Premier [[Anastas Mikoyan]].
[[File:Brigadistas capturados na Baía dos Porcos 1961.jpg|thumb|Brigade 2506 prisoners, 1961]]
In March 1960, U.S. president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] gave his approval to a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] plan to arm and train a group of  refugees to overthrow the Castro government. The CIA provided B-26 light bombers and ships to the rebels for the invasion. On 15 April 1961 at dawn, [[Brigade 2506]] flew from Puerto Cabezas, , and carried out preemptive airstrikes on  military airfields at San Antonio de Los Baños, Ciudad Libertad, Pinar del Río, and Santiago de , destroying five aircraft and damaging an indeterminable number.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=247}} The invasion (known as the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]]) took place on 17 April 1961, during the term of President [[John F. Kennedy]]. About 1,400  exiles disembarked at the [[Bay of Pigs]].  troops and local militias defeated the invasion by 19 April, killing over 100 invaders and taking the remainder prisoner. Five rebel B-26s were shot down by the  air force, and one was downed by anti-aircraft fire.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=250}} In January 1962,  was suspended from the [[Organization of  States]] (OAS), and later the same year the OAS started to impose sanctions against  of similar nature to the U.S. sanctions. The failed amphibious assault on  contributed to the Soviet decision to deploy [[R-12 Dvina|R-12]] missiles there,{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=253}} and the ensuing [[ Missile Crisis]] of October 1962 almost sparked [[World War III# Missile Crisis: 15–29 October 1962|World War III]]. In 1962,  generals proposed [[Operation Northwoods]] which would entail committing terrorist attacks in  cities and against refugees and falsely blaming the attacks on the  government, manufacturing a reason for the  to invade . This plan was rejected by President Kennedy. By 1963,  was moving towards a full-fledged [[communist state]] system modeled on the USSR.
[[File:Guantanamo Naval Base aerial photo 1962.jpg|thumb|Since 1959,  has regarded the U.S. presence in [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantánamo Bay]] as illegal.]]
[[Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo]] founded the anti-Castro group [[Alpha 66]] in the early 1960s, which used small craft to attack  and Soviet merchant ships, killing or wounding crew members. In 1964, Menoyo set up a guerrilla training camp in the , and after entering  in 1965, he was captured; however, Alpha 66 continued its raids under new leadership.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=251}} By the mid-1960s, Soviet aid had strengthened the  air force and navy, making raids against the island by  dissidents costly without significant U.S. support.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=254}}

In 1963,  sent 686 troops together with 22 tanks and other military equipment to support  in the [[Sand War]] against . The  forces remained in  for over a year, providing training to the  army. [[Che Guevara]], authorized by Fidel Castro, engaged in [[Simba rebellion|guerrilla activities in Africa]] and was killed in 1967 while attempting to start a [[Ñancahuazú Guerrilla|revolution in ]]. By the middle of 1965,  had begun supplying arms to the [[People's Movement for the Liberation of ]] (MPLA). In 1966,  aid also reached the [[African Party for the Independence of  and ]]. Furthermore, by the late 1960s,  instructors were providing military training to members of the [[ Liberation Front]].  troops prevented the [[1966  coup attempt]]. The coup collapsed when the  army refused to engage in combat against the . In February 1967,  advisors began operating with guerrillas in the [[-Bissau War of Independence]], and in November 1969, the  captured  Captain Pedro Rodriguez Peralta.

Starting in 1968, a campaign titled the "revolutionary offensive" was initiated to nationalize all remaining private small businesses, totaling about 58,000 small enterprises. The campaign would spur industrialization in  and focus the economy on sugar production, specifically to a deadline for an annual sugar harvest of 10 million tons by 1970. The economic focus on sugar production involved international volunteers and the mobilization of workers from all sectors of the  economy. Economic mobilization also coincided with greater militarization of  political structures and society in general. The ten million ton harvest goal was not reached.{{Rp|pages=37–38}} The  economy fell into decline after large sectors of the economy were neglected when large amounts of urban labor mobilized to the countryside.{{Rp|page=38}}

The standard of living in the 1970s was "extremely spartan," and discontent was rife. Fidel Castro admitted the failures of economic policies in a 1970 speech. In 1975, the OAS lifted its sanctions against , with the approval of 16 member states, including the . The U.S., however, maintained its own sanctions.

According to [[Amnesty International]], official death sentences from 1959 to 1987 numbered 237, of which all but 21 were carried out. The vast majority of those executed directly following the 1959 Revolution were policemen, politicians, and informers of the Batista regime accused of crimes such as torture and murder, and their public trials and executions had widespread popular support among the  population.

====Foreign interventions (1971–1991)====
{{Main|Foreign interventions by }}
[[File: in Ogaden1.JPG|thumb| artillery crew in [[]] during the [[Ogaden War]].]]
During the Cold War,  received $33 billion in Soviet aid, and  forces were deployed to all corners of Africa, either as military advisors or as combatants. Soviet pilots and technicians assumed defense duties in , freeing up  personnel to be deployed in Africa. In 1979, the U.S. objected to the presence of [[Soviet Army|Soviet combat troops]] on the island.

In November 1975,  deployed more than 65,000 troops and 400 Soviet-made tanks in  in one of the fastest military mobilizations in history.  developed nuclear weapons due to the threat to its security posed by the presence of large numbers of [[ intervention in | troops in ]]. In 1975–76 and again in 1988 at the [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]], the  alongside their MPLA allies fought [[UNITA]] rebels and [[apartheid]]  forces. In December 1977,  sent its combat troops from , the People's , and the Caribbean to , assisted by mechanized Soviet battalions, to help defeat a  invasion. On 24 January 1978,  and  troops counterattacked, inflicting 3,000 casualties on the  forces. In February,  troops launched a major offensive and forced the  army back into its own territory.  forces remained in  until September 1989.

Despite 's small size and the long distance separating it from the Middle East, Castro's  played an active role in the region during the Cold War. In 1972, a major  military mission consisting of tank, air, and artillery specialists was dispatched to [[South ]].  military advisors were sent to [[]] in the mid-1970s, but their mission was canceled after  invaded  in 1980. The  were also involved in the - conflict (November 1973–May 1974) that followed the [[Yom Kippur War]] (October 1973).  sources reported the presence of a  tank brigade in the [[Golan Heights]], which was supported by two brigades. The  and the - tank forces engaged in battle on the Golan front.{{rp|37–38}}

After the U.S. was defeated in the [[ War]], Castro began supporting Marxist insurgencies in [[ Civil War|]], [[ Civil War|]], [[ Revolution|]], and [[ conflict|]] by supplying weapons, munitions, and training.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=339}} Following the 1983 coup that resulted in the execution of  Prime Minister [[Maurice Bishop]] and establishment of the military government led by [[Hudson Austin]], [[ invasion of |U.S. forces invaded]]  in 1983, overthrowing the pro-Castro government. In a few days of fighting, 6,000  combat troops defeated 784  (636 construction workers with military training, 43 military advisors, and 18 diplomats).{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=358}}

 gradually withdrew its troops from  in 1989–91. An important psychological and political aspect of the  military involvement in Africa was the significant presence of black or mixed-race soldiers among the  forces. According to one source, more than 300,000  military personnel and civilian experts were deployed in Africa. The source also states that out of the 50,000  sent to , half contracted AIDS, and that 10,000  died as a consequence of their military actions in Africa.

====Political readjustments (1991–present)====
{{Main|Special Period|2006–2008  transfer of presidential duties}}
Soviet troops began to withdraw from  in September 1991, and Castro's rule was severely tested in the aftermath of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet collapse in December 1991]] (known in  as the [[Special Period]]). The country faced a severe economic downturn following the withdrawal of Soviet subsidies worth {{Nowrap|$4 billion}} to {{Nowrap|$6 billion}} annually, resulting in effects such as food and fuel shortages. The government did not accept  donations of food, medicines and cash until 1993. On 5 August 1994, state security dispersed protesters in a [[Maleconazo|spontaneous protest]] in Havana. From the start of the crisis until 1995,  saw its gross domestic product (GDP) shrink by 35%. It took another five years for its GDP to reach pre-crisis levels.{{sfn|Gershman|Gutierrez|2009|p={{page needed|date=December 2023}}}} In 1996, after  fighter jets [[1996 shootdown of Brothers to the Rescue aircraft|shot down]] two small aircraft piloted by a Florida-based anti-Castro group, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Helms–Burton Act]].

 has since found a new source of aid and support in the People's Republic of . In addition, [[Hugo Chávez]], then [[president of ]], and [[Evo Morales]], former [[president of ]], became allies, and both countries are major oil and gas exporters. In 2003, the government arrested and imprisoned a large number of civil activists, a period known as the [[Black Spring ()|"Black Spring"]].

In February 2008, Fidel Castro resigned as President of the State Council due to the serious gastrointestinal illness that he had suffered since July 2006. On 24 February, the [[National Assembly of People's Power|National Assembly]] elected his brother [[Raúl Castro]] the new president. In his inauguration speech, Raúl promised that some of the restrictions on freedom in  would be removed. In March 2009, Raúl Castro [[2009  government dismissals|removed some of his brother's appointees]].

On 3 June 2009, the [[Organization of  States]] adopted a resolution to end the 47-year ban on  membership of the group. The resolution stated, however, that full membership would be delayed until  was "in conformity with the practices, purposes, and principles of the OAS". Fidel Castro wrote that  would not rejoin the OAS, which, he said, was a "U.S. Trojan horse" and "complicit" in actions taken by the U.S. against  and other Latin  nations.

Effective 14 January 2013,  ended the requirement established in 1961 that any citizens who wished to travel abroad were required to obtain an expensive government permit and a letter of invitation. In 1961 the  government had imposed broad restrictions on travel to prevent the mass emigration of people after the 1959 revolution; it approved exit visas only on rare occasions. Requirements were simplified:  need only a passport and a national ID card to leave; and they are allowed to take their young children with them for the first time. However, a passport costs on average five months' salary. Observers expect that  with paying relatives abroad are most likely to be able to take advantage of the new policy. In the first year of the program, over 180,000 left  and returned.
{{as of|2014|December|}}, talks with  officials and  officials, including President [[Barack Obama]], resulted in the release of [[Alan Gross]], fifty-two political prisoners, and an unnamed non-citizen agent of the  in return for the release of three  agents currently imprisoned in the . Additionally, while the embargo between the  and  was not immediately lifted, it was relaxed to allow import, export, and certain limited commerce.

Raúl Castro stepped down from the presidency on 19 April 2018, and [[Miguel Díaz-Canel]] was elected president of the State Council by the National Assembly following [[2018  parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]]. Raúl Castro remained the [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of |First Secretary of the Communist Party]] and retained broad authority, including oversight over the president.

 approved a new constitution in 2019. The optional vote attracted 84.4% of eligible voters. 90% of those who voted approved the new constitution, and 9% opposed it. The new constitution states that the Communist Party is the only legitimate political party, describes access to health and education as fundamental rights, imposes presidential term limits, enshrines the right to legal representation upon arrest, recognizes private property, and strengthens the rights of multinationals investing with the state. Any form of discrimination harmful to human dignity is banned under the new constitution.

On 12 January 2021, then-U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] added  to the [[State Sponsors of Terrorism (U.S. list)|State Sponsors of Terrorism]] list, implementing a new series of economic sanctions on the country. Raúl Castro announced at the Eighth [[Congress of the Communist Party of ]], which began on 16 April 2021, that he was retiring as first secretary of the Communist Party. His successor, Miguel Díaz-Canel, was voted in on 19 April.

The government supported the proposed changes, but conservatives and parts of the opposition opposed them. [[LGBT rights in |Official policies]] of the  government from 1959 until the 1990s were hostile towards homosexuality, with the [[LGBT community]] marginalized on the basis of [[heteronormativity]], traditional [[gender role]]s, and strict criteria for [[moralism]].

===Early settlement===

[[Pottery]] art from  towns shows that  was settled by [[Austronesian people]]s by at least 3500 to 1000&nbsp;BC, with Melanesians following around a thousand years later, although there are still many open questions about the specific dates and patterns of human migration. It is believed that either the [[Lapita culture|Lapita people]] or the ancestors of the Polynesians settled the islands first, but not much is known of what became of them after the Melanesians arrived; the old culture may have had some influence on the new one, and archaeological evidence shows that some of the migrants moved on to [[]], [[]] and even [[Hawaii|Hawai'i]]. Archeological evidence also shows signs of human settlement on [[Moturiki|Moturiki Island]] beginning at least by 600 BC and possibly as far back as 900 BC. Although some aspects of  culture are similar to the [[Melanesia]]n culture of the western Pacific,  culture has a stronger connection to the older [[Polynesian culture]]s. The evidence is clear that there was trade between  and neighbouring archipelagos long before [[Europeans]] made contact with .

In the 10th century, the [[Tuʻi  Empire|Tu'i  Empire]] was established in , and  came within its sphere of influence. The  influence brought Polynesian customs and language into . That empire began to decline in the 13th century.

 has long had permanent settlements, but its peoples also have a history of mobility. Over the centuries, unique  cultural practices developed.  constructed large, elegant watercraft, with rigged sails called ''[[drua]]'' and exported some to .  also developed a distinctive style of village architecture, consisting of communal and individual [[Bure ()|''bure'']] and ''vale'' housing, and an advanced system of ramparts and moats that were usually constructed around the more important settlements. Pigs were domesticated for food, and a variety of agricultural endeavours, such as [[banana plantations]], existed from an early stage. Villages were supplied with water brought in by constructed wooden aqueducts.  lived in societies led by chiefs, elders and notable warriors. Spiritual leaders, often called ''bete'', were also important cultural figures, and the production and consumption of [[kava|''yaqona'']] was part of their ceremonial and community rites.  developed a monetary system where the polished teeth of the [[sperm whale]], called ''tambua'', became an active currency. A type of writing existed which can be seen today in various petroglyphs around the islands.  developed a refined [[Tapa cloth|''masi'' cloth]] textile industry, and used the cloth they produced to make sails and clothes such as the ''malo'' and the ''liku''. As with most other ancient human civilisations, warfare or preparation for warfare was an important part of everyday life in pre-colonial . The  were noted for their distinctive use of weapons, especially war clubs.  used many different types of clubs that can be broadly divided into two groups, two handed clubs and small specialised throwing clubs called ''ula''.

[[File:Le Tour du monde-01-p200.jpg|thumb|Bure-kalou or temple]] With the arrival of Europeans in the 17th century, and European colonisation in the late 19th century, many elements of  culture were either repressed or modified to ensure European – specifically,  – control. This was especially the case with respect to traditional  spiritual beliefs. Early colonists and missionaries utilised and conflated the concept of [[Human cannibalism|cannibalism]] in  to give a moral imperative for colonial intrusion. Europeans labelled many native  customs as debased or primitive, enabling colonists to see  as a "paradise wasted on savage cannibals". This narrative became a justification for violence and punitive actions by the colonists which accompanied the enforced transfer of power to the Europeans. Authors such as Deryck Scarr have perpetuated 19th century myths of "freshly killed corpses piled up for eating" and ceremonial mass human sacrifice on the construction of new houses and boats. While some modern archaeological studies conducted by scholars including Degusta, Cochrane, and Jones on  sites have shown that  may have practised an intermittent and ritualistic form of cannibalism, other research doubts even the existence of cannibalism in . Perhaps the most accurate account of cannibalism in 19th century  comes from [[William MacGregor]], the long term chief medical officer in  colonial . During the [[Little War ()|Little War]] of 1876, he stated that the rare occasion of tasting of the flesh of the enemy was done "to indicate supreme hatred and not out of relish for a gastronomic treat".

=== Early interaction with Europeans ===
[[File:Urville-Viti-Lebouka2.jpg|thumb|left|Levuka, 1842]]

[[|]] explorer [[Abel Tasman]] was the first known European visitor to , sighting the northern island of Vanua Levu and the North Taveuni archipelago in 1643 while looking for the Great Southern Continent.

[[James Cook]], the  navigator, visited one of the southern Lau islands in 1774. It was not until 1789, however, that the islands were charted and plotted, when [[William Bligh]], the castaway captain of {{HMS|Bounty}}, passed [[Ovalau ()|Ovalau]] and sailed between the main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu en route to [[Jakarta|Batavia]], in what is now . [[Bligh Water]], the strait between the two main islands, is named after him and for a time, the  Islands were known as the ''Bligh Islands''.

[[File: CLUB DANCE.png|thumb|The first Europeans to land and live among the  were shipwrecked sailors like [[Charles Savage (beachcomber)|Charles Savage]]]]

The first Europeans to maintain substantial contact with the  were [[sandalwood]] merchants, whalers and [[sea cucumber|"beche-de-mer"]] (sea cucumber) traders. The first [[whaling]] vessel known to have visited was the ''Ann and Hope'' in 1799, and she was followed by many others in the 19th century. These ships came for drinking water, food and firewood and, later, for men to help man their ships. Some of the Europeans who came to  in this period were accepted by the locals and were allowed to stay as residents.

By the 1820s, [[Levuka]] was established as the first European-style town in , on the island of Ovalau. The market for "beche-de-mer" in  was lucrative, and  and  merchants set up processing stations on various islands. Local  were utilised to collect, prepare and pack the product which would then be shipped to Asia. A good cargo would result in a half-yearly profit of around $25,000 for the dealer. The  workers were often given firearms and ammunition as an exchange for their labour, and by the end of the 1820s most of the  chiefs had muskets and many were skilled at using them. Some  chiefs soon felt confident enough with their new weapons to forcibly obtain more destructive weaponry from the Europeans. In 1834, men from Viwa and Bau were able to take control of the  ship ''L'amiable Josephine'' and use its cannon against their enemies on the [[Rewa River]], although they later ran it aground.

Christian missionaries like David Cargill also arrived in the 1830s from recently converted regions such as  and [[Tahiti]], and by 1840 the European settlement at Levuka had grown to about 40 houses with former whaler [[David Whippey]] being a notable resident. The religious conversion of the  was a gradual process which was observed first-hand by Captain [[Charles Wilkes]] of the  Exploring Expedition. Wilkes wrote that "all the chiefs seemed to look upon Christianity as a change in which they had much to lose and little to gain". Christianised , in addition to forsaking their spiritual beliefs, were pressured into cutting their hair short, adopting the [[Sulu (skirt)|sulu]] form of dress from  and fundamentally changing their marriage and funeral traditions. This process of enforced cultural change was called ''lotu''. Intensification of conflict between the cultures increased, and Wilkes was involved in organising a large punitive expedition against the people of [[Malolo]]. He ordered an attack with rockets which acted as makeshift incendiary devices. The village, with the occupants trapped inside, quickly became an inferno with Wilkes noting that the "shouts of men were intermingled with the cries and shrieks of the women and children" as they burnt to death. Wilkes demanded the survivors should "sue for mercy" and if not "they must expect to be exterminated". Around 57 to 87 Maloloan people were killed in this encounter.

=== Cakobau and the wars against Christian infiltration ===
[[File:Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa.jpg|thumb|Ratu [[Tanoa Visawaqa]]]]
[[File:Cakobau, died February 1883, photograph by Francis H. Dufty.jpg|thumb|Ratu [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]], ''Self Proclaimed Tui Viti'']]
The 1840s was a time of conflict where various  clans attempted to assert dominance over each other. Eventually, a warlord named [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]] of Bau Island was able to become a powerful influence in the region. His father was Ratu [[Tanoa Visawaqa]], the [[Vunivalu of Bau|Vunivalu]] (a chiefly title meaning warlord'','' often translated also as paramount chief) who had previously subdued much of western . Cakobau, following on from his father, became so dominant that he was able to expel the Europeans from Levuka for five years over a dispute about their giving of weapons to his local enemies. In the early 1850s, Cakobau went one step further and declared war on all Christians. His plans were thwarted after the missionaries in  received support from the already converted  and the presence of a  warship. The  Prince [[Enele Maʻafu]], a Christian, had established himself on the island of Lakeba in 1848, forcibly converting the local people to the [[Methodism|Methodist Church]]. Cakobau and other chiefs in the west of  regarded Maʻafu as a threat to their power and resisted his attempts to expand 's dominion. Cakobau's influence, however, began to wane, and his heavy imposition of taxes on other  chiefs, who saw him at best as [[Primus inter pares|first among equals]], caused them to defect from him.

Around this time the [[]] also became interested in asserting their power in the region, and they threatened intervention following a number of incidents involving their consul in the  islands, John Brown Williams. In 1849, Williams had his trading store looted following an accidental fire, caused by stray cannon fire during a [[Independence Day ()|Fourth of July]] celebration, and in 1853 the European settlement of Levuka was burnt to the ground. Williams blamed Cakobau for both these incidents, and the U.S. representative wanted Cakobau's capital at Bau destroyed in retaliation. A naval blockade was instead set up around the island which put further pressure on Cakobau to give up on his warfare against the foreigners and their Christian allies. Finally, on 30 April 1854, Cakobau offered his ''soro'' (supplication) and yielded to these forces. He underwent the ''lotu'' and converted to Christianity. The traditional  temples in Bau were destroyed, and the sacred ''[[Casuarina equisetifolia|nokonoko]]'' trees were cut down. Cakobau and his remaining men were then compelled to join with the , backed by the  and , to subjugate the remaining chiefs in the region who still refused to convert. These chiefs were soon defeated with Qaraniqio of the [[Rewa Province|Rewa]] being poisoned and Ratu Mara of Kaba being hanged in 1855. After these wars, most regions of , except for the interior highland areas, had been forced into giving up much of their traditional systems and were now vassals of Western interest. Cakobau was retained as a largely symbolic representative of a few  peoples and was allowed to take the ironic and self proclaimed title of "Tui Viti" ("King of "), but the overarching control now lay with foreign powers.

=== Cotton, confederacies and the Kai Colo ===
[[File:Tui Namosi, Kai Colo.jpg|thumb|left|Kai Colo warrior]]
The rising price of cotton in the wake of the [[ Civil War]] (1861–1865) caused an influx of hundreds of settlers to  in the 1860s from  and the  in order to obtain land and grow cotton. Since there was still a lack of functioning government in , these planters were often able to get the land in violent or fraudulent ways such as exchanging weapons or alcohol with  who may or may not have been the true owners. Although this made for cheap land acquisition, competing land claims between the planters became problematic with no unified government to resolve the disputes. In 1865, the settlers proposed a confederacy of the seven main native kingdoms in  to establish some sort of government. This was initially successful, and Cakobau was elected as the first president of the confederacy.
[[File:Flag of the Confederacy of Independent Kingdoms of .svg|thumb|Flag of the Confederacy of Independent Kingdoms of , 1865–1867]]

With the demand for land high, the white planters started to push into the hilly interior of Viti Levu. This put them into direct confrontation with the Kai Colo, which was a general term to describe the various  clans resident to these inland districts. The Kai Colo were still living a mostly traditional lifestyle, they were not Christianised, and they were not under the rule of Cakobau or the confederacy. In 1867, a travelling missionary named [[Thomas Baker (missionary)|Thomas Baker]] was killed by Kai Colo in the mountains at the headwaters of the [[Sigatoka River]]. The acting  consul, [[John Bates Thurston]], demanded that Cakobau lead a force of  from coastal areas to suppress the Kai Colo. Cakobau eventually led a campaign into the mountains but suffered a humiliating loss with 61 of his fighters being killed. Settlers also came into conflict with the local eastern Kai Colo people called the Wainimala. Thurston called in the [[ Station]] section of the [[Royal Navy]] for assistance. The Navy duly sent Commander [[Rowley Lambert]] and {{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}} to conduct a punitive mission against the Wainimala. An armed force of 87 men shelled and burnt the village of Deoka, and a skirmish ensued which resulted in the deaths of over 40 Wainimala.

=== Kingdom of  (1871–1874) ===
{{main|Kingdom of }}
[[File:Flag_of_the_Kingdom_of_Fiji_(1871-1874).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Kingdom of ]], 1871–1874]]

After the collapse of the confederacy, [[Enele Maʻafu]] established a stable administration in the Lau Islands and the . Other foreign powers such as the  were considering the possibility of annexing . This situation was not appealing to many settlers, almost all of whom were  subjects from . Britain, however, refused to annex the country, and a compromise was needed.

In June 1871, [[George Austin Woods]], an ex-lieutenant of the Royal Navy, managed to influence Cakobau and organise a group of like-minded settlers and chiefs into forming a governing administration. Cakobau was declared the monarch (''Tui Viti'') and the Kingdom of  was established. Most  chiefs agreed to participate, and even Ma'afu chose to recognise Cakobau and participate in the [[constitutional monarchy]]. However, many of the settlers had come from [[]], where negotiation with the [[Indigenous |indigenous people]] almost universally involved coercing them to accept very unfavourable terms. These settlers' expectation of dominating by force led them to form several aggressive, racially motivated groups, such as the  Subjects Mutual Protection Society. One group called themselves the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in homage to the [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] group in America. However, when respected individuals such as [[Charles St Julian]], Robert Sherson Swanston and John Bates Thurston were appointed by Cakobau, a degree of authority was established.

[[File:Three kai colo, ca. 1873, carte de visite by Francis Herbert Dufty.jpg|thumb|Three Kai Colo men in traditional  attire]]

With the rapid increase in white settlers entering the country, the desire for land acquisition also intensified. Once again, conflict with the Kai Colo in the interior of Viti Levu ensued. In 1871, the killing of two settlers near the [[Ba River ()|Ba River]] in the northwest of the island prompted a large [[punitive expedition]] of white farmers, imported slave labourers, and coastal  to be organised. This group of around 400 armed vigilantes, including veterans of the U.S. Civil War, had a battle with the Kai Colo near the village of Cubu, in which both sides had to withdraw. The village was destroyed, and the Kai Colo, despite being armed with muskets, received numerous casualties. The Kai Colo responded by making frequent raids on the settlements of the whites and Christian  throughout the [[Ba Province|district of Ba]]. Likewise, in the east of the island on the upper reaches of the Rewa River, villages were burnt, and many Kai Colo were shot by the vigilante settler squad called the Rewa Rifles.

Although the Cakobau government did not approve of the settlers taking justice into their own hands, it did want the Kai Colo subjugated and their land sold. The solution was to form an army. Robert S. Swanston, the minister for Native Affairs in the Kingdom, organised the training and arming of suitable  volunteers and prisoners to become soldiers in what was variably called the King's Troops or the Native Regiment. In a similar system to the [[ native police|Native Police]] that was present in the colonies of , two white settlers, James Harding and W. Fitzgerald, were appointed as the head officers of this paramilitary brigade. The formation of this force did not sit well with many of the white plantation owners as they did not trust an army of  to protect their interests.

The situation intensified further in early 1873 when the Burns family was killed by a Kai Colo raid in the Ba River area. The Cakobau government deployed 50 King's Troopers to the region under the command of Major Fitzgerald to restore order. The local whites refused their posting, and deployment of another 50 troops under Captain Harding was sent to emphasise the government's authority. To prove the worth of the Native Regiment, this augmented force went into the interior and massacred about 170 Kai Colo people at Na Korowaiwai. Upon returning to the coast, the force was met by the white settlers who still saw the government troops as a threat. A skirmish between the government's troops and the white settlers' brigade was only prevented by the intervention of Captain William Cox Chapman of {{HMS|Dido|1869|6}}, who detained the settlers' leaders, forcing the group to disband. The authority of the King's Troops and the Cakobau government to crush the Kai Colo was now total.

From March to October 1873, a force of about 200 King's Troops under the general administration of Swanston with around 1,000 coastal  and white volunteer auxiliaries, led a campaign throughout the highlands of Viti Levu to annihilate the Kai Colo. Major Fitzgerald and Major H.C. Thurston (the brother of John Bates Thurston) led a two pronged attack throughout the region. The combined forces of the different clans of the Kai Colo made a stand at the village of Na Culi. The Kai Colo were defeated with dynamite and fire being used to flush them out from their defensive positions amongst the mountain caves. Many Kai Colo were killed, and one of the main leaders of the hill clans, Ratu Dradra, was forced to surrender with around 2,000 men, women and children being taken prisoner and sent to the coast. In the months after this defeat, the only main resistance was from the clans around the village of Nibutautau. Major Thurston crushed this resistance in the two months following the battle at Na Culi. Villages were burnt, Kai Colo were killed, and a further large number of prisoners were taken. About 1,000 of the prisoners (men, women and children) were sent to Levuka where some were hanged and the rest were sold into [[slavery]] and forced to work on various plantations throughout the islands.

=== Blackbirding and slavery in  ===
{{Main|Blackbirding#In }}
[[File:Melanesian Cultural Area.png|thumb|Map of [[Melanesia]]]]

The [[blackbirding]] era began in  in 1865 when the first [[New Hebrides|New Hebridean]] and [[]] labourers were transported there to work on cotton plantations. The [[ Civil War]] had cut off the supply of US cotton to the international market when the Union [[Union blockade|blockaded]] Confederate ports. Cotton cultivation was potentially an extremely profitable business. Thousands of European planters flocked to  to establish plantations, but found the natives unwilling to adapt to their plans. They sought labour from the Melanesian islands. On 5 July 1865 [[Ben Pease]] received the first licence to provide 40 labourers from the New Hebrides to .

The  and Queensland governments tried to regulate this recruiting and transport of labour. Melanesian labourers were to be recruited for a term of three years, paid three pounds per year, issued basic clothing, and given access to the company store for supplies. Most Melanesians were recruited by deceit, usually being enticed aboard ships with gifts, and then locked up. In 1875, the chief medical officer in , Sir [[William MacGregor]], listed a mortality rate of 540 out of every 1,000 labourers. After the expiry of the three-year contract, the government required captains to transport the labourers back to their villages, but most ship captains dropped them off at the first island they sighted off the  waters. The  sent warships to enforce the law ([[Pacific Islanders Protection Act 1872]] ([[35 & 36 Vict.]] c. 19)), but only a small proportion of the culprits were prosecuted.

[[File:Seizure of blackbirder Daphne.jpg|thumb|Seizure of the blackbirder ''Daphne'']]

A notorious incident of the blackbirding trade was the 1871 voyage of the brig ''Carl'', organised by Dr. James Patrick Murray to recruit labourers to work in the plantations of . Murray had his men reverse their collars and carry black books, to appear as church missionaries. When islanders were enticed to a religious service, Murray and his men would produce guns and force the islanders onto boats. During the voyage Murray shot about 60 islanders. He was never brought to trial for his actions, as he was given immunity in return for giving evidence against his crew members. The captain of the ''Carl'', Joseph Armstrong, was later sentenced to death.

In addition to the blackbirded labour from other Pacific islands, thousands of people indigenous to the  archipelago were sold into slavery on the plantations. As the white settler backed Cakobau government, and later the  colonial government, subjugated areas in  under its power, the resultant prisoners of war were regularly sold at auction to the planters. This provided a source of revenue for the government and also dispersed the rebels to different, often isolated islands where the plantations were located. The land that was occupied by these people before they became slaves was then also sold for additional revenue. An example of this is the Lovoni people of Ovalau, who after being defeated in a war with the Cakobau government in 1871, were rounded up and sold to the settlers at £6 per head. Two thousand Lovoni men, women and children were sold, and their period of slavery lasted five years. Likewise, after the Kai Colo wars in 1873, thousands of people from the hill tribes of Viti Levu were sent to Levuka and sold into slavery. Warnings from the Royal Navy stationed in the area that buying these people was illegal were largely given without enforcement, and the  consul in , Edward Bernard Marsh, regularly turned a blind eye to this type of labour trade.

===  annexation ===
{{Main|Colony of | Western Pacific Territories}}
Despite achieving military victories over the Kai Colo, the Cakobau government was faced with problems of legitimacy and economic viability. Indigenous  and white settlers refused to pay taxes, and the cotton price had collapsed. With these major issues in mind, John Bates Thurston approached the  government, at Cakobau's request, with another offer to cede the islands. The newly elected [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory]]  government under [[Benjamin Disraeli]] encouraged expansion of the empire and was therefore much more sympathetic to annexing  than it had been previously. The murder of Bishop [[John Patteson (bishop)|John Patteson]] of the [[Melanesian Mission]] at [[Nukapu]] in the [[Reef Islands]] had provoked public outrage, which was compounded by the massacre by crew members of more than 150  on board the brig ''Carl.'' Two  commissioners were sent to  to investigate the possibility of an annexation. The question was complicated by maneuverings for power between Cakobau and his old rival, Ma'afu, with both men vacillating for many months. On 21 March 1874, Cakobau made a final offer, which the  accepted. On 23 September, [[Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead|Sir Hercules Robinson]], soon to be appointed the  Governor of , arrived on HMS ''Dido'' and received Cakobau with a royal 21-gun salute. After some vacillation, Cakobau agreed to renounce his ''Tui Viti'' title, retaining the title of ''Vunivalu'', or Protector. The formal cession took place on 10 October 1874, when Cakobau, Ma'afu, and some of the senior chiefs of  signed two copies of the Deed of Cession. Thus the Colony of  was founded; 96 years of  rule followed.

==== Measles epidemic of 1875 ====
To celebrate the annexation of , Hercules Robinson, who was [[Governor of New South Wales]] at the time, took Cakobau and his two sons to [[Sydney]]. There was a [[measles]] outbreak in that city and the three  all came down with the disease. On returning to , the colonial administrators decided not to quarantine the ship on which the convalescents travelled. This was despite the  having a very extensive knowledge of the devastating effect of infectious disease on an unexposed population. In 1875–76 the resulting epidemic of measles killed over 40,000 , about one-third of the  population. Some  allege that this failure of quarantine was a deliberate action to introduce the disease into the country. Historians have found no such evidence; the disease spread before the new  governor and colonial medical officers had arrived, and no quarantine rules existed under the outgoing regime.

==== Sir Arthur Gordon and the Little War ====
[[File:Sir_Arthur_Hamilton_Gordon.jpg|thumb|Governor [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Arthur Hamilton Gordon]]]]
Robinson was replaced as Governor of  in June 1875 by [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Sir Arthur Hamilton Gordon]]. Gordon was immediately faced with an insurgency of the Qalimari and Kai Colo people. In early 1875, colonial administrator [[Edgar Leopold Layard]] had met with thousands of highland clans at Navuso to formalise their subjugation to  rule and Christianity. Layard and his delegation managed to spread the measles epidemic to the highlanders, causing mass deaths in this population. As a result, anger at the  colonists flared throughout the region, and a widespread uprising quickly took hold. Villages along the Sigatoka River and in the highlands above this area refused  control, and Gordon was tasked with quashing this rebellion.

In what Gordon termed the "Little War", the suppression of this uprising took the form of two co-ordinated military campaigns in the western half of Viti Levu. The first was conducted by Gordon's second cousin, Arthur John Lewis Gordon, against the Qalimari insurgents along the Sigatoka River. The second campaign was led by [[Louis Knollys]] against the Kai Colo in the mountains to the north of the river. Governor Gordon invoked a type of martial law in the area where Arthur John Lewis Gordon and Knollys had absolute power to conduct their missions outside of any restrictions of legislation. The two groups of rebels were kept isolated from each other by a force led by Walter Carew and [[George Le Hunte]] who were stationed at Nasaucoko. Carew also ensured the rebellion did not spread east by securing the loyalty of the Wainimala people of the eastern highlands. The war involved the use of the soldiers of the old Native Regiment of Cakobau supported by around 1,500 Christian  volunteers from other areas of Viti Levu. The colonial [[ Government]] provided most of the advanced weapons for the army including 100 [[Snider–Enfield|Snider rifles]].

The campaign along the Sigatoka River was conducted under a [[scorched earth]] policy whereby numerous rebel villages were burnt and their fields ransacked. After the capture and destruction of the main fortified towns of Koroivatuma, Bukutia and Matanavatu, the Qalimari surrendered ''en masse''. Those not killed in the fighting were taken prisoner and sent to the coastal town of Cuvu. This included 827 men, women and children as well as Mudu, the leader of the insurgents. The women and children were distributed to places like [[Nadi]] and [[Nadroga-Navosa Province|Nadroga]]. Of the men, 15 were sentenced to death at a hastily conducted trial at [[Sigatoka]]. Governor Gordon was present, but chose to leave the judicial responsibility to his relative, Arthur John Lewis Gordon. Four were hanged and ten, including Mudu, were shot with one prisoner managing to escape. By the end of proceedings the governor noted that "my feet were literally stained with the blood that I had shed".

The northern campaign against the Kai Colo in the highlands was similar but involved removing the rebels from large, well protected caves in the region. Knollys managed to clear the caves "after some considerable time and large expenditure of ammunition". The occupants of these caves included whole communities, and as a result many men, women and children were either killed or wounded in these operations. The rest were taken prisoner and sent to the towns on the northern coast. The chief medical officer in  , William MacGregor, also took part both in killing Kai Colo and tending to their wounded. After the caves were taken, the Kai Colo surrendered and their leader, Bisiki, was captured. Various trials were held, mostly at Nasaucoko under Le Hunte, and 32 men were either hanged or shot including Bisiki, who was killed trying to escape.

By the end of October 1876, the "Little War" was over, and Gordon had succeeded in vanquishing the rebels in the interior of Viti Levu. Remaining insurgents were sent into exile with hard labour for up to 10 years. Some non-combatants were allowed to return to rebuild their villages, but many areas in the highlands were ordered by Gordon to remain depopulated and in ruins. Gordon also constructed a military fortress, Fort Canarvon, at the headwaters of the Sigatoka River where a large contingent of soldiers were based to maintain  control. He renamed the Native Regiment, the Armed Native Constabulary to lessen its appearance of being a military force.

To further consolidate social control throughout the colony, Governor Gordon introduced a system of appointed chiefs and village constables in the various districts to both enact his orders and report any disobedience from the populace. Gordon adopted the chiefly titles ''Roko'' and ''Buli'' to describe these deputies and established a [[Great Council of Chiefs]] which was directly subject to his authority as Supreme Chief. This body remained in existence until being suspended by the military-backed interim government in 2007 and only abolished in 2012.
Gordon also extinguished the ability of  to own, buy or sell land as individuals, the control being transferred to colonial authorities.

====  indenture system in  ====
{{main| indenture system| indenture ships to |Repatriation of indentured  from }}
Gordon decided in 1878 to import indentured labourers from  to work on the sugarcane fields that had taken the place of the cotton plantations. The 463  arrived on 14 May 1879 – the first of some 61,000 that were to come before the scheme ended in 1916. The plan involved bringing the  workers to  on a five-year contract, after which they could return to  at their own expense; if they chose to renew their contract for a second five-year term, they would be given the option of returning to  at the government's expense, or remaining in . The great majority chose to stay. The Queensland Act, which regulated indentured labour in Queensland, was made law in  also.

Between 1879 and 1916, tens of thousands of  moved to  to work as indentured labourers, especially on sugarcane plantations. Given the steady influx of ships carrying indentured  to  up until 1916, repatriated  generally boarded these same ships on their return voyage. The total number of repatriates under the  indenture system is recorded as 39,261, while the number of arrivals is said to have been 60,553. Because the return figure includes children born in , many of the indentured  never returned to .

==== Tuka rebellions ====
With almost all aspects of indigenous  social life being controlled by the  colonial authorities, a number of charismatic individuals preaching dissent and return to pre-colonial culture were able to forge a following amongst the disenfranchised. These movements were called Tuka, which roughly translates as "those who stand up". The first Tuka movement was led by Ndoongumoy, better known as Navosavakandua, which means "he who speaks only once". He told his followers that if they returned to traditional ways and worshipped traditional deities such as Degei and Rokola, their current condition would be transformed, with the whites and their puppet  chiefs being subservient to them. Navosavakandua was previously exiled from the Viti Levu highlands in 1878 for disturbing the peace, and the  quickly arrested him and his followers after this open display of rebellion. He was again exiled, this time to [[Rotuma]] where he died soon after his 10-year sentence ended.

Other Tuka organisations, however, soon appeared. The  colonial administration ruthlessly suppressed both the leaders and followers, with figureheads such as Sailose being banished to an asylum for 12 years. In 1891, entire populations of villages who were sympathetic to the Tuka ideology were deported as punishment. Three years later in the highlands of Vanua Levu, where locals had re-engaged in traditional religion, Governor Thurston ordered in the Armed Native Constabulary to destroy the towns and the religious relics. Leaders were jailed and villagers exiled or forced to amalgamate into government-run communities. Later, in 1914, [[Apolosi Nawai]] came to the forefront of  Tuka resistance by founding Viti Kabani, a co-operative company that would legally monopolise the agricultural sector and boycott European planters. The  and their proxy Council of Chiefs were not able to prevent the Viti Kabani's rise, and again the colonists were forced to send in the Armed Native Constabulary. Apolosi and his followers were arrested in 1915, and the company collapsed in 1917. Over the next 30 years, Apolosi was re-arrested, jailed and exiled, with the  viewing him as a threat right up to his death in 1946.

===World War I and II===
 was only peripherally involved in World War I. One memorable incident occurred in September 1917 when Count [[Felix von Luckner]] arrived at [[Wakaya Island]], off the eastern coast of Viti Levu, after his raider, {{SMS|Seeadler|1915|6}}, had [[Ship grounding|run aground]] in the [[Cook Islands]] following the shelling of [[Papeete]] in the [[ colonial empire| colony]] of [[Tahiti]]. On 21 September, the district police inspector took a number of  to Wakaya, and von Luckner, not realising that they were unarmed, unwittingly surrendered.

Citing unwillingness to exploit the  people, the colonial authorities did not permit  to enlist. One  of chiefly rank, a great-grandson of Cakobau, joined the [[ Foreign Legion]] and received 's highest military decoration, the [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 ()|Croix de Guerre]]. After going on to complete a law degree at [[Oxford University]], this same chief returned to  in 1921 as both a war hero and the country's first-ever university graduate. In the years that followed, [[Lala Sukuna|Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna]], as he was later known, established himself as the most powerful chief in  and forged embryonic institutions for what would later become the modern  nation.

[[File:Flag of  (1924–1970).svg|thumb|Flag of  1924–1970]]
By the time of World War II, the  had reversed its policy of not enlisting natives, and many thousands of  volunteered for the [[ Infantry Regiment]], which was under the command of [[Edward Cakobau|Ratu Sir Edward Cakobau]], another great-grandson of Cakobau. The regiment was attached to  and  army units during the war. Because of its central location,  was selected as a training base for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. An airstrip was built at [[Nadi]] (later to become an international airport), and gun emplacements studded the coast.  gained a reputation for bravery in the [[ campaign]], with one war correspondent describing their ambush tactics as "death with velvet gloves". Corporal [[Sefanaia Sukanaivalu]], of Yucata, was [[Posthumous award|posthumously]] awarded the [[Victoria Cross]], as a result of his bravery in the [[Bougainville campaign|Battle of Bougainville]].

===Responsible government and independence===
[[File:Kamisese Mara.jpg|thumb|[[Kamisese Mara]]]]
A constitutional conference was held in [[London]] in July 1965 to discuss constitutional changes with a view to introducing responsible government. Indo-, led by [[A. D. Patel]], demanded the immediate introduction of full self-government, with a fully elected legislature, to be elected by universal suffrage on a common voters' roll. These demands were vigorously rejected by the ethnic  delegation, who still feared loss of control over natively owned land and resources should an Indo- dominated government come to power. The  made it clear, however, that they were determined to bring  to self-government and eventual independence. Acknowledging their lack of choice, 's chiefs decided to negotiate for the best deal they could get.

A series of compromises led to the establishment of a cabinet system of government in 1967, with [[Kamisese Mara|Ratu Kamisese Mara]] as the first [[Chief Minister of |Chief Minister]]. Ongoing negotiations between Mara and [[Sidiq Koya]], who had taken over the leadership of the mainly Indo- [[National Federation Party]] on Patel's death in 1969, led to a second constitutional conference in London, in April 1970, at which 's Legislative Council agreed on a compromise electoral formula and a timetable for independence as a fully sovereign and independent nation within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The Legislative Council would be replaced with a bicameral [[Parliament of |Parliament]], with a [[Senate of |Senate]] dominated by  chiefs and a popularly elected [[House of Representatives of |House of Representatives]]. In the 52-member House, Native  and Indo- would each be allocated 22 seats, of which 12 would represent [[communal constituencies]] comprising voters registered on strictly ethnic roles, and another 10 representing [[national constituencies]] to which members were allocated by ethnicity but elected by universal suffrage. A further 8 seats were reserved for "[[general electors]]" – [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]], [[ people|]], [[Banaba Island|Banaban Islanders]], and other minorities; 3 of these were "communal" and 5 "national". With this compromise, it was agreed that  would become independent.

The  flag, the [[Union Jack]], was lowered for the last time at sunset on 9 October 1970 in the capital Suva. The  flag was raised after dawn on the morning of 10 October 1970; the country had officially become independent at midnight.

=== Independence ===
====1987 coups d'état====
{{main|1987  coups d'état}}
The  granted  independence in 1970. Democratic rule was interrupted by two [[1987  coups d'état|military coups]] in 1987 precipitated by a growing perception that the government was dominated by the [[ in |Indo-]] () community. The second 1987 coup saw both the  monarchy and the [[Governor-General of |Governor General]] replaced by a non-executive president and the name of the country changed from ''[[ Dominions|Dominion]] of '' to ''Republic of '' and then in 1997 to ''Republic of the  Islands''. The two coups and the accompanying civil unrest contributed to heavy Indo- emigration; the resulting population loss resulted in economic difficulties and ensured that Melanesians became the majority.

In 1990, the new constitution institutionalised ethnic  domination of the political system. The [[Group Against Racial Discrimination]] (GARD) was formed to oppose the unilaterally imposed constitution and to restore the 1970 constitution. In 1992 [[Sitiveni Rabuka]], the Lieutenant Colonel who had carried out the 1987 coup, became Prime Minister following elections held under the new constitution. Three years later, Rabuka established the Constitutional Review Commission, which in 1997 wrote a new constitution which was supported by most leaders of the indigenous  and Indo- communities.  was re-admitted to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

====2000 coup d'état====
{{Main|2000  coup d'état}}
In 2000, a [[coup]] was instigated by [[George Speight]], which effectively toppled the government of [[Mahendra Chaudhry]], who in 1997 had become the country's first Indo- Prime Minister following the adoption of the new constitution. Commodore [[Frank Bainimarama]] assumed executive power after the resignation, possibly forced, of President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. Later in 2000,  was rocked by [[Mutinies of the 2000  coup d'état|two mutinies]] when rebel soldiers went on a rampage at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks. The [[High Court of |High Court]] ordered the reinstatement of the constitution, and in September 2001, to restore democracy, a general election was held which was won by interim Prime Minister [[Laisenia Qarase]]'s [[Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua]] party.

In 2005, the Qarase government amid much controversy proposed a [[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill|Reconciliation and Unity Commission]] with power to recommend compensation for victims of the 2000 coup and amnesty for its perpetrators. However, the military, especially the nation's top military commander, Frank Bainimarama, strongly opposed this bill. Bainimarama agreed with detractors who said that to grant amnesty to supporters of the present government who had played a role in the violent coup was a sham. His attack on the legislation, which continued unremittingly throughout May and into June and July, further strained his already tense relationship with the government.

====2006 coup d'état====
In late November and early December 2006, Bainimarama was instrumental in the [[2006  coup d'état]]. Bainimarama handed down a list of demands to Qarase after a bill was put forward to parliament, part of which would have offered pardons to participants in the 2000 coup attempt. He gave Qarase an ultimatum date of 4 December to accede to these demands or to resign from his post. Qarase adamantly refused either to concede or resign, and on 5 December President Ratu [[Josefa Iloilo]] signed a legal order dissolving the parliament after meeting with Bainimarama.

Citing corruption in the government, Bainimarama staged a military takeover on 5 December 2006 against the prime minister that he had installed after a 2000 coup. The commodore took over the powers of the presidency and dissolved the parliament, paving the way for the military to continue the takeover. The coup was the culmination of weeks of speculation following conflict between the elected prime minister, Laisenia Qarase, and Bainimarama. Bainimarama had repeatedly issued demands and deadlines to the prime minister. A particular issue was previously pending legislation to pardon those involved in the 2000 coup. Bainimarama named [[Jona Senilagakali]] as caretaker prime minister. The next week Bainimarama said he would ask the Great Council of Chiefs to restore executive powers to the president, Ratu Josefa Iloilo.

On 4 January 2007, the military announced that it was restoring executive power to Iloilo, who made a broadcast endorsing the actions of the military. The next day, Iloilo named Bainimarama as the interim prime minister, indicating that the military was still effectively in control. In the wake of the takeover, reports emerged of alleged intimidation of some of those critical of the interim regime.

====2009 transfer of power====
{{main|2009  constitutional crisis}}
In April 2009, the [[Court of Appeal of | Court of Appeal]] overturned the High Court decision that Bainimarama's takeover of Qarase's government was lawful and declared the interim government to be illegal. Bainimarama agreed to step down as interim prime minister immediately, along with his government, and President Iloilo was to appoint a new prime minister. President Iloilo [[Obrogation|abrogated]] the constitution, and removed all office holders under the constitution including all judges and the governor of the Central Bank. In his own words, he "appoint[ed] [him]self as the Head of the State of  under a new legal order". He then reappointed Bainimarama under his "New Order" as interim prime minister and imposed a "Public Emergency Regulation" limiting internal travel and allowing press censorship.

On 2 May 2009,  became the first nation ever to have been suspended from participation in the [[Pacific Islands Forum]], for its failure to hold democratic elections by the date promised. Nevertheless, it remains a member of the Forum.

On 1 September 2009,  was suspended from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The action was taken because Bainimarama failed to hold elections by 2010 as the Commonwealth of Nations had demanded after the 2006 coup. Bainimarama stated a need for more time to end a voting system that heavily favoured ethnic  at the expense of the multi-ethnic minorities. Critics claimed that he had suspended the constitution and was responsible for [[human rights]] violations by arresting and detaining opponents.

In his 2010 New Year's address, Bainimarama announced the lifting of the Public Emergency Regulations (PER). However, the PER was not rescinded until January 2012, and the Suva Philosophy Club was the first organisation to reorganise and convene public meetings. The PER had been put in place in April 2009 when the former constitution was abrogated. The PER had allowed restrictions on speech, public gatherings, and censorship of news media and had given security forces added powers. He also announced a nationwide consultation process leading to a new constitution under which the 2014 elections were held.

The official name of the country was reverted to ''Republic of '' in February 2011.

==== Since 2014 ====
On 14 March 2014, the [[Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group]] voted to change 's full suspension from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] to a suspension from the councils of the Commonwealth, allowing them to participate in a number of Commonwealth activities, including the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]]. The suspension was lifted in September 2014.

The [[FijiFirst]] party, led by Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, won outright majority in the country's 51-seat parliament both in 2014 [[2014  general election|election]] and narrowly in 2018 [[2018  general election|election]]. In October 2021, [[Wiliame Katonivere|Tui Macuata Ratu Wiliame Katonivere]] was elected the new [[President of ]] by the parliament.

On 24 December 2022, [[Sitiveni Rabuka]], the head of the [[People's Alliance ()|People's Alliance]] (PAP), became 's 12th prime minister, succeeding Bainimarama, following the December 2022 [[2022  general election|general election]].

=== Prehistory ===
<!-- Paleolithic & Neolithic are prehistoric -->
[[File:Laas Geel single cow.jpg|thumb|Neolithic rock art at the [[Laas Geel]] complex depicting a long-horned cow]]
 was likely one of the first lands to be settled by early humans due to its location. [[Hunter-gatherer]]s who would later migrate out of Africa likely settled here before their migrations. During the Stone Age, the Doian and Hargeisan cultures flourished here. The oldest evidence of burial customs in the Horn of Africa comes from cemeteries in  dating back to the 4th millennium BC. The stone implements from the Jalelo site in the north were also characterised in 1909 as important artifacts demonstrating the archaeological universality during the Paleolithic between the East and the West.

According to linguists, the first [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations arrived in the region during the ensuing [[Neolithic]] period from the family's proposed [[Afroasiatic Urheimat|urheimat]] ("original homeland") in the [[Nile Valley]], or the [[Near East]].

The [[Laas Geel]] complex on the outskirts of [[Hargeisa]] in northwestern  dates back approximately 5,000 years, and has [[rock art]] depicting both wild animals and decorated cows. Other [[cave painting]]s are found in the northern [[Dhambalin]] region, which feature one of the earliest known depictions of a hunter on horseback. The rock art is dated to 1,000 to 3,000 BC. Additionally, between the towns of [[Las Khorey]] and [[El Ayo]] in northern  lies [[Karinhegane]], the site of numerous cave paintings, which collectively have been estimated to be around 2,500 years old.

The [[camel]] is believed to have been domesticated in the Horn region sometime between the 2nd and 3rd millennium BC. From there, it spread to [[]] and the [[Maghreb]].

=== Antiquity and classical era ===

[[File:Men from Punt Carrying Gifts, Tomb of Rekhmire MET 30.4.152 EGDP013029.jpg|thumb|Men from [[Land of Punt|Punt]] carrying Gifts, Tomb of [[Rekhmire]].]]
Ancient [[pyramid]]ical structures, [[mausoleum]]s, ruined cities and stone walls, such as the [[Wargaade Wall]], are evidence of an old civilisation that once thrived in the  peninsula. This civilisation enjoyed a trading relationship with [[ancient ]] and [[Mycenaean ]] since the second millennium BC, supporting the hypothesis that  or adjacent regions were the location of the ancient [[Land of Punt]]. The Puntites native to the region traded [[myrrh]], spices, gold, ebony, short-horned cattle, ivory and [[frankincense]] with the , Phoenicians, Babylonians, ,  and Romans through their commercial ports. An  expedition sent to Punt by the [[Eighteenth dynasty of |18th dynasty]] Queen [[Hatshepsut]] is recorded on the temple reliefs at [[Deir el-Bahari]], during the reign of the Puntite King Parahu and Queen Ati.

In the [[Classical antiquity|classical era]], the [[Macrobians]], who may have been ancestral to , established a powerful  kingdom that ruled large parts of modern . They were reputed for their longevity and wealth, and were said to be the "tallest and handsomest of all men". The Macrobians were warrior herders and seafarers. According to Herodotus' account, the [[Persian Emperor]] [[Cambyses II]], upon his [[History of Achaemenid |conquest of ]] in 525 BC, sent ambassadors to Macrobia, bringing luxury gifts for the Macrobian king to entice his submission. The Macrobian ruler, who was elected based on his stature and beauty, replied instead with a challenge for his Persian counterpart in the form of an unstrung bow: if the Persians could manage to draw it, they would have the right to invade his country; but until then, they should thank the gods that the Macrobians never decided to invade their empire. The Macrobians were a regional power reputed for their advanced architecture and [[gold]] wealth, which was so plentiful that they shackled their prisoners in golden chains.

During the classical period, the [[Barbaria (region)|Barbara]] city-states of [[Mosylon]], [[Opone]], [[Heis (town)|Mundus]], [[Bulhar|Isis]], [[Malao]], [[Zeila|Avalites]], [[Essina]], [[Nikon ()|Nikon]] and [[Sarapion]] developed a lucrative trade network, connecting with merchants from [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic ]], [[Ancient ]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian Persia]], [[Sabaeans|Saba]], the [[Nabataean Kingdom]], and the [[Roman Empire]]. They used the ancient  maritime vessel known as the ''[[beden]]'' to transport their cargo.
[[File:Beden.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Beden]] is a fast, ancient  single or double-masted maritime ship.]]
After the [[Nabatea#Roman annexation|Roman conquest of the Nabataean Empire]] and the Roman naval presence at [[Aden]] to curb piracy, Arab and  merchants agreed with the Romans to bar  ships from trading in the free port cities of the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian peninsula]] to protect the interests of  and Arab merchants in the lucrative commerce between the Red and Mediterranean Seas. However,  merchants continued to trade in the port cities of the  peninsula, which was free from Roman interference. For centuries,  merchants brought large quantities of cinnamon to  and Arabia from [[Ceylon]] and the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. The source of the cinnamon and other spices is said to have been the best-kept secret of Arab and  merchants in their trade with the Roman and  world; the Romans and  believed the source to have been the  peninsula. The collusive agreement among  and Arab traders inflated the price of  and  cinnamon in North Africa, the Near East, and Europe, and made the cinnamon trade a very profitable revenue generator, especially for the  merchants.

[[File:Silk route.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Silk Road]] extending from  to southern Europe, Arabia, , , Persia, , and Java]]
[[Islam]] was introduced to the area early on by the first Muslims of Mecca fleeing prosecution during the first [[Hegira|Hejira]] with [[Masjid al-Qiblatayn ()|Masjid al-Qiblatayn]] in [[Zeila]] being built before the [[Qibla]]h towards [[Mecca]]. It is one of the oldest [[mosque]]s in Africa. In the late 9th century, [[Al-Yaqubi]] wrote that Muslims were living along the northern  seaboard. He also mentioned that the [[Adal Sultanate|Adal Kingdom]] had its capital in the city. According to [[Leo Africanus]], the [[Adal Sultanate]] was governed by local [[ people|]] dynasties and its realm encompassed the geographical area between the Bab el Mandeb and Cape Guardafui. It was thus flanked to the south by the [[Ajuran Empire]] and to the west by the [[Abyssinian Empire]].

Throughout the Middle Ages, Arab immigrants arrived in Somaliland, a historical experience which would later lead to the legendary stories about Muslim [[sheikh]]s such as [[Abdirahman bin Isma'il al-Jabarti|Daarood]] and [[Ishaaq bin Ahmed]] (the purported ancestors of the [[Darod]] and [[Isaaq]] clans, respectively) travelling from [[Arabia]] to  and marrying into the local [[Dir (clan)|Dir]] clan.

In 1332, the Zeila-based King of Adal was slain in a military campaign aimed at halting Abyssinian emperor [[Amda Seyon I]]'s march toward the city. When the last Sultan of Ifat, [[Sa'ad ad-Din II]], was also killed by Emperor [[Dawit I of |Dawit I]] in Zeila in 1410, his children escaped to , before returning in 1415. In the early 15th century, Adal's capital was moved further inland to the town of [[Dakkar]], where [[Sabr ad-Din II]], the eldest son of Sa'ad ad-Din II, established a new base after his return from .
[[File:Imaam Ahmed Gurey.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi|Ahmed ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]], [[Imam]] of the [[Adal Sultanate|Adal Empire]]]]
Adal's headquarters were again relocated the following century, this time southward to [[Harar]]. From this new capital, Adal organised an effective army led by Imam [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]], (Ahmad "Gurey" or "Gran"; both meaning "the left-handed") and his closest top general and brother in law [[Matan ibn Uthman Al |Garad Matan]]. Imam Ahmed clan is documented to be from the [[Geri Koombe]], a sub clan of Darod. This 16th-century campaign is historically known as the [[Abyssinian–Adal war|Conquest of Abyssinia]] (''Futuh al-Habash''). During the war, Imam Ahmad pioneered the use of cannons supplied by the Ottoman Empire, which he imported through Zeila and deployed against Abyssinian forces and their  allies led by [[Cristóvão da Gama]].

During the [[Ajuran Sultanate]] period, the city-states and republics of [[Merca]], [[Mogadishu]], [[Barawa]], [[Hobyo]] and their respective ports flourished and had a lucrative foreign commerce with ships sailing to and from Arabia, , [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]], Persia, , , and as far away as . [[Vasco da Gama]], who passed by Mogadishu in the 15th century, noted that it was a large city with houses several storeys high and large palaces in its centre, in addition to many mosques with cylindrical minarets. The [[Harla people|Harla]], an early [[Hamitic]] group of tall stature who inhabited parts of , Tchertcher and other areas in the Horn, also erected various [[tumulus|tumuli]]. These masons are believed to have been ancestral to ethnic .[[File:ShenDuGiraffePainting.jpg|thumb|The [[Ajuran Sultanate]] maintained commercial ties with the [[Ming dynasty]] and other kingdoms.|left|268x268px]]

In the 16th century, [[Duarte Barbosa]] noted that many ships from the [[Khambhat|Kingdom of Cambaya]] in modern-day  sailed to Mogadishu with cloth and spices, for which they in return received gold, wax and ivory. Barbosa also highlighted the abundance of meat, wheat, barley, horses, and fruit on the coastal markets, which generated enormous wealth for the merchants. Mogadishu, the centre of a thriving textile industry known as ''toob benadir'' (specialised for the markets in , among other places), together with Merca and Barawa, also served as a transit stop for [[Swahili people|Swahili]] merchants from [[Mombasa]] and [[Malindi]] and for the gold trade from [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]]. [[Jewish]] merchants from the [[Strait of Hormuz|Hormuz]] brought their  textile and fruit to the  coast in exchange for [[grain]] and wood.

Trading relations were established with [[Malacca]] in the 15th century, with cloth, ambergris and porcelain being the main commodities of the trade. Giraffes, zebras and incense were exported to the [[Ming Empire]] of , which established  merchants as leaders in the commerce between East Asia and the Horn. Hindu merchants from [[Surat]] and Southeast African merchants from [[Pate Island|Pate]], seeking to bypass both the [[ ]] blockade (and later the  interference), used the  ports of Merca and Barawa (which were out of the two powers' direct jurisdiction) to conduct their trade in safety and without interference.

In the [[early modern]] period, successor states to the Adal Sultanate and [[Ajuran Sultanate]] began to flourish in . These included the [[Hiraab Imamate]], the [[Isaaq Sultanate]] led by the [[Guled Dynasty|Guled dynasty]], the [[Habr Yunis Sultanate]] led by the [[Rer Ainanshe|Ainanshe dynasty]], the [[Sultanate of the Geledi]] (Gobroon dynasty), the [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] (Migiurtinia), and the [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] (Obbia). They continued the tradition of castle-building and seaborne trade established by previous  empires.

Sultan [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]], the third Sultan of the House of Gobroon, started the golden age of the Gobroon Dynasty. His army came out victorious during the Bardheere Jihad, which restored stability in the region and revitalised the East African [[ivory trade]]. He also had cordial relations and received gifts from the rulers of neighbouring and distant kingdoms such as the , [[Wituland|Witu]] and  Sultans.

Sultan Ibrahim's son [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]] succeeded him as one of the most important figures in 19th-century East Africa, receiving tribute from  governors and creating alliances with important Muslim families on the East African coast.

In [[Somaliland]], the Isaaq Sultanate was established in 1750. The Isaaq Sultanate was a  kingdom that ruled parts of the [[Horn of Africa]] during the 18th and 19th centuries. It spanned the territories of the [[Isaaq]] clan, descendants of the [[Banu Hashim]] clan, in modern-day Somaliland and . The sultanate was governed by the Rer Guled branch established by the first sultan, Sultan [[Guled Abdi (Sultan)|Guled Abdi]], of the [[Eidagale]] clan. According to oral tradition, prior to the Guled dynasty the [[Isaaq]] clan-family were ruled by a dynasty of the Tolje'lo branch starting from, descendants of Ahmed nicknamed Tol Je'lo, the eldest son of [[Ishaaq bin Ahmed|Sheikh Ishaaq]]'s [[Harari people|Harari]] wife. There were eight Tolje'lo rulers in total, starting with Boqor Harun ({{Langx|so|Boqor Haaruun}}) who ruled the Isaaq Sultanate for centuries starting from the 13th century. The last Tolje'lo ruler [[Garad]] Dhuh Barar ({{langx|so|Dhuux Baraar}}) was overthrown by a coalition of Isaaq clans. The once strong Tolje'lo clan were scattered and took refuge amongst the [[Habr Awal]] with whom they still mostly live.

In the late 19th century, after the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884, European powers began the [[Scramble for Africa]]. In that year, a  protectorate was declared over part of , on the African coast opposite South . Initially, this region was under the control of the  Office, and so administered as part of the  Empire; in 1898 it was transferred to control by London. In 1889, the protectorate and later colony of [[ ]] was officially established by [[Kingdom of |]] through various treaties signed with a number of chiefs and sultans; Sultan [[Yusuf Ali Kenadid]] first sent a request to  in late December 1888 to make his [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] an  protectorate before later signing a treaty in 1889.

The Dervish movement successfully repulsed the  Empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region. The [[Dervish movement ()|Darawiish]] defeated the , , Abyssinian colonial powers on numerous occasions, most notably, the 1903 victory at Cagaarweyne commanded by [[Suleiman Aden Galaydh]], forcing the [[ Empire]] to retreat to the coastal region in the early 1900s. The Dervishes were finally defeated in 1920 by  airpower.{{sfn|Samatar|1982|pages=[https://archive.org/details/oralpoetrysomali00sama/page/n144 131], 135}}

The dawn of [[fascism]] in the early 1920s heralded a change of strategy for , as the north-eastern sultanates were soon to be forced within the boundaries of ''La Grande '' ("''[[Greater ]]''") according to the plan of Fascist . With the arrival of Governor [[Cesare Maria De Vecchi]] on 15 December 1923, things began to change for that part of Somaliland known as [[ Somaliland]]. The last piece of land acquired by  in  was [[Oltre Giuba]], present-day [[Jubaland]] region, in 1925.[[File:Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan.jpeg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan|Muhammed Abdullah Hassan]], Leader of the [[Dervish movement ()|Dervishes]]]]The  began local infrastructure projects, including the construction of hospitals, farms and schools.

A  force, including troops from several African countries, launched the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|campaign in January 1941]] from  to liberate  Somaliland and -occupied  and conquer  Somaliland. By February most of  Somaliland was captured and, in March,  Somaliland was retaken from the sea. The forces of the  Empire operating in Somaliland comprised the three divisions of , West African, and East African troops. They were assisted by  forces led by Abdulahi Hassan with  of the [[Isaaq]], [[Dhulbahante]], and [[Warsangali]] clans prominently participating. The number of [[ ]] began to decline after World War II, with fewer than 10,000 remaining in 1960.

=== Independence (1960–1969) ===
{{Main|Trust Territory of Somaliland|State of Somaliland| Republic|Greater | Youth League}}

Following World War II, Britain retained control of both [[ Somaliland]] and  Somaliland as protectorates. In 1945, during the [[Potsdam Conference]], the United Nations granted  trusteeship of  Somaliland as the [[Trust Territory of Somaliland]], on the condition first proposed by the  Youth League (SYL) and other nascent  political organisations, such as Hizbia Digil Mirifle  (HDMS) and the  National League (SNL)—that  achieve independence within ten years.  Somaliland remained a protectorate of Britain until 1960.
[[File:Isaaq Chiefs Hargeisa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Leaders of the [[Isaaq]] clan photographed in [[Hargeisa]] in 1958 during the Duke & Duchess of Gloucester's visit to Somaliland]]

To the extent that [[]] held the territory by UN mandate, the trusteeship provisions gave the  the opportunity to gain experience in Western political education and self-government. These were advantages that  Somaliland, which was to be incorporated into the new  state, did not have. Although in the 1950s  colonial officials attempted, through various administrative development efforts, to make up for past neglect, the protectorate stagnated in political administrative development. The disparity between the two territories in economic development and political experience would later cause serious difficulties integrating the two parts.[[File:Mogadishu city centre - 1960s.jpg|thumb|upright|An avenue in downtown [[Mogadishu]] in 1963]]Meanwhile, in 1948, under pressure from their World War II allies and to the dismay of the , the  returned the [[Haud]] (an important  grazing area that was presumably protected by  treaties with the  in 1884 and 1886) and the [[ Region]] to , based on a treaty they signed in 1897 in which the  ceded  territory to the  Emperor [[Menelek II of |Menelik]] in exchange for his help against possible advances by the .

Britain included the conditional provision that the  residents would retain their autonomy, but  immediately claimed sovereignty over the area. This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the  lands it had turned over. Britain also granted administration of the almost exclusively -inhabited [[Northern Frontier District]] (NFD) to  nationalists. This was despite a [[plebiscite]] in which, according to a  colonial commission, almost all of the territory's ethnic  favoured joining the newly formed  Republic.

A [[ Somaliland overseas territory referendum, 1958|referendum]] was held in neighbouring [[]] (then known as [[ Somaliland]]) in 1958, on the eve of 's independence in 1960, to decide whether or not to join the  Republic or to remain with . The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with , largely due to a combined yes vote by the sizeable [[Afar people|Afar]] ethnic group and resident Europeans. There was also widespread vote rigging, with the  expelling thousands of  before the referendum reached the polls.

The majority of those who voted 'no' were  who were strongly in favour of joining a united , as had been proposed by [[Mahmoud Harbi]], Vice President of the Government Council. Harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later.  finally gained independence from [[]] in 1977, and [[Hassan Gouled Aptidon]], a  who had campaigned for a 'yes' vote in the referendum of 1976, eventually became 's first president (1977–1999).

The  Somaliland protectorate obtained independence as the [[State of Somaliland]] on 26 June 1960. On 1 July 1960 the Trust Territory of Somaliland gained independence and the two united to form the [[ Republic]], albeit within boundaries drawn up by  and Britain. A government was formed by [[Abdullahi Issa]] and [[Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal]] with other members of the trusteeship and protectorate governments, with [[Abdulcadir Muhammed Aden]] as President of the [[Parliament of | National Assembly]], [[Aden Abdullah Osman Daar]] as [[List of Presidents of |President]] of the  Republic, and [[Abdirashid Ali Shermarke]] as [[Prime Minister of |Prime Minister]] (later to become president from 1967 to 1969). On 20 July 1961 and through a [[ constitutional referendum, 1961|popular referendum]], was ratified popularly by the people of  under  trusteeship, Most of the people from the former Somaliland Protectorate did not participate in the referendum, although only a small number of Somalilanders who participated the referendum voted against the [[Constitution of |new constitution]], which was first drafted in 1960. In 1967, Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal became Prime Minister, a position to which he was appointed by Shermarke. Egal would later become the President of the autonomous [[Somaliland]] region in northwestern .

===  Democratic Republic (1969–1991) ===
{{Main| Democratic Republic|1969  coup d'état}}

=== Coup d'État ===
On 15 October, while president Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke was touring drought-stricken Las Anood, his personal bodyguard shot and killed him. Former US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] concluded that the bodyguard was acting of his own accord. Six days later, on 21 October, General [[Siad Barre]] led a military coup and successfully overthrew the parliamentary government. Modern political analysts assert that the coup was motivated by corruption in the parliamentary government.  The bodyguard was tried, tortured and executed by the [[Supreme Revolutionary Council ()|Supreme Revolutionary Council]] (SRC). He came from the same clan background as the president who he killed.
[[File:Mohamed_Ainanshe_and_Kim_Il_Sung_-1970.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mohamed Ainanshe Guled]] in [[]] meeting President [[Kim Il Sung]] 1970]]

Alongside Barre, the SRC that assumed power after President Sharmarke's assassination was led by Brigadier General [[Mohamed Ainanshe Guled]], Lieutenant Colonel [[Salaad Gabeyre Kediye]] and Chief of Police [[Jama Ali Korshel|Jama Korshel]]. Kediye officially held the title "Father of the Revolution", and Barre shortly afterwards became the head of the SRC. The SRC subsequently renamed the country the  Democratic Republic, dissolved the parliament and the Supreme Court, and suspended the constitution.

The revolutionary government established large-scale public works programs and successfully implemented an urban and rural [[literacy]] campaign, which helped dramatically increase the literacy rate. The  Democratic Republic achieved a literacy rate of 70%, one of the highest in Africa at the time.

In addition to a nationalisation program of industry and land, the new regime's foreign policy placed an emphasis on 's traditional and religious links with the [[Arab world]], eventually joining the [[Arab League]] in February 1974. That same year, Barre also served as chairman of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), the predecessor of the [[African Union]] (AU).

In July 1976, Barre's SRC disbanded itself and established in its place the [[ Revolutionary Socialist Party]] (SRSP), a one-party government based on [[scientific socialism]] and Islamic tenets. The SRSP was an attempt to reconcile the official state ideology with the official state religion by [[Revisionism (Marxism)|adapting Marxist precepts]] to local circumstances. Emphasis was placed on the Muslim principles of social progress, equality and justice, which the government argued formed the core of scientific socialism and its own accent on self-sufficiency, public participation and popular control, as well as direct ownership of the means of production. While the SRSP encouraged private investment on a limited scale, the administration's overall direction was essentially [[Communism|communist]].

In July 1977, the [[Ogaden War]] broke out after Barre's government used a plea for national unity to justify an [[War of aggression|aggressive]] incorporation of the predominantly -inhabited [[Ogaden]] region of  into a Pan- [[Greater ]], along with the rich agricultural lands of south-eastern , infrastructure, and strategically important areas as far north as . In the first week of the conflict,  armed forces took southern and central Ogaden and for most of the war, the  army scored continuous victories on the  army and followed them as far as [[Sidamo Province|Sidamo]]. By September 1977,  controlled 90% of the Ogaden and captured strategic cities such as [[Jijiga]] and put heavy pressure on [[Dire Dawa]], threatening the train route from the latter city to . After the siege of Harar, a massive unprecedented Soviet intervention consisting of 20,000 [[]]n forces and several thousand Soviet experts came to the aid of 's communist [[Derg]] regime. By 1978, the  troops were ultimately pushed out of the Ogaden. This shift in support by the Soviet Union motivated the Barre government to seek allies elsewhere. It eventually settled on the Soviets' [[Cold War]] arch-rival, the [[]], which had been courting the  government for some time. 's initial friendship with the Soviet Union and later partnership with the  enabled it to build the largest army in Africa.[[File:Muhammad Siad Barre - 40866X9X9.jpg|thumb|Major General [[Mohamed Siad Barre]], Chairman of the [[Supreme Revolutionary Council ()|Supreme Revolutionary Council]], meeting with President of  [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]]]A new constitution was promulgated in 1979 under which elections for a People's Assembly were held. However, Barre's  Revolutionary Socialist Party [[politburo]] continued to rule. In October 1980, the SRSP was disbanded, and the Supreme Revolutionary Council was reestablished in its place. By that time, Barre's government had become increasingly unpopular. Many  had become disillusioned with life under military dictatorship.

The regime was weakened further in the 1980s as the Cold War drew to a close and 's strategic importance was diminished. The government became increasingly [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]], and [[resistance movement]]s, encouraged by , sprang up across the country, eventually leading to the [[ Civil War]]. Among the militia groups were the [[ Salvation Democratic Front]] (SSDF), [[United  Congress]] (USC), [[ National Movement]] (SNM) and the [[ Patriotic Movement]] (SPM), together with the non-violent political oppositions of the [[ Democratic Movement]] (SDM), the [[Factions in the  Civil War# Democratic Alliance (SDA)| Democratic Alliance]] (SDA) and the  Manifesto Group (SMG).

As the [[moral authority]] of Barre's government was gradually eroded, many  became disillusioned with life under military rule. By the mid-1980s, resistance movements supported by 's communist [[Derg]] administration had sprung up across the country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerrillas, especially in the northern regions. The clampdown included bombing of cities, with the northwestern administrative centre of [[Hargeisa]], a [[ National Movement]] (SNM) stronghold, among the targeted areas in 1988.

The clampdown initiated by [[Siad Barre|Barre]]'s government extended its reach beyond the initial bombings in the north to encompass various regions across the country. This reproduction of aggressive strategies aimed at stifling descent and retaining authority over the populace was a hallmark of the government's repressive actions in the South. One of the most notable instances occurred in 1991, when Barre's regime initiated a ruthless aerial assault that led to the deaths of numerous innocent individuals in the town of [[Beledweyne|Beledwene]], situated in southern . The cruelty and magnitude of this atrocity highlighted the degree to which the government was prepared to go to quash any sort of opposition or resistance, displaying a blatant disregard for human rights and the worth of human life.

Another notable instance of [[Siad Barre|Barre]]'s repressive policies occurred in the city of [[Baidoa]], which earned the nickname 'the city of death' due to the tragic events that unfolded there during the famine and [[ Civil War|civil war]]. Hundreds of thousands of individuals lost their lives as a consequence of governmental strategies specifically aimed at the [[Rahanweyn]] community residing in these areas.

During 1990, in the capital city of Mogadishu, the residents were prohibited from gathering publicly in groups greater than three or four. Fuel shortages, inflation, and currency devaluation impacted the economy. A thriving black market existed in the centre of the city as banks experienced shortages of local currency for exchange. Harsh [[exchange control]] regulations were introduced to prevent export of foreign currency. Although no travel restrictions were placed on foreigners, photographing many locations was banned. During daytime in Mogadishu, the appearance of any government military force was extremely rare. Alleged late-night operations by government authorities, however, included "disappearances" of individuals from their homes.

In 1991, the Barre administration was ousted by a coalition of clan-based opposition groups, backed by 's then-ruling [[Derg]] regime and [[Great Socialist People's  Arab Jamahiriya|]]. Following a meeting of the [[ National Movement]] and northern clans' elders, the northern former  portion of the country [[Somaliland Declaration of Independence|declared its independence]] as the [[Somaliland|Republic of Somaliland]] in May 1991. Although {{Lang|la|de facto}} independent and relatively stable compared to the tumultuous south, it has not been recognised by any foreign government.

[[File:Mogadishu.jpg|thumb|Prior to the civil war, Mogadishu was known as the "White pearl of the  Ocean".]]

Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime. In the south, armed factions led by USC commanders General [[Mohamed Farah Aidid]] and [[Ali Mahdi Mohamed]], in particular, clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital. In 1991, a multi-phased international conference on  was held in neighbouring . Owing to the legitimacy bestowed on Muhammad by the  conference, he was subsequently recognised by the international community as the new President of . He was not able to exert his authority beyond parts of the capital. Power was instead vied with other faction leaders in the southern half of  and with autonomous sub-national entities in the north. The  conference was followed by two abortive agreements for national reconciliation and disarmament, which were signed by 15 political stakeholders: an agreement to hold an Informal Preparatory Meeting on National Reconciliation, and the 1993 Addis Ababa Agreement made at the Conference on National Reconciliation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

In the early 1990s, due to the protracted lack of a permanent central authority,  began to be characterised as a "[[failed state]]."

[[File:Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed (28-03-2006).jpg|thumb|[[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed]], president of the transitional government of ]]

The Transitional National Government (TNG) was established in April–May 2000 at the  National Peace Conference (SNPC) held in Arta, . [[Abdiqasim Salad Hassan]] was selected as the President of the nation's new Transitional National Government (TNG), an interim administration formed to guide  to its third permanent republican government.
The TNG's internal problems led to the replacement of the Prime Minister four times in three years, and the administrative body's reported bankruptcy in December 2003. Its mandate ended at the same time.

On 10 October 2004, legislators elected [[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed]] as the first President of the [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG), the Transitional National Government's successor. The TFG was the second interim administration aiming to restore national institutions to  after the 1991 collapse of the Siad Barre regime and the ensuing civil war.

The Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was the internationally recognised government of  until 20 August 2012, when its tenure officially ended. It was established as one of the [[Transitional Federal Institutions]] (TFIs) of government as defined in the [[Transitional Federal Charter]] (TFC) adopted in November 2004 by the [[Transitional Federal Parliament]] (TFP). The Transitional Federal Government officially comprised the [[Executive (government)|executive]] branch of government, with the TFP serving as the [[Legislature|legislative]] branch. The government was headed by the [[President of ]], to whom the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] reported through the [[Prime Minister of |Prime Minister]]. However, it was also used as a general term to refer to all three branches collectively.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

=== Islamic Courts Union ===

[[File:Icu  map.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map showing the ICU at the peak of its influence]]

In 2006, the [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU) assumed control of much of the southern part of the country for 6 months and imposed [[Shari'a]] law. Top UN officials have referred to this brief period as a 'Golden era' in the history of  politics.

=== Transitional Federal Government ===
{{See also| War (2006–2009)|Battle of Mogadishu (2006)}}

The Transitional Federal Government sought to reestablish its authority, and, with the assistance of [[ National Defense Force| troops]], [[African Union]] peacekeepers and air support by the , drove out the ICU and solidified its rule. On 8 January 2007, TFG President [[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed]] entered Mogadishu with the  military support for the first time since being elected to office. The government then relocated to [[Villa ]] in the capital from its interim location in [[Baidoa]]. This marked the first time since the fall of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 that the federal government controlled most of the country.

=== Al-Shabaab insurgency ===
{{See also|Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Islamic Emirate of }}
[[Al-Shabaab ()|Al-Shabaab]] opposed the  military's presence in  and continued an insurgency against the TFG. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern . By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had forced the  troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops.

Owing to a lack of funding and human resources, an [[arms embargo]] that made it difficult to reestablish a national security force, and general indifference on the part of the international community, Yusuf found himself obliged to deploy thousands of troops from Puntland to Mogadishu to sustain the battle against insurgent elements in the southern part of the country. Financial support for this effort was provided by the autonomous region's government. This left little revenue for Puntland's own security forces and civil service employees, leaving the territory vulnerable to piracy and terrorist attacks.

On 29 December 2008, Yusuf announced before a united parliament in Baidoa his resignation as President of . In his speech, which was broadcast on national radio, Yusuf expressed regret at failing to end the country's seventeen-year conflict as his government had been mandated to do. He also blamed the international community for their failure to support the government, and said that the speaker of parliament would succeed him in office per the [[Transitional Federal Charter of the  Republic|Charter of the Transitional Federal Government]].

=== End of transitional period ===
{{See also|Hizbul Islam|Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a|Alliance for the Re-liberation of | Civil War (2009–present)|2009 timeline of the  Civil War}}

Between 31 May and 9 June 2008, representatives of 's federal government and the Alliance for the Re-liberation of  (ARS) participated in peace talks in  brokered by the former United Nations Special Envoy to , [[Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah]]. The conference ended with a signed agreement calling for the withdrawal of  troops in exchange for the cessation of armed confrontation. Parliament was subsequently expanded to 550 seats to accommodate ARS members, which then elected [[Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed]], as president.
With the help of a small team of African Union troops, the TFG began a [[ Civil War (2009–present)|counteroffensive]] in February 2009 to assume full control of the southern half of the country. To solidify its rule, the TFG formed an alliance with the Islamic Courts Union, other members of the Alliance for the Re-liberation of , and [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]], a moderate [[Sufism|Sufi]] militia. Furthermore, Al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam, the two main Islamist groups in opposition, began to fight amongst themselves in mid-2009. As a truce, in March 2009, the TFG announced that it would reimplement Shari'a as the nation's official judicial system. However, conflict continued in the southern and central parts of the country. Within months, the TFG had gone from holding about 70% of south-central 's conflict zones, to losing control of over 80% of the disputed territory to the Islamist insurgents.

In October 2011, a coordinated operation, [[Operation Linda Nchi]] between the  and  militaries and multinational forces began against the Al-Shabaab in southern . By September 2012, , , and [[Raskamboni movement|Raskamboni]] forces had managed to capture Al-Shabaab's last major stronghold, the southern port of Kismayo. In July 2012, three European Union operations were launched to engage with : [[European Union Training Mission |EUTM ]], EU Naval Force  [[Operation Atalanta]] off the Horn of Africa, and EUCAP Nestor.

As part of the official "Roadmap for the End of Transition", a political process that provided clear benchmarks leading toward the formation of permanent democratic institutions in , the Transitional Federal Government's interim mandate ended on 20 August 2012. The [[Federal Parliament of ]] was concurrently inaugurated.

Much of  was inhabited by [[central Sudanic languages|Central Sudanic]]- and [[Kuliak languages|Kuliak]]-speaking farmers and herders until 3,000 years ago, when [[Bantu languages|Bantu speakers]] arrived in the south and [[Nilotic languages|Nilotic speakers]] arrived in the northeast. By 1500 AD, they had all been assimilated into [[Bantu peoples|Bantu-speaking cultures]] south of [[Mount Elgon]], the [[Nile River]], and [[Lake Kyoga]]. According to [[oral tradition]] and archaeological studies, the [[Empire of Kitara]] covered an important part of the [[Great Lakes of Africa|Great Lakes Area]], from the northern lakes [[Lake Albert ()|Albert]] and [[Lake Kyoga|Kyoga]] to the southern lakes [[Lake Victoria|Victoria]] and [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]]. Kitara is claimed as the antecedent of the [[Tooro Kingdom|Tooro]], [[Ankole]], and [[Busoga]] kingdoms. Some [[Luo people#|Luo]] invaded Kitara and assimilated with the Bantu society there, establishing the Biito dynasty of the current [[Omukama of Bunyoro|Omukama]] (ruler) of [[Bunyoro|Bunyoro-Kitara]].

[[Arab]] traders moved into the land from the  Ocean coast of East Africa in the 1830s for trade and commerce. In the late 1860s, [[Bunyoro]] in Mid-Western  found itself threatened from the north by -sponsored agents. Unlike the Arab traders from the East African coast who sought trade, these agents were promoting foreign conquest. In 1869, [[Khedive]] [[Ismail of |Ismail Pasha]] of , seeking to annex the territories north of the borders of [[Lake Victoria]] and east of [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] and "south of [[Gondokoro]]", sent a  explorer, [[Samuel Baker]], on a military expedition to the frontiers of Northern , with the objective of suppressing the slave-trade there and opening the way to commerce and "civilization". The Banyoro resisted Baker, who had to fight a desperate battle to secure his retreat. Baker regarded the resistance as an act of treachery, and he denounced the Banyoro in a book (''Ismailia – A Narrative Of The Expedition To Central Africa For The Suppression Of Slave Trade, Organised By Ismail, Khadive Of '' (1874)) that was widely read in Britain. Later, the  arrived in  with a predisposition against the kingdom of [[Bunyoro-Kitara|Bunyoro]] and sided with the kingdom of [[Buganda]]. This eventually cost Bunyoro half of its territory, which was given to Buganda as a reward from the . Two of the numerous "lost counties" were [[1964  lost counties referendum|restored to Bunyoro after independence]].

In the 1860s, while Arabs sought influence from the north,  explorers searching for the source of the [[Nile]] arrived in . They were followed by  Anglican missionaries who arrived in the kingdom of Buganda in 1877 and  Catholic missionaries in 1879. This situation gave rise to the death of the [[ Martyrs]] in 1885—after the conversion of [[Muteesa I of Buganda|Muteesa I]] and much of his court, and the succession of his [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]] son [[Mwanga II of Buganda|Mwanga.]] The  government chartered the [[Imperial  East Africa Company]] (IBEAC) to negotiate trade agreements in the region beginning in 1888.

From 1886, there was a series of religious wars in Buganda, initially between Muslims and Christians and then, from 1890, between "ba-Ingleza" Protestants and "ba-Fransa" Catholics. These factions were named after the imperial powers with which they were aligned. Because of civil unrest and financial burdens, IBEAC claimed that it was unable to "maintain their occupation" in the region.  commercial interests were ardent to protect the trade route of the Nile, which prompted the  government to annex Buganda and adjoining territories to create the  Protectorate in 1894.{{rp|3–4}}

=== Protectorate (1894–1962)===
{{main|Protectorate of }}
[[File:Flag of the  Protectorate.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Protectorate of ]]]]
The [[Protectorate of ]] was a [[protectorate]] of the [[ Empire]] from 1894 to 1962. In 1893, the [[Imperial  East Africa Company]] transferred its administration rights of territory consisting mainly of the Kingdom of [[Buganda]] to the  government. The [[Imperial  East Africa Company|IBEAC]] relinquished its control over  after  internal religious wars had driven it into bankruptcy.

In 1894, the  Protectorate was established, and the territory was extended beyond the borders of Buganda by signing more treaties with the other kingdoms ([[Toro (kingdom)|Toro]] in 1900, [[Ankole]] in 1901, and [[Bunyoro]] in 1933) to an area that roughly corresponds to that of present-day .

The status of [[protectorate]] meant that  retained a degree of self-government that would have otherwise been limited under a full colonial administration, compared to neighbouring [[]], which had been made a colony.

In the 1890s, 32,000 labourers from   were [[ diaspora in East Africa|recruited to East Africa]] under indentured labour contracts to construct the [[ Railway]]. Most of the surviving  returned home, but 6,724 decided to remain in East Africa after the line's completion. Subsequently, some became traders and took control of cotton ginning and sartorial retail.

From 1900 to 1920, a [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] epidemic in the southern part of , along the north shores of Lake Victoria, killed more than 250,000 people.

[[World War II]] encouraged the colonial administration of  to recruit 77,143 soldiers to serve in the [[King's African Rifles]].{{citation needed|date=December 2023}} They were seen in action in the [[Western Desert campaign]], the [[East African campaign (World War II)|Abyssinian campaign]], the [[Battle of ]] and the [[ campaign]].

===Independence (1962–1965)===
 gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962 with [[Queen Elizabeth II]] as head of state and [[Queen of ]]. In October 1963,  became a republic but maintained its membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

The first post-independence election, held in 1962, was won by an alliance between the [[ People's Congress]] (UPC) and [[Kabaka Yekka]] (KY). UPC and KY formed the first post-independence government with [[Milton Obote]] as executive prime minister, with the Buganda Kabaka (King) [[Mutesa II of Buganda|Edward Muteesa II]] holding the largely ceremonial position of president.

{{Overly detailed|section|details=|date=October 2025}}
[[File:Owen Falls Dam construction.jpg|thumb|right|Construction of the [[Nalubaale Hydroelectric Power Station|Owen Falls Dam]] in [[Jinja District|Jinja]]]]
's immediate post-independence years were dominated by the relationship between the central government and the largest regional kingdom, [[Buganda]].

[[File:Kabaka Muwenda Mutebi II ne Nnaabagereka Sylvia Nagginda.jpg|thumb|Kabaka Muwenda Mutebi II and his wife Sylvia Nagginda]]

The issue of how to manage the largest monarchy within the framework of a unitary state had been a problem since the  creation of the Protectorate of . Colonial governors had failed to come up with a formula that worked. This was further complicated by Buganda's nonchalant attitude to its relationship with the central government. Buganda never sought independence but rather appeared to be comfortable with a loose arrangement that guaranteed them privileges above the other subjects within the protectorate or a special status when the  left. This was evidenced in part by hostilities between the  colonial authorities and Buganda prior to independence.

Within Buganda, there were divisions between those who wanted the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]] to remain a dominant monarch and those who wanted to join with the rest of  to create a modern secular state. The split resulted in the creation of two dominant Buganda based parties – the Kabaka Yekka (Kabaka Only) KY, and the [[Democratic Party ()|Democratic Party]] (DP) that had roots in the Catholic Church. The bitterness between these two parties was extremely intense especially as the first elections for the post-Colonial parliament approached. The Kabaka particularly disliked the DP leader, [[Benedicto Kiwanuka]].

Outside Buganda, a soft-spoken politician from Northern , [[Milton Obote]], had forged an alliance of non-Buganda politicians to form the  People's Congress (UPC). The UPC at its heart was dominated by politicians who wanted to rectify what they saw as the regional inequality that favoured Buganda's special status. This drew in substantial support from outside Buganda. The party, however, remained a loose alliance of interests, but Obote showed great skill at negotiating them into a common ground based on a federal formula.

[[File: Printers Kampala 1950s.jpg|thumb|left|The  printers building on Kampala Road, Kampala, ]]

At Independence, the Buganda question remained unresolved.  was one of the few colonial territories that achieved independence without a dominant political party with a clear majority in parliament. In the pre-Independence elections, the UPC ran no candidates in Buganda and won 37 of the 61 directly elected seats (outside Buganda). The DP won 24 seats outside Buganda. The "special status" granted to Buganda meant that the 21 Buganda seats were elected by proportional representation reflecting the elections to the Buganda parliament – the Lukikko. KY won a resounding victory over DP, winning all 21 seats.

The UPC reached a peak at the end of 1964 when the leader of the DP in parliament, [[Basil Kiiza Bataringaya]], crossed the parliamentary floor with five other MPs, leaving DP with only nine seats. The DP MPs were not particularly happy that the hostility of their leader, Benedicto Kiwanuka, towards the Kabaka was hindering their chances of compromise with KY. The trickle of defections turned into a flood when 10 KY members crossed the floor when they realised the formal coalition with the UPC was no longer viable. Obote's charismatic speeches across the country were sweeping all before him, and the UPC was winning almost every local election held and increasing its control over all district councils and legislatures outside Buganda. The response from the Kabaka was mute – probably content in his ceremonial role and symbolism in his part of the country. However, there were also major divisions within his palace that made it difficult for him to act effectively against Obote. By the time  had become independent, Buganda "was a divided house with contending social and political forces" There were however problems brewing inside the UPC. As its ranks swelled, the ethnic, religious, regional, and personal interests began to shake the party. The party's apparent strength was eroded in a complex sequence of factional conflicts in its central and regional structures. And by 1966, the UPC was tearing itself apart. The conflicts were further intensified by the newcomers who had crossed the parliamentary floor from DP and KY.

The UPC delegates arrived in [[Gulu]] in 1964 for their delegates conference. Here was the first demonstration as to how Obote was losing control of his party. The battle over the Secretary-General of the party was a bitter contest between the new moderate's candidate – [[Grace Ibingira]] and the radical John Kakonge. Ibingira subsequently became the symbol of the opposition to Obote within the UPC. This is an important factor when looking at the subsequent events that led to the crisis between Buganda and the Central government. For those outside the UPC (including KY supporters), this was a sign that Obote was vulnerable. Keen observers realised the UPC was not a cohesive unit.

The collapse of the UPC-KY alliance openly revealed the dissatisfaction Obote and others had about Buganda's "special status". In 1964, the government responded to demands from some parts of the vast Buganda Kingdom that they were not the Kabaka's subjects. Prior to colonial rule, Buganda had been rivalled by the neighbouring [[Bunyoro]] kingdom. Buganda had conquered parts of Bunyoro and the  colonialists had formalised this in the Buganda Agreements. Known as the "lost counties", the people in these areas wished to revert to being part of Bunyoro. Obote decided to allow a referendum, which angered the Kabaka and most of the rest of Buganda. The residents of the counties voted to return to Bunyoro despite the Kabaka's attempts to influence the vote. Having lost the referendum, KY opposed the bill to pass the counties to Bunyoro, thus ending the alliance with the UPC.

The UPC, which had previously been a national party, began to break along tribal lines when Ibingira challenged Obote in the UPC. The "North/South" ethnic divide that had been evident in economic and social spheres now entrenched itself in politics. Obote surrounded himself with mainly northern politicians, while Ibingira's supporters who were subsequently arrested and jailed with him, were mainly from the South. In time, the two factions acquired ethnic labels – "Bantu" (the mainly Southern Ibingira faction) and "Nilotic" (the mainly Northern Obote faction). The perception that the government was at war with the Bantu was further enhanced when Obote arrested and imprisoned the mainly Bantu ministers who backed Ibingira.
[[File:SA18157-Crowned Crane - Żuraw Królewski.jpg|thumb|[[Grey crowned crane|Grey Crowned Crane]] – a symbol of |alt=]]
These labels brought into the mix two very powerful influences. First Buganda – the people of Buganda are Bantu and therefore naturally aligned to the Ibingira faction. The Ibingira faction further advanced this alliance by accusing Obote of wanting to overthrow the Kabaka. They were now aligned to opposing Obote. Second – the security forces – the  colonialists had recruited the army and police almost exclusively from Northern  due to their perceived suitability for these roles. At independence, the army and police was dominated by northern tribes – mainly Nilotic. They would now feel more affiliated to Obote, and he took full advantage of this to consolidate his power. In April 1966, Obote passed out eight hundred new army recruits at [[Moroto Town|Moroto]], of whom seventy per cent came from the Northern Region.

At the time, there was a tendency to perceive central government and security forces as dominated by "northerners," particularly the Acholi who through the UPC had significant access to government positions at the national level. In northern  there were also varied degrees of anti-Buganda feelings, particularly over the kingdom's "special status" before and after independence, and all the economic and social benefits that came with this status. "Obote brought significant numbers of northerners into the central state, both through the civil service and military, and created a patronage machine in Northern ". However, both "Bantu" and "Nilotic" labels represent significant ambiguities. The Bantu category for example includes both Buganda and Bunyoro – historically bitter rivals. The Nilotic label includes the Lugbara, Acholi, and Langi, all of whom have bitter rivalries that were to define 's military politics later. Despite these ambiguities, these events unwittingly brought to fore the northerner/southerner political divide which to some extent still influences  politics.

The UPC fragmentation continued as opponents sensed Obote's vulnerability. At local level where the UPC dominated most councils discontent began to challenge incumbent council leaders. Even in Obote's home district, attempts were made to oust the head of the local district council in 1966. A more worrying fact for the UPC was that the next national elections loomed in 1967 – and without the support of KY (who were now likely to back the DP), and the growing factionalism in the UPC, there was the real possibility that the UPC would be out of power in months.{{cn|date=February 2025}}

Obote went after KY with a new act of parliament in early 1966 that blocked any attempt by KY to expand outside Buganda. KY appeared to respond in parliament through one of their few remaining MPs, the terminally ill Daudi Ochieng. Ochieng was an irony – although from Northern , he had risen high in the ranks of KY and become a close confidant to the Kabaka who had gifted him with large land titles in Buganda. In Obote's absence from Parliament, Ochieng laid bare the illegal plundering of ivory and gold from the  that had been orchestrated by Obote's army chief of staff, Colonel [[Idi Amin]]. He further alleged that Obote, Onama and Neykon had all benefited from the scheme. Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favour of a motion to censure Amin and investigate Obote's involvement. This shook the government and raised tensions in the country.

KY further demonstrated its ability to challenge Obote from within his party at the UPC Buganda conference, where the Attorney General, Godfrey Binaisa, was ousted by a faction believed to have the backing of KY, Ibingira and other anti-Obote elements in Buganda. Obote's response was to arrest Ibingira and other ministers at a cabinet meeting and to assume special powers in February 1966. In March 1966, Obote also announced that the offices of President and vice-president would cease to exist – effectively dismissing the Kabaka. Obote also gave Amin more power – giving him the Army Commander position over the previous holder (Opolot) who had relations to Buganda through marriage (possibly believing Opolot would be reluctant to take military action against the Kabaka if it came to that). Obote abolished the constitution and effectively suspended elections due in a few months. Obote went on television and radio to accuse the Kabaka of various offences including requesting foreign troops which appears to have been explored by the Kabaka following the rumours of Amin plotting a coup. Obote further dismantled the authority of the Kabaka by announcing among other measures:
* The abolition of independent public service commissions for federal units. This removed the Kabaka's authority to appoint civil servants in Buganda.
* The abolition of the Buganda High Court – removing any judicial authority the Kabaka had.
* The bringing of Buganda financial management under further central control.
* Abolition of lands for Buganda chiefs. Land is one of the key sources of Kabaka's power over his subjects.

This set the stage for a conflict between Buganda and the central government. Within Buganda's political institutions, rivalries driven by religion and personal ambition made the institutions ineffective and unable to respond to the central government moves. The Kabaka was often regarded as aloof and unresponsive to advice from the younger Buganda politicians who better understood the new post-Independence politics, unlike the traditionalists who were ambivalent to what was going on as long as their traditional benefits were maintained. The Kabaka favoured the neo-traditionalists.

In May 1966, the Kabaka asked for foreign help, and the Buganda parliament demanded that the  government leave Buganda, including the capital, Kampala. In response Obote ordered Idi Amin to attack the Kabaka's palace. The battle for the Kabaka's palace was fierce – the Kabaka's guards putting up more resistance than had been expected. The  trained Captain – the Kabaka with about 120 armed men kept Idi Amin at bay for twelve hours. It is estimated that up to 2,000 people died in the battle which ended when the army called in heavier guns and overran the palace. The anticipated countryside uprising in Buganda did not materialise and a few hours later a beaming Obote met the press to relish his victory. The Kabaka escaped over the palace walls and was transported into exile in London by supporters. He died there three years later.

===1966–1971 (before the coup)===
In 1966, following a power struggle between the Obote-led government and King Muteesa, Obote suspended the constitution and removed the ceremonial president and vice-president. In 1967, a new constitution proclaimed  a republic and abolished the traditional kingdoms. Obote was declared the president.

===1971 (after the coup) –1979 (end of Amin regime)===
{{Main|Second Republic of }}
After a [[1971  coup d'état|military coup on 25 January 1971]], Obote was deposed from power and General [[Idi Amin]] seized control of the country. Amin ruled  as dictator with the support of the military for the next eight years. He carried out mass killings within the country to maintain his rule. An estimated 80,000–500,000  died during his regime. Aside from his brutalities, he [[Expulsion of Asians in  in 1972|forcibly removed]] the entrepreneurial [[ people|]] minority from .

In 1980, the [[ Bush War]] broke out, leading to [[Yoweri Museveni]] becoming president, as his forces toppled the previous regime in January 1986.{{sfn|Reid|2017|p=75}}

[[List of political parties in |Political parties in ]] were restricted in their activities beginning that year, in a measure ostensibly designed to reduce sectarian violence. In the [[non-partisan democracy|non-party]] "Movement" system instituted by Museveni, political parties continued to exist, but they could operate only a headquarters office. They could not open branches, hold rallies, or field candidates directly (although electoral candidates could belong to political parties). A constitutional referendum cancelled this nineteen-year ban on multi-party politics in July 2005.

In 1993, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited  during his six-day [[List of pastoral visits of Pope John Paul II|pastoral trip]] to urge  to seek reconciliation.

In the mid-to-late 1990s, Museveni was lauded by Western countries as part of a new generation of African leaders. His presidency has been marred, however, by invading and occupying the  during the [[Second  War]], resulting in an estimated 5.4 million deaths since 1998, and by participating in other conflicts in the [[Great Lakes (Africa)|Great Lakes region of Africa]]. He has struggled for years in the civil war against the Lord's Resistance Army, which has been guilty of numerous crimes against humanity, including [[child slavery]], the [[Atiak massacre]], and other mass murders. Conflict in northern  has killed thousands and displaced millions.

Parliament abolished presidential term limits in 2005, allegedly because Museveni used public funds to pay US$2,000 to each member of parliament who supported the measure. Presidential [[2006  general election|elections]] were held in February 2006. Museveni ran against several candidates, the most prominent of them being [[Kizza Besigye]].

On 20 February 2011, the  Electoral Commission declared Museveni the winning candidate of the 2011 [[2011  general election|elections]] that were held on 18 February 2011. The opposition however, were not satisfied with the results, condemning them as full of sham and rigging. According to the official results, Museveni won with 68 per cent of the votes. This easily topped his nearest challenger, Besigye, who had been Museveni's physician and told reporters that he and his supporters "downrightly snub" the outcome as well as the unremitting rule of Museveni or any person he may appoint. Besigye added that the rigged elections would definitely lead to an illegitimate leadership and that it is up to  to critically analyse this. The European Union's Election Observation Mission reported on improvements and flaws of the  electoral process: "The electoral campaign and polling day were conducted in a peaceful manner. However, the electoral process was marred by avoidable administrative and logistical failures that led to an unacceptable number of  citizens being disfranchised."

Since August 2012, hacktivist group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] has threatened  officials and hacked official government websites over its anti-gay bills. Some international donors have threatened to cut financial aid to the country if anti-gay bills continue.

Indicators of a plan for succession by the president's son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, have increased tensions.

Museveni has ruled the country since 1986 and he was last re-elected in the January 2021 presidential [[2021  general election|elections]]. According to official results Museveni won the elections with 58% of the vote while popstar-turned-politician [[Bobi Wine]] had 35%. The opposition challenged the result because of allegations of widespread fraud and irregularities. Another opposition candidate was 24-year-old John Katumba.
==History==
{{main|History of }}

===Pre-colonial era===
The indigenous [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] had been living in eastern  for at least a millennium before the arrival of the [[ Empire|]]. Western , the [[Gran Chaco]], was inhabited by nomads of whom the [[Guaycuru peoples|Guaycuru]] peoples were the most prominent. The  River was roughly the dividing line between the agricultural Guarani people to the east and the nomadic and seminomadic people to the west in the Gran Chaco. The [[Mbayá]] nomads were known for their warrior traditions and were not fully pacified until the late 19th century. These indigenous tribes belonged to five distinct language families, which were the bases of their major divisions. Differing language speaking groups were generally competitive over resources and territories. They were further divided into tribes by speaking languages in branches of these families. Today 17 separate [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups remain.

===Colonial era===
The first Europeans in the area were  explorers in 1516. The  explorer [[Juan de Salazar de Espinosa]] founded the settlement of [[Asunción]] on 15 August 1537. The city eventually became the center of a [[ colonization of the Americas| colonial province of ]].

An attempt to create an autonomous Christian  nation was undertaken by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missions and settlements in this part of South America in the eighteenth century. They developed Jesuit [[reductions]] to bring Guarani populations together at  missions and protect them from virtual slavery by  settlers and  slave raiders, the ''[[bandeirantes]]'', in addition to seeking their conversion to Christianity. Catholicism in  was influenced by the indigenous peoples: The [[syncretic]] religion has absorbed native elements. The ''reducciones'' flourished in eastern  for about 150 years, until the expulsion of the Jesuits by the  Crown in 1767. The ruins of two 18th century [[Jesuit Missions of La Santísima  de Paraná and Jesús de Tavarangue]] have been designated as [[World Heritage Sites]] by [[UNESCO]].

In western ,  settlement and Christianity were strongly resisted by the nomadic [[Guaycuru peoples|Guaycuru]] and other nomads from the 16th century onward. Most of these peoples were absorbed into the [[mestizo]] population in the 18th and 19th centuries.

===Independence and rule of Francia===
{{main|Independence of }}
[[File:José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia]], 's first dictator]]
 overthrew the local  administration on 14 May 1811. 's first dictator was [[José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia]], who ruled  from 1814 until his death in 1840 with very little outside contact or influence. He intended to create a [[utopia]]n society based on the [[Geneva]]n theorist [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s [[The Social Contract|''Social Contract'']]. Rodríguez de Francia was nicknamed ''El Supremo''.

Rodríguez de Francia established new laws that greatly reduced the powers of the Catholic church (Catholicism was then an established state religion) and the cabinet, forbade colonial citizens from marrying one another and allowed them to marry only blacks, [[mulattoes]] or natives, in order to break the power of colonial-era elites and to create a [[mixed-race]] or mestizo society. He cut off relations between  and the rest of South America. Because of Francia's restrictions of freedom, [[Fulgencio Yegros]] and several other Independence-era leaders in 1820 planned a ''coup d'état'' against Francia, who discovered the plot and had its leaders either executed or imprisoned for life.

===Rule of the López family===
[[File:1864 Mitchell Map of ,  and Chili - Geographicus - SouthAmericaSouth-mitchell-1864.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.25|Political map of the region, 1864]]

After Francia's death in 1840,  was ruled by various military officers under a new ''[[military junta|junta militar]]'', until [[Carlos Antonio López]] (allegedly Rodríguez de Francia's nephew) came to power in 1841. López modernized  and opened it to foreign commerce. He signed a [[nonaggression pact]] with  and officially declared independence of  in 1842. After López's death in 1862, power was transferred to his eldest son, [[Francisco Solano López]].

The regime of the López family was characterized by pervasive and rigid centralism in production and distribution. There was no distinction between the public and the private spheres, and the López family ruled the country as it would a large estate.

The government exerted control on all exports. The export of [[yerba mate]] and valuable wood products maintained the balance of trade between  and the outside world. The  government was extremely protectionist, never accepted loans from abroad and levied high [[tariff]]s against imported foreign products. This [[protectionism]] made the society self-sufficient, and it also avoided the debt suffered by  and . Slavery existed in , although not in great numbers, until 1844, when it was legally abolished in the new constitution.{{rp|39–40}}

[[Francisco Solano López]], the son of Carlos Antonio López, replaced his father as the President-Dictator in 1862, and generally continued the political policies of his father. Both wanted to give an international image of  as "democratic and republican", but in fact, the ruling family had almost total control of all public life in the country, including church and colleges.{{rp|41–42}}

Militarily, Carlos Antonio López modernized and expanded industry and the [[ Army]] and greatly strengthened the strategic defenses of  by developing the [[Fortress of Humaitá]]. The government hired more than 200 foreign technicians, who installed [[telegraph line]]s and railroads to aid the expanding steel, textile, paper and ink, naval construction, weapons and gunpowder industries. The [[Ybycuí]] foundry, completed in 1850, manufactured cannons, mortars and bullets of all calibers. River warships were built in the shipyards of Asunción. Fortifications were built, especially along the [[Apa River]] and in [[Gran Chaco]].{{rp|22}} Following the death of Carlos Antonio López, these projects continued under his son Francisco Solano.

In terms of socio-economic development, the country was dubbed "the most advanced Republic in South America", notably by the  judge and politician [[Robert Phillimore|Sir Robert Phillimore]].

According to George Thompson, Lieutenant Colonel of Engineers in the  Army prior to and during the war, López's government was comparatively a good one for :
{{blockquote|Probably in no other country in the world has life and property been so secure as all over  during his (Antonio Lopez's) reign. Crime was almost unknown, and when committed, immediately detected and punished. The mass of the people was, perhaps, the happiest in existence. They had hardly to do any work to gain a livelihood. Each family had its house or hut in its own ground. They planted, in a few days, enough tobacco, maize and mandioca for their own consumption [...]. Having at every hut a grove of oranges [...] and also a few cows, they were almost throughout the year under little necessity [...]. The higher classes, of course, lived more in the European way...|George Thompson, C.E.}}

Afterward, the [[ Republic]], the [[Empire of ]] and the Republic of  signed the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Secret Treaty of the Triple Alliance]] against the  Government on 1 May 1865.

On 24 May 1866, the [[Battle of Tuyutí]] led to the loss of 6,000 men when a  attack was repelled by the Allies. It was marked as the bloodiest battle in South America during the war.

The  put up a ferocious resistance but ultimately lost in 1870 in the [[Battle of Cerro Corá]], where Marshal Solano López refused to surrender and died in action.

In 1904, the Liberal revolution against the rule of Colorados broke out. The Liberal rule started a period of great political instability. Between 1904 and 1954,  had thirty-one [[President of |presidents]], most of whom were removed from office by force. Conflicts between the factions of the ruling Liberal party led to the [[ Civil War (1922)| Civil War of 1922]].

The unresolved border conflict with  over the Chaco region finally erupted in the early 1930s in the [[Chaco War]]. After both sides suffered great losses,  defeated  and established its sovereignty over most of the disputed Chaco region. After the war, military officers used popular dissatisfaction with the Liberal politicians to seize the power for themselves. On 17 February 1936, the [[February Revolution ()|February Revolution]] brought colonel [[Rafael Franco]] to power. Between 1940 and 1948, the country was ruled by general [[Higinio Morínigo]]. Dissatisfaction with his rule resulted in the [[ Civil War (1947)| civil war of 1947]]. In its aftermath [[Alfredo Stroessner]] began involvement in a string of plots, which resulted in his military [[1954  coup d'état|coup d'état of 4 May 1954]]. In the aftermath of [[World War II]],  became a hideout for [[Ratlines (World War II aftermath)|Nazi fugitives]] accused of war crimes.

===Stroessner era, 1954–1989===
{{see also|El Stronato|Operation Condor}}
A series of unstable governments ensued until the establishment in 1954 of the regime of dictator [[Alfredo Stroessner]], who remained in office for more than three decades until 1989.  was modernized to some extent under Stroessner's regime, although his rule was marked by extensive human rights abuses.

Stroessner and the ''Colorado'' party ruled the country from 1954 to 1989. The dictator oversaw an era of economic expansion, but also had a poor human rights and environmental record (see "Political History").  actively participated in [[Operation Condor]]. Torture and death for political opponents was routine. After his overthrow, the ''Colorado'' continued to dominate national politics until 2008.

The splits in the ''Colorado'' Party in the 1980s, and the prevailing conditions – Stroessner's advanced age, the character of the regime, the economic downturn, and [[international isolation]] – were catalysts for anti-regime demonstrations and statements by the opposition prior to the 1988 general elections.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

''[[Authentic Radical Liberal Party|PLRA]]'' leader [[Domingo Laíno]] served as the focal point of the opposition in the second half of the 1980s. The government's effort to isolate Laíno by exiling him in 1982 had backfired. On his sixth attempt to reenter the country in 1986, Laíno returned with three television crews from the U.S., a former  ambassador to , and a group of  and  congressmen. Despite the international contingent, the police violently barred Laíno's return.

The Stroessner regime relented in April 1987, and permitted Laíno to return to Asunción. Laíno took the lead in organizing demonstrations and reducing infighting among the opposition party. The opposition was unable to reach agreement on a common strategy regarding the elections, with some parties advocating abstention, and others calling for blank voting. The parties held numerous 'lightning demonstrations' (''mítines relámpagos''), especially in rural areas. Such demonstrations were gathered and quickly disbanded before the arrival of the [[police]].

In response to the upsurge in opposition activities, Stroessner condemned the Accord for advocating "sabotage of the general elections and disrespect of the law". He used national police and civilian [[vigilantes]] of the ''Colorado'' Party to break up demonstrations. A number of opposition leaders were imprisoned or otherwise harassed. {{ill|Hermes Rafael Saguier|es}}, another key leader of the ''PLRA'', was imprisoned for four months in 1987 on charges of sedition. In early February 1988, police arrested 200 people attending a National Coordinating Committee meeting in [[Coronel Oviedo]]. Laíno and several other opposition figures were arrested before dawn on the day of the election, 14 February, and held for twelve hours. The government declared Stroessner's reelection with 89% of the vote.

The opposition attributed the results in part to the virtual Colorado monopoly on the mass media. They noted that 53% of those polled indicated that there was an "uneasiness" in  society. 74% believed that the political situation needed changes, including 45% who wanted a substantial or total change. Finally, 31% stated that they planned to abstain from voting in the February elections.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

===Stroessner's overthrow, post-1989===
On 3 February 1989, Stroessner was overthrown in a military coup headed by General [[Andrés Rodríguez (President)|Andrés Rodríguez]]. As president, Rodríguez instituted political, legal, and economic reforms and initiated a ''rapprochement'' with the international community. Reflecting the deep hunger of the rural poor for land, hundreds immediately occupied thousands of acres of unused territories belonging to Stroessner and his associates; by mid-1990, 19,000 families occupied {{convert|340000|acres|-3|abbr=on}}. At the time, 2.06 million people lived in rural areas, more than half of the 4.1 million total population, and most were landless.

The June 1992 constitution established a democratic system of government and dramatically improved protection of fundamental human rights. In May 1993, Colorado Party candidate [[Juan Carlos Wasmosy]] was elected as 's first civilian president in almost forty years, in what international observers deemed free and fair elections.

With support from the , the Organization of  States, and other countries in the region, the  people rejected an April 1996 attempt by then Army Chief General [[Lino Oviedo]] to oust President Wasmosy.

Oviedo was nominated as the Colorado candidate for president in the 1998 election. However, when the Supreme Court upheld in April his conviction on charges related to the 1996 coup attempt, he was not allowed to run and was detained in jail. His former running mate, [[Raúl ]], became the Colorado Party's candidate, and was elected in May in elections deemed by international observers to be free and fair. One of ' first acts after taking office in August was to commute Oviedo's sentence and release him. In December 1998, 's Supreme Court declared these actions unconstitutional. In this tense atmosphere, the murder of Vice President and long-time Oviedo rival [[Luis María Argaña]] on 23 March 1999, led the Chamber of Deputies to impeach  the next day.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} On 26 March, eight student anti-government demonstrators were murdered, widely believed to have been carried out by Oviedo supporters. This increased opposition to , who resigned on 28 March. Senate President [[Luis González Macchi]], a  opponent, was peacefully sworn in as president the same day.

In 2003, [[Nicanor Duarte]] was elected as president.

===Election of Fernando Lugo===
For the 2008 general elections, the Colorado Party was favored in polls. Their candidate was Minister of Education [[Blanca Ovelar]], the first woman to be nominated as a candidate for a major party in  history. After sixty years of Colorado rule, voters chose [[Fernando Lugo]], a former Roman Catholic Bishop and not a professional politician in civil government, and a member of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, 's largest opposition party. Lugo was an adherent of [[liberation theology]]. Lugo achieved a historic victory in 's presidential election, defeating the ruling party candidate, and ending 61 years of conservative rule. Lugo won with nearly 41% of the vote, compared to almost 31% for Blanca Ovelar of the Colorado party. Outgoing President [[Nicanor Duarte|Nicanor Duarte Frutos]] hailed the moment as the first time in the history of the nation that a government had transferred power to opposition forces in a constitutional and peaceful fashion.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

Lugo was sworn in on 15 August 2008. The Lugo administration set its two major priorities as the reduction of corruption and economic inequality.

[[File:Saludo de Piñera a Cartes (cropped).jpg|thumb|Inauguration of former President [[Horacio Cartes]], 15 August 2013]] 
Political instability following Lugo's election and disputes within his cabinet encouraged some renewal of popular support for the Colorado Party. Reports suggested that the businessman [[Horacio Cartes]] became the new political figure amid disputes. Despite the US [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]'s strong accusations against Cartes related to [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]], he continued to amass followers in the political arena.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

On 14 January 2011, the Colorado Party convention nominated Horacio Cartes as the presidential candidate for the party. However, the party's constitution did not allow it.{{clarify|date=April 2012}}
On 21 June 2012, [[Impeachment of Fernando Lugo|impeachment proceedings against President Lugo]] began in the country's lower house, which was controlled by his opponents. Lugo was given less than twenty-four hours to prepare for the proceedings and only two hours in which to mount a defense. Impeachment was quickly approved and the resulting trial in 's Senate, also controlled by the opposition, ended with the removal of Lugo from office and Vice President Federico Franco assuming the duties of president. Lugo's rivals blamed him for the deaths of 17 people – eight police officers and nine farmers – in armed clashes after police were ambushed by armed peasants when enforcing an eviction order against rural trespassers.

On 14 May 2011,  celebrated its [[ Bicentennial|bicentenary]] on the 200th anniversary of independence from the  Empire as a sovereign state.

Lugo's supporters gathered outside Congress to protest the decision as a "politically motivated coup d'état". Lugo's removal from office on 22 June 2012 is considered by [[UNASUR]] and other neighboring countries, especially those currently governed by leftist leaders, as a coup d'état. However, the Organization of  States, which sent a mission to  to gather information, concluded that the impeachment process was not a coup d'état, as it had been carried out in accordance with the [[Constitution of ]].

===Present day===
From August 2013 to 15 August 2018, the [[President of ]] was [[Horacio Cartes]]. Since 15 August 2018, the [[President of ]] has been [[Mario Abdo Benítez]]. They are both from the conservative [[Colorado Party ()|Colorado Party]]. President Mario Abdo enjoyed a close relationship with the  far-right president (in power 2019–2022), [[Jair Bolsonaro]]. In February 2019, President Mario Abdo Benitez was at Bolsonaro's side when Bolsonaro praised  military dictator Alfredo Stroessner, calling him "a man of vision". In 2021,  became the first country in South America to produce electric energy in its [[100% renewable energy]] supply. In May 2023, [[Santiago Peña]] of the long-ruling Colorado Party, won the presidential [[2023  general election|election]] to succeed Mario Abdo as the next [[President of ]]. On 15 August 2023, Santiago Peña was sworn in as 's new president.

[[Affad 23]] is an [[archaeological site]] located in the [[Affad Basin|Affad]] region of southern Dongola Reach in northern , which hosts "the well-preserved remains of prehistoric camps (relics of the oldest [[Natural environment|open-air]] hut in the world) and diverse [[hunting]] and [[Hunter-gatherer|gathering]] loci some 50,000 years old".

By the eighth millennium BC, people of a [[Neolithic]] culture had settled into a sedentary way of life there in fortified [[mudbrick]] villages, where they supplemented hunting and fishing on the Nile with grain gathering and cattle herding. Neolithic peoples created cemeteries such as [[R12 (cemetery)|R12]]. During the fifth millennium BC, migrations from the drying Sahara brought neolithic people into the Nile Valley along with agriculture.

The population that resulted from this cultural and genetic mixing developed a social hierarchy over the next centuries which became the [[Kingdom of Kerma]] at 2500 BC. Anthropological and archaeological research indicates that during the predynastic period  and Nagadan Upper  were ethnically and culturally nearly identical, and thus, simultaneously evolved systems of pharaonic kingship by 3300 BC.

The Kerma culture was an early civilization centered in [[Kerma]], . It flourished from around 2500 BC to 1500 BC in ancient [[]]. The Kerma culture was based in the southern part of , or "[[Upper ]]" (in parts of present-day northern and central ), and later extended its reach northward into Lower  and the border of . The polity seems to have been one of several [[Nile Valley]] states during the [[Middle Kingdom of ]]. In the Kingdom of Kerma's latest phase, lasting from about 1700–1500 BC, it absorbed the  kingdom of [[Saï (island)|Saï]] and became a sizable, populous empire rivaling .

This is the earliest  reference to ''Kush''; the [[]]n region had gone by other names in the Old Kingdom. Under [[Thutmose I]],  made several campaigns south.

The  ruled Kush in the New kingdom beginning when the  King Thutmose I occupied Kush and destroyed its capital, Kerma.

This eventually resulted in their annexation of  {{Circa|1504 BC}}. Around 1500 BC,  was absorbed into the [[New Kingdom of ]], but rebellions continued for centuries. After the conquest, Kerma culture was increasingly Egyptianized, yet rebellions continued for 220 years until {{Circa|1300 BC}}.  nevertheless became a key province of the New Kingdom, economically, politically, and spiritually. Indeed, major pharaonic ceremonies were held at Jebel Barkal near Napata. As an  colony from the 16th century BC,  ("Kush") was governed by an  [[Viceroy of Kush]].

Resistance to the early eighteenth Dynasty  rule by neighboring Kush is evidenced in the writings of [[Ahmose, son of Ebana]], an  warrior who served under Nebpehtrya Ahmose (1539–1514 BC), Djeserkara Amenhotep I (1514–1493 BC), and Aakheperkara Thutmose I (1493–1481 BC). At the end of the [[Second Intermediate Period of |Second Intermediate Period]] (mid-sixteenth century BC),  faced the twin existential threats—the [[Hyksos]] in the North and the Kushites in the South. Taken from the autobiographical inscriptions on the walls of his tomb-chapel, the  undertook campaigns to defeat Kush and conquer  under the rule of [[Amenhotep I]] (1514–1493 BC). In Ahmose's writings, the Kushites are described as [[archery|archers]], "Now after his Majesty had slain the Bedoin of Asia, he sailed upstream to [[Upper ]] to destroy the Nubian bowmen." The tomb writings contain two other references to the Nubian bowmen of Kush. By 1200 BC,  involvement in the [[Dongola Reach]] was nonexistent.

's international prestige had declined considerably towards the end of the [[Third Intermediate Period of |Third Intermediate Period]]. Its historical allies, the inhabitants of [[Canaan]], had fallen to the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365–1020 BC), and then the resurgent [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (935–605 BC). The [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], from the tenth century BC onwards, had once more expanded from northern [[Mesopotamia]], and conquered a vast empire, including the whole of the [[Near East]], and much of [[]], the eastern [[Mediterranean]], the [[Caucasus]] and [[History of #Early Iron Age|early Iron Age ]].

According to Josephus Flavius, the biblical Moses led the  army in a siege of the Kushite city of Meroe. To end the siege Princess Tharbis was given to Moses as a (diplomatic) bride, and thus the  army retreated back to .

The [[Kingdom of Kush]] was an ancient [[]]n state centred on the confluences of the [[Blue Nile]] and [[White Nile]], and the [[Atbarah River]] and the [[Nile|Nile River]]. It was established after the [[Bronze Age]] collapse and the disintegration of the [[New Kingdom of ]]; it was centred at Napata in its early phase.

After King [[Kashta]] ("the Kushite") invaded  in the eighth century BC, the Kushite kings ruled as pharaohs of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of ]] for nearly a century before being defeated and driven out by the [[Assyria]]ns. At the height of their glory, the Kushites conquered an empire that stretched from what is now known as [[South Kordofan]] to the Sinai. Pharaoh [[Piye]] attempted to expand the empire into the Near East but was thwarted by the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]].

Between 800 BCE and 100 AD the [[Nubian pyramids]] were built, among them can be named [[El-Kurru]], [[Kashta]], [[Piye]], [[Tantamani]], [[Shabaka]], Pyramids of [[Jebel Barkal|Gebel Barkal]], [[Pyramids of Meroe (Begarawiyah)]], the [[Sedeinga pyramids]], and [[Nuri|Pyramids of Nuri]].

The Kingdom of Kush is mentioned in the Bible as having saved the Israelites from the wrath of the Assyrians, although disease among the besiegers might have been one of the reasons for the failure to take the city.{{page needed|date=June 2013}}
The war that took place between Pharaoh [[Taharqa]] and the Assyrian king [[Sennacherib]] was a decisive event in Western history, with the Nubians being defeated in their attempts to gain a foothold in the [[Near East]] by Assyria. Sennacherib's successor [[Esarhaddon]] went further and invaded  itself to secure his control of the Levant. This succeeded, as he managed to expel Taharqa from Lower . Taharqa fled back to Upper  and , where he died two years later. Lower  came under Assyrian vassalage but proved unruly, unsuccessfully rebelling against the Assyrians. Then, the king [[Tantamani]], a successor of Taharqa, made a final determined attempt to regain Lower  from the newly reinstated Assyrian vassal [[Necho I]]. He managed to retake [[Memphis, |Memphis]] killing Necho in the process and besieged cities in the Nile Delta. [[Ashurbanipal]], who had succeeded Esarhaddon, sent a large army in  to regain control. He routed Tantamani near Memphis and, pursuing him, [[Sack of Thebes|sacked Thebes]]. Although the Assyrians immediately departed Upper  after these events, weakened, Thebes peacefully submitted itself to Necho's son [[Psamtik I]] less than a decade later. This ended all hopes of a revival of the Nubian Empire, which rather continued in the form of a smaller kingdom centred on [[Napata]]. The city was raided by the  {{circa}} 590 BC, and sometime soon after to the late-3rd century BC, the Kushite resettled in [[Meroë]].

=== Medieval Christian Nubian kingdoms (c. 350–1500) ===

On the turn of the fifth century the [[Blemmyes]] established a short-lived state in Upper  and Lower , probably centred around Talmis ([[Kalabsha]]), but before 450 they were already driven out of the Nile Valley by the Nobatians. The latter eventually founded a kingdom on their own, [[Nobatia]].{{sfn|Welsby|2002|pp=16–22}}
By the sixth century there were in total three Nubian kingdoms: Nobatia in the north, which had its capital at Pachoras ([[Faras]]); the central kingdom, [[Makuria]] centred at Tungul ([[Old Dongola]]), about {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=off|0}} south of modern [[Dongola]]; and [[Alodia]], in the heartland of the old Kushitic kingdom, which had its capital at [[Soba (city)|Soba]] (now a suburb of modern-day Khartoum).{{sfn|Welsby|2002|pp=24, 26}} Still in the sixth century they converted to Christianity.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|pp=16–17}} In the seventh century, probably at some point between 628 and 642, Nobatia was incorporated into Makuria.{{sfn|Werner|2013|p=77}}

Between 639 and 641 the Muslim Arabs of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] conquered [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] . In [[First Battle of Dongola|641 or 642]] and again in [[Second Battle of Dongola|652]] they invaded  but were repelled, making the Nubians one of the few who managed to defeat the Arabs during the [[Islamic expansion]]. Afterward the Makurian king and the Arabs agreed on a [[Baqt|unique non-aggression pact that also included an annual exchange of gifts]], thus acknowledging Makuria's independence.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|pp=68–70}} While the Arabs failed to conquer  they began to settle east of the Nile, where they eventually founded several port towns{{sfn|Hasan|1967|p=31}} and intermarried with the local [[Beja people|Beja]].{{sfn|Welsby|2002|pp=77–78}}

From the late 11th/12th century, Makuria's capital Dongola was in decline, and Alodia's capital declined in the 12th century as well.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|p=252}} In the 14th and 15th centuries [[Bedouin]] tribes overran most of ,{{sfn|Hasan|1967|p=176}} migrating to the [[Butana]], the [[Gezira (state)|Gezira]], [[Kordofan]] and [[Darfur]].{{sfn|Hasan|1967|p=145}} In 1365 a civil war forced the Makurian court to flee to [[Gebel Adda]] in [[Lower ]], while Dongola was destroyed and left to the Arabs. Afterwards Makuria continued to exist only as a petty kingdom.{{sfn|Werner|2013|pp=143–145}} After the prosperous{{sfn|Lajtar|2011|pp=130–131}} reign of king [[Joel of Dotawo|Joel]] ({{floruit}} 1463–1484) Makuria collapsed.{{sfn|Ruffini|2012|p=256}} Coastal areas from southern  up to the port city of [[Suakin]] was succeeded by the [[Adal Sultanate]] in the fifteenth century.{{sfn|Levtzion|Pouwels|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=J1Ipt5A9mLMC&pg=PA229 229]}} To the south, the kingdom of Alodia fell to either the Arabs, commanded by tribal leader [[Abdallah Jamma]], or the [[Funj]], an African people originating from the south.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|p=255}} Datings range from the [[Hijri year|9th century after the Hijra]] ({{circa}} 1396–1494),{{sfn|Vantini|1975|pp=786–787}} the late 15th century,{{sfn|Hasan|1967|p=133}} 1504{{sfn|Vantini|1975|p=784}} to 1509.{{sfn|Vantini|2006|pp=487–489}} An alodian rump state might have survived in the form of the [[kingdom of Fazughli]], lasting until 1685.{{sfn|Spaulding|1974|pp=12–30}}

Soon the Funj came in conflict with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], who had occupied [[Suakin]] {{circa|1526}}{{sfn|Peacock|2012|p=98}} and eventually pushed south along the Nile, reaching the third Nile cataract area in 1583/1584. A subsequent Ottoman attempt to capture Dongola was [[battle of Hannik|repelled]] by the Funj in 1585.{{sfn|Peacock|2012|pp=96–97}} Afterwards, [[Hannik]], located just south of the third cataract, would mark the border between the two states.{{sfn|O'Fahey|Spaulding|1974|p=35}} The aftermath of the Ottoman invasion saw the attempted usurpation of [[Ajib the Great|Ajib]], a minor king of northern .<!--He is said to have conquered eastern  http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:586255/FULLTEXT01.pdf p. 17 Paul 77,81-83--><!--In around 1580 he conquered eastern  and northwestern , --> While the Funj eventually killed him in 1611/1612 his successors, the [[Abdallabi tribe|Abdallab]], were granted to govern everything north of the confluence of Blue and White Niles with considerable autonomy.{{sfn|O'Fahey|Spaulding|1974|pp=36–40}}

In 1821, the Ottoman ruler of , [[Muhammad Ali of ]], invaded and conquered northern . Although technically the [[Vali (governor)|Vali]] of  under the [[Ottoman Empire]], Muhammad Ali styled himself as [[Khedive]] of a virtually independent . Seeking to add  to his domains, he sent his third son Ismail (not to be confused with [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismaʻil Pasha]] mentioned later) to conquer the country, and subsequently incorporate it into . With the exception of the Shaiqiya and the Darfur sultanate in Kordofan, he was met without resistance. The  policy of conquest was expanded and intensified by [[Ibrahim Pasha of |Ibrahim Pasha]]'s son, Ismaʻil, under whose reign most of the remainder of modern-day  was conquered.

The  authorities made significant improvements to the  infrastructure (mainly in the north), especially with regard to irrigation and cotton production. In 1879, the [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)|Great Powers]] forced the removal of Ismail and established his son [[Tewfik Pasha]] in his place.

During the Khedivial period, dissent had spread due to harsh taxes imposed on most activities. Taxation on irrigation wells and farming lands were so high most farmers abandoned their farms and livestock. During the 1870s, European initiatives against the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] had an adverse impact on the economy of northern , precipitating the rise of [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdist]] forces. [[Muhammad Ahmad|Muhammad Ahmad ibn Abd Allah]], the ''[[Mahdi]]'' (Guided One), offered to the ''ansars'' (his followers) and those who surrendered to him a choice between adopting Islam or being killed. The Mahdiyah (Mahdist regime) imposed traditional Sharia [[Sharia|Islamic law]]s. On 12 August 1881, an incident occurred at [[Battle of Aba|Aba Island]], sparking the outbreak of what became the [[Mahdist War]].

From his announcement of the Mahdiyya in June 1881 until the [[Siege of Khartoum|fall of Khartoum]] in January 1885, Muhammad Ahmad led a [[Mahdist War|successful military campaign]] against the Turco- government of the , known as the [[Turkiyah]]. Muhammad Ahmad died on 22 June 1885, a mere six months after the conquest of Khartoum. After a power struggle amongst his deputies, [[Abdallahi ibn Muhammad]], with the help primarily of the [[Baggara]] of western , overcame the opposition of the others and emerged as the unchallenged leader of the Mahdiyah. After consolidating his power, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad assumed the title of ''Khalifa'' (successor) of the Mahdi, instituted an administration, and appointed [[Ansar ()|Ansar]] (who were usually [[Baggara]]) as emirs over each of the several provinces.

Regional relations remained tense throughout much of the Mahdiyah period, largely because of the Khalifa's brutal methods to extend his rule throughout the country. In 1887, a 60,000-man Ansar army invaded [[]], penetrating as far as [[Gondar]]. In March 1889, king [[Yohannes IV]] of  marched on [[Metemma]]; however, after Yohannes fell in battle, the  forces withdrew.

Apart from these political considerations, Britain wanted to establish control over the Nile to safeguard a planned irrigation dam at [[Aswan]]. [[Herbert Kitchener]] led military campaigns against the [[Mahdist ]] from 1896 to 1898. Kitchener's campaigns culminated in a decisive victory in the [[Battle of Omdurman]] on 2 September 1898.

In 1905 local chieftain Sultan Yambio, reluctant to the end, gave up the struggle with  forces that had occupied the [[Kordofan]] region, finally ending the lawlessness. Ordinances published by Britain enacted a system of taxation. This was following the precedent set by the Khalifa. The main taxes were recognized. These taxes were on land, herds, and date-palms. The continued  administration of  fuelled an increasingly strident nationalist backlash, with  nationalist leaders determined to force Britain to recognise a single independent union of  and .

From 1924 until independence in 1956, the  had a policy of running  as two essentially separate territories; the north and south. The [[Lee Stack|assassination of a Governor-General of Anglo-  in Cairo]] was the causative factor; it brought demands of the newly elected [[Wafd Party|Wafd]] government from colonial forces. A permanent establishment of two battalions in Khartoum was renamed the [[ Defence Force]] acting as under the government, replacing the former garrison of  army soldiers, saw action afterward during the [[Abyssinia Crisis|Walwal Incident]].{{sfn|Morewood|2005|p=4}} The [[Wafdist]] parliamentary majority had rejected [[Abdel Khalek Sarwat Pasha|Sarwat Pasha]]'s accommodation plan with [[Austen Chamberlain]] in London; yet Cairo still needed the money. The  Government's revenue had reached a peak in 1928 at £6.6&nbsp;million, thereafter the Wafdist disruptions, and  borders incursions from Somaliland, London decided to reduce expenditure during the Great Depression. Cotton and gum exports were dwarfed by the necessity to import almost everything from Britain leading to a balance of payments deficit at Khartoum.{{sfn|Daly|pp=457–459}}

In July 1936 the Liberal Constitutional leader, Muhammed Mahmoud was persuaded to bring Wafd delegates to London to sign the Anglo- Treaty, "the beginning of a new stage in Anglo- relations", wrote [[Anthony Eden]].{{sfn|Morewood|1940|pp=94–95}} The  Army was allowed to return to  to protect the Canal Zone.

The  Government was directly involved militarily in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]]. Formed in 1925, the [[ Defence Force]] played an active part in responding to incursions early in World War Two.  troops occupied [[Kassala]] and other border areas from [[ East Africa| Somaliland]] during 1940. In 1942, the SDF also played a part in the invasion of the  colony by  and Commonwealth forces. The last  [[governor-general]] was [[Robert George Howe]].

The [[ revolution of 1952]] finally heralded the beginning of the march towards  independence. Having abolished the monarchy in 1953, 's new leaders, [[Mohammed Naguib]], whose mother was , and later [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], believed the only way to end  domination in  was for  to officially abandon its claims of sovereignty. In addition, Nasser knew it would be difficult for  to govern an impoverished  after its independence. The  on the other hand continued their political and financial support for the Mahdist successor, [[Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi]], who it was believed would resist  pressure for  independence. Abd al-Rahman was capable of this, but his regime was plagued by political ineptitude, which garnered a colossal loss of support in northern and central . Both  and Britain sensed a great instability fomenting, and thus opted to allow both  regions, north and south to have a free vote on whether they wished independence or a  withdrawal.

[[File: independence 2.png|upright=1.05|thumb|'s flag raised at independence ceremony on 1 January 1956 by the Prime Minister Ismail al-Azhari and in presence of opposition leader Mohamed Ahmed Almahjoub]]
A polling process was carried out resulting in the composition of a democratic parliament and [[Ismail al-Azhari]] was elected first Prime Minister and led the first modern  government. On 1 January 1956, in a special ceremony held at the People's Palace, the  and  flags were lowered and the new  flag, composed of green, blue and yellow stripes, was raised in their place by the prime minister [[Ismail al-Azhari]].

Dissatisfaction culminated in a [[1969  coup d'état|coup d'état]] on 25 May 1969. The coup leader, Col. [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], became prime minister, and the new regime abolished parliament and outlawed all political parties. Disputes between [[Marxist]] and non-Marxist elements within the ruling military coalition resulted in [[1971  coup d'état|a briefly successful coup in July 1971]], led by the [[ Communist Party]]. Several days later, anti-communist military elements restored Nimeiry to power.

In 1972, the [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|Addis Ababa Agreement]] led to a cessation of the north–south civil war and a degree of self-rule. This led to ten years hiatus in the civil war but an end to  investment in the [[Jonglei Canal]] project. This had been considered absolutely essential to irrigate the Upper Nile region and to prevent an environmental catastrophe and wide-scale [[famine]] among the local tribes, most especially the Dinka.{{cn|date=July 2025}} In the civil war that followed their homeland was raided, looted, pillaged, and burned. Many of the tribe were murdered in a bloody civil war that raged for over 20 years.

Until the early 1970s, 's agricultural output was mostly dedicated to internal consumption. In 1972, the  government became more pro-Western and made plans to export food and [[cash crop]]s. However, commodity prices declined throughout the 1970s causing economic problems for . At the same time, debt servicing costs, from the money spent mechanizing agriculture, rose. In 1978, the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] negotiated a [[Structural Adjustment Program]] with the government. This further promoted the mechanised export agriculture sector. This caused great hardship for the pastoralists of . In 1976, the Ansars had mounted a bloody but unsuccessful coup attempt. But in July 1977, President Nimeiry met with Ansar leader [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]], opening the way for a possible reconciliation. Hundreds of political prisoners were released, and in August a general amnesty was announced for all oppositionists.

{{further|Republic of  (1985–2019)}}
On 30 June 1989, Colonel [[Omar al-Bashir]] led a bloodless [[1989  coup d'état|military coup]]. The new military government suspended political parties and introduced an Islamic legal code on the national level. Later, al-Bashir carried out purges and executions in the upper ranks of the army, the banning of associations, political parties, and independent newspapers, and the imprisonment of leading political figures and journalists. On 16 October 1993, al-Bashir appointed himself "[[President of |President]]" and disbanded the Revolutionary Command Council. The executive and legislative powers of the council were taken by al-Bashir.

In the [[ general election, 1996|1996 general election]], he was the only candidate by law to run for election.  became a [[one-party state]] under the [[National Congress Party ()|National Congress Party]] (NCP). During the 1990s, [[Hassan al-Turabi]], then Speaker of the National Assembly, reached out to [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] groups and invited [[Osama bin Laden]] to the country. The  subsequently listed  as a [[State Sponsors of Terrorism|state sponsor of terrorism]]. Following Al Qaeda's [[1998  embassy bombings|bombing of the U.S. embassies in  and ]], the U.S. launched [[Operation Infinite Reach]] and targeted the [[Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory]], which the U.S. government falsely believed was producing chemical weapons for the terrorist group. Al-Turabi's influence began to wane, and others in favour of more pragmatic leadership tried to change 's [[international isolation]]. The country worked to appease its critics by expelling members of the [[ Islamic Jihad]] and encouraging bin Laden to leave.
[[File:Government Militia in Darfur.PNG|thumb|Government militia in Darfur]]

Before the [[Elections in |2000 presidential election]], al-Turabi introduced a bill to reduce the President's powers, prompting al-Bashir to [[dissolve parliament|order a dissolution]] and declare a [[state of emergency]]. When al-Turabi urged a boycott of the President's re-election campaign signing agreement with [[ People's Liberation Army]], al-Bashir suspected they were plotting to overthrow the government. Hassan al-Turabi was jailed later the same year.

In February 2003, the [[ Liberation Movement/Army]] (SLM/A) and [[Justice and Equality Movement]] (JEM) groups in Darfur took up arms, accusing the  government of oppressing non-Arab  in favour of [[ Arabs]], precipitating the [[War in Darfur]]. The conflict has since been [[Darfur genocide|described as a genocide]], and the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) in The Hague has issued two [[arrest warrant]]s for al-Bashir. Arabic-speaking nomadic militias known as the [[Janjaweed]] stand accused of many atrocities.

On 9 January 2005, the government signed the [[Naivasha Agreement|Nairobi Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] with the [[ People's Liberation Movement]] (SPLM) with the objective of ending the [[Second  Civil War]]. The [[United Nations Mission in ]] (UNMIS) was established under the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1590|UN Security Council Resolution 1590]] to support its implementation. The peace agreement was a prerequisite to the 2011 [[ independence referendum, 2011|referendum]]: the result was a unanimous vote in favour of secession of [[]]; the region of Abyei will hold [[Abyei status referendum|its own referendum]] at a future date.

[[File:Southern  Referendum1.jpg|thumb|Southern  wait to vote during the [[2011  independence referendum]].]]
The [[ People's Liberation Army]] (SPLA) was the primary member of the [[Eastern Front ()|Eastern Front]], a coalition of rebel groups operating in eastern . After the peace agreement, their place was taken in February 2004 after the merger of the larger [[Fulani people|Fulani]] and [[Beja Congress]] with the smaller [[Rashaida Free Lions]]. A peace agreement between the  government and the Eastern Front was signed on 14 October 2006, in Asmara. On 5 May 2006, the [[Darfur Peace Agreement]] was signed, aiming at ending the conflict which had continued for three years up to this point. The – Conflict (2005–2007) had erupted after the [[Battle of Adré]] triggered a declaration of war by . The leaders of  and  signed an agreement in [[]] on 3 May 2007 to stop fighting from the [[Darfur conflict]] spilling along their countries' {{convert|1000|km|mi|-2|adj=on}} border.

In July 2007 the country was hit by [[2007  floods|devastating floods]], with over 400,000 people being directly affected. Since 2009, a series of [[ nomadic conflicts|ongoing conflicts]] between rival nomadic tribes in  and  have caused a large number of civilian casualties.

==== Partition and rehabilitation ====
The [[ conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile]] in the early 2010s between [[ People's Armed Forces|the Army of ]] and the [[ Revolutionary Front]] started as a dispute over the oil-rich region of [[Abyei]] in the months leading up to [[| independence]] in 2011, though it is also related to civil war in Darfur that is nominally resolved. A year later in 2012 during the [[Heglig Crisis]]  would achieve victory against , a war over oil-rich regions between 's [[Unity (state)|Unity]] and 's [[South Kordofan]] states. The events would later be known as the [[2011–2013  protests| Intifada]], which would end only in 2013 after al-Bashir promised he would not seek re-election in 2015. He later broke his promise and sought re-election in 2015, winning through a boycott from the opposition who believed that the elections would not be free and fair. Voter turnout was at a low 46%.

On 13 January 2017, US president [[Barack Obama]] signed an Executive Order that lifted many sanctions placed against  and assets of its government held abroad. On 6 October 2017, [[Donald Trump]] lifted most of the remaining sanctions against the country.

On 19 December 2018, [[ revolution|massive protests]] began after a government decision to triple the price of goods at a time when the country was suffering an acute shortage of foreign currency and inflation of 70 percent. In addition, President al-Bashir, who had been in power for more than 30 years, refused to step down, resulting in the convergence of opposition groups to form a united coalition. The government retaliated by arresting more than 800 opposition figures and protesters, leading to the death of approximately 40 people according to the Human Rights Watch, although the number was much higher than that according to local and civilian reports. The protests continued after the overthrow of his government on 11 April 2019 after a massive sit-in in front of the [[ Armed Forces]] main headquarters, after which the chiefs of staff decided to intervene and they ordered the arrest of President al-Bashir and declared a three-month state of emergency. Over 100 people died on 3 June after security forces dispersed the sit-in using tear gas and live ammunition in what is known as the [[Khartoum massacre]], resulting in 's suspension from the African Union. 's youth had been reported to be driving the protests. The protests came to an end when the [[Forces for Freedom and Change]] (an alliance of groups organizing the protests) and [[Transitional Military Council (2019)|Transitional Military Council]] (the ruling military government) signed the July 2019 Political Agreement and the August 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration.
The transitional institutions and procedures included the creation of a joint military-civilian [[Sovereignty Council of ]] as head of state, a new [[Chief Justice of ]] as head of the judiciary branch of power, [[Nemat Abdullah Khair]], and a new prime minister. The former Prime Minister, [[Abdalla Hamdok]], a 61-year-old economist who worked previously for the UN [[Economic Commission for Africa]], was sworn in on 21 August 2019. He initiated talks with the [[IMF]] and [[World Bank]] aimed at stabilising the economy, which was in dire straits because of shortages of food, fuel and hard currency. Hamdok estimated that US$10bn over two years would suffice to halt the panic, and said that over 70% of the 2018 budget had been spent on civil war-related measures. The governments of [[]] and the [[]] had invested significant sums supporting the military council since Bashir's ouster. On 3 September, Hamdok appointed 14 civilian ministers, including the first female foreign minister and the first Coptic Christian, also a woman. As of August 2021, the country was jointly led by Chairman of the Transitional Sovereign Council, [[Abdel Fattah al-Burhan]], and Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok.

==== 2021 coup and the al-Burhan regime ====
{{main|October–November 2021  coup d'état}}
The  government announced on 21 September 2021 that there was a failed attempt at a [[coup d'état]] from the military that had led to the arrest of 40 military officers.

One month after the attempted coup, another military coup on 25 October 2021 resulted in the deposition of the civilian government, including former Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. The coup was led by general [[Abdel Fattah al-Burhan]] who subsequently declared a state of emergency. Burhan took office as the de facto head of state of  and formed a new army-backed government on 11 November 2021.

On 21 November 2021, Hamdok was reinstated as prime minister after a political agreement was signed by Burhan to restore the transition to civilian rule (although Burhan retained control). The 14-point deal called for the release of all political prisoners detained during the coup and stipulated that a 2019 constitutional declaration continued to be the basis for a political transition. Hamdok fired the chief of police Khaled Mahdi Ibrahim al-Emam and his second in command Ali Ibrahim.

On 2 January 2022, Hamdok announced his resignation from the position of Prime Minister following one of the most deadly protests to date. He was succeeded by [[Osman Hussein (politician)|Osman Hussein]]. By March 2022 over 1,000 people including 148 children had been detained for opposing the coup, there were 25 allegations of rape and 87 people had been killed including 11 children.

In April 2023 – as an internationally brokered plan for a transition to civilian rule was discussed – power struggles grew between army commander (and ''[[defacto|de facto]]'' national leader) Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and his deputy, [[Hemedti]], head of the heavily armed paramilitary [[Rapid Support Forces]] (RSF), formed from the [[Janjaweed]] militia.

On 15 April 2023, their conflict erupted into a civil war starting with the [[Battle of Khartoum (2023–present)|battles in the streets of Khartoum]] between the army and the RSF – with troops, tanks and planes. By the third day, 400 people had been reported killed and at least 3,500 injured, according to the [[United Nations]]. Among the dead were three workers from the [[World Food Programme]], triggering a suspension of the organization's work in , despite ongoing hunger afflicting much of the country.  General [[Yasser al-Atta]] said the [[|UAE]] was providing supplies to RSF, which were being used in the war.

Both the  Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces are [[War crimes during the  civil war (2023–present)|accused of committing war crimes]]. As of 29 December 2023, over 5.8 million were internally displaced and more than 1.5 million others had fled the country as refugees, and many civilians in [[Darfur]] have been reported dead as part of the [[Masalit massacres (2023–present)|Masalit massacres]]. Up to 15,000 people were killed in the city of [[Geneina]].

As a result of the war the [[World Food Programme]] released a report on 22 February 2024 saying that more than 95% of 's population could not afford a meal a day. As of April 2024, the United Nations reported that more than 8.6 million people have been forced out of their homes, while 18 million are facing severe hunger, five million of them are at emergency levels. In May 2024, US government officials estimated that at least 150,000 people had died in the war in the past year alone. The RSF's apparent targeting of Black indigenous communities, especially around the city of El Fasher, have led international officials to warn of the risk of history repeating itself with another genocide in the Darfur region.

On 31 May 2024, a conference was called at the House of Representatives by a US Congresswoman [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] to address 's humanitarian crisis. A report by the State Department concerning the UAE's involvement in , including war crimes and arms exports, was the prime focus of the conference's discussion. A panelist speaker, Councilman Mohamed Seifeldein, called for an end to the UAE's involvement in , stating that the UAE's role in using the RSF in  and also in the [[ civil war (2014–present)| civil war]] "need to be stopped". Seifeldein, along with another panelist [[Hagir S. Elsheikh]], urged the international community to stop all support for the RSF, pointing to the militant group's destructive role in . Elsheikh also recommended to use social media in raising awareness about the  war, and to put pressure on the US elected officials to halt arms sales to the UAE. The latest report presented to the UN states that 2025 will see 30.4 million people in  in need of humanitarian aid due to the military conflict in the country. [[Al-Fashir massacre|Widespread killings and rapes]] were reported after the RSF captured the town of [[al-Fashir]] in October 2025.

===Early migrations and political units===
{{Main|Kingdom of Kongo}}
[[File:Jean_Roy_de_Congo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[João I of Kongo|King João I]], [[Manikongo]] of the [[Kingdom of Kongo]]]]
Modern  was populated predominantly by [[nomad]]ic [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] and [[San people|San]] peoples prior to the first [[Bantu migration]]s. The Khoi and San peoples were [[hunter-gatherer]]s, rather than practicing [[pastoralism]] or cultivation of crops.

In the first millennium BC, they were displaced by [[Bantu peoples]] arriving from the north, most of whom likely originated in what is today northwestern [[]] and southern [[]]. Bantu speakers introduced the cultivation of [[banana]]s and [[taro]], as well as maintenance of large cattle herds, to 's central highlands and the Luanda plain. Due to a number of inhibiting geographic factors throughout the territory of , namely harshly traversable land, hot/humid climate, and a plethora of deadly diseases, intermingling of pre-colonial tribes in  had been rare.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

After settlement of the migrants, a number of political entities developed. The best-known of these was the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], based in . It extended northward to what are now the [[]], the [[]], and [[]]. It established [[trade route]]s with other city-states and civilisations up and down the coast of southwestern and western Africa. Its traders even reached [[Great ]] and the [[Mutapa Empire]], although the kingdom engaged in little or no trans-oceanic trade. To its south lay the [[Kingdom of Ndongo]], from which the area of the later  colony was sometimes known as ''Dongo''. Next to that was the [[Kingdom of Matamba]]. The lesser [[Kakongo|Kingdom of Kakongo]] to the north was later a vassal of the [[Kingdom of Kongo]]. The people in all of these states spoke [[Kongo language|Kikongo]] as a common language.

[[Kingdom of |]] [[Age of Discovery|explorer]] [[Diogo Cão]] reached the area in 1484. The previous year, the  had established relations with the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], which stretched at the time from modern [[]] in the north to the [[Kwanza River]] in the south. The  established their primary early trading post at [[Soyo]], which is now the northernmost city in  apart from the [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] [[enclave and exclave|exclave]].

[[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded São Paulo de Loanda ([[Luanda]]) in 1575 with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers. [[Benguela]] was fortified in 1587 and became a township in 1617. An authoritarian state, the Kingdom of Kongo was highly centralised around its monarch and controlled neighbouring states as [[vassal state|vassals]]. It had a strong economy, based on the industries of [[copper]], [[ivory]], [[salt]], [[Hide (skin)|hides]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Slavery|slaves]]. The transition from a feudal system of slavery to a capitalist one with  would prove crucial to the history of the Kingdom of Kongo.

As relations between Kongo and  grew in the early 16th century, trade between the kingdoms also increased. Most of the trade was in palm cloth, copper, and ivory, but also increasing numbers of slaves. Kongo exported few slaves, and its slave market had remained internal. But, following the development of a successful sugar-growing colony after  settlement of [[]], Kongo became a major source of [[Slavery|slaves]] for the island's traders and plantations. Correspondence by King Afonso documents the purchase and sale of slaves within the country. His accounts also detail which slaves captured in war were given or sold to  merchants.

Afonso continued to expand the kingdom of Kongo into the 1540s, expanding its borders to the south and east. The expansion of Kongo's population, coupled with Afonso's earlier religious reforms, allowed the ruler to centralize power in his capital and increase the power of the monarchy. He also established a royal monopoly on some trade. To govern the growing slave trade, Afonso and several  kings claimed a joint monopoly on the external slave trade.

The slave trade increasingly became Kongo's primary, and arguably sole, [[economic sector]]. A major obstacle for the Kingdom of Kongo was that slaves were the only commodity for which the European powers were willing to trade. Kongo lacked an effective [[World currency|international currency]]. Kongolese nobles could buy slaves with the national currency of [[Shell money|nzimbu shells]], which could be traded for slaves. These could be sold to gain international currency.

As the slave trade was the only commodity in which Europeans were interested in the region during the 16th and 17th centuries, the Kongo economy was unable to [[Economic diversification|diversify]] or later [[Industrial Revolution|industrialise]] outside of sectors in which slavery was involved, such as the [[arms industry]]. The increased production and sale of guns within the kingdom was due to the salient issue of the slave trade, which had become an increasingly violent struggle. There was a constant need for slaves for the kings and queens to sell in exchange for foreign commodities, the absence of which would prevent them from having any influence with European powers such as  and eventually the [[ Republic]].

Kongolese kings needed this influence to garner support from European powers for quelling internal rebellions. The situation became increasingly complicated during the rule of [[Garcia II of Kongo|Garcia II]], who needed the assistance of the  military to drive out the  from [[Luanda]], in spite of the fact that  was Kongo's primary slave trading partner.

By the early 17th century, the supply of foreign slaves captured by the Kongolese externally was waning. The government began to approve the enslavement of freeborn Kongolese citizens for relatively minor infractions, nearly any disobeying of the authoritarian system and the aristocracy. If several villagers were deemed guilty of a crime, it became relatively common for the whole village to be enslaved. The resulting chaos and internal conflict from Garcia II's reign would lead into that of his son and successor, [[António I of Kongo|António I]]. He was killed in 1665 by  at the [[Battle of Mbwila]] 1665, together with a substantial proportion of the aristocracy. The colonists were expanding their power.

War broke out more widely in the Kingdom of Kongo after the death of António I. Much of the stability and access to [[iron ore]] and [[charcoal]] necessary for [[gunsmith]]s to maintain the arms industry was disrupted. From then on, in this period almost every Kongolese citizen was in danger of being enslaved. Many Kongolese subjects were adroit in making guns, and they were enslaved to have their skills available to colonists in the New World, where they worked as blacksmiths, ironworkers, and charcoal makers.

The  established several other settlements, forts and trading posts along the  coast, principally trading in [[Slavery in | slaves]] for [[plantations in the  South|plantations]]. Local slave dealers provided a large number of slaves for the [[ Empire]], usually in exchange for manufactured goods from Europe. This part of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] continued until after [[independence of |'s independence]] in the 1820s.

Despite 's territorial claims in , its control over much of the country's vast interior was minimal. In the 16th century  gained control of the coast through a series of treaties and wars. Life for European colonists was difficult and progress was slow. [[John Iliffe (historian)|John Iliffe]] notes that " records of  from the 16th century show that a great [[famine]] occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys".

During the [[ Restoration War]], the [[ West  Company]] [[ Loango-|occupied]] the principal settlement of Luanda in 1641, using alliances with local peoples to carry out attacks against  holdings elsewhere. A fleet under [[Salvador de Sá]] retook Luanda in 1648; reconquest of the rest of the territory was completed by 1650. New treaties with the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]] were signed in 1649; others with [[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba|Njinga]]'s Kingdom of [[Matamba]] and [[Ndongo]] followed in 1656. The conquest of [[Pungo Andongo]] in 1671 was the last major  expansion from Luanda, as attempts to invade Kongo in 1670 and Matamba in 1681 failed. Colonial outposts also expanded inward from Benguela, but until the late 19th century the inroads from Luanda and Benguela were very limited.

The [[History of slavery|slave trade]] was abolished in  in 1836, and in 1854 the colonial government freed all its existing slaves. Four years later, a more progressive administration appointed by  abolished [[slavery]] altogether. However, these decrees remained largely unenforceable, and the  depended on assistance from the  [[Royal Navy]] and what became known as the [[Blockade of Africa]] to enforce their ban on the slave trade. This coincided with a series of renewed military expeditions into the bush.

By the mid-nineteenth century  had established its dominion as far north as the [[ River]] and as far south as [[Moçâmedes|Mossâmedes]]. Until the late 1880s,  entertained proposals to link  with its [[colony]] in [[]] but was blocked by  and  opposition. In this period, the  came up against different forms of armed resistance from various peoples in .

The [[Berlin Conference]] in 1884–1885 set the colony's borders, delineating the boundaries of  claims in , although many details were unresolved until the 1920s. Trade between  and its African territories rapidly increased as a result of protective [[tariff]]s, leading to increased development, and a wave of new  immigrants.

In 1925, an expedition to  was conducted by  naturalist explorer [[Arthur Stannard Vernay]]. Between 1939 and 1943,  army operations against the Mucubal, whom they accused of rebellion and cattle-thieving, resulted in hundreds of Mucubal killed. During the campaign, 3,529 were taken prisoner, 20% of whom were women and children, and imprisoned in concentration camps. Many died in captivity from undernourishment, violence and forced labor. Around 600 were sent to [[Sao Tome and Principe]]. Hundreds were also sent to a camp in [[Damba (municipality)|Damba]], where 26% died.

=== War of Independence===

[[File:Luanda,desfilemilitar (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[ Armed Forces]] marching in Luanda during the [[ Colonial War]]s (1961–74).]]
Under colonial law, black  were forbidden from forming political parties or labour unions. The first nationalist movements did not take root until after [[World War II]], spearheaded by a largely Westernised and -speaking urban class, which included many [[mestiço]]s. During the early 1960s they were joined by other associations stemming from ''ad hoc'' labour activism in the rural workforce. 's refusal to address increasing  demands for [[self-determination]] provoked an armed conflict, which erupted in 1961 with the [[Baixa de Cassanje revolt]] and gradually evolved into a protracted [[ War of Independence|war of independence]] that persisted for the next twelve years. Throughout the conflict, three militant nationalist movements with their own partisan guerrilla wings emerged from the fighting between the  government and local forces, supported to varying degrees by the [[ Communist Party]].

The ''[[FNLA|National Front for the Liberation of ]]'' (FNLA) recruited from [[Bakongo]] refugees in [[Zaire]]. Benefiting from particularly favourable political circumstances in [[Kinshasa|Léopoldville]], and especially from a common border with Zaire,  political exiles were able to build up a power base among a large expatriate community from related families, clans, and traditions. People on both sides of the border spoke mutually intelligible dialects and enjoyed shared ties to the historical Kingdom of Kongo. Though as foreigners skilled  could not take advantage of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]'s state employment programme, some found work as middlemen for the absentee owners of various lucrative private ventures. The migrants eventually formed the FNLA with the intention of making a bid for political power upon their envisaged return to .
[[File:FNLA1973.jpg|thumb|upright|Members of the [[National Liberation Front of ]] training in 1973.]]
A largely [[Ovimbundu]] guerrilla initiative against the  in central  from 1966 was spearheaded by [[Jonas Savimbi]] and the ''[[UNITA|National Union for the Total Independence of ]]'' (UNITA). It remained handicapped by its geographic remoteness from friendly borders, the ethnic fragmentation of the Ovimbundu, and the isolation of peasants on European plantations where they had little opportunity to mobilise.

During the late 1950s, the rise of the Marxist–Leninist ''[[MPLA|Popular Movement for the Liberation of ]]'' (MPLA) in the east and Dembos hills north of Luanda came to hold special significance. Formed as a coalition resistance movement by the [[ Communist Party]], the organisation's leadership remained predominantly [[Ambundu]] and courted public sector workers in [[Luanda]]. Although both the MPLA and its rivals accepted material assistance from the [[Soviet Union]] or the People's Republic of [[]], the former harboured strong anti-imperialist views and was openly critical of the [[]] and its support for . This allowed it to win important ground on the diplomatic front, soliciting support from nonaligned governments in [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], and the [[United Arab Republic]].

The MPLA attempted to move its headquarters from [[Conakry]] to Léopoldville in October 1961, renewing efforts to create a common front with the FNLA, then known as the ''Union of  Peoples'' (UPA) and its leader [[Holden Roberto]]. Roberto turned down the offer. When the MPLA first attempted to insert its own insurgents into , the cadres were ambushed and annihilated by UPA partisans on Roberto's orders—setting a precedent for the bitter factional strife which would later ignite the [[ Civil War]].

=== Civil War===
{{Main| Civil War}}

Throughout the war of independence, the three rival nationalist movements were severely hampered by political and military factionalism, as well as their inability to unite guerrilla efforts against the . Between 1961 and 1975 the MPLA, UNITA, and the FNLA competed for influence in the  population and the international community. The [[Soviet Union]] and [[]] became especially sympathetic towards the MPLA and supplied that party with arms, ammunition, funding, and training. They also backed UNITA militants until it became clear that the latter was at irreconcilable odds with the MPLA.

The collapse of 's [[Estado Novo ()|Estado Novo]] government following the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]] suspended all  military activity in Africa and the brokering of a ceasefire pending negotiations for  independence. Encouraged by the [[Organisation of African Unity]], Holden Roberto, Jonas Savimbi, and MPLA chairman [[Agostinho Neto]] met in [[Mombasa]] in early January 1975 and agreed to form a coalition government. This was ratified by the [[Alvor Agreement]] later that month, which called for general elections and set the country's independence date for 11 November 1975. All three factions, however, followed up on the ceasefire by taking advantage of the gradual  withdrawal to seize various strategic positions, acquire more arms, and enlarge their militant forces. The rapid influx of weapons from numerous external sources, especially the Soviet Union and the , as well as the escalation of tensions between the nationalist parties, fueled a new outbreak of hostilities. With tacit  and Zairean support the FNLA began massing large numbers of troops in northern  in an attempt to gain military superiority. Meanwhile, the MPLA began securing control of Luanda, a traditional Ambundu stronghold. Sporadic violence broke out in Luanda over the next few months after the FNLA attacked the MPLA's political headquarters in March 1975. The fighting intensified with street clashes in April and May, and UNITA became involved after over two hundred of its members were massacred by an MPLA contingent that June. An upswing in Soviet arms shipments to the MPLA influenced a decision by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] to likewise provide substantial covert aid to the FNLA and UNITA.

In August 1975, the MPLA requested direct assistance from the Soviet Union in the form of ground troops. The Soviets declined, offering to send advisers but no troops; however,  was more forthcoming and in late September dispatched nearly five hundred combat personnel to , along with sophisticated weaponry and supplies. By independence, there were over a thousand  soldiers in the country. They were kept supplied by a massive [[– airbridge|airbridge]] carried out with Soviet aircraft. The persistent buildup of  and Soviet military aid allowed the MPLA to drive its opponents from Luanda and blunt an abortive intervention by Zairean and [[]]n troops, which had deployed in a belated attempt to assist the FNLA and UNITA. The FNLA was largely annihilated after the decisive [[Battle of Quifangondo]], although UNITA managed to withdraw its civil officials and militia from Luanda and seek sanctuary in the southern provinces. From there, Savimbi continued to mount a determined insurgent campaign against the MPLA.
[[File: PT-76 .JPG|thumb|Soviet made  PT-76 tank in Luanda during the [[ intervention in ]], 1976]]
Between 1975 and 1991, the MPLA implemented an economic and political system based on the principles of [[scientific socialism]], incorporating [[Planned economy|central planning]] and a [[Marxist–Leninist]] [[one-party state]]. It embarked on an ambitious programme of [[Nationalization|nationalisation]], and the domestic private sector was essentially abolished. Privately owned enterprises were nationalised and incorporated into a single umbrella of state-owned enterprises known as ''Unidades Economicas Estatais'' (UEE). Under the MPLA,  experienced a significant degree of modern [[industrialisation]]. However, corruption and graft also increased and public resources were either allocated inefficiently or simply embezzled by officials for personal enrichment. The ruling party survived an [[1977  coup d'état attempt|attempted coup d'état]] by the [[Maoism|Maoist]]-oriented [[Communist Organization of |Communist Organisation of ]] (OCA) in 1977, which was suppressed after a series of bloody political purges left thousands of OCA supporters dead.

The MPLA abandoned its former Marxist ideology at its third party congress in 1990, and declared [[social democracy]] to be its new platform.  subsequently became a member of the [[International Monetary Fund]]; restrictions on the market economy were also reduced in an attempt to draw foreign investment. By May 1991 it reached a peace agreement with UNITA, the [[Bicesse Accords]], which scheduled [[ general election, 1992|new general elections]] for September 1992. When the MPLA secured a major electoral victory, UNITA objected to the results of both the presidential and legislative vote count and returned to war. Following the election, the [[Halloween massacre ()|Halloween massacre]] occurred from 30 October to 1 November, where MPLA forces killed thousands of UNITA supporters.

In 1997, [[George Soros]]'s [[Open Society Foundations]] launched its activities in  with the help of its first national representative until 2004, [[Rafael Marques de Morais]]. Despite the initial collaboration with the  government on developing [[primary school]] education, relations quickly soured over OSF's [[democratisation]] and [[human rights]] campaigning.

On 22 February 2002, government troops killed Savimbi in a skirmish in the [[Moxico (province)|Moxico province]]. UNITA and the MPLA consented to the [[Luena, |Luena]] Memorandum of Understanding in April; UNITA agreed to give up its armed wing. With the [[elections in |elections]] in [[2008  parliamentary election|2008]] and [[2012  general election|2012]], an MPLA-ruled [[dominant-party system]] emerged, with UNITA and the FNLA as opposition parties.

 experienced a serious humanitarian crisis; the result of the prolonged war, the abundance of [[minefield]]s, and the continued political agitation in favour of the independence of the [[exclave]] of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] (carried out in the context of the protracted [[Cabinda War|Cabinda conflict]] by the [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda|FLEC]]). While most of the internally displaced have now [[Squatting in |squatted]] around the capital, in ''musseques'' ([[shanty towns]]) the general situation for  remains desperate.

In 2007, a separatist movement was launched in the diamond-rich [[Lunda Norte Province]] by the retired [[Military justice|military judge]] Jota Filipe Malakito under the name of the Commission of the Legal-Sociological Manifesto of the Lunda Tchokwé Protectorate (''Comissão do Manifesto Jurídico-Sociológico do Protectorado Lunda Tchokwé'', CMJSPLT).{{efn|Later changed to Legal-Sociological Manifesto of the Lunda People, ''Manifesto Jurídico-Sociológico do Povo Lunda'', MJSLP, and disbanded in 2025.}} After Malakito's release from prison in 2011, a [[hardline]] faction led by the former [[Secretary (title)|secretary general]] José Mateus "Zeca Mutchima" split from the CMJSPLT, forming the Movement of the  Protectorate of Lunda Chokwe (''Movimento do Protetorado Português da Lunda Tchokwé'', MPPLT), whose statement of principles was partly drawn from [[Diogo Pacheco de Amorim]]'s 2003 manifesto for the  right-wing party [[New Democracy Party ()|New Democracy]]. The separatist movement eventually targeted 's six eastern provinces, corresponding to 51,6% of its territory.

A [[drought]] in 2016 caused the worst food crisis in [[Southern Africa]] in 25 years, affecting 1.4 million people across seven of 's eighteen provinces. [[Food prices]] rose and acute [[malnutrition]] rates doubled, impacting over 95,000 children.

[[José Eduardo dos Santos]] stepped down as [[President of ]] after 38 years in 2017, being peacefully succeeded by [[João Lourenço]], Santos' chosen successor. Some members of the dos Santos family were later linked to high levels of corruption. In July 2022, ex-president José Eduardo dos Santos died in .

In August 2022, the ruling party, MPLA, won another majority and President Lourenço won a second five-year term in the [[2022  general election|election]]. However, the election was the tightest in 's history.

=== Prehistory ===
[[File:1997 278-10 Sahara glyph.jpg|thumb|Rock engraving showing herds of giraffe, [[ibex]], and other animals in the southern Sahara near Tiguidit, ]]
Stone tools, some dating as far back as 280,000 BC, have been found in [[Adrar Bous]], [[Bilma]] and [[Djado]] in the northern [[Agadez Region]]. Some of these finds have been linked with the [[Aterian]] and [[Mousterian]] tool cultures of the [[Middle Paleolithic]] period, which flourished in northern Africa circa 90,000 BC–20,000 BC. It is thought that these humans lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. During the prehistoric [[African humid period]], the climate of the [[Sahara]] was wetter and more fertile, a phenomenon archaeologists refer to as the "Green Sahara", which provided "favourable" conditions for hunting and later agriculture and livestock herding.

The [[Neolithic]] era, beginning circa 10,000 BC, saw a number of changes such as the introduction of [[pottery]] (as evidenced at Tagalagal, Temet and Tin Ouffadene), the spread of cattle husbandry, and the burying of the dead in stone [[tumuli]]. As the climate changed in the period 4000–2800 BC the Sahara gradually began [[desertification|drying out]], forcing a change in settlement patterns to the south and east. Agriculture spread, including the planting of [[millet]] and [[sorghum]], and pottery production. Iron and copper items appear in this era, with finds including those at [[Azawagh]], [[Takedda]], [[Marendet]] and the [[Termit Massif]]. The [[Kiffian culture|Kiffian]] (circa 8000–6000 BC) and later [[Tenerian culture|Tenerian]] (circa 5000–2500 BC) cultures, centred on [[Adrar Bous]] and [[Gobero]] where skeletons have been uncovered, flourished during this period.

Societies continued to grow with regional differentiation in agricultural and funerary practices. A culture of this period is the [[Bura culture]] (circa 200–1300 AD) named for the [[Bura archaeological site]] where a burial replete with iron and ceramic statuettes were discovered. The Neolithic era saw the flourishing of Saharan rock art, including in the [[Aïr Mountains]], Termit Massif, Djado Plateau, Iwelene, Arakao, Tamakon, Tzerzait, [[Iferouane]], Mammanet and [[Dabous Giraffes|Dabous]]; the art spans the period from 10,000 BC to 100 AD and depicts a range of subjects, from the varied fauna of the landscape to depictions of spear-carrying figures dubbed ' warriors'.

=== Empires and kingdoms in pre-colonial  ===
By at least the 5th century BC the territory of what is now  had become an area of trans-Saharan trade. Led by [[Tuareg]] tribes from the north, camels were used as a means of transportation through what is later a desert. This mobility which would continue in waves for centuries was accompanied with further migration to the south and intermixing between sub-Saharan African and North African populations, and the spread of [[Islam]]. It was aided by the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]] in the 7th century, the result of three Arab invasions, which resulted in population movements to the south. Empires and kingdoms existed in the Sahel during this era.

====  Empire (1200s–1400s) ====
{{Main| Empire}}
The  Empire was a [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] empire founded by [[Sundiata Keita]] (r. 1230–1255) in {{circa|1230}} and existed until the 1600s. As detailed in the ''[[Epic of Sundiata]]'',  emerged as a breakaway region of the [[Sosso Empire]] which itself had split from the earlier [[ Empire]]. Thereafter  defeated the Sosso at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in 1235 and then  in 1240. From its heartland around the later - border region, the empire expanded under successive kings and came to dominate the Trans-Saharan trade routes, reaching its greatest extent during the rule of [[Mansa Musa]] (r. 1312–1337).{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} At this point parts of what are now 's [[Tillabéri Region]] fell under  rule. A Muslim, Mansa Musa performed the ''[[hajj]]'' in 1324–25 and encouraged the spread of [[Islam]] in the empire, and it "appears that most ordinary citizens continued to maintain their traditional animist beliefs instead of or alongside the new religion". The empire began "declining" in the 15th century due to a combination of internecine strife over the royal succession, weak kings, the shift of European trade routes to the coast, and rebellions in the empire's periphery by [[Mossi people|Mossi]], [[Wolof people|Wolof]], [[Tuareg]] and [[Songhai people|Songhai]] peoples. A rump  kingdom continued to exist until the 1600s.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

==== Songhai Empire (1000s–1591) ====
[[File:SONGHAI empire map.PNG|thumb|left|Map of the Songhai Empire, overlaid over modern boundaries]]
{{Main|Songhai Empire}}
The [[Songhai Empire]] was named for its main ethnic group, the [[Songhai people|Songhai or Sonrai]], and was centred on the bend of the [[ River]] in [[]]. Songhai began settling this region from the 7th to 9th centuries;{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} by the 11th century [[Gao]] (capital of the former [[Kingdom of Gao]]) had become the empire's capital. From 1000 to 1325, the Songhai Empire managed to maintain peace with the  Empire, its neighbour to the west. In 1325 Songhai was conquered by  until regaining its independence in 1375.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} Under king [[Sonni Ali]] (r. 1464–1492) Songhai adopted an expansionist policy which reached its apogee during the reign of [[Askia Mohammad I]] (r. 1493–1528); at this point the empire had expanded from its -bend heartland, including to the east where most of later western  fell under its rule, including [[Agadez]] which was conquered in 1496. The empire was unable to withstand repeated attacks from the [[Saadi dynasty]] of [[]] and was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Tondibi]] in 1591; it then collapsed into a number of smaller kingdoms.

==== Sultanate of Aïr (1400s–1906) ====
[[File:1997 277-9A Agadez mosque cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Agadez Mosque|The Grand Mosque of Agadez]]]]
{{Main|Sultanate of Aïr}}
In {{circa|1449}} in the north of what is now , the [[Sultanate of Aïr]] was founded by Sultan Ilisawan, based in [[Agadez]]. Formerly a trading post inhabited by a mixture of Hausa and Tuaregs, it grew as a strategic position on the Trans-Saharan trade routes. In 1515, Aïr was conquered by Songhai, remaining a part of that empire until its collapse in 1591. In the following centuries, it "seems that the sultanate entered a decline" marked by internecine wars and clan conflicts. When Europeans began exploring the region in the 19th century, most of Agadez lay in ruins and was taken over by the .

==== Kanem–Bornu Empire (700s–1700s) ====
{{Main|Kanem–Bornu Empire|Sultanate of Damagaram}}
To the east, the [[Kanem–Bornu Empire]] dominated the region around [[Lake ]] for a period. It was founded by the [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] around the 8th century and based in [[Njimi]], north-east of the lake. The kingdom gradually expanded, including during the rule of the [[Sayfawa dynasty]] which began in {{circa|1075}} under ''Mai'' (king) [[Hummay]]. The kingdom reached its greatest extent in the 1200s, partly due to the effort of ''Mai'' [[Dunama Dibbalemi]] (r. 1210–1259), and grew "richer" from its control of some Trans-Saharan trade routes; most of eastern and south-eastern , including [[Bilma]] and [[Kaouar]], was under Kanem's control in this period. Islam had been introduced to the kingdom by Arab traders from the 11th century, gaining more converts over the following centuries. Attacks by the [[Bulala]] people in the 14th century forced Kanem to shift westwards of Lake  where it became known as the Bornu Empire ruled from its capital [[Ngazargamu]] on what is later the [[- border]]. Bornu "prospered" during the rule of ''Mai'' [[Idris Alooma]] (r. circa 1575–1610) and re-conquered most of the "traditional lands" of Kanem, hence the designation 'Kanem–Bornu' for the empire. By the 17th century and into the 18th the Bornu kingdom had entered a "period of decline", shrinking back to its Lake  heartland.

Circa 1730–40 a group of [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] settlers led by Mallam Yunus left Kanem and founded the [[Sultanate of Damagaram]], centred on the town of [[Zinder]]. The sultanate remained nominally subject to the [[Borno Empire]] until the reign of Sultan Tanimoune Dan Souleymane in the 19th century, who declared independence and initiated a phase of expansion. The sultanate managed to resist the advance of the Sokoto Caliphate (''see below''), and was later captured by the  in 1899.

==== Hausa states and other smaller kingdoms (1400s–1800s) ====
[[File:Photo1906 Zinder overview.jpg|thumb|Overlooking the town of [[Zinder]] and the Sultan's Palace from the  fort (1906).

{{Main|Hausa Kingdoms|Dosso Kingdom|Dendi Kingdom}}
Between the  River and Lake  lay [[Hausa Kingdoms]], encompassing the cultural-linguistic area known as [[Hausaland]] which straddles what later became the [[- border]]. The Hausa are thought to be a mixture of autochthonous peoples and migrant peoples from the north and east, emerging as a distinct people sometime in the 900s–1400s when the kingdoms were founded. They gradually adopted Islam from the 14th century, and sometimes this existed alongside other religions, developing into syncretic forms; some Hausa groups such as the Azna resisted Islam altogether (the area of [[Dogondoutchi]] remains an animist stronghold). The Hausa kingdoms were not a compact entity but several federations of kingdoms more or less independent of one other. Their organisation was hierarchical and somewhat democratic: the Hausa kings were elected by the notables of the country and could be removed by them. The Hausa Kingdoms began as seven states founded, according to the [[Bayajidda]] legend, by the six sons of Bawo. Bawo was the only son of the Hausa queen [[Daurama]] and [[Bayajidda]] or ([[Abu Yazid]] according to certain historians) who came from [[Baghdad]]. The seven original Hausa states (also referred to as the 'Hausa bakwai') were: [[Daura Emirate|Daura]] (state of queen [[Daurama]]), [[Sultanate of Kano|Kano]], [[Rano]], [[Kingdom of Zazzau|Zaria]], [[Gobir]], [[Kingdom of Katsina|Katsina]] and [[Hadejia|Biram]]. An extension of the legend states that Bawo had a further seven sons with a concubine, who went on to found the so-called 'Banza (''illegitimate'') Bakwai': [[Zamfara]], [[Kebbi Emirate|Kebbi]], [[Nupe Kingdom|Nupe]], [[Gwari]], [[Yauri Emirate|Yauri]], [[Ilorin Emirate|Ilorin]] and [[Kwararafa]]. A smaller state not fitting into this scheme was [[Konni (Hausa state)|Konni]], centred on [[Birni-N'Konni]].
[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png|thumb|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]
The [[Fulani]], a pastoral people found throughout the Sahel, began migrating to Hausaland during the 1200s–1500s. During the later 18th century some Fulani were unhappy with the syncretic form of Islam practised there; exploiting also the populace's disdain with corruption amongst the Hausa elite, the Fulani scholar [[Usman Dan Fodio]] (from Gobir) declared a [[Fulani jihad|jihad]] in 1804. After conquering most of Hausaland (though not the Bornu Kingdom, which remained independent), he proclaimed the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] in 1809. Some of the Hausa states survived by fleeing south, such as the Katsina who moved to [[Maradi, |Maradi]] in the south of what later became . Some of these surviving states harassed the Caliphate and a period of wars and skirmishes commenced, with some states (such as Katsina and Gobir) maintaining independence whereas elsewhere newer ones were formed (such as the [[Sultanate of Tessaoua]]). The Caliphate managed to survive until, "fatally weakened" by the invasions of -based warlord [[Rabih az-Zubayr]], it finally fell to the  in 1903, with its lands later being partitioned between Britain and .

Other smaller kingdoms of the period include the [[Dosso Kingdom]], a [[Zarma people|Zarma]] polity founded in 1750, which resisted the rule of Hausa and Sokoto states.

{{Main|Senegambia and |Upper  and | West Africa|Colony of }}
In the 19th century, some European explorers travelled in the area that would become known as , such as [[Mungo Park (explorer)|Mungo Park]] (in 1805–1806), the [[Walter Oudney|Oudney]]-[[Dixon Denham|Denham]]-[[Hugh Clapperton|Clapperton]] expedition (1822–25), [[Heinrich Barth]] (1850–55 with [[James Richardson (explorer)|James Richardson]] and [[Adolf Overweg]]), [[Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs]] (1865–1867), [[Gustav Nachtigal]] (1869–1874) and [[Parfait-Louis Monteil]] (1890–1892).

Some European countries already possessed coastal colonies in Africa, and in the latter half of the century they began to turn their eyes towards the interior of the continent. This process, known as the '[[Scramble for Africa]]', culminated in the [[Berlin Conference|1885 Berlin conference]] in which the colonial powers outlined the division of Africa into spheres of influence. As a result of this, [[]] gained control of the upper valley of the [[ River]] (roughly equivalent to the present territory of [[]] and ).  then set about making a reality of their rule on the ground. In 1897, the  officer [[Marius Gabriel Cazemajou]] was sent to . He reached the [[Sultanate of Damagaram]] in 1898, and stayed in [[Zinder]] at the court of Sultan Amadou Kouran Daga. He was later killed, as Daga feared he would ally with the -based warlord Rabih az-Zubayr. In 1899–1900,  coordinated three expeditions—the [[Émile Gentil|Gentil Mission]] from [[ ]], the [[Amédée-François Lamy|Foureau-Lamy Mission]] from [[]] and the [[Voulet–Chanoine Mission]] from [[Timbuktu]]—with the aim of linking 's African possessions. The three eventually met at [[Kousséri]] (in the far north of [[]]) and defeated Rabih az-Zubayr's forces at the [[Battle of Kousséri]]. The Voulet-Chanoine Mission was "marred by atrocities", and "became notorious" for pillaging, looting, raping and killing local civilians on its passage throughout southern . On 8 May 1899, in retaliation for the resistance of queen [[Sarraounia]], captain Voulet and his men murdered all the inhabitants of the village of [[Birni-N'Konni]] in what is regarded as "one of the worst massacres in  colonial history". The "brutal" methods of Voulet and Chanoine caused a "scandal" and Paris was forced to intervene; when Lieutenant-Colonel [[Jean-François Klobb]] caught up with the mission near [[Tessaoua]] to relieve them of command he was killed. Lt. [[Paul Joalland]], Klobb's former officer, and Lt. [[Octave Meynier]] eventually took over the mission following a mutiny in which Voulet and Chanoine were killed.
The Military Territory of  was subsequently created within the [[Upper  and ]] colony (later ,  and ) in December 1904 with its capital at [[Niamey]]. The [[- border|border]] with Britain's colony of  to the south was finalised in 1910, a rough delimitation having already been agreed by the two powers via treaties during the period 1898–1906. The capital of the territory was moved to Zinder in 1912 when the  Military Territory was split off from Upper  and , before being moved back to Niamey in 1922 when  became a fully fledged colony within [[ West Africa]]. The borders of  were drawn up in stages and had been fixed at their later position by the 1930s. Territorial adjustments took place in this period: the areas west of the  river were [[– border|attached]] to  in 1926–1927, and during the dissolution of Upper Volta (modern ) in 1932–1947 most of the east of that territory was added to ; and in the east the [[Tibesti Mountains]] were [[- border|transferred]] to  in 1931.

The  generally adopted a form of indirect rule, allowing existing native structures to continue to exist within the colonial framework of governance providing that they acknowledged  supremacy. The Zarma of the Dosso Kingdom in particular proved amenable to  rule, using them as allies against the encroachments of Hausa and other nearby states; over time the Zarma thus became one of the "more educated and westernised" groups in . Perceived threats to  rule, such as the Kobkitanda rebellion in [[Dosso Region]] (1905–1906), led by the blind cleric Alfa Saibou, and the Karma revolt in the  valley (December 1905 – March 1906) led by Oumarou Karma were suppressed with force, as were the latter [[Hamallayya]] and [[Hauka]] religious movements. While "largely successful" in subduing the "sedentary" populations of the south, the  faced "considerably more difficulty" with the Tuareg in the north (centered on the Sultanate of Aïr in Agadez), and  was unable to occupy Agadez until 1906. Tuareg resistance continued, culminating in the [[Kaocen revolt]] of 1916–1917, led by [[Ag Mohammed Wau Teguidda Kaocen]], with backing from the [[Senussi]] in [[Fezzan]]; the revolt was violently suppressed and Kaocen fled to Fezzan where he was later killed. A puppet sultan was set up by the  and the "decline and marginalisation" of the north of the colony continued, exacerbated by a series of droughts. While it remained "something of a backwater", some limited economic development took place in  during the colonial years, such as the introduction of [[Hausa groundnut|groundnut]] cultivation. Measures to improve food security following a series of devastating famines in 1913, 1920, and 1931 were introduced.

During the [[Second World War]], during which time mainland  was occupied by [[Nazi ]], [[Charles de Gaulle]] issued the Brazzaville Declaration, declaring that the  colonial empire would be replaced post-war with a less centralised [[ Union]]. The  Union, which lasted from 1946 to 1958, conferred a limited form of  citizenship on the inhabitants of the colonies, with some decentralisation of power and limited participation in political life for local advisory assemblies. It was during this period that the [[ Progressive Party – African Democratic Rally| Progressive Party]] (''Parti Progressiste Nigérien'', or PPN, originally a branch of the African Democratic Rally, or ''[[Rassemblement Démocratique Africain]]'' – RDA) was formed under the leadership of former teacher [[Hamani Diori]], as was the left-wing [[Mouvement Socialiste Africain-Sawaba]] (MSA), led by [[Djibo Bakary]]. Following the Overseas Reform Act (''Loi Cadre'') of 23 July 1956 and the establishment of the [[Fifth  Republic]] on 4 December 1958,  became an autonomous state within the [[ Community]]. On 18 December 1958, an autonomous Republic of  was officially created under the leadership of Hamani Diori. MSA was banned in 1959 for its perceived excessive anti- stance. On 11 July 1960,  decided to leave the  Community and acquired full independence at midnight, local time, on 3 August 1960; Diori thus became the first [[List of Presidents of |president]] of the country.

=== Post-colonial (1960–) ===
==== Diori years (1960–1974) ====

Diori's single party rule was characterised by "good" relations with the West and a preoccupation with foreign affairs.]]
For its first 14 years as an independent state,  was run by a single-party civilian regime under the presidency of Hamani Diori. The 1960s saw an expansion of the education system and some limited economic development and industrialisation. Links with  remained, with Diori allowing the development of -led [[uranium]] mining in [[Arlit]] and supporting  in the [[ War]]. Relations with other African states were mostly "positive", with the exception of [[Dahomey]] (), owing to a [[- border|border]] dispute.  remained a one-party state throughout this period, with Diori surviving a planned coup in 1963 and an assassination attempt in 1965; most of this activity was masterminded by Djibo Bakary's MSA-Sawaba group which had launched an abortive rebellion in 1964. In the 1970s, a combination of economic difficulties, [[drought]]s and accusations of rampant corruption and mismanagement of food supplies resulted in a [[1974  coup d'état|coup d'état]] that overthrew the Diori regime.

==== First military regime (1974–1991) ====
The coup had been masterminded by Col. [[Seyni Kountché]] and a military group under the name of the ''Conseil Militaire Supreme'', with Kountché going on to rule the country until his death in 1987. The first action of the military government was to address the food crisis. Whilst political prisoners of the Diori regime were released after the coup, political and individual freedoms in general deteriorated during this period. There were attempted coups (in 1975, 1976 and 1984) which were thwarted, their instigators being punished.

[[File:Seyni Kountche 1983.jpg|thumb|President [[Seyni Kountché]] during the state visit of West  President [[Karl Carstens]] to  in 1983]]
Kountché sought to create a 'development society', funded mostly by the uranium mines in [[Agadez Region]]. [[Parastatal]] companies were created, infrastructure (building and new roads, schools, health centres) constructed, and there was corruption in government agencies, which Kountché did not hesitate to punish. In the 1980s, Kountché began cautiously loosening the grip of the military, with some relaxation of state censorship and attempts made to 'civilianise' the regime. The economic boom ended following the collapse in uranium prices, and [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]-led austerity and privatisation measures provoked opposition by some . In 1985, a Tuareg revolt in [[Tchintabaraden]] was suppressed. Kountché died in November 1987 from a brain tumour, and was succeeded by his chief of staff, Col. [[Ali Saibou]] who was confirmed as Chief of the Supreme Military Council four days later.

Saibou curtailed the most repressive aspects of the Kountché era (such as the secret police and media censorship), and set about introducing a process of political reform under the overall direction of a single party (the ''Mouvement National pour la Société du Développement'', or MNSD). A Second Republic was declared and a new constitution was drawn up, which was adopted following a [[1989  constitutional referendum|referendum]] in 1989. General Saibou became the first president of the Second Republic after winning the [[1989  general election|presidential election]] on 10 December 1989.

President Saibou's efforts to control political reforms failed in the face of trade union and student demands to institute a [[multi-party democracy|multi-party democratic system]]. On 9 February 1990, a violently repressed student march in Niamey led to the death of three students, which led to increased national and international pressure for further democratic reform. The Saibou regime acquiesced to these demands by the end of 1990. Meanwhile, trouble re-emerged in Agadez Region when a group of armed Tuaregs attacked the town of Tchintabaraden (seen by some as the start of the first [[Tuareg rebellion (1990–1995)|Tuareg Rebellion]]), prompting a military crackdown which led to deaths (the precise numbers are disputed, with estimates ranging from 70 to up to 1,000).

[[File:Ali Saibou cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Ali Saibou]], President 1987–93, helped oversee the transition from military to civilian rule.]]

==== National Conference and Third Republic (1991–1996) ====
The National Sovereign Conference of 1991 brought about multi-party democracy. From 29 July to 3 November, a national conference gathered together all elements of society to make recommendations for the future direction of the country. The conference was presided over by Prof. [[André Salifou]] and developed a plan for a [[transitional government]]; this was then installed in November 1991 to manage the affairs of state until the institutions of the Third Republic were put into place in April 1993. After the National Sovereign Conference, the transitional government drafted a constitution that eliminated the previous single-party system of the 1989 Constitution and guaranteed more freedoms. The new constitution was adopted by a [[1992  constitutional referendum|referendum]] on 26 December 1992. Following this, presidential [[1993  parliamentary election|elections]] were held and [[Mahamane Ousmane]] became the first president of the Third Republic on 27 March 1993. Ousmane's presidency saw four government changes and legislative [[1995  parliamentary election|elections]] in 1995, and an economic slump.

The violence in Agadez Region continued during this period, prompting the  government to sign a truce with Tuareg rebels in 1992 which was ineffective owing to internal dissension within the Tuareg ranks. Another rebellion, led by dissatisfied [[Toubou]] peoples claiming that, like the Tuareg, the  government had neglected their region, broke out in the east of the country. In April 1995 a peace deal with a Tuareg rebel group was signed, with the government agreeing to absorb some former rebels into the military and, with  assistance, help others return to a productive civilian life.

==== Second and third military regimes (1996–1999) ====
The governmental paralysis prompted the military to intervene; on 27 January 1996, Col. [[Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara]] led a [[1996  coup d'état|coup]] that deposed President Ousmane and ended the Third Republic. Maïnassara headed a ''Conseil de Salut National'' (National Salvation Council) composed of military officials which carried out a six-month transition period, during which a constitution was drafted and adopted on 12 May 1996.

Presidential campaigns were organised in the months that followed. Maïnassara entered the campaign as an independent candidate and won the [[1996  parliamentary election|election]] on 8 July 1996, the elections were viewed nationally and internationally by some as irregular, as the electoral commission was replaced during the campaign. Meanwhile, Maïnassara instigated an [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[World Bank]]-approved privatisation programme which enriched some of his supporters and were opposed by the trade unions. Following fraudulent local elections in 1999 the opposition ceased any cooperation with the Maïnassara regime. In unknown circumstances (possibly attempting to flee the country), Maïnassara was assassinated at [[Niamey Airport]] on 9 April 1999.

Maj. [[Daouda Malam Wanké]] then took over, establishing a transitional National Reconciliation Council to oversee the drafting of a constitution with a -style [[semi-presidential system]]. This was adopted on 9 August 1999 and was followed by presidential and legislative [[1999  general election|elections]] in October and November of the same year. The elections were generally found to be free and fair by international observers. Wanké then withdrew from governmental affairs.

==== Fifth Republic (1999–2009) ====
[[File: MNJ fighter technical gun.JPG|thumb|A [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] rebel fighter in northern  during the Second Tuareg Rebellion, 2008]]
After winning the election in November 1999, President [[Tandja Mamadou]] was sworn into office on 22 December 1999 as the first president of the Fifth Republic. Mamadou brought about administrative and economic reforms that had been halted due to the military coups since the Third Republic, and helped peacefully resolve a decades-long boundary dispute with . In August 2002, unrest within military camps occurred in [[Niamey]], [[Diffa]], and [[Nguigmi]], and the government was able to restore order within days. On 24 July 2004, municipal elections were held to elect local representatives, previously appointed by the government. These elections were followed by presidential elections, in which Mamadou was re-elected for a second term, thus becoming the first president of the republic to win consecutive elections without being deposed by military coups. The legislative and executive configuration remained somewhat similar to that of the first term of the president: [[Hama Amadou]] was reappointed as prime minister and [[Mahamane Ousmane]], the head of the CDS party, was re-elected as the president of the National Assembly (parliament) by his peers.

By 2007, the relationship between President Tandja Mamadou and his prime minister had "deteriorated", leading to the replacement of the latter in June 2007 by [[Seyni Oumarou]] following a successful vote of no confidence at the Assembly. President Tandja Mamadou sought to extend his presidency by modifying the constitution which limited presidential terms. Proponents of the extended presidency, who rallied behind the 'Tazartche' (Hausa for 'overstay') movement, were countered by opponents ('anti-Tazartche') composed of opposition party militants and civil society activists.

The north saw the outbreak of a [[Second Tuareg Rebellion]] in 2007 led by the ''[[ Movement for Justice|Mouvement des Nigériens pour la justice]]'' (MNJ). With a number of kidnappings the rebellion had "largely fizzled out inconclusively" by 2009. The "poor" security situation in the region is thought to have allowed elements of [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] (AQIM) to gain a foothold in the country.

==== Sixth republic and fourth military regime (2009–2010) ====
In 2009, President Tandja Mamadou decided to organize a constitutional referendum seeking to [[2009–2010  constitutional crisis|extend his presidency]], which was opposed by other political parties, and went against the decision of the Constitutional Court which had ruled that the referendum would be unconstitutional. Mamadou then modified and adopted a new constitution by referendum, which was declared illegal by the Constitutional Court, prompting Mamadou to dissolve the Court and assume emergency powers. The opposition boycotted the referendum and the constitution was adopted with 92.5% of voters and a 68% turnout, according to official results. The adoption of the constitution created a Sixth Republic, with a [[presidential system]], the suspension of the 1999 Constitution, and a three-year interim government with Tandja Mamadou as president. The events generated political and social unrest.

In a [[2010  coup d'état|coup d'état]] in February 2010, a military junta led by [[Salou Djibo]] was established in response to Tandja's attempted extension of his political term. The [[Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy]], headed by Djibo, carried out a one-year transition plan, drafted a constitution and held elections in 2011.

==== Seventh Republic (2010–2023) ====
[[File:, Barkiawal Béri (04), vue aérienne avec RN25.jpg|thumb|Semi-arid  is threatened by further [[Desertification in Africa|desertification]].]]
Following the adoption of a constitution in 2010 and [[2011  general election|presidential elections]] a year later, [[Mahamadou Issoufou]] was elected as the first president of the Seventh Republic; he was then [[2016  general election|re-elected]] in 2016. The constitution restored the semi-presidential system which had been abolished a year earlier. An attempted coup against him in 2011 was thwarted and its ringleaders arrested. Issoufou's time in office was marked by threats to the country's security, stemming from the fallout from the [[ Civil War]] and [[Northern  conflict]], [[jihadist insurgency in |an insurgency in western ]] by [[al-Qaeda]] and [[Islamic State]], the spillover of 's [[Boko Haram insurgency]] into south-eastern , and the use of  as a transit country for migrants (often organised by [[people-smuggling]] [[gang]]s).  and  forces assisted  in countering these threats.

On 10 December 2019, a large group of fighters belonging to the [[Islamic State in the Greater Sahara]] (IS-GS) [[Battle of Inates|attacked]] a military post in [[Inates]], killing over seventy [[ Armed Forces|soldiers]] and kidnapping others. The attack was the deadliest single incident 's military has ever experienced. On 9 January 2020, a large group of IS-GS militants [[Battle of Chinagodrar|assaulted]] a  military base at Chinagodrar, in 's [[Tillabéri Region]], killing at least 89  soldiers.

On 27 December 2020,  [[2020–21  general election|went to the polls]] after Issoufou announced he would step down, paving the way to a [[peaceful transition of power]]. No candidate won an absolute majority in the vote: [[Mohamed Bazoum]] came closest with 39.33%. Per the constitution, a run-off election was held on 20 February 2021, with Bazoum taking 55.75% of the vote and opposition candidate (and former president) [[Mahamane Ousmane]] taking 44.25%, according to the electoral commission.

At the start of 2021 with the [[Tchoma Bangou and Zaroumdareye massacres]], IS-GS began killing civilians en masse. On 21 March 2021, the IS-GS militants [[Tillia massacres|attacked]] several villages around [[Tillia]], killing 141 people, mostly civilians.

On 31 March 2021, 's security forces thwarted an [[2021  coup d'état attempt|attempted coup]] by a military unit in the capital, [[Niamey]]. Gunfire was heard in the presidential palace. The attack took place two days before newly elected president [[Mohamed Bazoum]] was due to be sworn into office. The Presidential Guard arrested some people during the incident. On 2 April 2021, Bazoum was sworn in as the [[President of ]].

==== Fifth military regime (2023–present) ====
{{clear}}
[[File:Alliance of Sahel States.svg|thumb|upright|The [[Alliance of Sahel States]]]]
Late on 26 July 2023, a [[2023  coup d'état|coup by the military]] overthrew Bazoum, putting an end to the Seventh Republic and the [[Ouhoumoudou Mahamadou's government|government]] of Prime Minister [[Ouhoumoudou Mahamadou]]. On 28 July, General [[Abdourahamane Tchiani]] was proclaimed as the ''de facto'' head of state of the country. Former finance minister [[Ali Lamine Zeine]] was declared the new [[Prime Minister of ]].

The coup was condemned by ECOWAS, which in the [[2023  crisis]] threatened to use military intervention to reinstate the government of Bazoum if the coup leaders did not by 6 August. The deadline passed without military intervention, though ECOWAS imposed sanctions, including cuts of  energy exports to  which had previously provided 70–90% of 's power. In November 2023 the coup-led governments of , , and  formed the [[Alliance of Sahel States]] in opposition to potential military intervention. On 24 February 2024 several ECOWAS sanctions against  were dropped, reportedly for humanitarian and diplomatic reasons, and  agreed to resume electricity exports to .

In the buildup to the August ECOWAS deadline, the junta requested help from the  [[Wagner Group]], though Wagner mercenaries were not known to have entered the country as a result.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}} In October the junta expelled  troops from the country, presenting the move as a step towards sovereignty from the former colonial power, and in December it suspended cooperation with the [[Francophonie]] alleging its promotion of  interests. UN resident coordinator [[Louise Aubin]] was also expelled in October after the junta alleged "underhanded maneuvers" by UN secretary-general António Guterres to prevent the country's participation in the UN General Assembly. In October the U.S. officially designated the takeover as a coup, suspending most –U.S. military cooperation as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign assistance programs. In April 2024,  military trainers and equipment began to arrive in  under a new military agreement, and the U.S. agreed to withdraw troops from  following the termination of a –U.S. agreement that had allowed US personnel to be stationed in the country.

The earliest known presence of hominins in  dates to around 800,000 [[Before Present|BP]], in the [[Middle Paleolithic]]. Many [[Middle Paleolithic]] sites have been discovered, mainly in the [[Zagros Mountains]] in western  and some sites associated with [[Neanderthal]]s. The [[Zarzian culture]] is documented in  during the [[Epipaleolithic]] (25,000–11,500 BP). Agriculture first appeared in  some 12,000 years ago alongside better-documented settlements in the [[Fertile Crescent]]. The [[Chogha Golan]] site featured early domestication of [[emmer]] wheat, The contemporary site of [[Ganj Dareh]] also features the earliest known domestication of [[goat]]s around 10,000 years ago.

The ancient city of [[Susa]], which would become the capital of [[Elam]] and later a capital city of the [[Achaemenid empire]], was first settled in 4400–4200 BC, adjacent to the modern site of [[Shush, ]].{{rp|46–47}} The [[Kura–Araxes culture]] ({{circa|3400|2000 BC}}) existed in northwestern  and the [[Caucasus]].

Inscriptions in the [[Proto-Elamite script]], which predates [[cuneiform]], have been found from during the early third millennium BC. The western part of the  plateau participated in the traditional [[ancient Near East]] with [[Elam]] (3200–539 BC), and later with other peoples such as the [[Kassites]], [[Mannaea]]ns, and [[Gutians]].

[[File:Achaemenid Empire at its greatest extent according to Oxford Atlas of World History 2002.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Achaemenid Empire]], or the First Persian Empire, at its greatest extent]]

The [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenids]] united all [[Persians|Persian]] tribes under [[Cambyses I]]. Under his son, [[Cyrus the Great]], the Achaemenids defeated the Medes and established the [[Achaemenid Empire]],{{Sfn|Middleton|2015|p=148}} the largest-ever  state.{{Sfn|Shenkar|2014|p=5}} Cyrus conquered the [[Lydia]]n and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] empires, creating an empire far larger than Assyria. His son, [[Cambyses II]] ({{Reign}}530–522 BC), conquered the last major power of the region, [[ancient ]], causing the collapse of its [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of |twenty-sixth dynasty]].

After the death of Cambyses II, [[Darius the Great]] ({{Reign}}522–486) ascended the throne by overthrowing the Achaemenid monarch [[Bardiya]]. Darius' first capital was at Susa, and he started the building program at [[Persepolis]]. He improved the extensive road system, and during his reign the first recorded mentions are made of the [[Royal Road]], a highway from Susa to [[Sardis]].

In 499 BC, [[Classical Athens|Athens]] supported a revolt in [[Miletus]], resulting in the sacking of Sardis. This led to the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], which lasted the first half of the 5th century BC. In the [[First Persian invasion of ]], Persian general [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] re-subjugated Thrace and made Macedon a full part of Persia.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|p=345}} Darius' successor [[Xerxes I]] ({{Reign}}486–465) launched the [[Second Persian invasion of ]]. At a crucial moment in the war, about half of mainland  was overrun by the Persians, including territories to the north of the Isthmus of [[Corinth]].{{Sfn|Aeschylus|2009|p=18}} This was reversed by a  victory following the battles of [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]] and [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], during which Persia lost its footholds in Europe, and withdrew from it.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|pp=135–138, 342–345}}

The empire entered a period of decline. From 334 BC to 331 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] defeated [[Darius III]] ({{Reign}}336–330 BC) in the battles of [[Battle of the Granicus|Granicus]], [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] and [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]], swiftly conquering the Achaemanid Empire by 331 BC. Alexander's empire collapsed after his death; his general, [[Seleucus I Nicator]], tried to take control of , [[Mesopotamia]], [[]], and [[]]. His empire was the [[Seleucid Empire]].

The [[Parthian Empire]] endured for five centuries, but civil wars destabilized it. Parthian power evaporated when [[Ardashir I]] revolted against the Arsacids and killed their last ruler, [[Artabanus IV of Parthia|Artabanus IV]], in 224 AD. Ardashir established the [[Sasanian Empire]], which ruled  and much of [[Near East]] before the [[Early Muslim conquests|Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century AD.{{Sfn|Shahbazi|2005}}

At their zenith, the Sasanians controlled all of modern-day  and  and parts of the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|Arabian Peninsula]], as well as the [[Caucasus]], the [[Levant]], and parts of [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]]. The strong economic conditions left by Parthians allowed the Sasanians to build a powerful and distinctive economic state whose reputation spread well beyond its political frontiers and time.{{Sfn|Gyselen|1997}} The Sasanian Empire was characterized by a complex and centralized government bureaucracy and the revitalization of [[Zoroastrianism]] as a legitimizing and unifying ideal.{{Sfn|Eiland|2004|p=81}}

=== Medieval period ===
After the fall of the Sasanian Empire in 651, the [[Arabs]] of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] adopted many Persian customs, especially the administrative and the court mannerisms. Arab provincial governors were either Persianized [[Arameans]] or ethnic Persians; Persian remained the official language of the caliphate until the adoption of Arabic toward the end of the 7th century.{{Sfn|Hawting|1986|p=63–64}} However,  was still not entirely under Arab control; the [[Daylam]] region was under the control of the [[Daylamites]], [[Tabaristan]] was under [[Dabuyid dynasty|Dabuyid]] and [[Paduspanids|Paduspanid]] control, and [[Mount Damavand]] under [[Masmughans of Damavand|Masmughan]] control. Arabs had invaded these regions several times but the regions' inaccessible terrain prevented a decisive result. The most prominent ruler of the Dabuyids, [[Farrukhan the Great]] ({{Reign}}712–728), managed to hold his domains during his long struggle against the Arab general [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]], who was defeated by a combined Daylamite–Dabuyid army and forced to retreat from Tabaristan.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|pp=312–313}}

Anti-Umayyad insurrections were supported by non-Arab Islamic converts, who were resentful over being relegated to lower social standing. In 747–750, one of these insurrections grew into the [[Abbasid revolution]], in which descendants of Muhammad's uncle, [[Abbas ibn Ali|Abbas]], overthrew the Umayyads.{{Sfn|Osman|2014|pp=62–63}} The political authority of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid caliphs]] diminished over the course of the 9th and 10th centuries.{{Sfn|Lorentz|2007|p=xxviii}} This led to the establishment of several independent  dynasties,{{Sfn|Lorentz|2007|p=xxviii}} the ousting of Arab rulers from their scattered bastions across the country, and an  cultural renaissance.{{Sfn|Mahendrarajah|2019}} The period between the collapse of Abbasid authority and the conquest of  by the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]] in the 11th century is referred to as the "[[ Intermezzo]]."{{Sfn|Mahendrarajah|2019}}

The  Intermezzo saw the rise and fall of several major and minor dynasties.{{Sfn|Mahendrarajah|2019}} Among the most important of these overlapping dynasties were the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (821–873); the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarids]] in [[Sistan]] (861–1003); and the [[Samanid Empire|Samanids]] (819–1005), originally at [[Bukhara]]. The Samanids eventually ruled an area from central  to . By early 10th century, the Abbasids almost lost control to the growing  faction known as the [[Buyid dynasty]] (934–1062). Since much of the Abbasid administration had been Persian, the Buyids were quietly able to assume real power in Baghdad. The Buyids were defeated in the mid-11th century by the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuq Turks]], who continued to exert influence over the Abbasids. From the empire's inception, the Seljuk rulers minted coins with the title ''šāhānšāh'' ({{Literal translation|King of Kings}}) in its Persian form,{{sfn|Barthold|1962|p=108}} perhaps adopting it from the Buyids.{{Sfn|Blair|1992|p=6}} The Seljuk Empire fractured after the death of [[Ahmad Sanjar]] in 1157.

The [[Islamization of ]] was a long process. As Persian Muslims consolidated their rule, the Muslim population rose from approximately 40% in the mid-9th century to close to 90% by the end of the 11th century. Historian [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] suggests that the rapid increase in conversion was aided by the Persian nationality of the rulers. Although Persians adopted the religion of their conquerors, over the centuries they worked to protect and revive their distinctive language and culture, a process known as [[Persianization]]. Arabs and Turks participated in this process.

[[Kublai Khan]] was eventually universally recognized, but the empire was irreversibly fragmented.{{Sfn|Lane|2012|p=250}} In much of the southwest of the empire, including , power fell to [[Hulegu Khan]],{{Sfn|Rossabi|2002|p=32}} who had been made a deputy there under Möngke Khan.{{Sfn|Lane|2012|p=250}} Hulegu was accepted as a legitimate ruler in  and was legitimized through a ''[[fatwa]]'' issued by the Shia scholar [[Ali ibn Tawus al-Hilli]].{{Sfn|Lane|2012|pp=253–254, 256}}  experienced a cultural renaissance under [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanid]] rule.{{Sfn|Lane|2012|pp=253–254, 256}} [[Ghazan Khan]] converted to Islam in the late 13th century, turning the state further away from the other Mongol realms.{{Sfn|Rossabi|2002|p=32}}

After Ghazan's nephew [[Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan|Abu Said]] died in 1335, the Ilkhanate lapsed into civil war and was divided between several petty dynasties – most prominently the [[Jalayirids]], [[Muzaffarids ()|Muzaffarids]], [[Sarbadars]] and [[Kartids]]. The mid-14th-century [[Black Death]] killed about 30% of the country's population.

==== Timur and the rise of new powers ====
{{See also|Timurid conquests and invasions}}
[[File:Empire of Timur and his Campaigns.png|thumb|[[Timur]]'s empire and his military campaigns]]
 remained divided until the establishment of the Persianate [[Timurid dynasty]] in 1370. Its founder, Timur (r. 1370–1405), hailed from a [[Turkification|Turkified]] tribe of Mongols. After establishing a power base in [[Transoxiana]], Timur invaded  in 1381 and eventually conquered most of it. Timur's campaigns were known for their brutality; many people were slaughtered and several cities were destroyed. In 1387, Timur ordered the complete [[Siege of Isfahan (1387)|massacre of Isfahan]], killing 70,000 people. The Timurids maintained control of most of  until 1452, when they lost the bulk of it to the [[Qara Qoyunlu]], who were conquered in turn by the [[Aq Qoyunlu]] 1468. [[Uzun Hasan]] and his successors were the masters of  until the rise of the Safavids.

[[File:Safavid Empire 1501 1722 AD.png|thumb|[[Safavid ]] (1501–1722) at its greatest extent]]

The [[Safavid |Safavid Empire]], founded by [[Ismail I]] (r. 1505–1524), is often considered the beginning of modern  history.{{Sfn|Matthee|2008}} While Safavid  predated the concept of the nation-state as such, it established the basis for the modern state of .{{Sfn|Matthee|2008}}{{Sfn|Brown|2011|p=432}} The [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] dynastic period was one of the most important  history, as it reunified  as a cohesive entity under native rule and established Shia Islam as the [[State religion|official religion]].{{Sfn|Savory|Karamustafa|1998|p=}} The Safavids ruled from 1501 to 1722, and experienced a brief restoration from 1729 to 1736.

The Safavid state had a complex bureaucratic system of checks and balances, which ensured transparency and prevented fraud. However, this system was intended not to equalize power between branches of government, but to ensure total power of the shah. Legitimized by his bloodline as a [[sayyid]], or descendant of Muhammad, the shah monitored the actions of government officials through reports provided by the superintendent of each department. [[Jean Chardin]],  merchant and eventual ambassador to , wrote that the Safavid shahs ruled their land with an iron fist and often in a [[Despotism|despotic]] manner.[[File:Afsharid  1741.png|thumb|The [[Afsharid ]] at its greatest extent in 1741–1745 under [[Nader Shah]]]]
Complex rivalries in the region of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] led to the  [[Hotak dynasty]] invading . In 1722, this conflict led to the collapse of the Safavid Empire after the [[siege of Isfahan]].{{Sfn|Matthee|2008}}{{Sfn|Aghaie|2012|p=306}} The brief interlude between 1722 and the rise of the [[Qajar dynasty]] in 1789–1796 was marked by widespread political turmoil in  and several rival attempts to establish power over the country. The Safavids failed to regain power and the Hotaks failed to establish control. The rival [[Afsharid |Afsharid]] and [[Zand dynasty|Zand]] dynasties were established by [[Nader Shah]] ({{Reign}}1736–1747) and [[Karim Khan Zand|Karim Khan]] ({{Reign}}1751–1779), respectively.{{Sfn|Aghaie|2012|p=306}}

==== Nader Shah and the shifting balance of power ====
{{See also|Campaigns of Nader Shah}}
Nader Shah has been described as "the last great Asiatic military conqueror," and compared by some historians to Napoleon and Alexander the Great.{{sfn|Axworthy|2008|p=xvii}} His numerous campaigns created a great empire that, at its maximum extent, briefly encompassed all or part of modern-day , , , , , , , , , , , , , the [[North Caucasus]], and the [[Persian Gulf]].

Nader Shah's death was followed by a [[Division of the Afsharid Empire|period of anarchy]] in  as rival army commanders fought for power. Nader's own family, the Afsharids, lost all but a small domain in Khorasan.

{{Main|Pahlavi }}

==== Constitutional Revolution and the rise of the Pahlavi dynasty ====
[[File:RezaShahBozorgTakhteJamshid32.jpg|thumb|[[Reza Shah Pahlavi]] with [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] at [[Persepolis]]]]
The [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] between 1905 and 1911 led to the establishment of an  parliament. After the [[1921 Persian coup d'état|1921 coup d'état]], the Qajar dynasty was replaced with the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. The dynasty was founded by [[Reza Shah]], who established an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian government]] that valued [[ nationalism|nationalism]], [[militarism]], [[secularism in |secularism]] and [[anti-communism]] combined with strict [[censorship]] and [[state propaganda]]. Reza Shah introduced many socio-economic reforms, reorganizing the army, government administration, and finances. Reza Shah ruled for almost 16 years until 1941, when he was forced to [[Abdication|abdicate]] by the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of ]].

To his supporters, his reign brought "[[Law and order (politics)|law and order]], discipline, central authority, and modern amenities – schools, trains, buses, radios, cinemas, and telephones." However, his reign has been characterized as a corrupt [[police state]] which provided only surface level modernization.

==== World War II and post-occupation instability ====
Due in part to Nazi 's [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]], the  government expected  to win the war and establish a powerful force on the - border.  rejected  and Soviet demands to expel  residents from its borders. In response, the two [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] invaded in August 1941 and easily overwhelmed the weak  army in [[Operation Countenance]].  became the major conduit of Allied [[Lend-Lease]] aid to the Soviet Union. The purpose was to secure  oil fields and ensure Allied supply lines through the [[Persian Corridor]].  remained officially neutral. Reza Shah was deposed during the subsequent occupation and replaced with his young son [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]. At the 1943 [[Tehran Conference]], the Allied "Big Three"—[[Joseph Stalin]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and [[Winston Churchill]]—issued the Tehran Declaration to guarantee the post-war independence and boundaries of .

In 1951, under Prime Minister [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]], the  parliament voted to nationalize the -owned oil industry, leading to the [[Abadan Crisis]]. Despite  pressure, including an economic blockade, nationalization continued. Mosaddegh was removed from power in 1952 but was quickly re-appointed by the Shah, due to a popular uprising in support of the premier. He forced the Shah into a brief exile in August 1953 after a failed military coup by [[Imperial Guard ()|Imperial Guard]] Colonel [[Nematollah Nassiri]].

On 19 August, a successful [[1953  coup d'état|coup]] was headed by retired army general [[Fazlollah Zahedi]], aided by the US ([[CIA]]) and the  ([[MI6]]), known as Operation Ajax and Operation Boot to the respective agencies. The coup—with a [[black propaganda]] campaign  against Mosaddegh — forced Mosaddegh from office. Mosaddegh was arrested and tried for treason. Found guilty, his sentence was reduced to house arrest on his family estate while his foreign minister, [[Hossein Fatemi]], was executed. [[Fazlollah Zahedi|Zahedi]] succeeded him as prime minister and suppressed opposition to the Shah, specifically from the [[National Front ()|National Front]] and the communist [[Tudeh Party]].

From that time until the revolution,  was ruled as an autocracy under the Shah, with strong  support.  initiated economic, social, agrarian, and administrative reforms to modernize the country, which became known as the [[White Revolution]]. Many Islamic leaders criticized these initiatives, and the land reform had mixed results. By 1978, the Shah had become wildly unpopular among the  people. Daily demonstrations destabilized the region, and the Shah established [[martial law]] to curb opposition. When hundreds of thousands of protestors persisted, security forces opened fire on the crowds in an incident that became known as [[Black Friday (1978)|Black Friday]].

{{Main| Revolution}}

[[File:Imam Khomeini in Mehrabad.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] returns to  after 14 years exile in  on 1 February 1979.]]
The protests against the Shah grew to include more than 10% of the country; it is rare for revolutions to involve even 1% of a country's population. Frustration with the Shah was so great that even secular and leftist groups supported [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Rohullah Khomeini]], the leader of the [[ Revolution|revolution]], despite sharing none of his political positions. Under increasing pressure, the Shah eventually fled , charging the interim [[Regency Council ()|Regency Council]] with his duties until a new government was formed. [[Shapour Bakhtiar]], the head of the Council, invited Khomeini to return from exile. However, upon return, Khomeini pledged to defeat the interim government led by Bakhtiar and claimed to support free democratic elections. Violence broke out between the two factions, ultimately leading Bakhtiar to flee  in disguise.

On 31 March 1979, a [[1979  Islamic Republic referendum|referendum]] was held on whether to transition from a government of monarchy to an [[Islamic republic]]. The referendum was approved by a massive margin. It mandated the creation of an [[Assembly for the Final Review of the Constitution|assembly]] to draft the new [[theocratic]] constitution, whereby Khomeini became [[Supreme Leader of |Supreme Leader]] in December 1979.

{{further|Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Assassination of Qasem Soleimani|2024 – conflict|– war}}On his deathbed in 1989, Khomeini appointed a 25-man Constitutional Reform Council which named [[Ali Khamenei]] as the next Supreme Leader, and made changes to 's constitution. A smooth transition followed Khomeini's death on 3 June 1989. While Khamenei lacked Khomeini's "charisma and clerical standing", he developed a network of supporters within 's armed forces and its economically powerful [[Bonyad|religious foundations]].

In 1989, President [[Akbar Rafsanjani]] concentrated on a pro-business policy of rebuilding the economy, without breaking with the ideology of the revolution. He supported a free market, favoring privatization of state industries and a moderate position internationally. In 1997, Rafsanjani was succeeded by moderate [[ reform movement|reformist]] [[Mohammad Khatami]], whose government advocated [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], constructive diplomatic relations with Asia and the European Union, and policy that supported a free market and foreign investment.

The [[2005  presidential election|2005 presidential election]] brought conservative populist and nationalist candidate [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] to power. He was known for his hardline views, nuclearization, and [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and |hostility towards ]], [[]], the UK, US and other states. He was the first president to be summoned by the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly|parliament]] to answer questions regarding his presidency. In 2013, centrist and reformist [[Hassan Rouhani]] was elected president. He encouraged personal freedom, free access to information, and improved women's rights. He improved 's diplomatic relations through exchanging conciliatory letters. The [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] was reached in [[Vienna]] in 2015, between , the [[P5+1]] ([[permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] + ) and the EU.

===Land migration===
[[File:Cistones.jpg|thumb|Prehistoric polished stone [[celt (tool)|celt]] from [[Boundiali]] in northern , photo taken at the [[IFAN Museum of African Arts]] in [[Dakar]], ]]

The first human presence in  has been difficult to determine because human remains have not been well preserved in the country's humid climate. However, newly found weapon and tool fragments (specifically, polished axes cut through [[shale]] and remnants of cooking and fishing) have been interpreted as a possible indication of a large human presence during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period (15,000 to 10,000 BC), or at the minimum, the [[Neolithic]] period.

The earliest known inhabitants of  have left traces scattered throughout the territory. Historians believe that they were all either displaced or absorbed by the ancestors of the present indigenous inhabitants, who migrated south into the area before the 16th century. Such groups included the Ehotilé ([[Aboisso]]), Kotrowou (Fresco), Zéhiri ([[Grand-Lahou]]), Ega and Diès ([[Divo, |Divo]]).

===Pre-Islamic and Islamic periods===
The first recorded history appears in the chronicles of North African ([[Berbers|Berber]]) traders, who, from early [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]], conducted a [[caravan (travellers)|caravan]] trade across the [[Sahara]] in salt, slaves, gold, and other goods. The southern termini of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes were located on the edge of the desert, and from there supplemental trade extended as far south as the edge of the rainforest. The most important terminals—[[Djenné]], [[Gao]], and [[Timbuktu|Timbuctu]]—grew into major commercial centres around which the great Sudanic empires developed.

By controlling the trade routes with their powerful military forces, these empires were able to dominate neighbouring states. The Sudanic empires also became centres of [[Islamic studies|Islamic education]]. Islam had been introduced in the [[ (region)|western ]] by Muslim Berbers; it spread rapidly after the conversion of many important rulers. From the 11th century, by which time the rulers of the Sudanic empires had embraced Islam, it spread south into the northern areas of contemporary .

The [[ Empire]], the earliest of the Sudanic empires, flourished in the region encompassing present-day southeast [[]] and southern [[]] between the 4th and 13th centuries. At the peak of its power in the 11th century, its realms extended from the Atlantic Ocean to Timbuktu. After the decline of , the [[ Empire]] grew into a powerful Muslim state, which reached its apogee in the early part of the 14th century. The territory of the  Empire in  was limited to the northwest corner around [[Odienné]].

Its slow decline starting at the end of the 14th century followed internal discord and revolts by vassal states, one of which, [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]], flourished as an empire between the 14th and 16th centuries. Songhai was also weakened by internal discord, which led to factional warfare. This discord spurred most of the migrations southward toward the forest belt. The dense rainforest covering the southern half of the country created barriers to the large-scale political organisations that had arisen in the north. Inhabitants lived in villages or clusters of villages; their contacts with the outside world were filtered through long-distance traders. Villagers [[subsistence agriculture|subsisted on agriculture]] and hunting.

===Pre-European modern period===
[[File:Royaumes ci.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Pre-European kingdoms]]
Five important states flourished in  during the pre-European [[early modern period]]. The Muslim [[Kong Empire]] was established by the [[Dyula people|Dyula]] in the early 18th century in the north-central region inhabited by the [[Senufo people|Sénoufo]], who had fled [[Islamization|Islamisation]] under the  Empire. Although Kong became a prosperous centre of agriculture, trade, and crafts, ethnic diversity and religious discord gradually weakened the kingdom. In 1895 the city of Kong was sacked and conquered by [[Samori Ture]] of the [[Wassoulou Empire]].

The [[Abron tribe|Abron]] kingdom of [[Gyaman|Gyaaman]] was established in the 17th century by an Akan group, the Abron, who had fled the developing [[Asante people|Ashanti]] confederation of Asanteman in what is present-day . From their settlement south of [[Bondoukou]], the Abron gradually extended their hegemony over the [[Dyula people]] in Bondoukou, who were recent arrivals from the market city of [[Begho]]. Bondoukou developed into a major centre of commerce and Islam. The kingdom's [[Quran]]ic scholars attracted students from all parts of West Africa. In the mid-17th century in east-central , other Akan groups fleeing the Asante established a [[Baoulé people|Baoulé]] kingdom at [[Sakassou|Sakasso]] and two [[Anyi people|Agni]] kingdoms, Indénié and [[Kingdom of Sanwi|Sanwi]].

The Baoulé, like the Ashanti, developed a highly centralised political and administrative structure under three successive rulers. It finally split into smaller chiefdoms. Despite the breakup of their kingdom, the Baoulé strongly resisted  subjugation. The descendants of the rulers of the Agni kingdoms tried to retain their separate identity long after 's independence; as late as 1969, the Sanwi attempted to break away from  and form an independent kingdom.

===Establishment of  rule===
Compared to neighbouring , , though practising slavery and slave raiding, suffered little from the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]]. European slave and merchant ships preferred other areas along the coast. The earliest recorded European voyage to West Africa was made by the [[ Empire|]] in 1482.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}} The first West African  settlement, [[-Louis, |-Louis]], was founded in the mid-17th century in , while at about the same time, the  ceded to the  a settlement at [[Gorée|Gorée Island]], off [[Dakar]]. A  [[Mission (station)|mission]] was established in 1687 at [[Assinie-Mafia|Assinie]] near the border with the [[Gold Coast ( colony)|Gold Coast]] (now ). The Europeans suppressed the local practice of slavery at this time and forbade the trade to their merchants.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Assinie's survival was precarious, however; the  were not firmly established in  until the mid-19th century. In 1843–44,  Admiral [[Édouard Bouët-Willaumez|Louis Édouard Bouët-Willaumez]] signed treaties with the kings of the [[Grand-Bassam]] and Assinie regions, making their territories a  protectorate.  explorers, missionaries, trading companies, and soldiers gradually extended the area under  control inland from the lagoon region. Pacification was not accomplished until 1915.

Activity along the coast stimulated European interest in the interior, especially along the two great rivers, the [[ River|]] and the [[ River|]]. Concerted  exploration of West Africa began in the mid-19th century but moved slowly, based more on individual initiative than on government policy. In the 1840s, the  concluded a series of treaties with local West African chiefs that enabled the  to build fortified posts along the Gulf of  to serve as permanent trading centres. The first posts in  included one at Assinie and another at Grand-Bassam, which became the colony's first capital. The treaties provided for  sovereignty within the posts and for trading privileges in exchange for fees or ''[[coutume]]s'' paid annually to the local chiefs for the use of the land. The arrangement was not entirely satisfactory to the , because trade was limited and misunderstandings over treaty obligations often arose. Nevertheless, the  government maintained the treaties, hoping to expand trade.  also wanted to maintain a presence in the region to stem the increasing influence of the  along the Gulf of  coast.

The defeat of  in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871 and the subsequent annexation by  of the  province of [[Alsace–Lorraine]] initially caused the  government to abandon its colonial ambitions and withdraw its military garrisons from its West African trading posts, leaving them in the care of resident merchants. The trading post at Grand-Bassam was left in the care of a shipper from [[Marseille]], [[Arthur Verdier]], who in 1878 was named [[Resident minister|Resident]] of the Establishment of .

In 1886, to support its claims of effective occupation,  again assumed direct control of its West African coastal trading posts and embarked on an accelerated program of exploration in the interior. In 1887, Lieutenant [[Louis-Gustave Binger]] began a two-year journey that traversed parts of 's interior. By the end of the journey, he had concluded four treaties establishing  protectorates in . Also in 1887, Verdier's agent, [[Marcel Treich-Laplène]], negotiated five additional agreements that extended  influence from the headwaters of the  River Basin through .

By the end of the 1880s,  had established control over the coastal regions, and in 1889 Britain recognised  sovereignty in the area. That same year,  named Treich-Laplène the titular governor of the territory. In 1893,  became a  colony, with its capital in Grand-Bassam, and Captain Binger was appointed governor. Agreements with  in 1892 and with Britain in 1893 determined the eastern and western boundaries of the colony, but the northern boundary was not fixed until 1947 because of efforts by the  government to attach parts of Upper Volta (present-day [[]]) and [[ ]] (present-day ) to  for economic and administrative reasons.

's main goal was to stimulate the production of exports. Coffee, cocoa, and palm oil crops were soon planted along the coast.  stood out as the only West African country with a sizeable population of European settlers; elsewhere in West and Central Africa, Europeans who emigrated to the colonies were largely bureaucrats. As a result,  citizens owned one-third of the cocoa, coffee, and banana [[plantation]]s and adopted the local forced-labour system.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

[[File: West Africa 1913 map.png|thumb|left|Colonies of [[ West Africa]] {{Circa|1913}}]]
Throughout the early years of  rule,  military contingents were sent inland to establish new posts. The African population resisted  penetration and settlement, even in areas where treaties of protection had been in force. Among those offering the greatest resistance was [[Samori Ture]], who in the 1880s and 1890s was establishing the [[Wassoulou Empire]], which extended over large parts of present-day , , , and . Ture's large, well-equipped army, which could manufacture and repair its own firearms, attracted strong support throughout the region. The  responded to Ture's expansion and conquest with military pressure.  campaigns against Ture, which were met with fierce resistance, intensified in the mid-1890s until he was captured in 1898 and his empire dissolved.

's imposition of a [[Poll tax|head tax]] in 1900 to support the colony's [[public works]] program provoked protests. Many Ivorians saw the tax as a violation of the protectorate treaties because they felt that  was demanding the equivalent of a ''coutume'' from the local kings, rather than the reverse. Many, especially in the interior, also considered the tax a humiliating symbol of submission. In 1905, the  officially abolished [[Slavery in Africa|slavery]] in most of  West Africa. From 1904 to 1958,  was part of the Federation of [[ West Africa]]. It was a colony and an overseas territory under the [[ Third Republic|Third Republic]]. In [[World War I]],  organized regiments from  to fight in , and colony resources were rationed from 1917 to 1919.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}} Until the period following [[World War II]], governmental affairs in  West Africa were administered from Paris. 's policy in West Africa was reflected mainly in its philosophy of "association", meaning that all Africans in  were officially  "subjects" but without rights to representation in Africa or .

[[ colonial empires#Second  colonial empire| colonial policy]] incorporated concepts of [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and association. Based on the assumed superiority of  culture, in practice the assimilation policy meant the extension of the  language, institutions, laws, and customs to the colonies. The policy of association also affirmed the superiority of the  in the colonies, but it entailed different institutions and systems of laws for the coloniser and the colonised. Under this policy, the Africans in  were allowed to preserve their own customs insofar as they were compatible with  interests.

An indigenous elite trained in  administrative practice formed an intermediary group between  and Africans. After 1930, a small number of Westernized Ivorians were granted the right to apply for  citizenship. Most Ivorians, however, were classified as  subjects and were governed under the principle of association. As subjects of , natives outside the civilised elite had no political rights. They were drafted for work in mines, on plantations, as porters, and on public projects as part of their tax responsibility. They were expected to serve in the military and were subject to the ''[[indigénat]]'', a separate system of law.

During World War II, the [[Vichy |Vichy regime]] remained in control until 1943, when members of General [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s provisional government assumed control of all  West Africa. The [[Brazzaville Conference]] of 1944, the first Constituent Assembly of the [[ Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in 1946, and 's gratitude for African loyalty during World War II, led to far-reaching governmental reforms in 1946.  citizenship was granted to all African "subjects", the right to organise politically was recognised, and various forms of forced labour were abolished. Between 1944 and 1946, many national conferences and constituent assemblies took place between 's government and provisional governments in .{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}} Governmental reforms were established by late 1946, which granted  citizenship to all African "subjects" under the colonial control of the .{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Until 1958, governors appointed in Paris administered the colony of , using a system of direct, centralised administration that left little room for Ivorian participation in policy-making. The  colonial administration also adopted divide-and-rule policies, applying ideas of assimilation only to the educated elite. The  were also interested in ensuring that the small but influential Ivorian elite was sufficiently satisfied with the ''status quo'' to refrain from developing [[anti- sentiment]]s and calls for independence. Although strongly opposed to the practices of association, educated Ivorians believed that they would achieve equality in the  colonial system through assimilation rather than through complete independence from . After the assimilation doctrine was implemented through the postwar reforms, though, Ivorian leaders realised that even assimilation implied the superiority of the  over the Ivorians and that discrimination and inequality would end only with independence.

===Independence===
[[File:Houphouet-Boigny Kennedy.jpg|thumb|President [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] and First Lady [[Marie-Thérèse Houphouët-Boigny]] in the [[White House]] [[Entrance Hall]] with President [[John F. Kennedy]] and First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] in 1962]]
[[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]], the son of a [[Baoulé people|Baoulé chief]], became 's father of independence. In 1944, he formed the country's first agricultural trade union for African cocoa farmers like himself. Angered that colonial policy favoured  plantation owners, the union members united to recruit migrant workers for their own farms. Houphouët-Boigny soon rose to prominence and was elected to the  Parliament in Paris within a year. A year later, the  abolished [[forced labour]]. Houphouët-Boigny established a strong relationship with the  government, expressing a belief that  would benefit from the relationship, which it did for many years.  appointed him as a minister, the first African to become a minister in a European government.

A turning point in relations with  was reached with the 1956 Overseas Reform Act (''[[Loi-cadre Defferre|Loi Cadre]]''), which transferred several powers from Paris to elected territorial governments in  West Africa and also removed the remaining voting inequities. On 4 December 1958,  became an autonomous member of the  Community, which had replaced the [[ Union]].

By 1960, the country was easily  West Africa's most prosperous, contributing over 40% of the region's total exports. When Houphouët-Boigny became the first president, his government gave farmers good prices for their products to further stimulate production, which was further boosted by a significant immigration of workers from surrounding countries. Coffee production increased significantly, catapulting  into third place in world output, behind  and . By 1979, the country was the world's leading producer of cocoa. It also became Africa's leading exporter of pineapples and palm oil.  technicians contributed to the "Ivorian miracle". In other African nations, the people drove out the Europeans following independence, but in , they poured in. The  community grew from only 30,000 before independence to 60,000 in 1980, most of them teachers, managers, and advisors. For 20 years, the economy maintained an annual growth rate of nearly 10%—the highest of Africa's non-oil-exporting countries.

===Houphouët-Boigny administration===
Houphouët-Boigny's one-party rule was not amenable to political competition. [[Laurent Gbagbo]], (who eventually became the president of  in 2000) had to flee the country in the 1980s after he incurred the ire of Houphouët-Boigny by founding the [[Ivorian Popular Front]]. Houphouët-Boigny banked on his broad appeal to the population, who continued to elect him. He was criticised for his emphasis on developing large-scale projects.

Many felt the millions of dollars spent transforming his home village, [[Yamoussoukro]], into the new political capital were wasted; others supported his vision to develop a centre for peace, education, and religion in the heart of the country. In the early 1980s, the world recession and a local drought sent shock waves through the Ivorian economy. The overcutting of timber and collapsing sugar prices caused the country's external debt to increase three-fold. Crime rose dramatically in [[Abidjan]] as an influx of villagers exacerbated unemployment caused by the recession. In 1990, hundreds of civil servants went on strike, joined by students protesting [[institutional corruption]]. The unrest forced the government to support multi-party democracy. Houphouët-Boigny became increasingly feeble and died in 1993. He favoured [[Henri Konan Bédié]] as his successor.

===Bédié administration===
In October 1995, Bédié overwhelmingly won re-election against a fragmented and disorganised opposition. He tightened his hold over political life, jailing several hundred opposition supporters. In contrast, the economic outlook improved, at least superficially, with decreasing inflation and an attempt to remove foreign debt. Unlike Houphouët-Boigny, who was very careful to avoid any ethnic conflict and left access to administrative positions open to immigrants from neighbouring countries, Bedié emphasised the concept of ''[[Ivoirité]]'' to exclude his rival [[Alassane Ouattara]], who had two northern Ivorian parents, from running for the future presidential election. As people originating from foreign countries are a large part of the Ivorian population, this policy excluded many people of Ivorian nationality. The relationship between various ethnic groups became strained, resulting in two civil wars in the following decades.

Similarly, Bedié excluded many potential opponents from the army. In late 1999, a group of dissatisfied officers [[1999 Ivorian coup d'état|staged a military coup]], putting General [[Robert Guéï]] in power. Bedié fled into exile in . The new leadership reduced crime and corruption, and the generals pressed for [[austerity]] and campaigned in the streets for a less wasteful society.

===First civil war===
{{Main|First Ivorian Civil War}}
A [[2000 Ivorian presidential election|presidential election was held in October 2000]] in which Laurent Gbagbo vied with Guéï, but it was not peaceful. The lead-up to the election was marked by military and civil unrest. Following a public uprising that resulted in around 180 deaths, Guéï was swiftly replaced by Gbagbo. Ouattara was disqualified by the country's Supreme Court because of his alleged [[|Burkinabé]] nationality. The constitution did not allow noncitizens to run for the presidency. This sparked violent protests in which his supporters, mainly from the country's north, battled riot police in the capital, Yamoussoukro.

In the early hours of 19 September 2002, while Gbagbo was in , an armed uprising occurred. Troops who were to be demobilised mutinied, launching attacks in several cities. The battle for the main [[gendarmerie]] barracks in Abidjan lasted until mid-morning, but by lunchtime the government forces had secured Abidjan. They had lost control of the north of the country, and rebel forces made their stronghold in the northern city of [[Bouaké]]. The rebels threatened to move on to Abidjan again, and  deployed troops from its base in the country to stop their advance. The  said they were protecting their citizens from danger, but their deployment also helped government forces. That the  were helping either side was not established as a fact, but each side accused the  of supporting the opposite side. Whether  actions improved or worsened the situation in the long term is disputed. What exactly happened that night is also disputed. [[File:059  Foreign Legion.JPG|thumb|Armed Ivorians next to a [[ Foreign Legion]] armoured car, 2004]]The government claimed that former president Robert Guéï led a coup attempt, and state TV showed pictures of his dead body in the street; counter-claims stated that he and 15 others had been murdered at his home, and his body had been moved to the streets to incriminate him. Ouattara took refuge in the  embassy; his home had been burned down. President Gbagbo cut short his trip to  and on his return stated, in a television address, that some of the rebels were hiding in the shanty towns where foreign migrant workers lived. Gendarmes and vigilantes bulldozed and burned homes by the thousands, attacking residents. An early ceasefire with the rebels, which had the backing of much of the northern populace, proved short-lived and fighting over the prime cocoa-growing areas resumed.  sent in troops to maintain the cease-fire boundaries, and militias, including warlords and fighters from [[]] and [[]], took advantage of the crisis to seize parts of the west.

In January 2003, Gbagbo and rebel leaders signed accords creating a "government of national unity". Curfews were lifted, and  troops patrolled the country's western border. The unity government was unstable, and central problems remained with neither side achieving its goals. In March 2004, 120 people were killed at an opposition rally, and subsequent mob violence led to the evacuation of foreign nationals. A report concluded the killings were planned. Though UN peacekeepers were deployed to maintain a "Zone of Confidence", relations between Gbagbo and the opposition continued to deteriorate.

Early in November 2004, after the peace agreement had effectively collapsed because the rebels refused to disarm, Gbagbo ordered airstrikes against the rebels. During [[2004 –Ivorian clashes|one of these airstrikes]] in Bouaké, on 6 November 2004,  soldiers were hit, and nine were killed; the Ivorian government said it was a mistake, but the  claimed it was deliberate. They responded by destroying most Ivorian military aircraft (two Su-25 planes and five helicopters), and violent retaliatory riots against the  broke out in Abidjan.

Gbagbo's original term as president expired on 30 October 2005, but a peaceful election was deemed impossible, so his term in office was extended for a maximum of one year, according to a plan worked out by the [[African Union]] and endorsed by the [[United Nations Security Council]]. With the late-October deadline approaching in 2006, the election was regarded as very unlikely to be held by that point, and the opposition and the rebels rejected the possibility of another term extension for Gbagbo. The UN Security Council endorsed another one-year extension of Gbagbo's term on 1 November 2006; however, the resolution provided for strengthening of Prime Minister [[Charles Konan Banny]]'s powers. Gbagbo said the next day that elements of the resolution deemed to be constitutional violations would not be applied.

A peace accord between the government and the rebels, or [[Forces Nouvelles de Côte d'Ivoire|New Forces]], was signed on 4 March 2007, and subsequently [[Guillaume Soro]], leader of the New Forces, became prime minister. These events were seen by some observers as substantially strengthening Gbagbo's position. According to UNICEF, at the end of the civil war, water and sanitation infrastructure had been greatly damaged. Communities across the country required repairs to their water supply.

The presidential elections that should have been organised in 2005 were postponed until November 2010. The preliminary results showed a loss for Gbagbo in favour of former Prime Minister Ouattara. The ruling FPI contested the results before the [[Constitutional Council ()|Constitutional Council]], charging massive fraud in the northern departments controlled by the rebels of the New Forces. These charges were contradicted by United Nations observers (unlike African Union observers).{{Citation needed|date=February 2025}} The report of the results led to severe tension and violent incidents. The Constitutional Council, which consisted of Gbagbo supporters, declared the results of seven northern departments unlawful and that Gbagbo had won the elections with 51% of the vote – instead of Ouattara winning with 54%, as reported by the Electoral Commission. After the inauguration of Gbagbo, Ouattara—who was recognised as the winner by most countries and the United Nations—organised an alternative inauguration. These events raised fears of a resurgence of the civil war; thousands of refugees fled the country. The African Union sent [[Thabo Mbeki]], former president of , to mediate the conflict. The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution recognising Ouattara as the winner of the elections, based on the position of the [[Economic Community of West African States]], which suspended  from all its decision-making bodies while the African Union also suspended the country's membership.

In 2010, a colonel of  armed forces, Nguessan Yao, was arrested in New York in a year-long [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] operation charged with procuring and illegal export of weapons and munitions: 4,000 handguns, 200,000 rounds of ammunition, and 50,000 tear-gas grenades, in violation of a UN embargo. Several other  officers were released because they had diplomatic passports. His accomplice, Michael Barry Shor, an international trader, was located in Virginia.[[File:Internally Displaced Persons Duekoue 2011 Cote dIvoire.jpg|thumb|A shelter for internally displaced persons during the 2011 civil war]]
The 2010 presidential election led to the [[2010–2011 Ivorian crisis]] and the Second Ivorian Civil War. International organisations reported numerous human-rights violations by both sides. In [[Duékoué]], hundreds of people were killed. In nearby [[Bloléquin]], dozens were killed. UN and  forces took military action against Gbagbo. Gbagbo was taken into custody after a raid into his residence on 11 April 2011. The country was severely damaged by the war, and it was observed that Ouattara had inherited a formidable challenge to rebuild the economy and [[Refugees from |reunite Ivorians]]. Gbagbo was taken to the [[International Criminal Court]] in January 2016. He was declared acquitted by the court but given a conditional release in January 2019.  has been designated as a host country.

===Ouattara administration===
Ouattara has ruled the country since 2010. President Ouattara was re-elected in the [[2015 Ivorian presidential election|2015 presidential election]]. [[2020 Ivorian presidential election|In November 2020]], he won a third term in office in elections boycotted by the opposition. His opponents argued it was illegal for Ouattara to run for a third term. 's Constitutional Council formally ratified President Ouattara's re-election to a third term in November 2020.

In December 2022, 's electric production company, {{ill|Compagnie ivoirienne d'électricité|fr}} launched a commission to establish the country's first [[Boundiali Solar Power Station|solar plant]] in [[Boundiali]], with an installation of 37.5 MW, backed by a 10-MW lithium [[battery energy storage system]].

On 6 October 2023, Ouattara dissolved the government and removed Prime Minister [[Patrick Achi]] from his position.

[[File:Leptis Magna Arch of Septimus Severus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leptis Magna]]]]
The coastal plain of  was inhabited by [[Neolithic]] peoples from as early as 8000 BC. The [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] ancestors of the [[Berber people]] are assumed to have spread into the area by the [[Late Bronze Age]]. The earliest known name of such a tribe was the [[Garamantes]], based in [[Germa]]. The [[Phoenicia]]ns were the first to establish trading posts in . By the 5th century BC, the greatest of the Phoenician colonies, [[Carthage]], had extended its [[hegemony]] across much of North Africa, where a distinctive civilisation, known as [[Punic]], came into being.

In 630 BC, the [[Ancient |ancient ]] colonised the area around [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]] in Eastern  and founded the city of [[Cyrene, |Cyrene]]. Within 200 years, four more important  cities were established in the area that became known as [[Cyrenaica]]. The area was home to the renowned philosophy school of the [[Cyrenaics]]. In 525 BC the [[Persian people|Persian]] army of [[Cambyses II]] overran Cyrenaica, which for the next two centuries remained under Persian or  rule. [[Alexander the Great]] ended Persian rule in 331 BC and received tribute from Cyrenaica. Eastern  again fell under the control of the , this time as part of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]].
[[File:Roman emperor Septimius Severus, 200-11; Altes Museum, Berlin (26307681078).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Septimius Severus]], the first Roman emperor native to [[Roman Africa]], was born in Leptis Magna.]]
After the fall of [[Carthage]] the Romans did not immediately occupy [[Tripolitania]] (the region around Tripoli), but left it instead under control of the kings of [[Numidia]], until the coastal cities asked and obtained its protection. [[Ptolemy Apion]], the last  ruler, bequeathed Cyrenaica to Rome, which formally annexed the region in 74 BC and joined it to Crete as [[Creta et Cyrenaica|a Roman province]]. As part of the [[Africa Nova]] province, Tripolitania was prosperous, and reached a golden age in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, when the city of [[Leptis Magna]], home to the [[Severan dynasty]], was at its height.

On the eastern side, Cyrenaica's first Christian communities were established by the time of the Emperor [[Claudius]]. It was heavily devastated during the [[Kitos War]] and almost depopulated of  and Jews alike. Although repopulated by [[Trajan]] with military colonies, from then started its decline.  was early to convert to [[Nicene Christianity]] and was the home of [[Pope Victor I]]; however,  was also home to many non-Nicene varieties of early Christianity, such as [[Arianism]] and [[Donatism]].

[[File:Awjila (Libia) - The Mosque of Atiq.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Atiq Mosque, Awjila|Atiq Mosque]] in [[Awjila]] is the oldest mosque in the [[Sahara]].]]
Under the command of [[Amr ibn al-As]], the [[Rashidun army]] conquered [[Cyrenaica]]. In 647 an army led by [[Abdullah ibn Saad]] took Tripoli from the Byzantines definitively. The [[Fezzan]] was conquered by [[Uqba ibn Nafi]] in 663. The Berber tribes of the hinterland accepted Islam, however they resisted Arab political rule. For the next several decades,  was under the purview of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Caliph of Damascus]] until the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] overthrew the Umayyads in 750, and  came under the rule of Baghdad. When Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] appointed [[Ibrahim I ibn al-Aghlab|Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab]] as his governor of [[Ifriqiya]] in 800,  enjoyed considerable local autonomy under the [[Aghlabid]] dynasty. By the 10th century, the Shiite [[Fatimids]] controlled Western , and ruled the entire region in 972 and appointed [[Bologhine ibn Ziri]] as governor.

Ibn Ziri's Berber [[Zirid dynasty]] ultimately broke away from the Shiite Fatimids, and recognised the Sunni Abbasids of Baghdad as rightful Caliphs. In retaliation, the Fatimids brought about the migration of thousands from mainly two Arab Qaisi tribes, the [[Banu Sulaym]] and [[Banu Hilal]] to [[North Africa]]. This act drastically altered the fabric of the  countryside, and cemented the cultural and linguistic Arabisation of the region.

Zirid rule in Tripolitania was short-lived though, and already in 1001 the Berbers of the [[Banu Khazrun]] broke away. Tripolitania remained under their control until 1146, when the region was overtaken by the [[Normans of Sicily]]. For the next 50 years, Tripolitania was the scene of numerous battles among [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]], the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] rulers and insurgents of the [[Banu Ghaniya]]. Later, a general of the Almohads, Muhammad ibn Abu Hafs, ruled  from 1207 to 1221 before the later establishment of the  [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsid Kingdom]] independent from the Almohads. In the 14th century, the [[Banu Thabit]] dynasty ruled Tripolitania before reverting to direct Hafsid control. By the 16th century, the Hafsids became increasingly caught up in the power struggle between  and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

After Abbasid control was weakened, Cyrenaica was under -based states such as the [[Tulunids]], [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshidids]], Ayyubids, and [[Mamluk Sultanate|Mamluks]] before Ottoman conquest in 1517. [[Fezzan]] acquired independence under Awlad Muhammad dynasty after [[Kanem–Bornu Empire|Kanem]] rule. Ottomans finally conquered Fezzan between 1556 and 1577.

After a successful invasion of Tripoli by [[Habsburg ]] in 1510, and its handover to the [[Knights Hospitaller]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] admiral [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] took control of  in 1551. His successor [[Turgut Reis]] was named the [[Bey]] of Tripoli and later [[Pasha of Tripoli]] in 1556. By 1565, administrative authority as regent in Tripoli was vested in a ''[[pasha]]'' appointed directly by the ''[[sultan]]'' in [[Constantinople]]/[[Istanbul]]. In the 1580s, the rulers of [[Fezzan]] gave their allegiance to the sultan, and although Ottoman authority was absent in [[Cyrenaica]], a ''bey'' was stationed in Benghazi late in the next century to act as agent of the government in Tripoli. European [[Barbary slave trade|slaves]] and large numbers of enslaved Blacks transported from  were also a feature of everyday life in Tripoli. In 1551, [[Turgut Reis]] enslaved almost the entire population of the  island of [[Gozo]], some 5,000 people, sending them to .

In time, real power came to rest with the pasha's corps of [[janissaries]]. In 1611 the ''[[dey]]s'' staged a coup against the pasha, and Dey Sulayman Safar was appointed as head of government. For the next hundred years, a series of ''deys'' effectively ruled Tripolitania. The two most important Deys were [[Mehmed Saqizli]] (r. 1631–49) and [[Osman Saqizli]] (r. 1649–72), both also Pasha, who ruled effectively the region. The latter conquered also Cyrenaica.

Lacking direction from the Ottoman government, Tripoli lapsed into a period of military anarchy during which coup followed coup and few deys survived in office more than a year. One such coup was led by  officer [[Ahmed Karamanli]]. The [[Karamanli dynasty|Karamanlis]] ruled from 1711 until 1835 mainly in Tripolitania, and had influence in Cyrenaica and Fezzan as well by the mid-18th century. Ahmed's successors proved to be less capable than himself, however, the region's delicate balance of power allowed the Karamanli. The [[1793–95 Tripolitanian civil war]] occurred in those years. In 1793,  officer [[Trabluslu Ali Pasha|Ali Pasha]] deposed Hamet Karamanli and briefly restored Tripolitania to Ottoman rule. Hamet's brother [[Yusuf Karamanli|Yusuf]] (r. 1795–1832) re-established Tripolitania's independence. In 1816, Yusuf ordered the [[Al-Jawazi massacre|massacre of the al-Jawazi tribe]].

In the early 19th century war broke out between the  and Tripolitania, and a series of battles ensued in what came to be known as the [[First Barbary War]] and the [[Second Barbary War]]. By 1819, the various treaties of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] had forced the Barbary states to give up piracy almost entirely, and Tripolitania's economy began to crumble. As Yusuf weakened, factions sprung up around his three sons. Civil war soon resulted.

Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]] sent in troops ostensibly to restore order, marking the end of both the Karamanli dynasty and an independent Tripolitania. Order was not recovered easily, and the revolt of the  under Abd-El-Gelil and Gûma ben Khalifa lasted until the death of the latter in 1858. The second period of direct Ottoman rule saw administrative changes, and greater order in the governance of the three provinces of . Ottoman rule finally reasserted to Fezzan between 1850 and 1875 for earning income from Saharan commerce.

[[File:Omar Mukhtar 13.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|[[Omar Mukhtar]] was a prominent leader of  resistance in Cyrenaica against  colonisation.]]
After the [[Italo- War]] (1911–1912),  simultaneously turned the three regions into colonies. From 1912 to 1927, the territory of  was known as [[ | North Africa]]. From 1927 to 1934, the territory was split into two colonies, [[ Cyrenaica]] and [[ Tripolitania]], run by  governors. Some 150,000  settled in , constituting roughly 20% of the total population.

[[Omar Mukhtar]] rose to prominence as a [[ resistance movement|resistance leader]] against  colonisation and became a national hero despite his capture and execution on 16 September 1931. His face is currently printed on the  ten dinar note in memory and recognition of his patriotism. Another prominent resistance leader, Idris al-Mahdi as-Senussi (later [[Idris of |King Idris I]]), Emir of Cyrenaica, continued to lead the  resistance until the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]].

The so-called "[[pacification of ]]" by the  resulted in mass deaths of the indigenous people in Cyrenaica, killing approximately one quarter of Cyrenaica's population of 225,000. [[Ilan Pappé]] estimates that between 1928 and 1932 the  military "killed half the Bedouin population (directly or through disease and starvation in [[ concentration camps in ]])."

In 1934,  combined [[Cyrenaica]], [[Tripolitania]] and [[Fezzan]] and adopted the name "" (used by the [[Ancient |Ancient ]] for all of [[North Africa]] except [[]]) for the unified colony, with [[Tripoli, |Tripoli]] as its [[Capital city|capital]]. The  emphasised infrastructure improvements and public works. In particular, they greatly expanded  railway and road networks from 1934 to 1940, building hundreds of kilometres of new roads and railways and encouraging the establishment of new industries and dozens of new agricultural villages.

In June 1940, [[Military history of  during World War II| entered World War II]].  became the setting for the hard-fought [[North African Campaign]] that ultimately ended in defeat for  and its [[Afrika Korps| ally]] in 1943. From 1943 to 1951,  was under [[Allied occupation of |Allied occupation]]. The  military [[ Military Administration ()|administered]] the two former   provinces of Tripolitana and Cyrenaïca, while the  [[ Fezzan|administered]] the province of Fezzan. In 1944, Idris returned from exile in [[Cairo]] but declined to resume permanent residence in Cyrenaica until the removal of some aspects of foreign control in 1947. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Peace with , 1947|1947 peace treaty]] with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]],  relinquished all claims to .

=== Independent Kingdom (1951–1969) ===
{{Main|Kingdom of |}}
[[File:IdrisI3.jpg|thumb|[[King Idris]] of |223x223px]]
A national assembly crafted a constitution that established a [[monarchy]] and extended an offer for the throne to [[Idris of |Sayyid Idris]], the [[Emir of Cyrenaica]]. Sayyid Idris held the esteemed position as the leader of the influential [[Senusiyya|Senussi religious brotherhood]], which was founded by his grandfather in the preceding century as a response to Western influence in the [[Arab world]]. This devout Islamic movement garnered significant support from the [[Bedouin|desert Bedouin]] and became a major political force in . During the declining years of the [[Ottoman Empire]], it effectively governed the  interior.
Born in an oasis in [[Cyrenaica]] in 1890, Sayyid Idris assumed leadership of the Senussi at a young age. He spent a considerable period of exile in [[]] under  rule and returned to  after the [[Axis powers]] were ousted in 1943. On 24 December 1951, as King Idris I, he addressed the nation via radio from [[Benghazi]]. On 21 November 1949, the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] passed a resolution stating that  should become independent before 1 January 1952. Idris represented  in the subsequent UN negotiations. By 24 December 1951,  declared its independence as the [[Kingdom of | of ]], a constitutional and hereditary [[monarchy]] under King [[Idris I of |Idris]].

However, the new kingdom faced challenging prospects. It lacked significant industry and agricultural resources. The kingdom's primary exports consisted of hides, wool, horses, and ostrich feathers. Despite having one of the lowest income per capita figures globally, it also suffered from one of the highest illiteracy rates. King Idris I, already in his sixties, had no direct heir to succeed him. His cousin, whom he had married in 1932, reportedly experienced numerous miscarriages, and their son, born in 1953, tragically died shortly after birth. Crown Prince Rida, Idris's brother, was the designated heir, but the royal family was riddled with incessant disputes. King Idris's devout Muslim piety, which solidified his support among the [[Bedouin|Bedouin population]], clashed with the modernising and urban intellectual currents in . To address the rivalry between [[Cyrenaica]] and [[Tripolitania]], [[Benghazi]] and [[Tripoli, |Tripoli]] alternated as the capital every two years.

The swift emergence of a large number of bureaucrats resulted in a costly royal government. The discovery of significant [[oil reserves]] in 1959 and the subsequent income from [[petroleum]] sales enabled one of the world's poorest nations to establish an extremely wealthy state. Although oil drastically improved the  government's finances, popular resentment began to build over the increased concentration of the nation's wealth in the hands of King Idris and the national elite. This discontent continued to mount with the rise of [[Nasserism]] and [[Arab nationalism]] throughout [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], that inspire many anti-royal coups across the [[Arab world]].

=== Republic of  under Gaddafi (1969–2011) ===
{{Main|History of  under Muammar Gaddafi}}
On 1 September 1969, a group of rebel military officers led by [[Muammar Gaddafi]] launched a [[1969  coup d'état|coup d'état against King Idris]], which became known as the Al Fateh Revolution. Gaddafi was referred to as the "[[Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution|Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution]]" in government statements and the official  press. He began dominating history and politics of  for the next four decades. Moving to reduce  influence, in October 1970 all -owned assets were expropriated and the 12,000-strong [[ settlers in | community]] was [[1970 expulsion of  from |expelled]] from  alongside the smaller community of [[History of the Jews in |  Jews]]. The day became a [[Public holiday|national holiday]] known as "[[Day of Revenge]]"; it was later renamed the "Day of Friendship" because of an improvement in [[– relations]].
[[File:Gaddafi 1972.jpg|left|thumb|246x246px|[[Muammar Gaddafi]], leader of  ({{reign|1969|2011}})]]
's increase in prosperity was accompanied by increased internal political repression, and political dissent was made illegal under Law 75 of 1973. Widespread surveillance of the population was carried out through Gaddafi's Revolutionary Committees. Gaddafi also wanted to ease the strict social restrictions imposed on women by the previous regime, establishing the [[Revolutionary Women's Formation]] to encourage reform. In 1970, a law was introduced affirming equality of the sexes and wage parity. In 1971, Gaddafi sponsored the creation of a  General Women's Federation. In 1972, a law was passed criminalising the marriage of girls under the age of sixteen and making the woman's consent a necessary prerequisite for a marriage.

On 25 October 1975, a coup attempt was launched by a group of 20 military officers, mostly from the city of [[Misrata]]. This resulted in the arrest and executions of the coup plotters. In March 1977,  officially became the "Socialist People's  Arab Jamahiriya". Gaddafi officially passed power to the [[General People's Committee]]s and henceforth claimed to be no more than a symbolic figurehead. The new ''jamahiriya'' (Arab for "republic") governance structure he established was officially referred to as "[[direct democracy]]". Gaddafi, in his vision of democratic government and [[political philosophy]], published ''[[The Green Book (Gaddafi)|The Green Book]]'' in 1975. His short book inscribed a representative mix of utopian socialism and Arab nationalism with a streak of [[Bedouin]] supremacy.[[File:F-4J of VF-74 with  MiG-23 over Gulf of Sidra 1981.jpg|thumb|F-4J of VF-74 with  MiG-23 over Gulf of Sidra in 1981]]In February 1977,  started delivering military supplies to [[Goukouni Oueddei]] and the [[People's Armed Forces]] in .

Hundreds of  lost their lives in the country's support for [[Idi Amin]]'s [[]] in [[– War|its war against ]]. Gaddafi financed various other groups from anti-nuclear movements to [[|]] trade unions.

 adopted its plain green national flag on 19 November 1977. The country had the only plain-coloured flag in the world until 2011, when  adopted [[Flag of |its current flag]].{{citation needed|date=April 2023}} From 1977 onward, per capita income in the country rose to more than US$11,000, the fifth-highest in Africa, while the [[Human Development Index]] became the highest in Africa and greater than that of [[]]. This was achieved without borrowing any foreign loans, keeping  [[List of sovereign states by public debt|debt-free]]. The [[Great Manmade River]] was also built to allow free access to fresh water across large parts of the country. In addition, financial support was provided for university scholarships and employment programs. Much of 's income from oil, which soared in the 1970s, was spent on arms purchases and on sponsoring dozens of paramilitaries and terrorist groups around the world.

[[1986  bombing of |An  airstrike]] led by then U.S. president [[Ronald Reagan]] intended to kill Gaddafi failed in 1986.  was finally put under sanctions by the [[United Nations]] after [[Lockerbie bombing|the bombing]] of a commercial flight at [[Lockerbie]] in 1988 killed 270 people. In the 1990s, the government's rule was threatened by militant Islamism and an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Gaddafi. The government responded with repressive measures. Riots and Islamic activisim were crushed by [[Revolutionary Guard Corps]]. Nevertheless, [[Cyrenaica]] between 1995 and 1998 was politically unstable, due to the tribal allegiances of the local troops. In 2003, Gaddafi announced that all of his regime's [[ and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] were disassembled, and that  was transitioning toward [[nuclear power]].

The first civil war came during the [[Arab Spring]] movements which overturned the rulers of [[]] and [[]].  first experienced protests against Gaddafi's regime on 15 February 2011, with a full-scale revolt beginning on [[Revolution Day|17 February]]. 's authoritarian regime led by Muammar Gaddafi put up much more of a resistance compared to the regimes in  and . While overthrowing the regimes in  and  was a relatively quick process, Gaddafi's campaign posed significant stalls on the uprising in . The first announcement of a competing political authority appeared online and declared the [[Interim Transitional National Council]] as an alternative government. One of Gaddafi's senior advisors responded by posting a tweet, wherein he resigned, defected, and advised Gaddafi to flee. By 20 February, the unrest had spread to [[Tripoli, |Tripoli]]. On 27 February 2011, the [[National Transitional Council]] was established to administer the areas of  under rebel control. On 10 March 2011, the [[]] and many other nations recognised the council headed by [[Mahmoud Jibril]] as acting prime minister and as the legitimate representative of the  people and withdrawing the recognition of Gaddafi's regime.
[[File:Green square protests in Tripoli, .jpg|thumb|A protest against the anti-Gaddafi supporters in Tripoli]]
Pro-Gaddafi forces were able to respond militarily to rebel pushes in [[Tripolitania|Western ]] and launched a counterattack along the coast toward Benghazi, the ''de facto'' centre of the uprising. The town of [[Zawiya, |Zawiya]], {{convert|48|km}} from Tripoli, was bombarded by [[ Air Force (1951–2011)|air force planes]] and army tanks and seized by [[Armed Forces of the  Arab Jamahiriya|Jamahiriya troops]], "exercising a level of brutality not yet seen in the conflict." Organizations of the United Nations, including [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] and the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], condemned the crackdown as violating international law, with the latter body expelling  outright in an unprecedented action. On 17 March 2011, the UN Security Council passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973|Resolution 1973]], with a 10–0 vote and five abstentions including [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]] and [[]]. The resolution sanctioned the establishment of a [[no-fly zone]] and the use of "all means necessary" to protect civilians within . On 19 March, the first act of [[NATO]] allies to secure the no-fly zone began by destroying  air defences when  military jets entered  airspace on a [[reconnaissance]] mission heralding attacks on enemy targets.

In the weeks that followed, U.S.  forces were in the forefront of NATO operations against . More than 8,000 US personnel in warships and aircraft were deployed in the area. At least 3,000 targets were struck in 14,202 strike sorties, 716 of them in Tripoli and 492 in [[Brega]]. The U.S. air offensive included flights of [[Northrop B-2 Spirit|B-2 stealth bombers]], each bomber armed with sixteen 2000-pound bombs, flying out of and returning to their base in [[Missouri]]. The support provided by the NATO air forces contributed to the ultimate success of the revolution. By 22 August 2011, [[National Liberation Army ()|rebel fighters]] had entered Tripoli and occupied [[Martyrs' Square, Tripoli|Green Square]], which they renamed Martyrs' Square in honour of those killed since 17 February 2011. On 20 October 2011, the last heavy fighting of the uprising came to an end in the city of [[Sirte]]. The [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|Battle of Sirte]] was both the last decisive battle and the last one in general of the [[First  Civil War]] where Gaddafi was captured and killed by NATO-backed forces on 20 October 2011. Sirte was the last Gaddafi loyalist stronghold and his place of birth. The defeat of [[loyalist]] forces was celebrated on 23 October 2011, three days after the fall of Sirte. At least 30,000  died in the civil war. In addition, the [[National Transitional Council]] estimated 50,000 wounded.

Following the defeat of loyalist forces,  was torn among numerous rival, armed militias affiliated with distinct regions, cities and tribes, while the central government had been weak and unable to effectively exert its authority over the country. Competing militias pitted themselves against each other in a political struggle between [[Islamism|Islamist]] politicians and their opponents. On 7 July 2012,  held their first parliamentary elections since the end of the former regime. On 8 August, the [[National Transitional Council]] officially handed power over to the wholly elected [[General National Congress]], which was then tasked with the formation of an interim government and the drafting of a new [[ interim Constitutional Declaration| Constitution]] to be approved in a general [[Next  referendum|referendum]]. On 25 August 2012, in what Reuters reported as "the most blatant sectarian attack" since the end of the civil war, unnamed organised assailants bulldozed a [[Sufism|Sufi]] mosque with graves in the centre of the  capital [[Tripoli, |Tripoli]]. It was the second such razing of a Sufi site in two days. Numerous acts of vandalism and destruction of heritage were carried out by suspected Islamist militias, including the removal of the Nude Gazelle Statue and the destruction and desecration of [[World War II]]-era  grave sites near [[Benghazi]]. Many other cases of heritage vandalism were reported to be carried out by Islamist-related radical militias and mobs that either destroyed, robbed, or looted a number of historic sites.

On 11 September 2012, Islamist militants mounted an [[2012 Benghazi attack|attack on the  diplomatic compound in Benghazi]], killing the U.S. ambassador to , [[J. Christopher Stevens]], and three others. The incident generated outrage in the [[]] and . On 7 October 2012, 's Prime Minister-elect [[Mustafa A. G. Abushagur|Mustafa A.G. Abushagur]] was ousted after failing a second time to win parliamentary approval for a new cabinet. On 14 October 2012, the General National Congress elected former GNC member and human rights lawyer [[Ali Zeidan]] as prime minister-designate. Zeidan was sworn in after his cabinet was approved by the GNC. On 11 March 2014, after having been ousted by the GNC for his inability to halt a rogue oil shipment, Prime Minister Zeidan stepped down, and was replaced by Prime Minister [[Abdullah al-Thani]].

The [[Second  Civil War|Second Civil War]] began in May 2014 following fighting between rival parliaments with tribal militias and [[jihad]]ist groups soon taking advantage of the power vacuum. Most notably, radical Islamist fighters seized [[Derna, |Derna]] in 2014 and [[Sirte]] in 2015 in the name of the [[Islamic State]]. In February 2015, neighbouring [[]] [[February 2015  airstrikes in |launched airstrikes]] against IS in support of the Tobruk government. In June 2014, [[2014  parliamentary election|elections were held]] to the [[House of Representatives ()|House of Representatives]], a new legislative body intended to take over from the [[General National Congress]]. The elections were marred by violence and low turnout, with voting stations closed in some areas. Secularists and liberals did well in the elections, to the consternation of Islamist lawmakers in the GNC, who reconvened and declared a continuing mandate for the GNC, refusing to recognise the new House of Representatives. Armed supporters of the General National Congress occupied Tripoli, forcing the newly elected parliament to flee to [[Tobruk]].
[[File: General Khalifa Haftar in 2023.jpg|thumb|[[Khalifa Haftar]], the head of the [[ National Army]], one of the main factions in the [[ civil war (2014–2020)|2014 civil war]]]]
In January 2015, meetings were held with the aim to find a peaceful agreement between the rival parties in . The so-called Geneva-Ghadames talks were supposed to bring the GNC and the Tobruk government together at one table to find a solution of the internal conflict. However, the GNC actually never participated, a sign that internal division not only affected the "Tobruk Camp", but also the "Tripoli Camp". Meanwhile, terrorism within  steadily increased, also affecting neighbouring countries. The [[Bardo National Museum attack|terrorist attack against the Bardo Museum]] in [[]] on 18 March 2015 was reportedly carried out by two -trained militants. During 2015 an extended series of diplomatic meetings and peace negotiations were supported by the United Nations, as conducted by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG),  diplomat [[Bernardino León]]. UN support for the SRSG-led process of dialogue carried on in addition to the usual work of the United Nations Support Mission in  (UNSMIL). In July 2015 SRSG Leon reported to the UN Security Council on the progress of the negotiations, which at that point had just achieved a political agreement on 11 July setting out "a comprehensive framework... includ[ing] guiding principles... institutions and decision-making mechanisms to guide the transition until the adoption of a permanent constitution."
Talks, negotiations and dialogue continued on during mid-2015 at various international locations, culminating at Skhirat in  in early September.

Also in 2015, as part of the ongoing support from the international community, the UN Human Rights Council requested a report about the  situation and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, [[Zeid bin Ra'ad|Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein]], established an investigative body (OIOL) to report on human rights and rebuilding the  justice system. Chaos-ridden  emerged as a major transit point for [[2015 European migrant crisis|people trying to reach Europe]]. Between 2013 and 2018, nearly 700,000 migrants reached  by boat, many of them from . In May 2018 's rival leaders agreed to hold parliamentary and presidential elections following a meeting in [[Paris]]. In April 2019, [[Khalifa Haftar]] launched [[Western  campaign|Operation Flood of Dignity]], in an offensive by the [[ National Army]] aimed to seize Western territories from the [[Government of National Accord]] (GNA). In June 2019, forces allied to 's UN-recognised Government of National Accord successfully captured [[Gharyan]], a strategic town where military commander Khalifa Haftar and his fighters were based. According to a spokesman for GNA forces, Mustafa al-Mejii, dozens of LNA fighters under Haftar were killed, while at least 18 were taken prisoner.

In March 2020, Prime Minister of the GNA [[Fayez al-Sarraj|Fayez Al-Sarraj]] commenced Operation Peace Storm. The government initiated the bid in response to the state of assaults carried by [[Field Marshal]] [[Khalifa Haftar|Haftar]]'s [[ National Army|LNA]]. "We are a legitimate, civilian government that respects its obligations to the international community, but is committed primarily to its people and has an obligation to protect its citizens," Sarraj said in line with his decision. On 28 August 2020, the ''[[BBC]] Africa Eye'' and ''BBC Arabic Documentaries'' revealed that a drone operated by the [[]] (UAE) killed 26 young cadets at a military academy in Tripoli, on 4 January. Most of the cadets were teenagers and none of them were armed. The -made drone [[CAIG Wing Loong II|Wing Loong II]] fired Blue Arrow 7 missile, which was operated from UAE-run Al-Khadim  air base. In February, these drones stationed in  were moved to an air base near [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] in the western  desert. ''[[The Guardian]]'' probed and discovered the blatant violation of [[United Nations|UN]] arms embargo by the UAE and [[]] on 7 October 2020. As per the reporting, both the nations sent large-scale military cargo planes to  in support of their respective parties. On 23 October 2020, [[ peace process|a permanent ceasefire]] was signed to end the war.

In December 2021, the [[2022  presidential election|country's first presidential election]] was scheduled, but was delayed to June 2022 and later postponed further.

[[Fathi Bashagha]] was appointed prime minister by the parliament in February 2022 to lead a transitional administration, but standing prime minister [[Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh]] refused to hand over power as of April 2022. In protest against the Dbeibah government, tribal leaders from the desert town of [[Ubari]] shut down the [[El Sharara oil field]], 's largest oil field, on 18 April 2022. The shut down threatened to cause oil shortages domestically in , and preclude the state-run National Oil Corp. from exploiting the high oil prices on the international market resulting from the [[ invasion of ]]. On 2 July, the [[House of Representatives ()|House of Representatives]] was burned down by protesters.

On 10 September 2023, catastrophic floods due to [[Derna dam collapses|dam failure]]s generated by [[Storm Daniel]] devastated the port city of [[Derna, |Derna]], killing more than 5,900 and possibly as many as 24,000. The floods were the worst natural disaster in 's modern history.

With its long sea border between eastern and western civilizations,  has long existed at a crossroads of cultures with a strategic location in terms of trade on the west of the Arabian Peninsula. Large settlements for their era existed in the mountains of northern  as early as 5000 BC. The [[Sabaeans|Sabaean Kingdom]] existed in [[ (region)|]] from {{Circa|1000 BCE}} to {{Circa|275 CE}}. {{Sfn|Arbach|Rossi|2022|pp=40–41}} Its inhabitants were the Sabaeans,{{Efn|{{langx|xsa|{{script|Sarb|𐩪𐩨𐩱}}|{{sc|s¹bʾ}}}}; {{langx|ar|ٱلسَّبَئِيُّوْن|as-Sabaʾiyyūn}}; {{langx|he|סְבָאִים|Səḇāʾīm}}}} The four major kingdoms or tribal confederations in [[South Arabia]] were Saba, [[Hadhramaut]], [[Qataban]], and [[Minaeans|Ma'in]].

''[[Sabaeans|Sabaʾ]]'' ({{langx|ar|سَـبَـأ}}) is thought to be biblical Sheba and was the most prominent federation. The Sabaean rulers adopted the title [[Mukarrib]] generally thought to mean ''unifier'', or a ''priest-king'', or the head of the confederation of South Arabian kingdoms, the "king of the kings". The role of the Mukarrib was to bring the various tribes under the kingdom and preside over them all. The Sabaeans built the [[Marib Dam|Great Dam of Marib]] around 940 BC. The dam was built to withstand the seasonal flash floods surging down the valley.

By the third century BC, Qataban, Hadhramaut, and Ma'in became independent from Saba and established themselves in the  arena. Minaean rule stretched as far as [[Dedanites|Dedan]], with their capital at [[Baraqish]]. The Sabaeans regained their control over Ma'in after the collapse of Qataban in 50 BC. By the time of the Roman expedition to Arabia Felix in 25 BC, the Sabaeans were once again the dominating power in Southern Arabia. [[Aelius Gallus]] was ordered to lead a military campaign to establish Roman dominance over the Sabaeans.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had a vague and contradictory geographical knowledge about Arabia Felix. A Roman army of 10,000 men was defeated before reaching [[Marib]]. [[Strabo]]'s close relationship with Aelius Gallus led him to attempt to justify his friend's defeat in his writings. It took the Romans six months to reach Marib and 60 days to return to [[]]. The Romans blamed their [[Nabataeans|Nabataean]] guide and executed him for treachery. No direct mention in Sabaean inscriptions of the Roman expedition has yet been found.

After the Roman expedition (perhaps earlier) the country fell into chaos, and two clans, namely [[Banu Hamdan|Hamdan]] and [[Himyar]], claimed kingship, assuming the title King of Sheba and [[Himyar|Dhu Raydan]]. Dhu Raydan, ''i.e.'', Himyarites, allied themselves with [[Aksum]] in  against the Sabaeans. The chief of [[Bakil]] and king of Saba and Dhu Raydan, [[Ilasaros|El Sharih Yahdhib]], launched successful campaigns against the Himyarites and Habashat, ''i.e.'', [[Aksum]]. El Sharih took pride in his campaigns and added the title Yahdhib to his name, which means "suppressor"; he used to kill his enemies by cutting them to pieces. Sana'a came into prominence during his reign, as he built the [[Ghumdan Palace]] as his place of residence.

The Himyarites annexed Sana'a from Hamdan around 100 AD. [[Hashid|Hashdi]] tribesmen rebelled against them and regained Sana'a around 180. [[Shammar Yahri'sh]] had conquered Hadhramaut, [[Najran]], and [[Tihamah]] by 275, thus unifying  and consolidating Himyarite rule. The Himyarites rejected [[polytheism]] and adhered to a consensual form of [[monotheism]] called [[Rahmanism]].

[[File: Museum  04.jpg|thumb|Bronze hand with an inscribed prayer in [[Himyaritic]] to god [[Ta'lab]]]]
In 354, Roman Emperor [[Constantius II]] sent an embassy headed by [[Theophilos the ]] to convert the Himyarites to Christianity. According to [[Philostorgius]], the mission was resisted by local Jews. Several inscriptions have been found in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Sabaean language|Sabaean]] praising the ruling house in Jewish terms for "...helping and empowering the People of ."

According to Islamic traditions, King [[Tub'a Abu Kariba As'ad|As'ad the Perfect]] mounted a military expedition to support the Jews of [[Yathrib]]. Abu Kariba As'ad, as known from the inscriptions, led a military campaign to central Arabia or [[Najd]] to support the vassal [[Kingdom of Kinda]] against the [[Lakhmids]]. However, no direct reference to Judaism or Yathrib was discovered from his lengthy reign. Abu Kariba died in 445, having reigned for almost 50 years. By 515, Himyar became increasingly divided along religious lines and a bitter conflict between different factions paved the way for an [[Aksum]]ite intervention. The last Himyarite king Ma'adikarib Ya'fur was supported by Aksum against his Jewish rivals. Ma'adikarib was Christian and launched a campaign against the Lakhmids in southern [[]], with the support of other Arab allies of [[Byzantium]]. The Lakhmids were a bulwark of [[Persia]], which was intolerant to a proselytizing religion like Christianity.

After the death of Ma'adikarib Ya'fur around 521, a Himyarite Jewish warlord called [[Dhu Nuwas]] rose to power. Emperor [[Justinian I]] sent an embassy to . He wanted the officially Christian Himyarites to use their influence on the tribes in inner Arabia to launch military operations against Persia. Justinian I bestowed the "dignity of king" upon the Arab [[sheikh]]s of Kindah and [[Ghassanids|Ghassan]] in central and northern Arabia. From early on, Roman and Byzantine policy was to develop close links with the powers of the coast of the [[Red Sea]]. They were successful in converting{{clarify|date=August 2015|reason=https://www.britannica.com/place/Byzantine-Empire}} Aksum and influencing their culture. The results concerning to  were rather disappointing.

A Kendite prince called Yazid bin Kabshat rebelled against Abraha and his Arab Christian allies. A truce was reached once the Great Dam of Marib had suffered a breach. Abraha died around 570. The [[Sasanid Empire]] annexed Aden around 570. Under their rule, most of  enjoyed great autonomy except for Aden and Sana'a. This era marked the collapse of ancient South Arabian civilization, since the greater part of the country was under several independent clans until the arrival of Islam in 630.

[[Muhammad]] sent his cousin [[Ali]] to Sana'a and its surroundings around 630. At the time,  was the most advanced region in Arabia. The [[Banu Hamdan]] confederation was among the first to accept Islam. Muhammad sent [[Muadh ibn Jabal]], as well to Al-Janad, in present-day [[Taiz]], and dispatched letters to various tribal leaders. Major tribes, including Himyar, sent delegations to [[Medina]] during the "year of delegations" around 630–631. Several  accepted Islam before 630, such as [[Ammar ibn Yasir]], [[Al-Ala'a Al-Hadrami]], [[Miqdad ibn Aswad]], [[Abu Musa Ashaari]], and [[Sharhabeel ibn Hasana]]. A man named [[Aswad Ansi|'Abhala ibn Ka'ab Al-Ansi]] expelled the remaining Persians and claimed he was a prophet of [[Rahman (Islamic term)|Rahman]]. He was assassinated by a  of Persian origin called [[Fayruz al-Daylami]]. Christians, who were mainly staying in [[Najran]] along with Jews, agreed to pay ''[[jizya]]h'' ({{langx|ar|جِـزْيَـة}}), although some Jews converted to Islam, such as [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]] and [[Ka'ab al-Ahbar]].

Powerful Yemenite tribes such as Kinda were on his side during the [[Battle of Marj Rahit (684)|Battle of Marj Rahit]].

Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Ziyad founded the Ziyadid dynasty in [[Tihamah]] around 818. The state stretched from [[Al Qunfudhah|Haly]] (in present-day ) to Aden. They nominally recognized the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] but ruled independently from [[Zabid]]. By virtue of its location, they developed a special relationship with [[|Abyssinia]]. The chief of the [[Dahlak Archipelago|Dahlak islands]] exported slaves, as well as amber and leopard hides, to the ruler of . They controlled only a small portion of the coastal strip in Tihamah along the Red Sea, and never exercised control over the highlands and Hadhramaut. A Himyarite clan called the [[Yufirids]] established their rule over the highlands from [[Saada]] to [[Taiz]], while Hadhramaut was an Ibadi stronghold and rejected all allegiance to the Abbasids in [[Baghdad]].

The first [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] imam, [[Al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya|Yahya ibn al-Husayn]], arrived in  in 893. He was a religious cleric and judge who was invited to come to Saada from Medina to arbitrate tribal disputes. Yahya persuaded local tribesmen to follow his teachings. The sect slowly spread across the highlands, as the tribes of [[Hashid]] and [[Bakil]], later known as "the twin wings of the imamate", accepted his authority. He founded the [[Rassids|Zaidi imamate]] in 897. Yahya established his influence in Saada and Najran. He also tried to capture Sana'a from the Yufirids in 901 but failed miserably.

==== Sulayhid dynasty (1047–1138) ====

}}

The [[Sulayhid dynasty]] was founded in the northern highlands around 1040; at the time,  was ruled by different local dynasties. In 1060, [[Ali al-Sulayhi|Ali ibn Muhammad Al-Sulayhi]] conquered Zabid and killed its ruler Al-Najah, founder of the Najahid dynasty. His sons were forced to flee to Dahlak. Hadhramaut fell into Sulayhid hands after their capture of Aden in 1162.

By 1063, Ali had subjugated [[Greater ]]. He then marched toward [[Hejaz]] and occupied [[Makkah]]. Ali was married to [[Asma bint Shihab]], who governed  with her husband. The [[Khutba]] during [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayers]] was proclaimed in both her husband's name and hers. No other Arab woman had this honor since the advent of Islam.

Ali al-Sulayhi was killed by Najah's sons on his way to Mecca in 1084. His son Ahmed Al-Mukarram led an army to Zabid and killed 8,000 of its inhabitants. He later installed the Zurayids to govern Aden. al-Mukarram, who had been afflicted with facial paralysis resulting from war injuries, retired in 1087 and handed over power to his wife [[Arwa al-Sulayhi]]. Queen Arwa moved the seat of the Sulayhid dynasty from Sana'a to [[Jibla, |Jibla]], a small town in central  near [[Ibb]]. She sent Ismaili missionaries to , where a significant Ismaili community was formed that exists to this day.

Queen Arwa continued to rule securely until her death in 1138. She is still remembered as a great and much-loved sovereign, as attested in  historiography, literature, and popular lore, where she is referred to as ''Balqis al-sughra'' ("the junior queen of Sheba"). Shortly after Arwa's death, the country was split between five competing petty dynasties along religious lines. The [[Ayyubid dynasty]] overthrew the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in . A few years after their rise to power, [[Saladin]] dispatched his brother [[Turan Shah]] to conquer  in 1174.

==== Ayyubid conquest (1171–1260) ====
{{Main|Ayyubid dynasty}}
[[Turan Shah]] conquered Zabid from the [[Mahdids]] in 1174, then marched toward Aden in June and captured it from the Zurayids. The [[Hamdanid sultans]] of Sana'a resisted the Ayyubid in 1175, and the Ayyubids did not manage to secure Sana'a until 1189. The Ayyubid rule was stable in southern and central , where they succeeded in eliminating the ministates of that region, while Ismaili and Zaidi tribesmen continued to hold out in several fortresses.

The Ayyubids failed to capture the [[Zaydism|Zaydis]] stronghold in northern . In 1191, Zaydis of [[Shibam Kawkaban District|Shibam Kawkaban]] rebelled and killed 700 Ayyubid soldiers. Imam [[Al-Mansur Abdallah|Abdullah bin Hamza]] proclaimed the imamate in 1197 and fought al-Mu'izz Ismail, the Ayyubid Sultan of . Imam Abdullah was defeated at first but was able to conquer Sana'a and [[Dhamar, |Dhamar]] in 1198, and al-Mu'izz Ismail was assassinated in 1202.

[[Al-Mansur Abdallah|Abdullah bin Hamza]] carried on the struggle against the Ayyubid until his death in 1217. After his demise, the Zaidi community was split between two rival imams. The Zaydis were dispersed, and a truce was signed with the Ayyubid in 1219. The Ayyubid army was defeated in [[Dhamar, |Dhamar]] in 1226. Ayyubid Sultan Mas'ud Yusuf left for Mecca in 1228, never to return. Other sources suggest that he was forced to leave for  instead in 1223.

==== Rasulid dynasty (1229–1454) ====
[[File:Cairo Castle GardenTaiz,.jpg|thumb|[[Al-Qahira Castle]]'s Garden in Taiz, the capital of  during the [[Rasulid dynasty|Rasulid's era]]]]

The [[Rasulid dynasty]] was established in 1229 by [[Al-Mansur Umar|Umar ibn Ali]], who was appointed deputy governor by the Ayyubids in 1223. When the last Ayyubid ruler left  in 1229, Umar stayed in the country as caretaker. He subsequently declared himself an independent king by assuming the title "al-Malik Al-Mansur" (the king assisted by [[Allah]]).

Umar first established himself at Zabid, then moved into the mountainous interior, taking the important highland centre Sana'a. However, the Rasulid capitals were Zabid and Taiz. He was assassinated by his nephew in 1249. Omar's son [[Al-Muzaffar Yusuf I|Yusuf]] defeated the faction led by his father's assassins and crushed several counterattacks by the Zaydi imams who still held on in the northern highland. Mainly because of the victories he scored over his rivals, he assumed the honorific title "al-Muzaffar" (the victorious).

After the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Baghdad]] to the [[Mongols]] in 1258, al-Muzaffar Yusuf I appropriated the title of [[caliph]]. He chose the city of Taiz to become the political capital of the kingdom because of its strategic location and proximity to Aden. The Rasulid sultans built numerous [[Madrasa]]s to solidify the [[Shafi'i]] school of thought, which is still the dominant school of [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]] amongst  today. Under their rule, Taiz and Zabid became major international centres of Islamic learning. The kings were educated men in their own right, who not only had important libraries but also wrote treatises on a wide array of subjects, ranging from astrology and medicine to agriculture and genealogy.[[File:Slaves Zadib  13th century BNF Paris.jpg|thumb|A 13th-century book illustration produced in [[Baghdad]] by [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|al-Wasiti]] showing a slave-market in the town of [[Zabid]] in ]]They had a difficult relationship with the [[Mamluks of ]] because the latter considered them a vassal state. Their competition centred over the Hejaz and the right to provide ''[[kiswa]]'' of the [[Ka'aba]] in Mecca. The dynasty became increasingly threatened by disgruntled family members over the problem of succession, combined with periodic tribal revolts, as they were locked in a war of attrition with the Zaydi imams in the northern highlands. During the last 12 years of Rasulid rule, the country was torn between several contenders for the kingdom. The weakening of the Rasulid provided an opportunity for the [[Tahirids ()|Banu Taher]] clan to take over and establish themselves as the new rulers of  in 1454 AD.

==== Tahirid dynasty (1454–1517) ====
{{Main articles|Ottoman– confrontations|Ottoman– conflicts (1538–1560)}}

The [[Tahirids ()|Tahirids]] were a local clan based in [[Rada' District|Rada'a]]. They built schools, mosques, and irrigation channels, as well as water cisterns and bridges in Zabid, Aden, [[Rada'a]], and Juban. Their best-known monument is the [[Amiriya Madrasa]] in [[Rada' District]], which was built in 1504. The Tahirids were too weak either to contain the Zaydi imams or to defend themselves against foreign attacks.

Realizing how rich the Tahirid realm was, the Mamluks decided to conquer it. The Mamluk army, with the support of forces loyal to Zaydi Imam [[Al-Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din]], conquered the entire Tahirid realm but failed to capture Aden in 1517. The Mamluk victory was short-lived. The [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered , hanging the last Mamluk Sultan in [[Cairo]]. The Ottomans had not decided to conquer  until 1538. The Zaydi highland tribes emerged as national heroes by offering stiff, vigorous resistance to the  occupation. The Mamluks tried to attach  to  and the  led by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], occupied the island of [[Socotra]] and made an unsuccessful attack on Aden in 1513.

Instead of confronting them, the Mamluks, who were running out of food and water, landed on the coast of  and began harassing the villagers of Tihamah to obtain the supplies they needed.

The interest of  on the Red Sea consisted on the one hand of guaranteeing contacts with a Christian ally in  and on the other of being able to attack Mecca and the Arab territories from the rear, while still having absolute dominance over trade of spices, the main intention was to dominate the commerce of the cities on the coast of Africa and Arabia. To this end,  sought to influence and dominate by force or persuasion all the ports and kingdoms that fought among themselves.

[[File:Jemen1988-153 hg.jpg|thumb|[[al-Bakiriyya Mosque|Al Bakiriyya Ottoman Mosque]] in [[Sana'a]] was built in 1597.]]

The Ottomans had two fundamental interests to safeguard in —the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and the trade route with  for spices and textiles, both threatened, and the latter virtually eclipsed, by the arrival of the  in the  Ocean and the Red Sea in the early 16th century. [[Hadım Suleiman Pasha]], the Ottoman governor of [[Eyalet of |]], was ordered to command a fleet of 90 ships to conquer . The country was in a state of incessant anarchy and discord as Pasha described it by saying:

{{Blockquote| is a land with no lord, an empty province. It would be not only possible but easy to capture, and should it be captured, it would be master of the lands of [[ subcontinent|]] and send every year a great amount of gold and jewels to [[Constantinople]].}}

Imam [[al-Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din]] ruled over the northern highlands including Sana'a, while Aden was held by the last Tahiride Sultan 'Amir ibn Dauod. Pasha stormed Aden in 1538, killing its ruler, and extended Ottoman authority to include Zabid in 1539 and eventually Tihamah in its entirety. Zabid became the administrative headquarters of  Eyalet. The Ottoman governors did not exercise much control over the highlands. They held sway mainly in the southern coastal region, particularly around Zabid, Mocha, and Aden. Of 80,000 soldiers sent to  from  between 1539 and 1547, only 7,000 survived. The Ottoman accountant-general in  remarked:

{{Blockquote|We have seen no foundry like  for our soldiers. Each time we have sent an expeditionary force there, it has melted away like salt dissolved in water.}}

[[File:Group of men in .tif|thumb|left|Ottoman soldiers and  locals]]

The Ottomans sent yet another expeditionary force to Zabid in 1547, while Imam al-Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad-Din was ruling the highlands independently. Yahya chose his son Ali to succeed him, a decision that infuriated his other son [[al-Mutahhar]] ibn Yahya. Al-Mutahhar was lame, so he was not qualified for the imamate. He urged Oais Pasha, the Ottoman colonial governor in [[Zabid]], to attack his father. Indeed, Ottoman troops supported by tribal forces loyal to Imam al-Mutahhar stormed Taiz and marched north toward Sana'a in August 1547. The Turks officially made Imam al-Mutahhar a ''[[Sanjak-bey]]'' with authority over [['Amran]]. Imam al-Mutahhar assassinated the Ottoman colonial governor and recaptured Sana'a, but the Ottomans, led by [[Özdemir Pasha]], forced al-Mutahhar to retreat to his fortress in [[Thula]]. Özdemir Pasha effectively put  under Ottoman rule between 1552 and 1560. Özdemir died in Sana'a in 1561 and was succeeded by [[Mahmud Pasha (governor)|Mahmud Pasha]].

Mahmud Pasha was described by other Ottoman officials as a corrupt and unscrupulous governor, and he was displaced by Ridvan Pasha in 1564. By 1565,  was split into two provinces, the highlands under the command of Ridvan Pasha and Tihamah under Murad Pasha. Imam al-Mutahhar launched a propaganda campaign in which he claimed that the prophet Mohammed came to him in a dream and advised him to wage ''jihad'' against the Ottomans. Al-Mutahhar led the tribes to capture Sana'a from Ridvan Pasha in 1567. When Murad tried to relieve Sana'a, highland tribesmen ambushed his unit and slaughtered all of them. Over 80 battles were fought. The last decisive encounter took place in Dhamar around 1568, in which Murad Pasha was beheaded and his head sent to al-Mutahhar in Sana'a. By 1568, only Zabid remained under the possession of the Turks.

In 1632, Al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad sent an expeditionary force of 1,000 men to conquer Mecca. The army entered the city in triumph and killed its governor. The Ottomans sent an army from  to fight the Yemenites. Seeing that the  army was too numerous to overcome, the  army retreated to a valley outside Mecca. Ottoman troops attacked the  by hiding at the wells that supplied them with water. This plan proceeded successfully, causing the  over 200 casualties, most from thirst. The tribesmen eventually surrendered and returned to . Al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad died in 1644. He was succeeded by [[Al-Mutawakkil Isma'il]], another son of al-Mansur al-Qasim, who conquered  in its entirety.

 became the sole [[coffee bean|coffee]] producer in the world. The country established diplomatic relations with the [[Safavid dynasty]] of Persia, Ottomans of Hejaz, [[Mughal Empire]] in , and , as well. In the first half of the 18th century, the Europeans broke 's monopoly on coffee by smuggling coffee trees and cultivating them in their own colonies in the East Indies, East Africa, the West Indies, and Latin America. The imamate did not follow a cohesive mechanism for succession, and family quarrels and tribal insubordination led to the political decline of the Qasimi dynasty in the 18th century.

The  were looking for a coal depot to service their steamers en route to . It took 700 tons of coal for a round-trip from [[Suez]] to [[Bombay]]. [[East  Company]] officials decided on [[Aden]]. The [[ Empire]] tried to reach an agreement with the Zaydi imam of Sana'a, permitting them a foothold in Mocha, and when unable to secure their position, they extracted a similar agreement from the [[Sultanate of Lahej|Sultan of Lahej]], enabling them to consolidate a position in Aden. The  managed to occupy Aden and evicted the Sultan of Lahej from Aden and forced him to accept their "protection". In November 1839, 5,000 tribesmen tried to retake the town but were repulsed and 200 were killed.

With emigrants from , East Africa, and Southeast Asia, Aden grew into a world city. In 1850, only 980 Arabs were registered as original inhabitants of the city. The  presence in Aden put them at odds with the Ottomans. The Turks asserted to the  that they held sovereignty over the whole of Arabia, including  as the successor of Mohammed and the Chief of the Universal Caliphate.

==== Ottoman return ====
[[File:Mukhtar Pasha.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Grand Vizier]] and [[Wāli]] of  [[Ahmed Muhtar Pasha]]]]

The Ottomans were concerned about the  expansion from the [[ Raj|-ruled subcontinent]] to the Red Sea and Arabia. They returned to the Tihamah in 1849 after an absence of two centuries. Rivalries and disturbances continued among the Zaydi imams, between them and their deputies, with the [[ulema]], with the heads of tribes, as well as with those who belonged to other sects. Some citizens of Sana'a were desperate to return law and order to  and asked the Ottoman Pasha in Tihamah to pacify the country. The opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 strengthened the Ottoman decision to remain in . By 1873, the Ottomans succeeded in conquering the northern highlands. Sana'a became the administrative capital of [[ Vilayet]].

The Ottomans learned from their previous experience and worked on the disempowerment of local lords in the highland regions. They even attempted to secularize the  society, while [[Yemenite Jews]] came to perceive themselves in  nationalist terms. The Ottomans appeased the tribes by forgiving their rebellious chiefs and appointing them to administrative posts. They introduced a series of reforms to enhance the country's economic welfare. However, corruption was widespread in the Ottoman administration in . This was because only the worst of the officials were appointed because those who could avoid serving in  did so. The Ottomans had reasserted control over the highlands for a temporary duration. The so-called ''[[Tanzimat]]'' reforms were considered heretic by the Zaydi tribes. In 1876, the Hashid and Bakil tribes rebelled against the Ottomans; the Turks had to appease them with gifts to end the uprising.

The tribal chiefs were difficult to appease and an endless cycle of violence curbed Ottoman efforts to pacify the land. [[Ahmed Izzet Pasha]] proposed that the Ottoman army evacuate the highlands and confine itself to Tihamah, and not unnecessarily burden itself with continuing military operation against the Zaydi tribes. Imam [[Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din|Yahya Hamidaddin]] led a rebellion against the Turks in 1904; the rebels disrupted the Ottoman ability to govern. The revolts between 1904 and 1911 were especially damaging to the Ottomans, costing them as many as 10,000 soldiers and as much as 500,000 [[Pound sterling|pounds]] per year. The Ottomans signed a treaty with imam [[Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din|Yahya Hamidaddin]] in 1911. Under the treaty, Imam Yahya was recognized as an autonomous leader of the Zaydi northern highlands. The Ottomans continued to rule [[Shafi'i]] areas in the mid-south until their departure in 1918.

==== Mutawakkilite Kingdom ====
{{Main|Kingdom of }}
[[File:Dar al hajar.jpg|thumb|upright|Imam [[Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din|Yahya Hamid Ed-Din]]'s house near Sana'a]]

Imam Yahya hamid ed-Din al-Mutawakkil was ruling the northern highlands independently from 1911, from which he began a conquest of the  lands. In 1925 Yahya captured al-Hudaydah from the [[Idrisid dynasty|Idrisids]]. In 1927, Yahya's forces were about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} away from Aden, Taiz, and Ibb, and were bombed by the  for five days; the imam had to pull back. Small [[Bedouin]] forces, mainly from the [[Madh'hij]] confederation of [[Marib]], attacked [[Shabwah Governorate|Shabwah]] but were bombed by the  and had to retreat.

The [[ Empire]] was the first to recognize Yahya as the king of  in 1926. This created a great deal of anxiety for the , who interpreted it as recognition of Imam Yahya's claim to sovereignty over Greater , which included the Aden protectorate and Asir. The Idrisis turned to [[Ibn Saud]] seeking his protection from Yahya. However, in 1932, the Idrisis broke their accord with Ibn Saud and went back to Yahya seeking help against Ibn Saud, who had begun liquidating their authority and expressed his desire to annex those territories into his own  domain. Yahya demanded the return of all Idrisi dominion.

Negotiations between Yahya and Ibn Saud proved fruitless. After the 1934 - war, Ibn Saud announced a ceasefire in May 1934. Imam Yahya agreed to release  hostages and the surrender of the Idrisis to  custody. Imam Yahya ceded the three provinces of Najran, Asir, and [[Jizan Region|Jazan]] for 20 years. and signed another treaty with the  government in 1934. The imam recognized the  sovereignty over Aden protectorate for 40 years. Out of fear for [[Al Hudaydah|Hudaydah]], Yahya did submit to these demands.

==== Colonial Aden ====

Starting in 1890, hundreds of  people from Hajz, Al-Baetha, and Taiz migrated to Aden to work at ports, and as labourers. This helped the population of Aden once again become predominantly Arab after, having been declared a free zone, it had become mostly foreigners. During World War II, Aden had increasing economic growth and became the second-busiest port in the world after [[New York City]]. After the rise of labour unions, a rift was apparent between the sectors of workers and the first signs of resistance to the occupation started in 1943. [[Muhammad Ali Luqman]] founded the first Arabic club and school in Aden, and was the first to start working towards a union.

The [[Colony of Aden]] was divided into an eastern colony and a western colony. Those were further divided into 23 sultanates and emirates, and several independent tribes that had no relationships with the sultanates. The deal between the sultanates and Britain detailed protection and complete control of foreign relations by the . The Sultanate of Lahej was the only one in which the sultan was referred to as ''His Highness''. The [[Federation of South Arabia]] was created by the  to counter [[Arab nationalism]] by giving more freedom to the rulers of the nations.

The [[North  Civil War]] inspired many in the south to rise against the  rule. The [[National Liberation Front ()|National Liberation Front]] (NLF) of  was formed with the leadership of [[Qahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi|Qahtan Muhammad Al-Shaabi]]. The NLF hoped to destroy all the sultanates and eventually unite with the [[ Arab Republic]]. Most of the support for the NLF came from [[Radfan]] and Yafa, so the  launched Operation Nutcracker, which completely burned Radfan in January 1964.

==== Two states ====
{{Main| Arab Republic|South }}

Arab nationalism had an influence in some circles who opposed the lack of modernization efforts in the Mutawakkilite monarchy. This became apparent when Imam [[Ahmad bin Yahya]] died in 1962. He was succeeded by his son, but army officers attempted to seize power, sparking the [[North  Civil War]]. The Hamidaddin royalists were supported by , Britain, and  (mostly with weapons and financial aid, but also with small military forces), whilst the military rebels were backed by .  provided the rebels with weapons and financial assistance, but also sent a large military force to participate in the fighting.  covertly supplied weapons to the royalists to keep the  military busy in  and make Nasser less likely to initiate a conflict in the Sinai. After six years of civil war, the military rebels formed the [[ Arab Republic]].

The revolution in the north coincided with the [[Aden Emergency]], which hastened the end of  rule in the south. On 30 November 1967, the state of South  was formed, comprising Aden and the former Protectorate of South Arabia. This socialist state was later officially known as the [[People's Democratic Republic of ]] and a programme of nationalisation was begun.

Relations between the two  states fluctuated between peaceful and hostile. The South was supported by the Eastern bloc. The North, however, was not able to get the same connections. In 1972, the two states fought a war. The war was resolved with a ceasefire and negotiations brokered by the [[Arab League]], where it was declared that unification would eventually occur. In 1978, [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] was named as president of the  Arab Republic. After the war, the North complained about the South's help from foreign countries. This included .

In 1979, fresh fighting between the two states resumed and efforts were renewed to bring about unification. Thousands were killed in 1986 in the [[South  Civil War]]. President [[Ali Nasser Muhammad]] fled to the north and was later sentenced to death for treason. A new government formed.

==== Unification and civil war ====
{{Main| unification| Civil War (1994)}}

In 1990, the two governments reached a full agreement on the joint governing of , and the countries were merged on 22 May 1990, with Saleh as president. The president of South , [[Ali Salim al-Beidh]], became vice president. A unified [[Assembly of Representatives of |parliament]] was formed and a unity constitution was agreed upon. In the [[ parliamentary election, 1993|1993 parliamentary election]], the first held after unification, the [[General People's Congress ()|General People's Congress]] won 122 of 301 seats.{{rp|309}}

After the [[Gulf War|invasion of ]] crisis in 1990, 's president opposed military intervention from non-Arab states. As a member of the [[United Nations Security Council]] for 1990 and 1991,  abstained on a number of [[United Nations Security Council|UNSC]] resolutions concerning  and  and voted against the "...use of force resolution." The vote outraged the U.S., and  expelled 800,000  in 1990 and 1991 to punish  for its opposition to the intervention.

In the absence of strong state institutions, [[Elite theory|elite politics]] in  constituted a ''de facto'' form of [[collaborative governance]], where competing tribal, regional, religious, and political interests agreed to hold themselves in check through tacit acceptance of the balance it produced. The informal political settlement was held together by a power-sharing deal among three men: President Saleh, who controlled the state; major general [[Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar]], who controlled the largest share of the [[ Armed Forces]]; and [[Abdullah ibn Husayn al-Ahmar]], figurehead of the Islamist [[Al-Islah ()|al-Islah party]] and 's chosen broker of transnational [[clientelism|patronage payments]] to various political players, including tribal [[sheikh]]s. The  payments have been intended to facilitate the tribes' autonomy from the  government and to give the  government a mechanism with which to weigh in on 's political decision-making.

Following food riots in major towns in 1992, a new coalition government made up of the ruling parties from both the former  states was formed in 1993. However, Vice President al-Beidh withdrew to Aden in August 1993 and said he would not return to the government until his grievances were addressed. These included northern violence against his [[ Socialist Party]], as well as the economic marginalization of the south. Negotiations to end the political deadlock dragged on into 1994. The government of Prime Minister [[Haydar Abu Bakr Al-Attas]] became ineffective due to political infighting.

An accord between northern and southern leaders was signed in [[Amman]], [[]] on 20 February 1994, but this could not stop the civil war. During these tensions, both the northern and southern armies (which had never integrated) gathered on their respective frontiers.

[[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] became 's first directly elected president in [[ presidential election, 1999|the 1999 presidential election]], winning 96% of the vote.{{rp|310}} The only other candidate, [[Najeeb Qahtan Al-Sha'abi]], was the son of Qahtan Muhammad al-Sha'abi, a former president of South . Though a member of Saleh's [[General People's Congress ()|General People's Congress]] (GPC) party, Najeeb ran as an independent.

In October 2000, 17 U.S. personnel died after an al-Qaeda [[USS Cole bombing|suicide attack on the U.S. naval vessel USS ''Cole'']] in [[Aden]]. After the [[September 11 attacks]] on the , President Saleh assured U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] that  was a partner in his [[War on Terror]]. In 2001, violence surrounded [[ constitutional referendum, 2001|a referendum]], which apparently supported extending Saleh's rule and powers.

The [[Houthi insurgency in ]] began in June 2004 when dissident cleric [[Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi]], head of the Zaidi Shia sect, launched an uprising against the  government. The  government alleged that the [[Houthis]] were seeking to overthrow it and to implement ''Shī'ite'' [[religious law]]. The rebels countered that they were "defending their community against discrimination" and government aggression. In 2005, at least 36 people were killed in clashes across the country between police and protesters over rising fuel prices. In the [[ presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential election]], Saleh won with 77% of the vote. His main rival, [[Faisal bin Shamlan]], received 22%. Saleh was sworn in for another term on 27 September.

A suicide bomber killed eight  tourists and two  in the [[Marib Governorate]] in July 2007. A series of bomb attacks occurred on police, official, diplomatic, foreign business, and tourism targets in 2008. Car bombings outside the U.S. embassy in Sana'a killed 18 people, including six of the assailants in September 2008. In 2008, an opposition rally in Sana'a demanding electoral reform was met with police gunfire.

The 2011 [[ Revolution| revolution]] followed other [[Arab Spring]] mass protests in early 2011. The uprising was initially against unemployment, economic conditions, and corruption, as well as against the government's proposals to modify the [[constitution of ]] so that Saleh's son could inherit the presidency.

In March 2011, police snipers opened fire on a pro-democracy camp in Sana'a, killing more than 50 people. In May, dozens were killed in clashes between troops and tribal fighters in Sana'a. By this point, Saleh began to lose international support. In October 2011,  human rights activist [[Tawakul Karman]] won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], and the [[UN Security Council]] condemned the violence and called for a transfer of power. On 23 November 2011, Saleh flew to [[Riyadh]], in neighbouring , to sign the [[Gulf Co-operation Council]] plan for political transition, which he had previously spurned. Upon signing the document, he agreed to legally transfer the office and powers of the presidency to his deputy, Vice President [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi]].

Hadi took office for a two-year term upon winning the uncontested presidential elections in February 2012. A unity government—including a prime minister from the opposition—was formed. Al-Hadi would oversee the drafting of a new constitution, followed by parliamentary and presidential elections in 2014. Saleh returned in February 2012. In the face of objections from thousands of street protesters, parliament granted him full immunity from prosecution. Saleh's son, General [[Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh]], continues to exercise a strong hold on sections of the military and security forces.

[[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula|AQAP]] claimed responsibility for a February 2012 suicide attack on the presidential palace that killed 26 Republican Guards on the day that President Hadi was sworn in. AQAP was also behind a suicide bombing that killed 96 soldiers in Sana'a three months later. In September 2012, a car bomb attack in Sana'a killed 11 people, a day after a local al-Qaeda leader [[Said al-Shihri]] was reported killed in the south.

By 2012, there was a "small contingent of U.S. special-operations troops"—in addition to CIA and "unofficially acknowledged" U.S. military presence—in response to increasing terror attacks by AQAP on  citizens. Many analysts have pointed out the former  government role in cultivating terrorist activity in the country. Following the election of President [[Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi]], the  military was able to push [[Ansar al-Sharia ()|Ansar al-Sharia]] back and recapture the [[Shabwah Governorate]].

The central government in Sana'a remained weak, staving off challenges from [[South  Movement|southern separatists]] and Houthis as well as AQAP. The [[Houthi insurgency]] intensified after Hadi took power, escalating in September 2014 as anti-government forces led by [[Abdul-Malik al-Houthi]] [[Battle of Sana'a (2014)|swept into the capital]] and forced Hadi to agree to a "unity" government. The Houthis then refused to participate in the government, although they continued to apply pressure on Hadi and his ministers, even shelling the president's private residence and placing him under house arrest, until the government's mass resignation in January 2015. The following month, the Houthis dissolved parliament and [[2014–15  coup d'état|declared]] that a [[Revolutionary Committee ()|Revolutionary Committee]] under [[Mohammed Ali al-Houthi]] was the interim authority in . Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, a cousin of the acting president, called the takeover a "glorious revolution". However, the "constitutional declaration" of 6 February 2015 was widely rejected by opposition politicians and foreign governments, including the [[United Nations]].

Hadi managed to flee from Sana'a to Aden, his hometown and stronghold in the south, on 21 February 2015. He promptly gave a televised speech rescinding his resignation, condemning the coup, and calling for recognition as the constitutional president of . The following month, Hadi declared Aden 's "temporary" capital. The Houthis, however, rebuffed an initiative by the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] and continued to move south toward Aden. All U.S. personnel were evacuated, and President Hadi was forced to flee the country to . On 26 March 2015,  announced [[Operation Decisive Storm]] and began airstrikes and announced its intentions to lead a military coalition against the Houthis, who they claimed were being aided by  and began a force buildup along the  border.

After Hadi troops took control of Aden from Houthis, jihadist groups became active in the city, and some terrorist incidents were linked to them such as [[Missionaries of Charity attack in Aden]] on 4 March 2016. In February 2018, Aden was [[Battle of Aden (2018)|seized]] by the UAE-backed separatist [[Southern Transitional Council]].

 has been suffering from a [[Famine in  (2016–present)|famine since 2016]] as a result of the civil war. More than 50,000 children in  died from starvation in 2017. Numerous commentators have condemned the -led coalition's military campaign, including its [[blockade of ]], as [[genocide]]. The famine is being compounded by an outbreak of [[cholera]] that has affected more than one million people. The  Arabian-led intervention in  and blockade of  have contributed to the famine and cholera epidemic. The UN estimated that by the end of 2021, the war in  would have caused over 377,000 deaths, and roughly 70% of deaths were children under age 5.

On 4 December 2017, deposed strongman and former president [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]], accused of treason, was assassinated by Houthis whilst attempting to flee clashes near rebel-held Sana'a between Houthi and pro-Saleh forces. After losing the support of the -led coalition, 's President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi resigned, and the Presidential Leadership Council took power in April 2022.

In June 2024, the UAE-backed STC were putting pressure to lease the [[Port of Aden|Aden International Port]] to [[Abu Dhabi Ports]]. The move was opposed by the Parliament and the public. A joint statement by 24 members of Shura Council expressed categorical rejection of the lease agreement. Economists said the Emirates was attempting to control the Aden Port and limit its activities, in order to keep its own ports active. Governor of Aden, Tariq Salam also said the lease attempt aims to devalue the Aden Port and take its international maritime status. Aden International Port had ended its agreement to manage two container terminals with Dubai Ports World in 2012, due to economic decline and failure to fulfill commitments.

The islands making up  were formed approximately 30 million years ago due to volcanic activity in deep water along the [[ Line]]. Over time, interactions with seawater and periods of eruption have engendered a wide variety of different igneous and volcanic rocks on the islands with complex assemblages of [[mineral]]s.

=== Arrival of Europeans ===
The islands of  were uninhabited when the  arrived sometime around 1470. The first Europeans to put ashore were [[João de Santarém]] and [[Pêro Escobar]].  navigators explored the islands and decided that they would be good locations for bases to trade with the mainland.

The dates of European arrival are sometimes given as 21 December ([[Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas's Day]]) 1471, for ; and 17 January ([[Anthony the Great|St Antony's Day]]) 1472, for Príncipe, though other sources cite different years around that time. Príncipe was initially named ''Santo Antão'' (" Anthony"), changing its name in 1502 to ''Ilha do Príncipe'' ("Prince's Island"), in reference to the Prince of  to whom duties on the island's sugar crop were paid.

The first successful settlement of  was established in 1493 by [[Álvaro Caminha]], who received the land as a grant from the crown. Príncipe was settled in 1500 under a similar arrangement. Attracting settlers proved difficult, however, and most of the earliest inhabitants were "undesirables" sent from , mostly [[ and  Jews|Sephardic Jews]]. 2,000 Jewish children, eight years old and under, were taken from the Iberian peninsula for work on the sugar plantations. In time, these settlers found the volcanic soil of the region suitable for agriculture, especially the growing of sugar.

{{Main| }}
By 1515,  had become slave depots for the coastal slave trade centered at [[Elmina]].
The cultivation of sugar was a labour-intensive process and the  began to enslave large numbers of Africans from the continent. In the sugar boom's early stages, property on the islands had little value, with farming for local consumption while the economy relied mainly on the transit of slaves, though already many foodstuffs were imported. When the local landowner Álvaro Borges died in 1504, his cleared land and domesticated animals were sold for only 13,000 réis, about the price of three slaves. According to [[Valentim Fernandes]] around 1506,  had more sugarcane fields than [[Madeira]] "from which they already produce molasses," but the island lacked facilities for industrial sugar production. [[File:Forte_de_S%C3%A3o_Sebasti%C3%A3o_-_S%C3%A3o_Tom%C3%A9_(8084256064).jpg|thumb|left|[[São Sebastião Museum]] in ]]

==== Economic development in the 16th century ====
 would only become economically noteworthy with the introduction of a water-powered sugar mill in 1515, which soon led to the mass cultivation of sugar: "The fields are expanding and the sugar mills, too. At this time, only two sugar mills are here and another three are being built, counting the mill of the contractors, which is large. Similarly, the necessary conditions exist, such as streams and timber, to be able to build many more. And the [sugar] canes are the biggest I have ever seen in my life."{{Citation needed|reason=who?|date=December 2022}} Sugar [[plantation]]s were organized with slave labor, and by the mid-16th century, the  settlers had turned the islands into Africa's foremost exporter of sugar.

Slaves in  were brought from the [[Slave Coast of West Africa]], the  Delta, the island of Fernando Po, and later from the Kongo and . In the 16th century, the enslaved were imported from and exported to , [[Elmina]], the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], , and the  Americas. In 1510, reportedly 10,000 to 12,000 slaves were imported by . In 1516,  received 4,072 slaves with the purpose of re-exportation. From 1519 to 1540, the island was the center of the slave trade between Elmina and the  Delta. Throughout the early to mid-sixteenth century,  traded in slaves intermittently with  and the Kingdom of Kongo. In 1525  began trafficking slaves to the  Americas, mainly to the Caribbean and . From 1532 to 1536,  sent an annual average of 342 slaves to the [[Antilles]]. Prior to 1580, the island accounted for 75 percent of 's imports, mainly slaves. The slave trade remained a cornerstone of 's economy until after 1600.

The power dynamics of  in the 16th century were surprisingly diverse with the participation of free [[mulatto]][s] and black citizens in governance. Voluntary colonists shunned  for its disease and food shortages, so the  crown deported convicts to the island and encouraged interracial relationships to secure the colony. Slavery was also not permanent, as demonstrated through the 1515 royal decree granting the manumission of African wives of white settlers and their mixed-race children. In 1517, another decree freed the male slaves who had originally arrived on the island with the first colonists. After 1520, a royal charter allowed for property-owning, married, free mulattos to hold public offices. This was followed by a decree in 1546 establishing civil equality between these qualified mulattos and the white settlers, allowing free mulattos and black citizens opportunities for upward mobility and participation in local politics and business. Social divisions led to frequent disputes within the colony's town councils and with the governor and bishop, with constant political instability.
[[File:Gezicht op Sao Tomé, ca. 1641 Insvla S. Thomae (titel op object), RP-P-1951-70.jpg|thumb|Capture of  by [[Cornelis Jol]] of the [[ West  Company]] in 1641]]
At first, slavery in  was less strict. In the mid-16th century, an anonymous  pilot noted that the slaves were employed as couples, built their own accommodations, and worked autonomously once a week on the cultivation of their own food supply. However, this more relaxed slave system did not last long following the introduction of plantations. Throughout, slaves frequently ran away to the inhospitable mountain forests of the island's interior. Between 1514 and 1527, five percent of slaves that were imported to  escaped, often to starve, though 1531–1535 saw major food shortages even in the plantations. Eventually, the [[Maroon (people)|Maroon people]] developed settlements in the interior known as'' macambos''.

==== Slave rebellions ====
The first signs of slave rebellion began in the 1530s, when the maroon gangs organized to attack plantations, some of which were abandoned. A formal complaint was lodged by local  authorities in 1531 lamenting that too many settlers and black citizens were being killed in the attacks, and that the island would be lost if the problem remained unresolved. In a 1533 'bush war', a 'bush captain' led militia units to suppress the maroons. A significant event in the maroon fight for freedom occurred in 1549, when two men claiming to be free-born were taken in from the ''macambos ''by a wealthy mulatto planter named Ana de Chaves. With the support of de Chaves, the two men petitioned the king to be declared free, and the request was approved. The largest population of maroons coincided with the sugar boom of the mid-16th century, as the plantations teemed with slaves. Between 1587 and 1590, many of the runaway slaves were defeated in another bush war. By 1593, the governor declared the maroon forces almost completely extinguished. Nevertheless, maroon populations kept settlers away from the southern and western regions.

The greatest slave revolt occurred in July 1595, when the government was weakened by disputes between the bishop and the governor. A native slave named [[Rei Amador|Amador]] recruited 5,000 slaves to raid and destroy plantations, sugar mills, and settler houses. Amador's rebellion made three raids on the town and destroyed 60 of the island's 85 sugar mills, but they were defeated by the militia after three weeks. Two hundred slaves were killed in combat, and Amador and the other rebel leaders were executed, while the rest of the slaves were granted amnesty and returned to their plantation. Smaller slave rebellions followed in the 17th and 18th centuries.

==== 18th, 19th and 20th centuries ====
Eventually, competition from sugar-producing colonies in the [[Western Hemisphere]] began to hurt the islands. The large enslaved population also proved difficult to control, with  unable to invest many resources in the effort.{{citation needed|date=July 2024}} Sugar cultivation thus declined over the next 100 years, and by the mid-17th century,  had become primarily a transit point for ships engaged in the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] between continental Africa and the Americas.{{citation needed|date=July 2024}}

In the early 19th century, two new cash crops, coffee and cocoa, were introduced.{{rp|2}} By 1905,  had become the world's largest producer of cocoa, which remains the country's most important crop.

The ''roças'' system, which gave the plantation managers a high degree of authority, led to abuses against the African farm workers. Although  officially abolished slavery in 1876, the practice of forced paid labour continued. ''[[Scientific ]]'' documented in words and pictures the continued use of slaves in  in its 13 March 1897 issue.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

Observations of the [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]] in Príncipe by Sir [[Arthur Eddington]] provided one of the first successful tests of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]].

In the early 20th century, an internationally publicized controversy arose over charges that [[]]n contract workers were being subjected to forced labour and unsatisfactory working conditions. Sporadic labor unrest and dissatisfaction continued well into the 20th century, culminating in an outbreak of riots in 1953 in which several hundred African laborers were killed in a clash with their  rulers. The anniversary of this "[[Batepá Massacre]]" remains officially observed by the government.

By the late 1950s, when other emerging nations across the African continent demanded their independence, a small group of São Toméans formed the [[Movement for the Liberation of ]] (MLSTP), which eventually established its base in nearby [[]]. Picking up momentum in the 1960s, events moved quickly after the overthrow of the [[Marcelo Caetano|Caetano]] dictatorship in  in April 1974.

The new  regime was committed to the dissolution of its overseas colonies. In November 1974, its representatives met with the MLSTP in Algiers and worked out an agreement for the transfer of sovereignty. After a period of transitional government,  achieved independence on 12 July 1975, choosing as the first president the MLSTP Secretary General [[Manuel Pinto da Costa]].

In 1990,  became one of the first African countries to undergo [[Democratization|democratic reform]], and changes to the constitution—including the legalization of opposition political parties—led to elections in 1991 that were non-violent, free, and transparent. [[Miguel Trovoada]], a former prime minister who had been in exile since 1986, returned as an independent candidate and was elected president. Trovoada was re-elected in 's second multiparty presidential election in 1996.

The [[Democratic Convergence Party – Reflection Group|Party of Democratic Convergence]] won a majority of seats in the [[National Assembly of |National Assembly]], with the MLSTP becoming an important and vocal minority party. Municipal elections followed in late 1992, in which the MLSTP won a majority of seats on five of seven regional councils. In early legislative elections in October 1994, the MLSTP won a plurality of seats in the assembly. It regained an outright majority of seats in the November 1998 elections.

===21st century===
In the 2001 presidential elections the candidate backed by the [[Independent Democratic Action]] party, [[Fradique de Menezes]], was elected in the first round and inaugurated on 3 September. Parliamentary elections were held in March 2002. For the next four years, a series of short-lived opposition-led governments was formed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In July 2003, the army seized power for one week, complaining of corruption and that forthcoming oil revenues would not be divided fairly. An accord was negotiated under which President de Menezes was returned to office. In March 2006, the [[Cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]] period ended, when a propresidential coalition won enough seats in National Assembly elections to form a new government.

In the 30 July 2006 [[2006 São Toméan presidential election|presidential election]], Fradique de Menezes easily won a second five-year term in office, defeating two other candidates, [[Patrice Trovoada]] (son of former president Miguel Trovoada) and independent [[Nilo Guimarães]]. Local elections, the first since 1992, took place on 27 August 2006 and were dominated by members of the ruling coalition. On 12 February 2009, a'' [[coup d'état]] ''was attempted to overthrow President Fradique de Menezes. The plotters were imprisoned, but later received a pardon from President de Menezes.

[[Evaristo Carvalho]] became the [[President of ]] in the [[2016 São Toméan presidential election|2016 elections]], after winning over the incumbent President [[Manuel Pinto da Costa]]. President Carvalho is also vice president of the Independent Democratic Action party (ADI). [[Patrice Emery Trovoada]] became prime minister in 2014; he is also the leader of the Independent Democratic Action party (ADI). In December 2018, [[Jorge Bom Jesus]], the leader of the Movimento de Libertação de  e Príncipe-Partido Social Democráta (MLSTP-PSD), was sworn in as new prime minister.

[[File:Pergamon-Museum - Anthropomorphe Stele 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Anthropomorphic stela (4th millennium BC), sandstone, 57x27 cm, from El-Maakir-Qaryat al-Kaafa ([[National Museum of ]], [[Riyadh]])]]

There is evidence that human habitation in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] dates back to about 125,000 years ago. A 2011 study found that the first modern humans to spread east across Asia left [[Africa]] about 75,000 years ago across the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] connecting the [[Horn of Africa]] and Arabia. The Arabian Peninsula is regarded as central to the understanding of evolution and dispersals of humanity. Arabia underwent an extreme environmental fluctuation in the [[Quaternary]] that led to profound evolutionary and demographic changes. Arabia has a rich [[Lower Paleolithic]] record, and the quantity of [[Oldowan]]-like sites in the region indicate a significant role that Arabia had played in the early hominin colonization of Eurasia.

In the [[Neolithic]] period, prominent cultures such as [[Al-Magar]], whose centre lay in modern-day southwestern Najd, flourished. Al-Magar could be considered a "Neolithic Revolution" in human knowledge and handicraft skills. The culture is characterized as being one of the world's first to involve the widespread domestication of animals, particularly the horse. Al-Magar statues were made from local stone, and it seems that the statues were fixed in a central building that might have had a significant role in the social and religious life of the inhabitants.

In 2017, hunting scenes showing images of most likely domesticated dogs (resembling the [[Canaan Dog]]) were discovered in northwestern . These rock engravings date back more than {{gaps|8|000}} years, making them the earliest depictions of dogs in the world.

At the end of the 4th millennium BC, Arabia entered the [[Bronze Age]]; metals were widely used, and the period was characterized by its 2&nbsp;m high burials which were simultaneously followed by the existence of numerous temples that included many free-standing sculptures originally painted with red colours.

In May 2021, archaeologists announced that a 350,000-year-old [[Acheulean]] site named An Nasim in the [[Ḥaʼil Province|Hail region]] could be the oldest human habitation site in northern . [[Paleolithic]] artefacts are similar to material remains uncovered at the Acheulean sites in the [[An Nafud|Nefud Desert]].

The earliest sedentary culture in  dates back to the [[Ubaid period]] at [[Dosariyah]]. Climatic change and the onset of aridity may have brought about the end of this phase of settlement, as little archaeological evidence exists from the succeeding millennium. The settlement of the region picks up again in the period of [[Dilmun]] in the early 3rd millennium. Known records from [[Uruk]] refer to a place called Dilmun, associated on several occasions with copper, and in later periods it was a source of imported woods in southern Mesopotamia. Scholars have suggested that Dilmun originally designated the [[Eastern Province, |Eastern Province]], notably linked with the major Dilmunite settlements of Umm an-Nussi and Umm ar-Ramadh in the interior and Tarout on the coast. It is likely that [[Tarout Island]] was the main port and the capital of Dilmun. Mesopotamian inscribed clay tablets suggest that, in the early period of Dilmun, a hierarchical organized political structure existed. In 1966, an earthwork in Tarout exposed an ancient burial field that yielded a large statue dating to the Dilmunite period (mid 3rd millennium BC). The statue was locally made under the strong Mesopotamian influence on the artistic principle of Dilmun.

By 2200 BC, the centre of Dilmun shifted for unknown reasons from Tarout and the  Arabian mainland to the island of , and a highly developed settlement emerged there, where a laborious temple complex and thousands of burial mounds dating to this period were discovered.

By the late [[Bronze Age]], a historically recorded people and land ([[Midian]] and the Midianites) in the north-western portion of  are well-documented in the Bible. Centred in [[Tabuk, |Tabouk]], it stretched from [[Wadi Arabah]] in the north to the area of al-Wejh in the south. The capital of Midian was Qurayyah, it consists of a large, fortified citadel encompassing 35 hectares and below it lies a walled settlement of 15 hectares. The city hosted as many as 12,000 inhabitants. The Bible recounts [[Kingdom of  (united monarchy)|]]'s [[Midian war|two wars]] with Midian, in the early 11th century BC. Politically, the Midianites were described as having a decentralized structure headed by five kings (Evi, Rekem, Tsur, Hur, and Reba); the names appear to be toponyms of important Midianite settlements. It is common to view that Midian designated a confederation of tribes, the sedentary element settled in the Hijaz while its nomadic affiliates pastured and sometimes pillaged as far away as [[ (region)|]]. The nomadic [[Midianites]] were one of the earliest exploiters of the domestication of camels that enabled them to navigate through the harsh terrains of the region.

The original statue was painted with white. ([[Louvre|Louvre Museum]], [[Paris]])]]

At the end of the 7th century BC, an emerging kingdom appeared in north-western Arabia. It started as a sheikdom of Dedan, which developed into the kingdom of [[Lihyan]]. During this period, Dedan transformed into a kingdom that encompassed a much wider domain. In the early 3rd century BC, with bustling economic activity between the south and north, Lihyan acquired large influence suitable to its strategic position on the caravan road. The Lihyanites ruled over a large domain from [[Medina|Yathrib]] in the south and parts of the Levant in the north. In antiquity, Gulf of Aqaba used to be called Gulf of Lihyan, a testimony to the extensive influence that Lihyan acquired.

The Lihyanites fell into the hands of the [[Nabataeans]] around 65 BC upon their seizure of Hegra then marching to [[Tayma]], and to their capital Dedan in 9 BC. The Nabataeans ruled large portions of north Arabia until their domain was annexed by the [[Roman Empire]], which renamed it [[Arabia Petraea]], and remained under the rule of the Romans until 630.

=== Middle Ages and rise of Islam ===
{{Main|Caliphate}}
[[File:Umayyad750ADloc.png|thumb|left|At its greatest extent, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] (661–750) covered {{cvt|11100000|km2|sqmi|-5|comma=gaps}} and 62 million people (29 per cent of the world's population), making it one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]] in both area and proportion of the world's population. It was also larger than any previous empire in history.]]

Shortly before the advent of Islam, apart from urban trading settlements (such as Mecca and Medina), much of what was to become  was populated by nomadic pastoral tribal societies. The Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca in about 570 [[Common Era|CE]]. In the early 7th century, [[Muhammad]] united the [[Tribes of Arabia|various tribes of the peninsula]] and created a single Islamic religious polity. Following his death in 632, his followers expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia, conquering territory in the Iberian Peninsula in the west, to parts of Central and South Asia in the east, in a matter of decades. Arabia became a more politically peripheral region of the Muslim world as the focus shifted to the newly conquered lands.

[[Arab]]s originating from modern-day , the [[Hejaz]] in particular, founded the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] (632–661), [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] (661–750), [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] (750–1517), and the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] (909–1171) caliphates. From the 10th century to the early 20th century, Mecca and Medina were under the control of a local Arab ruler known as the [[Sharif of Mecca]], but at most times the Sharif owed allegiance to the ruler of one of the major Islamic empires based in [[Baghdad]], [[Cairo]] or [[Istanbul]]. Most of the remainder of what became  reverted to traditional tribal rule.

[[File:Siyer-i Nebi - Imam Ali und Hamza bei dem vorgezogenen Einzelkampf in Badr gegen die Götzendiener.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Battle of Badr]], 13 March 624 CE]]
For much of the 10th century, the [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]]-Shi'ite [[Qarmatians]] were the most powerful force in the Persian Gulf. In 930, the Qarmatians pillaged Mecca, outraging the Muslim world, particularly with their theft of the [[Black Stone]]. In 1077–1078, an Arab sheikh named [[Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni]] defeated the Qarmatians in [[Eastern Arabia|]] and [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|al-Hasa]] with the help of the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuq Empire]] and founded the [[Uyunid dynasty]]. The [[Uyunid Emirate]] later underwent expansion, with its territory stretching from Najd to the [[ Desert]]. They were overthrown by the [[Usfurids]] in 1253. Usfurid rule was weakened after Persian rulers of [[Ormus|Hormuz]] captured  and [[Qatif]] in 1320. The vassals of Ormuz, the Shia [[Jarwanid dynasty]] came to rule eastern Arabia in the 14th century. The [[Jabrids]] took control of the region after overthrowing the Jarwanids in the 15th century and clashed with Hormuz for more than two decades over the region for its economic revenues, until finally agreeing to pay [[tribute]] in 1507. [[Al-Muntafiq]] tribe later took over the region and came under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[suzerainty]]. The [[Bani Khalid (tribe)|Bani Khalid tribe]] later revolted against them in the 17th century and took control. Their rule extended from  to  at its height, and they too came under Ottoman suzerainty.

=== Ottoman Hejaz and  era ===
{{Main|Ottoman era in the history of |Mamluk– conflicts|Ottoman– confrontations}}

In the 16th century, the Ottomans added the Red Sea and Persian Gulf coast (the Hejaz, [[Aseer]] and [[Eastern Arabia|Al-Ahsa]]) to the empire and claimed suzerainty over the interior. One reason was to [[Ottoman– conflicts (1538–1560)|thwart  attempts]] to attack the Red Sea (hence the Hejaz) and the  Ocean. The Ottoman degree of control over these lands varied over the next four centuries with the fluctuating strength or weakness of the empire's central authority.{{sfn|Bowen|2007|p=68}} These changes contributed to later uncertainties, such as the dispute with  over the [[Occupation of Ma'an|inclusion of the sanjak of Ma'an]], including the cities of [[Ma'an]] and [[Aqaba]].

=== Saud dynasty and unification ===
{{See also|Unification of }}

[[File:The First  State Greatest Extent.png|thumb|Expansion of the [[Emirate of Diriyah|first  State]] in 1810|left]]
The emergence of what was to become the  royal family, known as the Al Saud, began at the town of [[Diriyah]] in central Arabia with the accession as [[emir]] of [[Muhammad bin Saud]] on 22 February 1727. In 1744 he joined forces with the religious leader [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]],{{sfn|Bowen|2007|p=69–70}} founder of the Wahhabi movement, a strict puritanical form of Sunni Islam. This alliance provided the ideological impetus to  expansion and remains the basis of  Arabian dynastic rule today.

The [[Emirate of Diriyah]] established in the area around Riyadh rapidly expanded and briefly controlled most of the present-day territory of , [[Wahhabi sack of Karbala|sacking Karbala]] in 1802, and [[Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites in |capturing Mecca]] in 1803. In 1818, it was destroyed by the Ottoman viceroy of , [[Muhammad Ali of |Mohammed Ali Pasha]]. The much smaller [[Emirate of Nejd]] was established in 1824. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the Al Saud contested control of the interior of what was to become  with another Arabian ruling family, the [[Rashidi dynasty|Al Rashid]], who ruled the [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar]]. By 1891, the Al Rashid were victorious and the Al Saud were driven into exile in .

At the beginning of the 20th century, the Ottoman Empire continued to control or have a suzerainty over most of the peninsula. Subject to this suzerainty, Arabia was ruled by a patchwork of tribal rulers, with the [[Sharif of Mecca]] having pre-eminence and ruling the Hejaz. In 1902, [[Abdul Rahman bin Faisal|Abdul Rahman]]'s son, Abdulaziz—later known as [[Ibn Saud]]—recaptured control of Riyadh bringing the Al Saud back to Nejd, creating the [[Emirate of Nejd and Hasa|third " state"]]. Ibn Saud gained the support of the [[Ikhwan]], a tribal army inspired by Wahhabism and led by [[Faisal Al-Dawish]], and which had grown quickly after its foundation in 1912. With the aid of the Ikhwan, Ibn Saud captured Al-Ahsa from the Ottomans in 1913.

In 1916, with the encouragement and support of [[ of Great Britain and |Britain]] (which was fighting the Ottomans in [[World War I]]), the Sharif of Mecca, [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein bin Ali]], led a pan-[[Arab Revolt]] against the Ottoman Empire to create a united Arab state. Although the revolt failed in its objective, [[Allies of World War I|the Allied]] victory in World War I resulted in the end of Ottoman suzerainty and control in Arabia, and Hussein bin Ali became [[Kingdom of Hejaz|King of Hejaz]].

Ibn Saud avoided involvement in the Arab Revolt and instead continued his struggle with the Al Rashid. Following the latter's final defeat, he took the title [[Sultanate of Nejd|Sultan of Nejd]] in 1921. With the help of the Ikhwan, the Kingdom of Hejaz was conquered in 1924–25, and on 10 January 1926, Ibn Saud declared himself king of Hejaz. For the next five years, he administered the two parts of his dual kingdom as separate units.

After the conquest of the Hejaz, the Ikhwan leadership's objective switched to expansion of the Wahhabist realm into the  protectorates of ,  and , and began raiding those territories. This met with Ibn Saud's opposition, as he recognized the danger of a direct conflict with the . At the same time, the Ikhwan became disenchanted with Ibn Saud's domestic policies which appeared to favour modernization and the increase in the number of non-Muslim foreigners in the country. As a result, they turned against Ibn Saud and, after a two-year struggle, were defeated in 1929 at the [[Battle of Sabilla]], where their leaders were massacred. On Ibn Saud's behalf, [[Faisal bin Abdulaziz al Saud|Prince Faisal]] declared the unification on 23 September 1932, and the two kingdoms of Hejaz and Nejd were unified as the Kingdom of . That date is now a national holiday called [[ National Day]].

[[File:Dammam No. 7 on March 4, 1938.jpg|thumb|The oil well ''[[Dammam No. 7]]'' on March 4, 1938, the day it struck oil in commercial quantities, becoming the first in  to do so]]
The new kingdom was reliant on limited agriculture and pilgrimage revenues. [[Dammam No. 7|In 1938, vast reserves of oil were discovered]] in the Al-Ahsa region along the coast of the Persian Gulf, and full-scale development of the oil fields began in 1941 under the US-controlled [[ Aramco|Aramco (Arabian  Oil Company)]]. Oil provided  with economic prosperity and substantial political leverage internationally. Cultural life rapidly developed, primarily in the Hejaz, which was the centre for newspapers and radio. However, the large influx of [[foreign workers in ]] in the oil industry increased the pre-existing propensity for [[xenophobia]]. At the same time, the government became increasingly wasteful and extravagant. By the 1950s this had led to large governmental deficits and excessive foreign borrowing. In 1953, [[Saud of ]] succeeded as the king of . In 1964 he was deposed in favour of his half brother [[Faisal of ]], after an intense rivalry, fuelled by doubts in the royal family over Saud's competence. In 1972,  gained a 20% control in Aramco, thereby decreasing US control over  oil. In 1973,  led an [[1973 oil crisis|oil boycott]] against the Western countries that supported  in the [[Yom Kippur War]] against  and , leading to the quadrupling of oil prices. In 1975, Faisal was assassinated by his nephew, Prince [[Faisal bin Musaid]] and was succeeded by his half-brother [[Khalid of |King Khalid]].[[File:Nasser_and_Faisal.jpg|alt=Nasser and Faisal|thumb|230x230px|Faisal (left) with 's President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] in Cairo, 1969]]
By 1976,  had become the largest oil producer in the world. Khalid's reign saw economic and social development progress at an extremely rapid rate, transforming the infrastructure and educational system of the country; in foreign policy, close ties with the US were developed. In 1979, two events occurred which greatly concerned the government and had a long-term influence on  foreign and domestic policy. The first was the [[ Revolution| Islamic Revolution]]. It was feared that the country's [[Shi'a Islam in |Shi'ite minority]] in the Eastern Province (which is also the location of the oil fields) might rebel under the influence of their  co-religionists. There were several anti-government uprisings in the region such as the [[1979 Qatif Uprising]]. The second event was the [[Grand Mosque Seizure]] in Mecca by Islamist extremists. The militants involved were in part angered by what they considered to be the corruption and un-Islamic nature of the  government. The government regained control of the mosque after 10 days, and those captured were executed. Part of the response of the royal family was to enforce the much stricter observance of traditional religious and social norms in the country (for example, the closure of cinemas) and to give the [[ulema]] a greater role in government. Neither entirely succeeded as Islamism continued to grow in strength.

[[File: 2003 CIA map.jpg|thumb|left|Map of  Arabian administrative regions and roadways]]
In 1980,  bought out the  interests in Aramco. King Khalid died in 1982 and was succeeded by his brother, [[Fahd of |King Fahd]]. Fahd continued to develop close relations with the  and increased the purchase of  and  military equipment. The vast wealth generated by oil revenues was beginning to have an even greater impact on  society. It led to rapid technological (but not cultural) modernization, urbanization, mass public education, and the creation of new media. This and the presence of increasingly large numbers of foreign workers greatly affected traditional  norms and values. Although there was a dramatic change in the social and economic life of the country, political power continued to be monopolized by the royal family leading to discontent among many  who began to look for wider participation in government.{{sfn|Abir|1993|p=114}}

In the 1980s,  and [[]] spent $25 billion in support of [[Saddam Hussein]] in the [[– War]] (1980–1988); however,  condemned the [[invasion of ]] in 1990 and asked the  to intervene. King Fahd allowed  and coalition troops to be stationed in . He invited the  government and many of its citizens to stay in , but expelled citizens of [[]] and [[]] because of their governments' support of [[Ba'athist |]]. In 1991,  Arabian forces were involved both in bombing raids on  and in the land invasion that helped to liberate , which became known as the [[Gulf War]] (1990–1991).

's relations with the West was one of the issues that led to [[List of militant incidents in |an increase in Islamist terrorism]] in , as well as Islamist terrorist attacks in Western countries by  nationals. [[Osama bin Laden]] was a  citizen (until stripped of his citizenship in 1994) and was responsible for the [[1998  embassy bombings|1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] in East Africa and the 2000 [[USS Cole bombing|USS ''Cole'' bombing]] near the port of [[Aden]], . 15 of [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|the hijackers]] involved in the [[September 11 attacks]] were  nationals. Many  who did not support the Islamist terrorists were nevertheless deeply unhappy with the government's policies.

Islamism was not the only source of hostility to the government. Although extremely wealthy by the 21st century, 's economy was near stagnant. High taxes and a growth in unemployment have contributed to discontent and have been reflected in a rise in civil unrest, and discontent with the royal family. In response, a number of limited reforms were initiated by King Fahd. In March 1992, he introduced the "[[Basic Law of |Basic Law]]", which emphasized the duties and responsibilities of a ruler. In December 1993, the Consultative Council was inaugurated. It is composed of a chairman and 60 members—all chosen by the King. Fahd made it clear that he did not have democracy in mind, saying: "A system based on elections is not consistent with our Islamic creed, which [approves of] government by consultation [shūrā]."

In 1995, Fahd suffered a stroke, and the Crown Prince, [[Abdullah of |Abdullah]], became ''de facto'' regent; however, his authority was hindered by conflict with Fahd's full brothers (known, with Fahd, as the "[[Sudairi Seven]]").

=== 21st century ===
Signs of discontent included, in 2003 and 2004, a series of bombings and armed violence in Riyadh, Jeddah, Yanbu and Khobar. In February–April 2005, [[2005  Arabian municipal elections|the first-ever nationwide municipal elections]] were held in . Women were not allowed to take part.

In 2005, King Fahd died and was succeeded by Abdullah, who continued the policy of minimum reform and clamping down on protests. The king introduced economic reforms aimed at reducing the country's reliance on oil revenue: limited [[deregulation]], encouragement of foreign investment, and [[privatization]]. In February 2009, Abdullah announced a series of governmental changes to the judiciary, armed forces, and various ministries to modernize these institutions including the replacement of senior appointees in the judiciary and the [[Islamic religious police|Mutaween]] (religious police) with more moderate individuals and the appointment of the country's first female deputy minister. On 29 January 2011, hundreds of protesters gathered in [[Jeddah]] in a rare display of criticism against the city's poor infrastructure after flooding killed 11 people.

Since 2011,  has been affected by its own [[2011–13  Arabian protests|Arab Spring protests]]. In response, King Abdullah announced on 22 February 2011 a series of benefits for citizens amounting to $36 billion, of which $10.7 billion was earmarked for housing. No political reforms were included, though some prisoners indicted for financial crimes were pardoned. Abdullah also announced a package of $93 billion, which included 500,000 new homes to a cost of $67 billion, in addition to creating {{gaps|60|000}} new security jobs. Although male-only [[ Arabian municipal elections, 2011|municipal elections were held in 2011]], Abdullah allowed women to vote and be elected in the [[ Arabian municipal elections, 2015|2015 municipal elections]], and also to be nominated to the [[Consultative Assembly of |Shura Council]].

Evidence of [[rock carvings]] along the [[Nile]] and in surrounding oases indicates early habitation. In the [[10th millennium BCE]], a culture of [[hunter-gatherer]]s and [[fishing|fishers]] was replaced by a [[cereal|grain]]-grinding culture. Climate changes or [[overgrazing]] around 8000 [[before common era|BCE]] began to desiccate the pastoral lands of , forming the [[Sahara]]. Early [[tribal people]]s migrated to the Nile River where they developed a settled agricultural [[Economic system|economy]] and more centralised society.

By about 6000 BCE, a [[Neolithic]] culture took root in the Nile Valley. During the Neolithic era, several predynastic cultures developed independently in [[Upper and Lower ]]. The [[Badarian]] culture and the successor [[Naqada]] series are generally regarded as precursors to [[Ancient |dynastic ]]. The earliest known Lower  site, Merimda, predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years. Contemporaneous Lower  communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years, remaining culturally distinct, but maintaining frequent contact through trade.

The Byzantines regained control of  after a brief [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanid Persian]] invasion early in the 7th century, until 639–42, when the country was conquered by Arab Muslim forces under [[Amr ibn al-As]]. The Arabs defeated the Byzantine armies, bringing [[Islam]] to . Alexandria briefly returned to Byzantine control in 645 but fell again to the Arabs in 646. In 654, an invasion fleet sent by [[Constans II]] was repulsed. The Arabs founded [[Fustat]], later replaced by Cairo in 969.

Under the [[Abbasid]] caliphate,  was governed through deputies residing in Baghdad. Revolts occurred frequently, including the  revolt of 828 and the uprising of 831 when Copts joined Muslims against the government. Semi-independent dynasties arose, including the [[Tulunid dynasty]] (868–905) and [[Ikhshidid dynasty]] (935–969), which maintained Abbasid allegiance while exercising local authority.

The [[Fatimid Caliphate]] ruled  from the 10th century, with [[Cairo]] as their capital. After the Fatimids, the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] governed until 1250, when the [[Mamluk]]s, a military caste of [[Turkic people|Turco]]-[[Circassians|Circassian]] origin, took control. The Mamluks ruled  for the next three centuries and maintained control over parts of the Levant. By the late 13th century,  linked trade routes connecting the Red Sea with , Malaya, and the East Indies. The mid-14th century [[Black Death]] killed about 40% of 's population.

 was conquered by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1517, following the defeat of the [[Mamluk Sultanate]], and became a province of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Mamluks, who had dominated 's military and political life for centuries, retained influence under Ottoman rule, creating a semi-autonomous power structure. The Ottomans faced repeated challenges in maintaining control, while plagues and famines weakened the economy and civil society. Between 1687 and 1731,  experienced six major famines, including the 1784 famine that killed roughly one-sixth of the population.

In 1798, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] invaded , defeating the Mamluks at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]]. The  occupation was short-lived, but it destabilized the region and set the stage for Muhammad Ali Pasha's rise. After the  were expelled, power struggles ensued between the Ottomans, the Mamluks, and  mercenaries in Ottoman service, leaving  politically fragmented.

In 1805, [[Muhammad Ali of |Muhammad Ali Pasha]] seized power, massacring the remaining Mamluks and establishing a dynasty that would rule  until 1952. He reorganized the army along European lines, introduced conscription, and developed a centralized administration. At the same time, he promoted cash-crop agriculture, especially long-staple cotton, to integrate  into global markets. His successors, including [[Ibrahim Pasha of |Ibrahim Pasha]], [[Abbas I of |Abbas I]], [[Sa'id of |Sa'id]], and [[Isma'il Pasha of |Isma'il Pasha]], continued reforms in agriculture, science, and industry, and abolished slavery.

Muhammad Ali expanded 's control over [[Northern ]] (1820–1824), [[]] (1833), and parts of [[Arabia]] and [[]], but European powers intervened in 1841, forcing him to relinquish most of his conquests. He modernized 's infrastructure, built factories and irrigation networks, and strengthened the military, while broader education remained largely limited to military and technical training. The centralization of power and focus on military and economic modernization laid the foundation for 's transformation into a regional power.

=== Monarchical  (1867–1952) ===
{{Main|Khedivate of  {{!}} Khedivate of  (1867–1914|Sultanate of  {{!}} Sultanate of  (1914–1922)|Kingdom of  (1922–1953)}}

In 1867,  was formally granted autonomous status as a [[Khedivate of |vassal state]] of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Suez Canal]], completed in 1869 with  assistance, became a key strategic and commercial asset. Financial mismanagement and mounting debts led Isma'il Pasha to sell 's shares in the canal to Britain in 1875, increasing European influence. Rising discontent culminated in the [[Urabi revolt]], after which Britain occupied  in 1882, establishing a de facto protectorate while maintaining nominal Ottoman sovereignty. The Anglo- Condominium Agreement of 1899 placed  under joint  and  administration, though Britain retained real control. Incidents such as the [[Denshawai incident]] in 1906 intensified nationalist sentiment, laying the groundwork for political movements that challenged both Ottoman and European dominance.

[[File:Cairo-Demonstrations1919.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Female nationalists demonstrating in [[Cairo]], 1919|304x304px]]
In 1914, as the [[Ottoman Empire]] joined World War I alongside the Central Powers, Khedive [[Abbas II of |Abbas II]] declared support for the Ottoman side. In response, the  deposed him and installed his brother [[Hussein Kamel of |Hussein Kamel]], who assumed the title of [[Sultanate of |Sultan of ]].  was formally declared independent from the Ottoman Empire but remained under  protection.

After [[World War I]], nationalist sentiments surged. [[Saad Zaghlul]] and the [[Wafd Party]] secured popular support, but the  exiled Zaghlul and his colleagues to  on 8 March 1919, prompting the [[ revolution of 1919|first modern revolution]]. This uprising pressured the UK to issue a [[Unilateral Declaration of  Independence|declaration of independence]] on 22 February 1922. Sultan [[Fuad I of |Fuad I]] then assumed the title of King of . Despite nominal independence, Britain retained military presence and political influence.
[[File:Fuad I of , Edward VIII, & Mohamed Sa'id Paşa.jpg|thumb|[[Fuad I of ]] with [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]], 1932|left|223x223px]]
In 1923, a new constitution established a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] government. The Wafd Party won a decisive victory in the 1923–24 elections, with [[Saad Zaghloul]] becoming prime minister. The [[Anglo- Treaty of 1936|1936 treaty]] led to  troop withdrawal from most of , except the Suez Canal. The treaty left the status of [[Anglo- |]] unresolved, as real control remained with Britain.

During [[World War II]],  served as a strategic base for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] operations, particularly in [[North Africa]]. Although  declared martial law and severed diplomatic relations with [[Axis powers]], the  army did not engage directly. Political tensions persisted, highlighted by the 1942 [[Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942|Abdeen Palace Incident]], in which  forces pressured King Farouk to install a Wafd-coalition government.
[[File:1stAlameinBritDefense.jpg|thumb| infantry near [[First Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]], 17 July 1942|right|200x200px]]
After the war, nationalist and anti- sentiments intensified.  troops largely withdrew in 1947, leaving a residual presence around the Suez Canal. 's defeat in the [[First Arab- War]] fueled anti-monarchy feeling. The Wafd Party's 1950 election victory forced King Farouk to appoint [[Mostafa El-Nahas]] as prime minister. In 1951,  unilaterally renounced the [[Anglo- treaty of 1936|1936 treaty]] and demanded  troop withdrawal. The situation around the Suez Canal escalated, culminating in violent confrontations that led to the killing of 43  policemen in 1952 by  troops. The Ismailia incident outraged  and led to the subsequent [[Cairo fire|Black Saturday]] anti- riots, which saw widespread destruction in Cairo.

These events precipitated the [[ Revolution of 1952|Free Officers Movement coup]] on 22–23 July 1952, led by [[Muhammad Naguib]] and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. King Farouk abdicated in favor of his infant son, [[Fuad II of |Fuad II]], but real power rested with the [[ Revolutionary Command Council]]. By 18 June 1953, the monarchy was formally abolished, the 1923 constitution suspended, and  was declared a republic, with Naguib as president and Nasser as prime minister.

=== Republican  under Nasser (1952–1970) ===

[[File:Port Said from air.jpg|thumb|Smoke rises from oil tanks beside the [[Suez Canal]] hit during the initial [[Suez Crisis|Anglo- assault]] on , 5 November 1956.]]
Following the [[ revolution of 1952|1952 Revolution]] led by the [[Free Officers Movement ()|Free Officers Movement]],  came under military control, and all political parties were banned. On 18 June 1953, the [[Republic of  (1953–1958)|Republic of ]] was officially declared, with [[Muhammad Naguib]] serving as the first President. His presidency lasted less than a year and a half, as [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], a [[Pan-Arabist]] and the principal architect of the 1952 movement, gradually consolidated power. Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 and placed under [[house arrest]]. The presidency remained vacant until Nasser was formally elected in 1956.

In October 1954,  and the  agreed to end the [[Anglo- |Anglo- Condominium Agreement]] of 1899, granting  full independence, which came into effect on 1 January 1956. In June 1956, Nasser assumed the presidency and immediately became the central figure in 's domestic and foreign policy.  forces completed their withdrawal from the Suez Canal Zone on 13 June 1956. Later that year, on 26 July, Nasser [[nationalised]] the Suez Canal, provoking the [[Suez Crisis]] when , with support from  and the , invaded the Sinai Peninsula and targeted the Canal. The conflict ended following diplomatic pressure from the  and the Soviet Union, restoring the pre-war status quo.

In 1958,  formed a political union with , creating the [[United Arab Republic]]. The union, also loosely connected with [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of |North ]] in the [[United Arab States]], was short-lived;  seceded in 1961. During this period,  became heavily involved in the [[North  Civil War]], with military interventions and peace conferences ultimately leading to a prolonged stalemate.
In May 1967, tensions with  escalated after warnings from the Soviet Union, deployment of  forces to Sinai, expulsion of UN peacekeepers, and closure of the [[Straits of Tiran]]. These measures precipitated the [[Third Arab- War|Six-Day War]], during which  captured the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Gaza Strip]]. In response to the conflict, an [[Emergency law in |Emergency Law]] was enacted, greatly expanding police powers, restricting constitutional rights, and legalising censorship; it remained in force until 2012, except for a brief break in 1980–81.

Socially and economically, Nasser's policies transformed . At the time of the monarchy's fall, less than half a million  were considered upper class, four million were middle class, and seventeen million were lower class or poor. Education was expanded, with school enrolment more than doubling from 1953 to 1966. Land reforms, industrial support, and growth in public-sector employment created a larger middle class, including doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, and journalists. However, by the late 1960s, the  economy faced stagnation, political freedoms had declined, and Nasser's personal popularity began to wane.

===  under Sadat and Mubarak (1971–2011) ===
{{Main|History of  under Anwar Sadat|History of  under Hosni Mubarak}}
[[File: Armor.jpg|thumb| tanks advancing in the Sinai desert during the [[Yom Kippur War]], 1973]]
After the death of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] in 1970, [[Anwar Sadat]] assumed the presidency of . Sadat consolidated his power by marginalising Nasserist and leftist factions, while controlling opposition both secular and religious. He shifted 's Cold War alignment from the Soviet Union to the , expelling Soviet advisors in 1972, and renamed the country the Arab Republic of  in 1971. Sadat launched the [[Infitah]] ("open door") economic reforms. Some measures of this economic liberalization caused social tensions, most notably the removal of food subsidies in 1977 which sparked widespread [[1977  bread riots|bread riots]].
[[File:Begin, Carter and Sadat at Camp David 1978.jpg|thumb|Celebrating the signing of the 1978 [[Camp David Accords]]: [[Menachem Begin]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Anwar Sadat]]]]
In 1973, Sadat coordinated with  in the [[Fourth Arab- War]] to reclaim the [[Sinai Peninsula]] from  occupation. Though militarily mixed, the war restored Arab morale and strengthened Sadat's domestic legitimacy. His historic 1977 visit to Jerusalem led to the 1979 [[– peace treaty|- peace treaty]], with  withdrawing from Sinai and  recognizing  as a sovereign state. This initiative provoked widespread controversy across the Arab world, resulting in 's temporary expulsion from the [[Arab League]], but remained popular domestically. Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by an Islamic extremist opposed to his domestic policies and peace initiative.
[[File:Hosni Mubarak - Official Photo.JPG|left|thumb|222x222px|[[Hosni Mubarak]], president of  from 1981 to 2011]]
[[Hosni Mubarak]] succeeded Sadat in a 1981 referendum in which he was the sole candidate. He maintained 's peace treaty with  and improved relations with Arab neighbors. Domestically, he faced widespread poverty, high unemployment, and urban overcrowding. The 1986 Security Police riots, sparked by reports of extended military service, led to violent protests, destruction of businesses, and 107 deaths.

Terrorist attacks, particularly by Islamist groups like [[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]], targeted government officials, foreigners, and Christian [[Copts]], devastating tourism, 's primary source of hard currency. The political scene was dominated by the [[National Democratic Party ()|NDP]], which curtailed freedoms of association, expression, and political participation through laws such as the 1993 Syndicates Law, 1995 Press Law, and 1999 NGOs Law.
[[File:Cairo north.JPG|thumb|Cairo grew into a [[metropolitan area]] with a population of over 22 million.]]
In 1997, the [[Luxor massacre]] left 62 dead, mostly tourists, highlighting the continuing threat to security and the economy. In 2005, limited reforms allowed multi-candidate presidential elections, but restrictions on candidates and alleged government interference ensured Mubarak's easy reelection. Voter turnout was less than 25%, and opposition leader [[Ayman Nour]] was subsequently imprisoned.

[[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]] reported widespread human rights abuses, including torture, arbitrary detention, and the use of  as an international "torture hub" in the context of the [[war on terror]]. Constitutional changes in 2007 further expanded presidential powers, restricted religious parties, and broadened police authority.  remained under strong military influence, described by officials as a "pharaonic" system, with democracy as a distant aspiration.

On 25 January 2011, [[2011  revolution|widespread protests]] erupted against President Hosni Mubarak's government, triggered by demands for political freedom, social justice, and the end of long-standing corruption. Demonstrations rapidly spread across major cities, particularly in [[Cairo]]'s [[Tahrir Square]], capturing global attention. After 18 days of escalating unrest, Mubarak resigned on 11 February 2011 and fled Cairo. The [[ military]] assumed control, with [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]], chairman of the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]], acting as interim head of state. On 13 February, the military dissolved parliament and suspended the constitution. A constitutional referendum followed on 19 March 2011. Later that year,  held its first parliamentary elections since the previous regime, with high voter turnout and no major reported irregularities.

[[Mohamed Morsi]], affiliated with the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], won the [[2012  presidential election|presidency]] on 24 June 2012 and was sworn in on 30 June. His cabinet, announced in August 2012, included significant representation from the Muslim Brotherhood, prompting liberal and secular groups to withdraw from the [[Constituent Assembly of ]] over concerns of imposing strict Islamic law. In November 2012, Morsi issued a decree granting immunity to his decisions and protecting the constituent assembly's work, sparking [[2012–2013  protests|mass protests and violent clashes]] across the country. Tensions escalated, with the largest confrontations between Islamist supporters and opponents since the 2011 revolution occurring on 5 December 2012. Morsi refused to cancel the December 2012 [[2012  constitutional referendum|constitutional referendum]].

Following growing public discontent, the [[2013  coup d'état|military removed Morsi]] on 3 July 2013, dissolved the [[Senate ()|Shura Council]], and installed [[Adly Mansour]], chief justice of the [[Supreme Constitutional Court ()|Supreme Constitutional Court]], as interim president. Authorities cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood, jailing thousands and conducting mass trials. Violence during [[Rabaa massacre|dispersals of pro-Morsi camps]] left hundreds dead. A new [[Constitution of |constitution]] was approved by referendum on 18 January 2014 with 98.1% voting in favour.

[[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] won the [[2014  presidential election|presidential elections]] in June 2014 with 96.1% of the vote and was sworn in on 8 June. Under his rule,  intensified security on the Gaza border, dismantled tunnels between Sinai and Gaza, and consolidated political power. Presidential terms were extended to six years in 2019, allowing El-Sisi to run for a third term in 2024. Parliamentary elections in 2020 confirmed a pro-El-Sisi majority for the [[Nation's Future Party|Mostaqbal Watan Party]]. The constitutional reforms and strengthened military authority under El-Sisi have been described as a return to authoritarianism.

=== Early history ===
[[File:Prehistoric pottery shards, .jpg|thumb|Fragments of [[prehistoric]] pottery from [[Kamabai]] Rock Shelter]]

[[File: Bunce Island 1805.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bunce Island]], 1805, during the period the slave factory was run by [[Sir John Anderson, 1st Baronet, of Mill Hill|John]] and [[Alexander Anderson (slave trader)|Alexander Anderson]]]]'s history is marked by continuous human habitation for at least 2,500 years, influenced by migrations from across Africa. Iron technology had been adopted by the 9th century and agriculture established by 1000 AD along the coast. Climate shifts over centuries altered the ecological zones, influencing migration and conquest dynamics.

The region's dense [[tropical rainforest]] and swamps, coupled with the presence of the [[tsetse fly]] which carried a disease fatal to horses and the [[zebu]] cattle used by the [[Mande people|Mandé people]], provided natural defenses against invasions by the [[Mandinka Empire]] and other African empires, and limited influence by the [[ Empire]]. The introduction of [[Islam]] by [[Susu people|Susu]] traders, merchants and migrants in the 18th century further enriched the culture, eventually establishing a strong foothold in the north. The conquest by [[Samory Touré]] in the northeast solidified Islam among the [[Yalunka people|Yalunka]], [[Kuranko]] and [[Limba people ()|Limba]] people.

===European trading===

The 15th century marked the beginning of European interaction with , highlighted by  explorer [[Pedro de Sintra]] mapping the region in 1462 and naming it after the lioness mountains. This naming has been subject to historical reinterpretation, suggesting earlier European knowledge of the region. Following Sintra, European traders established fortified posts, engaging primarily in the [[History of slavery|slave trade]], which shaped the socio-economic landscape significantly.

Traders from European countries such as the [[ Republic]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of |]], started to establish trading stations. These stations quickly began to primarily deal in slaves, who were brought to the coast by indigenous traders from interior areas. The Europeans made payments, called ''Cole'', for rent, tribute, and trading rights, to the king of an area. Local Afro-European merchants often acted as middlemen, the Europeans advancing them goods to trade to indigenous merchants, most often for slaves and ivory.
[[File:, sapi, olifante, 1490-1510 ca.jpg|thumb|, sapi, olifante, 1490-1510 ca]]

===Early  interactions===
 traders were particularly drawn to the local craftsmanship in [[ivory]], leading to a notable trade in ivory artifacts such as horns, [[Sapi Saltceller]], and spoons. The Sapi people belonged to a cluster of people who spoke [[West Atlantic languages]], living in the region of modern day . There had already been a carving culture established in the area prior to  contact and many travelers to  initially impressed with their carving skills took local ivory horns back to Europe. [[File:DeliveryService-2.jpg|thumb|An Ivory Hunting Horn, Sapi people, Modern day Bullom or Temne People, , late 15th century]]

=== Black Poor of London ===
{{Main|Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor}}
[[File:Houses at Sierra-Leone (May 1853, X, p.55) - Copy.jpg|thumb|Houses at Sierra-Leone (May 1853, X, p. 55)]]
In the late 18th century, some African  who had fought for the [[ Crown]] during the [[ Revolutionary War]] were resettled in , forming a community named [[Black Loyalists]]. This resettlement scheme was partly motivated by social issues in London, with the  Resettlement Scheme offering a new beginning for the [[Black Poor]]. Many had been slaves who had escaped to join the , lured by promises of freedom ([[emancipation]]). Official documentation known as the ''[[Book of Negroes]]'' lists thousands of freed slaves whom the  evacuated from the nascent  and resettled in colonies elsewhere in [[ North America]].
Pro-slavery advocates accused the Black Poor of being responsible for a large proportion of crime in 18th-century London. While the broader community included some women, the Black Poor seems to have exclusively consisted of men, some of whom developed relationships with local women and often married them. On the voyage between [[Plymouth|Plymouth, England]] and , 29 European girlfriends and wives accompanied the [[Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor|Black Poor settlers]]. Many in London thought moving them to  would lift them out of poverty. The  Resettlement Scheme was proposed by entomologist [[Henry Smeathman]] and drew interest from humanitarians like [[Granville Sharp]], who saw it as a means of showing the pro-slavery lobby that black people could contribute towards the running of the new colony. Government officials soon became involved in the scheme as well, although their interest was spurred by the possibility of resettling a large group of poor citizens elsewhere. [[William Pitt the Younger]], prime minister and leader of the Tory party, had an active interest in the Scheme because he saw it as a means to repatriate the Black Poor to Africa.

In January 1787, the ''Atlantic'' and the ''Belisarius'' set sail for , but bad weather forced them to divert to Plymouth, during which time about 50 passengers died. Another 24 were discharged, and 23 ran away. Eventually, 411 passengers sailed to  in April 1787. On the voyage between Plymouth and , 96 passengers died. In 1787 the  Crown founded a settlement in  in what was called the "[[Province of Freedom]]". About 400 black and 60 white colonists reached  on 15 May 1787. After they established [[Granville Town]], most of the first group of colonists died, owing to disease and warfare with the indigenous African peoples ([[Temne people|Temne]]), who resisted their encroachment. When the ships left them in September, they had been reduced to "276 persons, namely 212 black men, 30 black women, 5 white men and 29 white women".

The settlers that remained forcibly captured land from a local African chieftain, but he retaliated, attacking the settlement, which was reduced to a mere 64 settlers comprising 39 black men, 19 black women, and six white women. Black settlers were captured by unscrupulous traders and sold as slaves, and the remaining colonists were forced to arm themselves for their own protection. The 64 remaining colonists established a second Granville Town.

=== Nova Scotians ===
{{Main|Nova Scotian Settlers}}

Following the  Revolution, some Black Loyalists from [[Nova Scotia]], , were relocated to , founding Freetown and contributing significantly to the [[Krio people]] and [[Krio language]] that would come to define the region.{{citation needed|date=April 2025}}

Following the [[ Revolution]], more than 3,000 Black Loyalists had also been settled in [[Nova Scotia]], but faced harsh winters and racial discrimination. [[Thomas Peters (black leader)|Thomas Peters]] pressed  authorities for relief and more aid; together with  abolitionist [[John Clarkson (abolitionist)|John Clarkson]], the [[ Company]] was established to relocate Black Loyalists who wanted to take their chances in West Africa. In 1792 nearly 1,200 persons from Nova Scotia crossed the Atlantic to build the second (and only permanent) Colony of  and the settlement of [[Freetown]] on 11 March 1792. In  they were called the [[Nova Scotian Settlers]], the ''Nova Scotians'', or the ''Settlers''. Clarkson initially banned the survivors of Granville Town from joining the new settlement, blaming them for the demise of Granville Town. The Settlers built Freetown in the styles they knew from their lives in the [[ South]]; they also continued  fashion and  manners. In addition, many continued to practise [[Methodism]].

In the 1790s, the Settlers, including adult women, voted for the first time in elections. In 1792, in a move that foreshadowed the women's suffrage movements in Britain, the heads of all households, of which a third were women, were given the right to vote. Black settlers in  enjoyed much more autonomy than their white equivalent in European countries. Black migrants elected different levels of political representatives, 'tithingmen', who represented each dozen settlers and 'hundreders' who represented larger amounts. This sort of representation was not available in Nova Scotia. The initial process of society-building in Freetown was a harsh struggle. The Crown did not supply enough basic supplies and provisions and the Settlers were continually threatened by illegal slave trading and the risk of re-enslavement.

===  Maroons and Liberated Africans ===
{{Main| Maroons in | Liberated Africans}}

The  Company, controlled by London investors, refused to allow the settlers to take [[fee simple|freehold]] of the land. In 1799 some of the settlers revolted. The Crown subdued the revolt by bringing in forces of more than 500&nbsp;[[ Maroons]], whom they transported from [[Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town)]] via Nova Scotia in 1800. Led by Colonel [[Montague James]], the Maroons helped the colonial forces to put down the revolt, and in the process the [[ Maroons in ]] secured the best houses and farms.

On 1 January 1808, [[Thomas Ludlam (colonial administrator)|Thomas Ludlam]], the Governor of the  Company and a leading abolitionist, surrendered the company's charter. This ended its 16&nbsp;years of running the Colony. The  Crown reorganised the  Company as the [[African Institution]]; it was directed to improve the local economy. Its members represented both  who hoped to inspire local entrepreneurs and those with interest in the Macauley & Babington Company, which held the () monopoly on  trade.

At about the same time (following the Slave Trade Act 1807 which abolished the slave trade), Royal Navy crews delivered thousands of formerly enslaved Africans to Freetown, after liberating them from illegal slave ships. These [[recaptives|Liberated Africans]] or ''recaptives'' were sold for $20 a head as apprentices to the white settlers, Nova Scotian Settlers, and the  Maroons. Many Liberated Africans were treated poorly and even abused because some of the original settlers considered them their property. Cut off from their various homelands and traditions, the Liberated Africans were forced to assimilate to the Western styles of Settlers and Maroons. The Liberated Africans eventually modified their customs to adopt those of the Nova Scotians, Maroons and Europeans, yet kept some of their ethnic traditions. As the Liberated Africans became successful traders and spread Christianity throughout West Africa, they intermarried with the Nova Scotians and Maroons.{{rp|3–4, 223–255}}

These [[Liberated Africans in |Liberated Africans]] were from many areas of Africa, but principally the west coast. Between the 18th and 19th century, freed African , some [[Americo ]] "refugees", and particularly [[Afro-Caribbean]]s, mainly  Maroons, also immigrated and settled in Freetown. Together these peoples formed the [[ Creole|Creole/Krio ethnicity]] and an [[-based creole languages|-based creole]] language ([[Krio language|Krio]]), which is the [[lingua franca]].

=== Colonial era (1808–1961) ===
{{Main| Colony and Protectorate}}

The colonial era saw  evolving under  rule.  developed as an educational center in West Africa, with the establishment of [[Fourah Bay College]] in 1827, attracting -speaking Africans from across the region.

The settlement of  in the 1800s was unique in that the population was composed of displaced Africans, brought to the colony after the  [[abolition of the slave trade]] in 1807. Upon arrival in , each ''recaptive'' was given a registration number, and information on their physical qualities was entered into the Register of Liberated Africans. Documentation was often subjective, resulting in inaccurate entries, making them difficult to track.

The first missionaries, [[Peter Hartwig (missionary)|Peter Hartwig]] and [[Melchior Renner]]from the [[Church Mission Society|Church Missionary Society]] (CMS), arrived in  in 1804. The CMS missionaries were to introduce Western ideals, including Western education and healthcare. One of their most significant contributions was the establishment of schools for West African children. European missionaries established these schools with an agenda to convert the native people to their religion, but the educational efforts did not relate to local needs.

In the early 19th century, Freetown served as the residence of the  colonial governor of the region, who also administered the [[Gold Coast ( colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[]]) and the [[Gambia]] settlements.  developed as the educational centre of [[ West Africa]]. The  established [[Fourah Bay College]] in 1827, which became a magnet for -speaking Africans on the West Coast. For more than a century, it was the only European-style university in west [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther]] was the first student to be enrolled. Fourah Bay College soon drew [[ Creole people|Creoles/Krio people]] and other Africans seeking higher education in  West Africa. These included , , Ivorians, and others, especially in the fields of [[theology]] and education. Freetown was known as the "[[Athens]] of Africa" due to the number of excellent schools there and in surrounding areas.

In Freetown, the  interacted mostly with the Krio people, who did most of the trading with the indigenous peoples of the interior. Educated Krio people held many positions in the colonial government, giving them status and good pay. After the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884–85, the  decided to establish more dominion over the inland areas, to satisfy what the European powers called "effective occupation". In 1896 it annexed these areas, declaring them the  Protectorate. With this change, the  began to expand their administration in the region, recruiting  citizens to posts and pushing Krio people out of governmental positions and even Freetown's desirable residential areas.

[[Madam Yoko]] persuaded the  to give her control of the Kpaa Mende chiefdom. She used diplomacy to communicate with local chiefs who did not trust her friendship with the . Because Yoko supported the , some sub-chiefs rebelled, causing Yoko to take refuge in the police barracks. She ruled as a paramount chief in the new  Protectorate until 1906.

The  annexation of the Protectorate interfered with indigenous chiefs' sovereignty. They designated chiefs as units of local government, rather than dealing with them individually, as had been the previous practice. They did not maintain relationships even with longstanding allies, such as [[Bai Bureh]], who was later unfairly portrayed as a prime instigator of the [[Hut Tax War]].

In 1898, Colonel [[Frederic Cardew]], military governor of the Protectorate, imposed a new tax on dwellings and demanded that chiefs use their people to maintain roads. The taxes were often higher than the value of the dwellings, and 24 chiefs signed a petition to Cardew stating how destructive this was; their people could not afford to take time off from their subsistence agriculture. They resisted payment of taxes, and tension over the new colonial requirements and the administration's suspicion of the chiefs led to the Hut Tax War. The  fired first; the northern front of mainly Temne people was led by Bai Bureh. The southern front, consisting mostly of [[Mende people]], entered the conflict somewhat later, for other reasons.

For several months, Bureh's fighters had the advantage over the vastly more powerful  forces but both sides suffered hundreds of fatalities. Bureh surrendered on 11 November 1898 to end the destruction of his people's territory and dwellings. The  government recommended leniency, but Cardew insisted on sending the chief and two allies into exile in the Gold Coast; his government hanged 96 of the chief's warriors. Bureh was allowed to return in 1905, when he resumed his chieftaincy of Kasseh. The defeat of the Temne and Mende in the Hut Tax War ended mass resistance to the Protectorate and colonial government, but intermittent rioting and labour unrest continued throughout the colonial period. Riots in 1955 and 1956 involved tens of thousands of  in the Protectorate.

Domestic [[Slavery in Africa|slavery]], which continued to be practised by local African elites, was abolished in 1928. In 1935, a monopoly on mineral mining was granted to the [[ Selection Trust]], run by [[De Beers]]. The monopoly was scheduled to last 98 years. Mining of diamonds in the east and other minerals expanded, drawing labourers there from other parts of the country.

In 1924, the UK government divided the administration of  into Colony and Protectorate, with different political systems for each. The Colony was Freetown and its coastal area; the Protectorate was defined as the [[hinterland]] areas dominated by local chiefs. Antagonism between the two entities escalated to a heated debate in 1947, when proposals were introduced to provide for a single political system for both the Colony and the Protectorate. Most proposals came from leaders of the Protectorate, whose population far outnumbered the Colony's. The Krios, led by [[I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson|Isaac Wallace-Johnson]], opposed the proposals, as they would have reduced the Krios' political power in the Colony.

In 1951, [[Lamina Sankoh]] collaborated with educated Protectorate leaders to form the [[ People's Party]] (SLPP) as the party of the Protectorate. The SLPP leadership, led by Sir Milton Margai, negotiated with the  and the educated Krio-dominated colony based in Freetown to achieve independence. Under Margai, educated Protectorate elites were able to join forces with the [[paramount chiefs]] in the face of Krio intransigence. Later, Margai used the same skills to win over opposition leaders and moderate Krio elements to achieve independence from the UK.

In November 1951, Margai oversaw the drafting of a new constitution, which united the separate Colonial and Protectorate legislatures and provided a framework for [[decolonisation]]. In 1953,  was granted local ministerial powers and Margai was elected [[Chief Minister]] of . The new constitution ensured  had a parliamentary system within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In May 1957,  held its first parliamentary election. The SLPP won the most seats in Parliament and Margai was reelected as Chief Minister by a landslide.

=== Independence and post-independence era ===
On 27 April 1961, Margai led  to independence from Great Britain and became the country's first prime minister.  had its own parliament, its own prime minister, and the ability to make its own laws, but like countries such as  and ,  remained a "Dominion" and Queen Elizabeth was Queen of the independent [[ (1961–1971)|Dominion of ]]. The Dominion of  retained a parliamentary system of government and was a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The leader of the main opposition [[All People's Congress]] (APC), Siaka Stevens, along with Isaac Wallace-Johnson, another outspoken critic of the SLPP government, were arrested and placed under [[house arrest]] in Freetown.

In May 1962,  held its [[ general election, 1962|first general election]] as an independent state. The SLPP won a plurality of seats in parliament, and Margai was reelected as prime minister. Margai was popular among  during his time in power. He was not corrupt, nor did he make lavish displays of his power or status. He based the government on the [[rule of law]] and the separation of powers, with multiparty political institutions and fairly viable representative structures. Margai employed a brokerage style of politics, sharing power among political parties and interest groups, especially the powerful paramount chiefs in the provinces, most of whom were key allies of his government.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==== Albert Margai's tenure (1964–1967) ====
Upon Margai's unexpected death in 1964, his younger [[half-brother]], Sir Albert Margai, was appointed as prime minister by parliament. Sir Albert's leadership was briefly challenged by Foreign Minister John Karefa-Smart, who questioned his succession to the SLPP leadership position. But Karefa-Smart lacked broad support within the SLPP in his attempt to oust Albert as both the leader of the SLPP and prime minister. Soon after Albert Margai was sworn in as prime minister, he fired several senior government officials who had served in his brother's government, viewing them as a threat to his administration, including Karefa-Smart.

Sir Albert resorted to increasingly [[authoritarian]] actions in response to protests and enacted several laws against the opposition All People's Congress while attempting to establish a [[one-party state]]. He opposed to the colonial legacy of allowing executive powers to the Paramount Chiefs, many of whom had been his brother's allies. Accordingly, they began to consider Sir Albert a threat to the ruling houses across the country. Margai appointed many non-Creoles to the country's [[civil service]] in Freetown, in an overall diversification of the civil service, which had been dominated by Creoles. As a result, he became unpopular among Creoles, many of whom had supported Sir Milton. Margai sought to make the army homogeneously [[Mende people|Mende]], his own ethnic group, and was accused of favouring members of the Mende for prominent positions.

In 1967, riots broke out in Freetown against Margai's policies. In response, he declared a [[state of emergency]] across the country. He was accused of corruption and of a policy of [[affirmative action]] in favour of the Mende ethnic group. He also endeavoured to change  from a democracy to a [[one-party state]].

==== 1967 General Election and military coups (1967–1968) ====
The APC, with its leader [[Siaka Stevens]], narrowly won a small majority of seats in Parliament over the SLPP in a closely contested [[ general election, 1967|1967 general election]]. Stevens was sworn in as prime minister on 21 March 1967.

Within hours of taking office, Stevens was ousted in a bloodless [[1967  coups d'état|military coup]] led by [[Brigadier General]] [[David Lansana]], the commander of the [[Republic of  Armed Forces| Armed Forces]]. He was a close ally of Albert Margai, who had appointed him to the position in 1964. Lansana placed Stevens under [[house arrest]] in Freetown and insisted that the determination of the Prime Minister should await the election of the tribal representatives to the House. Stevens was later freed and fled the country, going into exile in neighbouring . On 23 March 1967, a group of military officers in the  Army led by Brigadier General [[Andrew Juxon-Smith]] staged a counter-coup against Lansana. They seized control of the government, arrested Lansana, and suspended the constitution. The group set up the [[National Reformation Council]] (NRC), with Juxon-Smith as its chairman and Head of State of the country.

On 18 April 1968 a group of low-ranking soldiers in the  Army who called themselves the Anti-Corruption Revolutionary Movement (ACRM), led by Brigadier General [[John Amadu Bangura]], [[Sergeants' Coup ()|overthrew]] the NRC [[Military junta|junta]]. The ACRM arrested many senior NRC members. They reinstated the constitution and returned power to Stevens, who at last assumed the office of prime minister.

Stevens had Bangura arrested in 1970 and charged with conspiracy and treason. He was found guilty and sentenced to death, even though his actions had led to Stevens's return to power. Lansana and [[Samuel Hinga Norman|Hinga Norman]], the main army officers involved in the first coup (1967), were unceremoniously dismissed from the armed forces and made to serve time in prison. Norman was a guard to [[Governor-general]] [[Henry Josiah Lightfoot Boston|Sir Henry Lightfoot-Boston]]. Lansana was tried, found guilty of treason, and sentenced to death in 1975.

==== One-party state and dawn of the 'Republic' (1968–1991) ====
[[File: All People's Congress political rally  1968.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An [[All People's Congress|APC]] political rally in the northern town of [[Kabala, |Kabala]] outside the home of supporters of the rival [[ People's Party|SLPP]] in 1968]]

Stevens assumed power as prime minister again in 1968, following a series of coups. He had campaigned on a platform of socialist principles, but abandoned them and employed an authoritarian government. During his first decade or so in power, Stevens renegotiated some of what he called "useless prefinanced schemes" contracted by his predecessors Albert Margai of the SLPP and Juxon-Smith of the NRC. Some of these policies were said to have left the country economically deprived.

Stevens reorganised the country's oil refinery, the government-owned Cape Sierra Hotel, and a cement factory. He began efforts that later improved transportation and movement between the provinces and Freetown. Roads and hospitals were constructed in the provinces, and Paramount Chiefs and provincial peoples became a prominent force in Freetown. Under the pressure of several coup attempts, real or perceived, Stevens's rule grew increasingly authoritarian, and his relationship with some of his supporters deteriorated. He removed the SLPP from competitive politics in general elections, some believed, through violence and intimidation. To maintain the support of the military, Stevens retained the popular John Amadu Bangura as head of the  Armed Forces.

After the return to civilian rule, [[by-election]]s were held (beginning in autumn 1968) and an all-APC cabinet was appointed. In November 1968, unrest in the provinces led Stevens to declare a state of emergency across the country. Many senior officers in the  Army were greatly disappointed with Stevens's policies and his handling of the  Military, but none could confront him. Brigadier General Bangura, who had reinstated Stevens as prime minister, was widely considered the only person who could control Stevens. The army was devoted to Bangura. In January 1970, Bangura was arrested and charged with [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] and plotting to commit a coup against the Stevens government. After a trial that lasted a few months, Bangura was convicted; on 29 March 1970, he was executed by hanging in Freetown.

After Bangura's execution, a group of soldiers loyal to him mutinied in Freetown and other parts of the country in opposition to Stevens's government. Dozens of soldiers were arrested and convicted by a [[court martial]] in Freetown for their participation in the mutiny. Among the soldiers arrested was a little-known army [[corporal]], [[Foday Sankoh]], a strong Bangura supporter, who later formed the [[Revolutionary United Front|Revolutionary United Front (RUF)]]. Sankoh was convicted and jailed for seven years at Pademba Road Prison in Freetown.

In April 1971, a new republican constitution was adopted under which Stevens became president. In the 1972 by-elections, the opposition SLPP complained of intimidation and procedural obstruction by the APC and militia. These problems became so severe that the SLPP boycotted the [[ general election, 1973|1973 general election]]; as a result, the APC won 84 of the 85 elected seats.

An alleged plot to overthrow President Stevens failed in 1974 and its leaders were executed. In mid-1974,  soldiers, as requested by Stevens, were stationed in the country to help maintain his hold on power, as Stevens was a close ally of then- president [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]]. In March 1976, Stevens was elected without opposition to a second five-year term as president. On 19 July 1975, 14 senior army and government officials were executed after being convicted of attempting a coup to topple Stevens's government.

In 1977, a nationwide student demonstration against the government disrupted 's politics. The demonstration was quickly put down by the army and Stevens's personal Special Security Division (SSD), a heavily armed paramilitary force he had created to protect him and maintain his hold on power. SSD officers were loyal to Stevens and were deployed across the country to clamp down on any rebellion or protest against his government. [[ parliamentary election, 1977|A general election]] was called later that year in which corruption was again endemic; the APC won 74 seats and the SLPP 15. In 1978, the APC-dominant parliament approved a new constitution making the country a one-party state. The 1978 constitution made the APC the only legal political party in . This move led to another major demonstration against the government in many parts of the country, which was also put down by the army and the SSD force.

Stevens is generally criticised for dictatorial methods and government corruption, but he kept the country stable and from collapsing into civil war. He created government institutions still in use. Stevens reduced ethnic polarisation in government by incorporating members of various ethnic groups into his all-dominant APC government.

Stevens retired from politics in November 1985. The APC named a new presidential candidate, [[Major General]] [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], head of the  Armed Forces. Momoh had been loyal to Stevens, who had appointed him to the position. Like Stevens, Momoh was a member of the minority [[Limba people ()|Limba]] ethnic group. As the sole candidate, Momoh was elected president without opposition and sworn in as 's second president on 28 November 1985 in Freetown. President Momoh appointed his former military colleague and key ally, Major General Mohamed Tarawalie, to succeed him as head of the  Military. Momoh named James Bambay Kamara head of the [[ Police]]. Bambay Kamara was also a strong Momoh loyalist and supporter. Momoh broke from Stevens by integrating the SSD into the  Police as a special [[paramilitary force]]. Under Stevens, the SSD had been a personal force used to maintain his hold on power, independent from the  Military and  Police Force. The  Police under Bambay Kamara's leadership was accused of physical violence, arrest, and intimidation against critics of Momoh's government.

Momoh's strong links with the army and verbal attacks on corruption earned him initial support among . With the lack of new faces in the APC cabinet under Momoh and the return of many from Stevens's government, criticisms soon arose that Momoh was simply perpetuating the rule of Stevens.

The next few years under the Momoh administration were characterised by corruption, which Momoh defused by sacking several senior cabinet ministers. To formalise his war against corruption, Momoh announced a "Code of Conduct for Political Leaders and Public Servants". After an alleged attempt to overthrow Momoh in March 1987, more than 60 senior government officials were arrested, including Vice-President [[Francis Minah]], who was convicted of plotting the coup and executed by hanging in 1989.

===  Civil War (1991–2002) and the NPRC regime (1992–1996) ===

{{Further| Civil War}}The brutal civil war significantly impacted , with internal and external factors contributing to widespread violence. International interventions, notably by the  and the United Nations, were crucial in restoring peace.[[File: School destroyed by  Civil War.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A school in [[Koindu]] destroyed during the [[ Civil War|Civil War]]; in total 1,270 primary schools were destroyed in the War.]]

In October 1990, owing to mounting pressure from both within and outside the country for political and economic reforms, Momoh set up a constitutional review commission to assess the 1978 one-party constitution. Based on the commission's recommendations, a constitution reestablishing a multi-party system was approved by the exclusive APC Parliament by a 60% majority vote, becoming effective on 1 October 1991. It was widely suspected that Momoh was not serious about political reform, as APC rule was increasingly marked by abuses of power.

The brutal civil war in neighbouring [[]] played a significant role in the outbreak of fighting in . [[Charles Taylor ()|Charles Taylor]], then leader of the [[National Patriotic Front of ]], reportedly helped form the [[Revolutionary United Front|Revolutionary United Front (RUF)]] under the command of former  army [[corporal]] [[Foday Sankoh|Foday Saybana Sankoh]], an ethnic Temne from [[Tonkolili District]] in Northern . Taylor's aim was for the RUF to attack the bases of -dominated peacekeeping troops in  who opposed his rebel movement in .

On 29 April 1992, a group of young soldiers in the  Army, led by seven army officers—Lieutenant Sahr Sandy, Captain Valentine Strasser, [[Solomon Musa|Lieutenant Solomon "SAJ" Musa]], Captain [[Komba Mondeh]], Lieutenant [[Tom Nyuma]], Captain Julius Maada Bio and Captain Komba Kambo—staged a [[military coup]] that sent Momoh into exile in , and the soldiers established the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC), with 25-year-old Captain Valentine Strasser as its chairman and Head of State of the country. The NPRC junta immediately suspended the constitution, banned all political parties, limited [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]], and enacted a rule-by-decree policy, in which soldiers were granted unlimited powers of administrative detention without charge or trial, and challenges against such detentions in court were precluded.

SAJ Musa, a childhood friend of Strasser, became the deputy chairman and deputy leader of the NPRC government. Strasser became the world's youngest head of state when he seized power just three days after his 25th birthday. The NPRC established the National Supreme Council of State as the military highest command and final authority in all matters and was exclusively made up of the highest-ranking NPRC soldiers, including Strasser and the others who toppled Momoh.

One of the top-ranking soldiers in the NPRC junta, Lieutenant Sahr Sandy, a trusted ally of Strasser, was assassinated, allegedly by Major S.I.M. Turay, a key loyalist of Momoh. A heavily armed military manhunt was carried out across the country to find Sandy's killer. Turay, the main suspect, fled to . Dozens of soldiers loyal to Momoh were arrested, including Colonel Kahota M. Dumbuya and Major Yayah Turay.

The NPRC maintained relations with ECOWAS and strengthened support for -based ECOMOG troops fighting in the  war. On 28 December 1992, an alleged coup attempt against the NPRC government aimed at freeing the detained Colonel Yahya Kanu, Colonel [[Kahota M.S. Dumbuya]], and former inspector general of police Bambay Kamara, was foiled. Several Junior army officers led by Sergeant Mohamed Lamin Bangura were identified as being behind the coup plot. The coup plot led to the execution of 17 soldiers by firing squad. Some of those executed include Colonel Kahota Dumbuya, Major Yayah Kanu, and Sergeant Mohamed Lamin Bangura. Several prominent members of the Momoh government who had been in detention at the Pa Demba Road prison, including former inspector general of police Bambay Kamara, were also executed.

On 5 July 1994 SAJ Musa, who was popular among the general population, particularly in Freetown, was arrested and sent into exile after he was accused of planning a coup to topple Strasser, an accusation SAJ Musa denied. Strasser replaced Musa as deputy NPRC chairman with Captain Bio and instantly promoted him to [[brigadier]].

The NPRC's efforts proved nearly as ineffective as the Momoh administration in repelling the RUF rebels. More and more of the country fell into the RUF fighters' hands, and by 1994 they had gained control of much of the diamond-rich Eastern Province and were getting close to Freetown. In response, the NPRC hired several hundred mercenary fighters from [[]]-based [[private military contractor]] [[Executive Outcomes]] to strengthen the response to RUF rebels. Within a month, they drove the RUF fighters back to enclaves along 's borders and cleared the RUF from the Kono diamond-producing areas of .

With Strasser's two most senior NPRC allies and commanders Lieutenant Sahr Sandy and Lieutenant [[Solomon Musa]] no longer around to defend him, Strasser's leadership within the NPRC's Supreme Council of State became fragile. On 16 January 1996, after about four years in power, Strasser was arrested in a palace coup staged by his fellow NPRC soldiers led by Brigadier Bio at the Defence Headquarters in Freetown. Strasser was immediately flown into exile in a [[military helicopter]] to [[Conakry]], [[]]. In his first public broadcast to the nation after the 1996 coup, Brigadier Bio said that returning  to a democratically elected civilian government and ending the civil war were his motivations for the coup.

==== Kabbah's tenure: government, "dawn of a new republic", the AFRC and end of the Civil War (1996–2007) ====
Following the 1995 National Consultative Conference at the Bintumani Hotel in Freetown, dubbed "Bintumani I", a Strasser-led initiative, the Bio administration initiated another National Consultative Conference at the same hotel, dubbed "Bintumani II". It involved both national and international stakeholders, in an effort to find a viable solution to the issues plaguing the country. "''Peace before Elections vs Elections before Peace''" became a key debate topic and this quickly became a point of national discussion. The discussions eventually concluded with key stakeholders, including Bio's administration and the UN, agreeing that while efforts in finding a peaceful solution to ending the war should continue, a general election should be held as soon as possible. Bio handed power over to Ahmad Tejan Kabbah of the SLPP, after the conclusion of elections in early 1996 which Kabbah won. After taking over, President Kabbah immediately opened [[dialogue]] with the RUF and invited their leader Foday Sankoh for peace negotiations.

On 25 May 1997, 17 soldiers in the  army led by Corporal Tamba Gborie, loyal to the detained Major [[Johnny Paul Koroma]], launched a military coup which sent President Kabbah into exile in  and they established the [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council]] (AFRC). Gborie quickly went to the  Broadcasting Services headquarters in New England, Freetown to announce the coup to a shocked nation and to alert all soldiers across the country to report for guard duty. The soldiers immediately released Koroma from prison and installed him as their chairman and Head of State.

Koroma suspended the constitution, banned demonstrations, shut down all private radio stations in the country and invited the RUF to join the new junta government, with its leader Foday Sankoh as the Vice-Chairman of the new AFRC-RUF coalition junta government. Within days, Freetown was overwhelmed by the presence of the RUF combatants. The Kamajors, a group of traditional fighters mostly from the Mende ethnic group under the command of deputy [[Defence Minister]] [[Samuel Hinga Norman]], remained loyal to President Kabbah and defended the Southern part of  from the soldiers.

After nine months in office, the junta was overthrown by the -led [[ECOMOG]] forces, and the democratically elected government of president Kabbah was reinstated in February 1998. On 19 October 1998, 24 soldiers in the  army—including Gborie, Brigadier Hassan Karim Conteh, Colonel Samuel Francis Koroma, Major Kula Samba and Colonel Abdul Karim Sesay—were executed by firing squad after they were convicted in a [[court martial]] in Freetown, some for orchestrating the 1997 coup that overthrew President Kabbah and others for failure to reverse the mutiny.

In October 1999, the United Nations agreed to send [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]] to help restore order and disarm the rebels. The first of the 6,000-member force began arriving in December, and the [[UN Security Council]] voted in February 2000 to increase the force to 11,000, and later to 13,000. But in May, when nearly all [[]]n forces had left and UN forces were trying to disarm the RUF in eastern , [[Foday Sankoh|Sankoh]]'s forces clashed with the UN troops, and some 500 peacekeepers were taken [[hostage]] as the peace accord effectively collapsed. The hostage crisis resulted in more fighting between the RUF and the government as UN troops launched [[Operation Khukri]] to end the siege.

The situation in the country deteriorated to such an extent that  troops were deployed in [[Operation Palliser]], originally simply to evacuate foreign nationals. But the  exceeded their original mandate and took full military action to defeat the rebels and restore order. The  were the catalyst for the ceasefire that ended the civil war. Elements of the [[ Army]], together with administrators and politicians, remained after withdrawal to help train the armed forces, improve the country's infrastructure, and administer financial and material aid. [[Tony Blair]], the Prime Minister of Britain at the time, is regarded as a hero by the people of .

Between 1991 and 2001, about [[List of wars by death toll|50,000 people were killed]] in 's civil war. Hundreds of thousands of people were forced from their homes and many became refugees in [[]] and [[]]. In 2001, UN forces moved into rebel-held areas and began to disarm rebel soldiers. By January 2002, the war was declared over. In May 2002, Kabbah was reelected president by a landslide. By 2004, the disarmament process was complete. Also in 2004, a UN-backed [[war crime]]s court began holding trials of senior leaders from both sides of the war. In December 2005, UN peacekeeping forces pulled out of .

's historical records start with [[clay tablets]] from approximately around 2000 BC that were found in modern-day [[Kültepe]]. These tablets belonged to an [[Karum (trade post)|Assyrian trade colony]]. The languages in  at that time included Hattian, Hurrian, [[Hittite language|Hittite]], [[Luwian language|Luwian]], and [[Palaic language|Palaic]]. [[Hattic language|Hattian]] was a language indigenous to , with no known modern-day connections. [[Hurrian language]] was used in northern [[]].

The [[Thracians]] were also present in modern-day [[ Thrace]]. It is not known if the [[Trojan War]] is based on historical events.

Around 750 BC, [[Phrygia]] had been established, with its two centers in [[Gordium]] and modern-day [[Kayseri]]. [[Phrygians]] spoke an Indo-European language, which was closer to [[ language|]] than Anatolian languages. Phrygians shared  with [[Neo-Hittite states|Neo-Hittites]] and [[Urartu]]. Luwian-speakers were probably the majority in various Anatolian Neo-Hittite states. Urartians spoke a non-Indo-European language and their capital was around [[Lake Van]]. Urartu and Phrygia fell in seventh century BC. They were replaced by [[Carians]], [[Lycians]] and [[Lydians]]. These three cultures "can be considered a reassertion of the ancient, indigenous culture of the Hattian cities of ".

Before 1200 BC, there were four -speaking settlements in , including [[Miletus]]. Around 1000 BC, [[Iron Age  migrations| started migrating]] to the west coast of . These eastern  settlements played a vital role in shaping the Archaic  civilization; important [[polis|cities]] included [[Miletus]], [[Ephesus]], [[Halicarnassus]], [[Smyrna]] (now [[İzmir]]) and [[Byzantium]] (now [[Istanbul]]), the latter founded by colonists from [[Megara]] in the seventh century BCE. These settlements were grouped as [[Aeolis]], [[Ionia]], and [[Doric hexapolis|Doris]], after the specific  groups that settled them. Further  colonization in  was led by Miletus and [[Megara]] in 750–480 BC. The  cities along the Aegean prospered with trade, and saw remarkable scientific and scholarly accomplishments. [[Thales of Miletus|Thales]] and [[Anaximander]] from Miletus founded the [[Ionian school (philosophy)|Ionian School of philosophy]], thereby laying the foundations of [[rationalism]] and [[Western philosophy]].

[[File:Ephesus_Celsus_Library_Façade.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Library of Celsus]] in [[Ephesus]] was built by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 114–117.]]

[[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] attacked eastern  in 547 BC, and [[Achaemenid Empire]] eventually [[Siege of Sardis (547 BC)|expanded into western ]]. In the east, the [[Satrapy of | province]] was part of the Achaemenid Empire. Following the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], the  city-states of the Anatolian Aegean coast regained independence, but most of the interior stayed part of the Achaemenid Empire. Two of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], the [[Temple of Artemis]] in Ephesus, and the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], were located in .

Following the victories of Alexander in [[Battle of the Granicus|334 BC]] and [[Battle of Issus|333 BC]], the Achaemenid Empire collapsed and  became part of the [[Macedon| Empire]]. This led to increasing cultural homogeneity and [[Hellenization]] of the Anatolian interior, which met resistance in some places. Following Alexander's death, the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] ruled large parts of , while native Anatolian states emerged in the Marmara and Black Sea areas. In eastern , [[Kingdom of  (antiquity)|the kingdom of ]] appeared. In third century BC, [[Celts]] invaded central  and continued as a major ethnic group in the area for around 200 years. They were known as the [[Galatians (people)|Galatians]].

When [[Kingdom of Pergamon|Pergamon]] requested assistance in its conflict with the Seleucids, [[Roman Republic|Rome]] intervened in  in the second century BC. Without an heir, Pergamum's king left the kingdom to Rome, which was annexed as [[Asia (Roman province)|province of Asia]]. Roman influence grew in  afterwards. Following [[Asiatic Vespers]] massacre, and [[Mithridatic Wars]] with [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]], Rome emerged victorious. Around the 1st century BC, [[Roman province|Rome expanded into parts of Pontus and Bithynia]], while turning rest of Anatolian states into Roman satellites. Several [[Roman–Parthian Wars|conflicts with Parthians ensued]], with peace and wars alternating.

According to [[Acts of the Apostles]], early Christian Church had significant growth in  because of [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]]'s efforts. Letters from St. Paul in  comprise the [[Early Christianity|oldest Christian literature]]. Under Roman authority, [[ecumenical councils]] such as [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea (Iznik)]] in 325 served as a guide for developing "orthodox expressions of basic Christian teachings".

[[File:Aya_Sophia_(7144824757).jpg|thumb|The [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]) was built by the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] emperor [[Justinian the Great]] in 532–537.]]
The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the [[Roman Empire]] centered in [[Constantinople]] during [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]]. The eastern half of the Empire survived the conditions that caused the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of the West]] in the 5th century AD, and continued to exist until the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire remained the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in the [[Mediterranean world]]. The term ''Byzantine Empire'' was only coined following the empire's demise; its citizens referred to the polity as the "Roman Empire" and to themselves as ''Romans''. Due to the imperial seat's move from Rome to [[Byzantium]], the [[Christianity as the Roman state religion|adoption of Christianity as the state religion]], and the predominance of [[Medieval |]] instead of [[Latin]], modern historians continue to make a distinction between the earlier ''Roman Empire'' and the later ''Byzantine Empire''.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

In the early Byzantine Empire period, the Anatolian coastal areas were  speaking. In addition to natives, interior  had diverse groups such as [[Goths]], [[Celts]], [[Persians]] and [[History of the Jews in the Byzantine Empire|Jews]]. Interior  had been "heavily Hellenized". [[Anatolian languages]] eventually became extinct after [[Hellenization]] of .

According to historians and linguists, the [[Proto-Turkic language]] originated in Central-East Asia. Initially, Proto-[[Turkic languages|Turkic speakers]] were potentially both hunter-gatherers and farmers; they later became [[nomadic]] [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]]. Early and medieval [[Turkic peoples|Turkic groups]] exhibited a wide range of both East Asian and West-Eurasian physical appearances and genetic origins, in part through long-term contact with neighboring peoples such as [[ peoples|Iranic]], [[Mongolic peoples|Mongolic]], [[Tocharians|Tocharian]], [[Uralic people|Uralic]], and [[Yeniseian people|Yeniseian]] peoples. During the 9th and 10th centuries CE, [[Oghuz Turks|the Oghuz]] were a Turkic group that lived in the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe|Caspian]] and [[Aral Sea|Aral]] steppes. Partly due to pressure from the [[Kipchaks]], the Oghuz migrated into [[ Plateau|]] and [[Transoxiana]]. They mixed with Iranic-speaking groups in the area and converted to [[Islam]]. Oghuz Turks were also known as  or [[Turkoman (ethnonym)|Turkoman]].

The ruling family of [[Seljuq dynasty|the Seljuks]] originated from the ''[[Kınık (tribe)|Kınık]]'' branch of the Oghuz Turks. In 1040, the Seljuks defeated the [[Ghaznavids]] at the [[Battle of Dandanaqan]] and established the [[Seljuk Empire]] in [[Greater Khorasan]]. [[Baghdad]], the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]'s capital and center of [[Islamic Golden Age|the Islamic world]], was taken by Seljuks in 1055. Given the role [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasani]] traditions played in art, culture, and political traditions in the empire, the Seljuk period is described as a mixture of "[[Turko-Persian tradition|, Persian and Islamic influences]]". In the latter half of the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks began penetrating into [[medieval ]] and . At the time,  was a diverse and largely -speaking region after previously being [[Hellenization|Hellenized]].

The Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantines at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, and later established [[Sultanate of Rum|the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]]. During this period, there were also [[Anatolian beyliks| principalities]] such as [[Danishmendids]]. Seljuk arrival started the [[Turkification]] process in ; there were Turkic/ migrations, intermarriages, and conversions into Islam. The shift took several centuries and happened gradually. Members of [[Mysticism#Islamic mysticism|Islamic mysticism]] orders, such as [[Mevlevi Order]], played a role in the [[Islamization]] of the diverse people of . Seljuk expansion was one of the reasons for the [[Crusades]]. In 13th century, there was a second significant wave of Turkic migration, as people fled [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] expansion. Seljuk sultanate was defeated by the Mongols at the [[Battle of Köse Dağ]] in 1243 and disappeared by the beginning of the 14th century. It was replaced by various  principalities.

Based around [[Söğüt]], [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Beylik]] was founded by [[Osman I]] in the early 14th century. According to Ottoman chroniclers, Osman descended from the ''[[Kayı (tribe)|Kayı]]'' tribe of the [[Oghuz Turks]]. Ottomans started annexing the nearby  beyliks (principalities) in  and expanded into the [[Balkans]]. [[Mehmed II]] completed Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire by [[Fall of Constantinople|capturing its capital, Constantinople]], on 29 May 1453. [[Selim I]] united  under Ottoman rule. Turkification continued as Ottomans mixed with various indigenous people in  and the Balkans.

The Ottoman Empire was a global power during the reigns of [[Selim I]] and [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. In the 16th and 17th centuries, [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire|Sephardic Jews]] moved into Ottoman Empire following their [[Reconquista#Conversions and expulsions|expulsion]] from . From the second half of the 18th century onwards, the [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire began to decline]]. The [[Tanzimat]] reforms, initiated by [[Mahmud II]] in 1839, aimed to modernize the Ottoman state in line with the progress that had been made in Western Europe. The [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]] was the first among Muslim states, but was [[First Constitutional Era|short-lived]].

As the empire gradually shrank in size, military power and wealth; especially after the [[Great Eastern Crisis|Ottoman economic crisis and default]] in 1875 which led to uprisings in the Balkan provinces that culminated in the [[Russo- War (1877–1878)]]. The decline of the Ottoman Empire led to a [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|rise in nationalist sentiment among its various subject peoples]], leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence, such as the [[Hamidian massacres]] of [[ in the Ottoman Empire|]], which claimed up to 300,000 lives.{{Better source needed|reason=some of this information is not in the source|date=November 2024}} Ottoman territories in Europe ([[Rumelia]]) were lost in the [[First Balkan War]] (1912–1913). Ottomans managed to recover some territory in Europe, such as [[Edirne]], in the [[Second Balkan War]] (1913).

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, [[persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction]] and [[Persecution of Muslims# Empire|in the  Empire]] resulted in estimated 5 million deaths, with the casualties including Turks. Five to seven or seven to nine million [[Muhacir|refugees]] migrated into modern-day  from the [[Balkans]], [[Caucasus]], [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea]], and [[Mediterranean]] islands, shifting the center of the Ottoman Empire to . In addition to a small number of Jews, the refugees were overwhelmingly Muslim; they were both  and non- people, such as [[Circassians]] and [[Crimean Tatars]]. [[Paul Mojzes]] has called the Balkan Wars an "unrecognized genocide", where multiple sides were both victims and perpetrators. Circassian refugees included the survivors of the [[Circassian genocide]].

Following the [[1913 Ottoman coup d'état|1913 coup d'état]], the [[Three Pashas]] took control of the Ottoman government. The Ottoman Empire entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and was ultimately defeated. During the war, the empire's  subjects were [[Temporary Law of Deportation|deported to ]] as part of the [[ genocide]]. As a result, an estimated 600,000 to more than 1 million, or up to 1.5 million [[ in the Ottoman Empire|]] were killed. The  government has [[ genocide denial|refused to acknowledge]] the events as genocide and states that  were only [[Population transfer|"relocated]]" from the eastern war zone. [[Late Ottoman genocides|Genocidal campaigns]] were also committed against the empire's other minority groups such as the [[Assyrian genocide|Assyrians]] and [[ genocide|]]. Following the [[Armistice of Mudros]] in 1918, the victorious [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] sought the [[partition of the Ottoman Empire]] through the 1920 [[Treaty of Sèvres]].

The [[occupation of Istanbul]] (1918) and [[Occupation of Smyrna|İzmir]] (1919) by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in the aftermath of World War I initiated the [[ National Movement]]. Under the leadership of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal Pasha]], a military commander who had distinguished himself during the [[Gallipoli campaign|Battle of Gallipoli]], the [[ War of Independence]] (1919–1923) was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] (1920).

The [[Government of the Grand National Assembly| Provisional Government]] in [[Ankara]], which had declared itself the legitimate government of the country on [[Grand National Assembly of |23 April 1920]], started to formalize the legal transition from the old Ottoman into the new Republican political system. The Ankara Government engaged in armed and diplomatic struggle. In 1921–1923, the , , , and  armies had been expelled. The military advance and diplomatic success of the Ankara Government resulted in the signing of the [[Armistice of Mudanya]] on 11 October 1922. On 1 November 1922, the  Parliament in Ankara formally abolished the Sultanate, thus ending 623 years of [[monarchy|monarchical]] Ottoman rule.

The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] of 24 July 1923, which superseded the Treaty of Sèvres, led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the new  state as the successor state of the Ottoman Empire. On 4 October 1923, the Allied occupation of  ended with the withdrawal of the last Allied troops from [[Occupation of Istanbul|Istanbul]].

Mustafa Kemal became the republic's first [[President of |president]] and introduced [[Atatürk's reforms|many reforms]]. The reforms aimed to transform the old [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|religion-based and multi-communal]] Ottoman monarchy into a  [[nation state]] that would be governed as a [[parliamentary republic]] under a [[ Constitution of 1924|secular constitution]]. Women gained the right to vote nationally in 1934.

Cultures in the region have been dated back to at least the fourth millennium BC, including the [[Bronze Age]] [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex]], the [[Andronovo culture|Andronovo]] cultures and the [[Sarazm|pro-urban site of Sarazm]], a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].

The earliest recorded history of the region dates back to about 500 BC when most, if not all, of  was part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Some authors have suggested that in the seventh and sixth centuries BC parts of , including territories in the Zeravshan valley, formed part of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Kambojas]] tribe before it became part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].
After the region's conquest by [[Alexander the Great]] it became part of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], a successor state of Alexander's empire. Northern  (the cities of [[Khujand]] and [[Panjakent]]) was part of [[Sogdia]], a collection of city-states which was overrun by [[Scytho-Siberians]] and [[Yuezhi]] nomadic tribes around 150 BC. The [[Silk Road]] passed through the region and following the expedition of  explorer [[Zhang Qian]] during the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han|Wudi]] (141 BC–87 BC) commercial relations between [[Han Empire]] and Sogdiana flourished. Sogdians played a role in facilitating trade and worked in other capacities, as farmers, carpetweavers, glassmakers, and woodcarvers.<!--an unsourced  assertion? However, the Sogdian traders were then still less important in the Silk Road trade than their southern neighbors,  and Bactrians.-->

The [[Kushan Empire]], a collection of [[Yuezhi]] tribes, took control of the region in the first century AD and ruled until the fourth century AD during which time [[Buddhism]], [[Nestorian Christianity]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and [[Manichaeism]] were practised in the region. Later the [[Hephthalite Empire]], a collection of nomadic tribes, moved into the region, and the [[Arabs]] [[Spread of Islam|disseminated Islam]] in the eighth century.

The [[Samanids|Samanid Empire]], 819 to 999, restored [[Persian people|Persian]] control of the region and enlarged the cities of [[Samarkand]] and [[Bukhara]], which became the cultural centres of [[]]; the region was known as Khorasan. The empire was centred in Khorasan and Transoxiana, at its greatest extent encompassing , parts of , , , , , parts of , and .

Four brothers Nuh, Ahmad, Yahya, and Ilyas founded the Samanid state. Each of them ruled territory under [[Abbasid]] suzerainty. In 892, [[Ismail Samani]] (892–907) united the Samanid state under one ruler, thus putting an end to the feudal system used by the Samanids. It was under him that the Samanids became independent of Abbasid authority.

The [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] conquered [[Transoxania]] (which corresponded approximately with what later would be , , southern , and southwest ) and ruled between 999 and 1211. Their arrival in Transoxania signalled a definitive shift from  to Turkic predominance in Central Asia, and gradually the Kara-khanids became assimilated into the Perso-Arab Muslim culture of the region.

In the 13th century, the [[Mongol Empire]] swept through Central Asia, invaded the [[Khwarezmian Empire]] and sacked its cities, looting and massacring people. [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turco-Mongol]] conqueror [[Timur|Tamerlane]] founded the [[Timurid Empire]], becoming the first ruler of the [[Timurid dynasty]] in and around what later became  and Central Asia.

During the 19th century, the [[Jadid]]ists established themselves as an Islamic social movement throughout the region. While the Jadidists were pro-modernisation and not necessarily anti-, the  viewed the movement as a threat because the  Empire was predominantly Christian.  troops were required to restore order during uprisings against the Khanate of Kokand between 1910 and 1913. Further violence occurred in July 1916 when demonstrators attacked  soldiers in [[Khujand]] over the threat of forced [[conscription]] during [[World War I]]. While  troops brought Khujand back under control, clashes continued throughout the year in various locations in .


=== Soviet period ===

After the [[ Revolution]] of 1917 guerrillas throughout Central Asia, known as ''[[basmachi]]'', waged [[Kokand Autonomy|a war]] against [[Bolshevik]] armies in an attempt to maintain independence. The Bolsheviks prevailed after a four-year war, in which [[mosque]]s and villages were burned down and the population suppressed.

Between 1928 and 1941, Soviet authorities started an [[USSR anti-religious campaign (1928–1941)|anti-religious campaign]] of [[secularization|secularisation]]. Practising [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], or [[Judaism]] was discouraged and repressed; due to the [[Soviet anti-religious legislation]], several [[Church (building)|churches]], [[mosque]]s, and [[synagogue]]s were closed. As a consequence of the conflict and Soviet agriculture policies, [[Central Asia]],  included, underwent a famine that claimed lives.

 was first created in 1924 as the [[ Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] (abbrievated  ASSR), an autonomous republic within the [[ Soviet Socialist Republic]].{{sfn|Heathershaw|Herzig|2013|p=1}} Despite their historical status as  cities and mostly being populated by , none of the regional urban centres—such as [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]], [[Tirmiz]], [[Qarshi]], and [[Khojand]]—were included in . Instead, the Tajikistani capital was established in [[Dushanbe]], a mountain town with approximately 1,000 residents.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=119}}

A specific Persian dialect, with vocabulary and pronunciation different from formal written Persian, was deliberately made the national language of  by the Soviets and renamed "Tajiki" to forcibly separate it from the common variant of Persian spoken from [[Istanbul]] to [[Calcutta]]. The  were also excluded from the enormous global world of Persian literature, both past and current, by the creation of a new phonetic alphabet, first Latin-based in 1928 and later Cyrillic in 1940.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=118}} With Persian confined to  and replaced by  as Central Asia's common language, the unity of the [[Persianate]] world was broken, steering Soviet and post-Soviet Central Asia onto a developmental path distinct from  and .{{sfn|Arjomand|2025|p=344}} In 1929, the  ASSR was elevated to its own full [[Republics of the Soviet Union|union republic]], the [[ Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The [[Sughd Region]] was added to  in the same year.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=120}}

Between 1927 and 1934, [[collectivization of agriculture|collectivisation of agriculture]] and an expansion of cotton production took place, especially in the southern region. Soviet collectivization policy brought violence against farmers and peasants, classified as [[anti-Soviet]] categories of "[[enemies of the people]]", and [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|forced resettlement]] occurred throughout . Consequently, some peasants fought collectivisation and revived the [[Basmachi movement]]. Some industrial development occurred during this time along with the expansion of irrigation infrastructure.

Two rounds of [[Great Purge|Stalin's purges]] (1927–1934 and 1937–1938) resulted in the expulsion of nearly 10,000 people from all levels of the [[Communist Party of ]]. Ethnic [[]] were sent in to replace those expelled and subsequently  dominated party positions at all levels, including the top position of first secretary. Between 1926 and 1959 the proportion of  among 's population grew from less than 1% to 13%. [[Bobojon Ghafurov]], [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of ]] from 1946 to 1956, was the only  politician of significance outside of the republic during the Soviet Era.

 began to be conscripted into the [[Red Army]] in 1939 and during [[World War II]] around 260,000  citizens fought against [[Nazi ]], [[ in World War II|]], and the [[Empire of ]]. Between 60,000 (4%) and 120,000 (8%) of 's 1,530,000 citizens were killed during World War II.

Following the war and the end of Stalin's reign, attempts were made to further expand the agriculture and industry of . During 1957–58 [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[Virgin Lands Campaign]] focused attention on , where living conditions, education and industry lagged behind the other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]]. In the 1980s,  had the lowest household saving rate in the USSR, the lowest percentage of households in the two top per capita income groups, and the lowest rate of university graduates per 1000 people.

By the 1980s  nationalists were calling for increased rights. Real disturbances did not occur within the republic until 1990. The following year, the [[Soviet Union]] collapsed, and  declared its independence on 9 September 1991, a day which is celebrated as the country's [[Independence Day ()|Independence Day]].

In February 1990, [[1990 Dushanbe riots|riots and strikes]] in [[Dushanbe]] and other cities began due to the difficult socio-economic situation, lack of housing, and youth unemployment. The nationalist and democratic opposition and supporters of independence joined the strikes and began to demand the independence of the republic and democratic reforms. [[Islamism|Islamists]] began to hold strikes to demand respect for their rights and independence. The Soviet leadership introduced Internal Troops in Dushanbe to eliminate the unrest.

Following independence, the nation fell into [[Tajikistani Civil War|civil war]] among factions distinguished by clan loyalties. Regional groups from the [[Gharm]] and [[Gorno-Badakhshan]] regions of , led by a combination of [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] reformers and [[Islamists]], who eventually became the [[United  Opposition]], rose up against the newly formed government of President [[Rahmon Nabiyev]], which was dominated by people from the [[Khujand]] and [[Kulob]] regions.

The war lasted until 1997. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution and increased poverty, seeking better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were [[refugee]]s inside and outside of the country.

[[Emomali Rahmon]] came to power in the early part of this conflict in 1992, after Nabiyev was forced at gunpoint on 7 September 1992 to resign from office. Rahmon defeated former prime minister [[Abdumalik Abdullajanov]] in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote.

In 1997, a [[ceasefire]] was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result praised as a successful United Nations peacekeeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the [[United  Opposition|opposition]]. [[Tajikistani presidential election, 1999|Elections]] were held in 1999 and were criticised by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair; Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. [[ presidential election, 2006|Elections in 2006]] were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) criticised it, while observers from the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] claimed the elections were legal and transparent.

Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. OSCE claimed that the  Government censored  and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.

== History ==
{{Main|History of |Ruanda-Urundi}}
 is one of the few countries in Africa, along with its neighbour  among others (such as [[]], [[]], and [[]]), to be a direct territorial continuation of a pre-colonial era African state. The early history of , and especially the role and nature of the country's three dominant ethnic groups, the Twa, Hutu and Tutsi, is highly debated amongst academics.

===Kingdom of ===
{{Main|Kingdom of }}
The first evidence of the  state dates back to the late 16th century where it emerged on the eastern foothills. Over the following centuries it expanded, annexing smaller neighbours. The Kingdom of  or Urundi, in the Great Lakes region was a polity ruled by a traditional monarch with several princes beneath him; succession struggles were common. The king, known as the ''mwami'' (translated as ruler) headed a princely aristocracy (''ganwa'') which owned most of the land and required a tribute, or tax, from local farmers (mainly Hutu) and herders (mainly Tutsi). The Kingdom of  was characterised by a hierarchical political authority and tributary economic exchange.

In the mid-18th century, the Tutsi royalty consolidated authority over land, production, and distribution with the development of the ubugabire—a patron-client relationship in which the populace received royal protection in exchange for tribute and land tenure. By this time, the royal court was made up of the Tutsi-Banyaruguru. They had higher social status than other pastoralists such as the Tutsi-Hima. In the lower levels of this society were generally Hutu people, and at the very bottom of the pyramid were the Twa. The system had some fluidity, however. Some Hutu people belonged to the nobility and in this way also had a say in the functioning of the state.

The classification of Hutu or Tutsi was not merely based on ethnic criteria alone. Hutu farmers that managed to acquire wealth and livestock were regularly granted the higher social status of Tutsi, some even made it to become close advisors of the ''Ganwa''. On the other hand, there are also reports of Tutsi that lost all their cattle and subsequently lost their higher status and were called Hutu. Thus, the distinction between Hutu and Tutsi was also a socio-cultural concept, instead of a purely ethnic one. There were also many reports of marriages between Hutu and Tutsi people. In general, regional ties and power struggles played a far more determining role in 's politics than ethnicity.

===Rule by  and ===
{{Main| East Africa|Ruanda-Urundi}}
From 1884, the [[ East Africa Company]] was active in the African Great Lakes region. As a result of heightened tensions and border disputes between the  East Africa Company, the [[ Empire]] and the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]], the [[ Empire]] was called upon to put down the [[Abushiri revolt]]s and protect the empire's interests in the region. The  East Africa Company transferred its rights to the  Empire in 1891, in this way establishing the  colony of [[ East Africa]], which included  (Urundi),  (Ruanda), and the mainland part of [[]] (formerly known as [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]]). The  Empire stationed armed forces in  and  during the late 1880s. The location of the present-day city of [[Gitega]] served as an administrative centre for the Ruanda-Urundi region.

During the [[World War I|First World War]], the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]] greatly affected the African Great Lakes region. The [[ |]] and [[ Empire|]] colonial forces of the [[Allies of World War I|allied powers]] launched a [[Tabora offensive|coordinated attack]] on the  colony. The  army stationed in  was forced to retreat by the numerical superiority of the  army and by 17 June 1916,  and  were occupied. The [[Force Publique]] and the  [[Lake Force]] then started a thrust to capture [[Tabora]], an administrative centre of central  East Africa. After the war, as outlined in the [[Treaty of Versailles]],  was forced to cede "control" of the Western section of the former  East Africa to .

On 20 October 1924, [[Ruanda-Urundi]], which consisted of modern-day  and , became a  [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandate territory]], with [[Bujumbura|Usumbura]] as its capital. In practical terms it was considered part of the [[ colonial empire]]. , as part of Ruanda-Urundi, continued its kingship [[dynasty]] despite the presence of European authorities.

The , however, preserved many of the kingdom's institutions; the  monarchy succeeded in surviving into the post-colonial period. Following the [[Second World War]], Ruanda-Urundi was classified as a [[United Nations Trust Territory]] under  administrative authority. During the 1940s, a series of policies caused divisions throughout the country. On 4 October 1943, powers were split in the legislative division of 's government between chiefdoms and lower chiefdoms. Chiefdoms were in charge of land, and lower sub-chiefdoms were established. Native authorities also had powers. In 1948,  allowed the region to form [[political parties]]. These factions contributed to  gaining its independence from , on 1 July 1962.

===Independence===
[[File:Flag of  (1962–1966).svg|thumb|alt=flag white saltire cross on green and red background with plant in centre white rondel|Flag of the [[Kingdom of ]] (1962–1966).]]
[[File:Plaza de la Independencia.JPG|thumb|alt=flag sign at flagpole and raised plaza|Independence Square and monument in Bujumbura.]]
On 20 January 1959, [[List of kings of |King]] [[Mwambutsa IV Bangiriceng of |Mwami Mwambutsa IV]] requested 's independence from  and dissolution of the Ruanda-Urundi union. In the following months,  political parties began to advocate for the end of  colonial rule and the separation of  and . The first and largest of these political parties was the [[Union for National Progress]] (UPRONA).

's push for independence was influenced by the [[ Revolution]] and the accompanying instability and ethnic conflict that occurred there. As a result of the  Revolution, many  Tutsi refugees arrived in  from 1959 to 1961.

's first [[ legislative election, 1961|elections]] took place on 8 September 1961 and UPRONA, a multi-ethnic unity party led by [[Prince Louis Rwagasore]] won just over 80% of the electorate's votes. In the wake of the elections, on 13 October, the 29-year-old [[Prince Louis Rwagasore#Assassination in 1961|Prince Rwagasore was assassinated]], robbing  of its most popular and well-known nationalist.

The country claimed independence on 1 July 1962, and legally changed its name from Ruanda-Urundi to .  became a [[constitutional monarchy]] with Mwami Mwambutsa IV, Prince Rwagasore's father, serving as the country's king. On 18 September 1962  joined the [[United Nations]].

In 1963, King Mwambutsa appointed a Hutu prime minister, [[Pierre Ngendandumwe]], but he was assassinated on 15 January 1965 by a  Tutsi employed by the US Embassy. The assassination occurred in the broader context of the [[ Crisis]] during which [[Western world|Western]] anti-communist countries were confronting the communist [[People's Republic of ]] as it attempted to make  a logistics base for communist insurgents battling in . [[ legislative election, 1965|Parliamentary elections in May 1965]] brought a majority of Hutu into the parliament, but when King Mwambutsa appointed a Tutsi prime minister, some Hutu felt this was unjust and ethnic tensions were further increased. In October 1965, an attempted [[1965  coup d'état|coup d'état]] led by the Hutu-dominated police was carried out but failed. The Tutsi dominated army, then led by Tutsi officer Captain [[Michel Micombero]] purged Hutu from their ranks and carried out reprisal attacks which ultimately claimed the lives of up to 5,000 people in a precursor to the [[Ikiza|1972  Genocide]].

King Mwambutsa, who had fled the country during the October coup of 1965, was deposed by a [[July 1966  coup d'état|coup in July 1966]] and his teenage son, [[Ntare V of |Prince Ntare V]], claimed the throne. In November that same year, the Tutsi Prime Minister, then-Captain Michel Micombero, carried out another [[November 1966  coup d'état|coup]], this time deposing Ntare, abolishing the monarchy and declaring the nation a [[republic]], though his one-party government was effectively a [[military dictatorship]]. As president, Micombero became an advocate of [[African socialism]] and received support from the People's Republic of . He imposed a staunch regime of law and order and sharply repressed Hutu militarism.

===Civil war and genocides===
{{Further| genocide (1972)| genocide (1993)}}

In late April 1972, two events led to the outbreak of the [[ genocide (1972)|First  Genocide]]. On 27 April 1972, a rebellion led by [[Hutu]] members of the [[gendarmerie]] broke out in the lakeside towns of [[Rumonge]] and [[Nyanza-Lac]] and the rebels declared the short-lived [[Martyazo Republic]]. The rebels attacked both Tutsi and any Hutu who refused to join their rebellion. During this initial Hutu outbreak, anywhere from 800 to 1200 people were killed. At the same time, King [[Ntare V of ]] returned from exile, heightening political tension in the country. On 29 April 1972, the 24-year-old Ntare V was murdered. In subsequent months, the Tutsi-dominated government of [[Michel Micombero]] used the army to combat Hutu rebels and commit genocide, murdering targeted members of the Hutu majority. The total number of casualties was never established, but contemporary estimates put the number of people killed between 80,000 and 210,000. In addition, several hundred thousand Hutu were estimated to have fled the killings into [[Zaïre]], [[]] and [[]].

Following the civil war and genocide, Micombero became mentally distraught and withdrawn. In 1976, Colonel [[Jean-Baptiste Bagaza]], a Tutsi, led a [[1976  coup d'état|bloodless coup]] to topple Micombero and set about promoting reform. His administration drafted a new constitution in 1981, which maintained 's status as a [[one-party state]]. In August 1984, Bagaza was elected head of state. During his tenure, Bagaza suppressed political opponents and religious freedoms.

Major [[Pierre Buyoya]], a Tutsi, [[1987  coup d'état|overthrew Bagaza in 1987]], suspended the constitution and dissolved political parties. He reinstated military rule by a Military Committee for National Salvation (CSMN). Anti-Tutsi ethnic propaganda disseminated by the remnants of the 1972 UBU, which had re-organized as PALIPEHUTU in 1981, led to [[1988 ethnic violence in |killings of Tutsi peasants]] in the northern communes of [[Ntega]] and [[Marangara]] in August 1988. The government put the death toll at 5,000,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} some international NGOs{{who|date=January 2024}} believed this understated the deaths.

The new regime did not unleash the harsh reprisals of 1972. Its effort to gain public trust was eroded when it decreed an [[amnesty]] for those who had called for, carried out, and taken credit for the killings. Analysts have called this period the beginning of the "culture of impunity." Other analysts put the origins of the "culture of impunity" earlier, in 1965 and 1972, when a small number of identifiable Hutus unleashed massive killings of Tutsis.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In the aftermath of the killings, a group of Hutu intellectuals wrote an open letter to [[Pierre Buyoya]], asking for more representation of the Hutu in the administration. They were arrested and jailed. A few weeks later, Buyoya appointed a new government, with an equal number of Hutu and Tutsi ministers. He appointed [[Adrien Sibomana]] (Hutu) as Prime Minister. Buyoya also created a commission to address issues of national unity. In 1992, the government created a new constitution that provided for a multi-party system, but a [[civil war]] broke out.

An estimated total of 250,000 people died in  from the various conflicts between 1962 and 1993.

Since 's independence in 1962, two [[ genocide (disambiguation)|genocides]] have taken place in the country: the 1972 mass killings of Hutus by the Tutsi-dominated army, and the mass killings of Tutsis in 1993 by the Hutu majority. Both were described as genocides in the final report of the International Commission of Inquiry for  presented in 2002 to the [[United Nations Security Council]].

===First attempt at democracy and war between Tutsi National Army and Hutu population===
In June 1993, [[Melchior Ndadaye]], leader of the Hutu-dominated [[Front for Democracy in ]] (FRODEBU), won the first democratic election. He became the first Hutu head of state, leading a pro-Hutu government. Though he attempted to smooth the country's bitter ethnic divide, his reforms antagonised soldiers in the Tutsi-dominated army, and he was assassinated amidst a failed military coup in October 1993, after only three months in office. The ensuing [[ Civil War]] (1993–2005) saw persistent violence between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi majority army. It is estimated that some 300,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the years following the assassination.

In early 1994, the parliament elected [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]] (Hutu) to the office of president. He and [[Juvénal Habyarimana]], the president of , both Hutus, died together [[Assassination of Habyarimana and Ntaryamira|when their airplane was shot down]] in April 1994. More refugees started fleeing to . Speaker of Parliament, [[Sylvestre Ntibantunganya]] (Hutu), was appointed as president in October 1994. A coalition government involving 12 of the 13 parties was formed. A feared general massacre was averted, but violence broke out. A number of Hutu refugees in Bujumbura,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} the then-capital, were killed. The mainly Tutsi Union for National Progress withdrew from the government and parliament.

In 1996, [[Pierre Buyoya]] (Tutsi) again took power through a [[1996  coup d'état|coup d'état]]. He suspended the constitution and was sworn in as president in 1998. This was the start of his second term as president, after his first term from 1987 to 1993. In response to rebel attacks, the government forced much of the population to move to [[refugee camp]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}} Under Buyoya's rule, long peace talks started, mediated by [[]]. Both parties signed agreements in [[Arusha]], [[]] and [[Pretoria]], , to share power in . The agreements took four years to plan.

[[File:Second  War Africa map en.svg|thumb|alt=color map of African countries showing   and  backing rebels against Kabila|Belligerents of the [[Second  War]].  backed the rebels.]]
On 28 August 2000, a transitional government for  was planned as a part of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement. The transitional government was placed on a trial basis for five years. After several aborted cease-fires, a 2001 peace plan and power-sharing agreement has been relatively successful. A cease-fire was signed in 2003 between the Tutsi-controlled  government and the largest Hutu rebel group, CNDD-FDD (National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy).

In 2003, FRODEBU leader [[Domitien Ndayizeye]] (Hutu) was elected president.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}} In early 2005, ethnic quotas were formed for determining positions in 's government. Throughout the year, elections for parliament and president occurred.

[[Pierre Nkurunziza]] (Hutu), once a leader of a rebel group, was elected president in 2005. {{As of|2008}}, the  government was talking with the Hutu-led Palipehutu-National Liberation Forces (NLF) to bring peace to the country.

===Peace agreements===
African leaders began a series of peace talks between the warring factions following a request by the United Nations Secretary General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] for them to intervene in the humanitarian crisis. Talks were initiated under the aegis of former  President [[Julius Nyerere]] in 1995; following his death,  President [[Nelson Mandela]] took the helm. As the talks progressed,  President [[Thabo Mbeki]] and  President [[Bill Clinton]] also lent their respective weight.

The main objective was to transform the  government and military structurally in order to bridge the ethnic gap between the Tutsi and Hutu. It was to take place in two major steps. First, a transitional power-sharing government would be established, with the presidents holding office for three-year terms. The second objective involved a restructuring of the armed forces, where the two groups would be represented equally.

As the protracted nature of the peace talks demonstrated, the mediators and negotiating parties confronted several obstacles. First, the  officials perceived the goals as "unrealistic" and viewed the treaty as ambiguous, contradictory and confusing. Second, and perhaps most importantly, the  believed the treaty would be irrelevant without an accompanying cease fire. This would require separate and direct talks with the rebel groups. The main Hutu party was skeptical of the offer of a power-sharing government; they alleged that they had been deceived by the Tutsi in past agreements.

In 2000, the  President signed the treaty, as well as 13 of the 19 warring Hutu and Tutsi factions. Disagreements persisted over which group would preside over the nascent government, and when the ceasefire would begin. The spoilers of the peace talks were the hardliner Tutsi and Hutu groups who refused to sign the accord; as a result, violence intensified. Three years later at a summit of African leaders in , the  president and the main opposition Hutu group signed an accord to end the conflict; the signatory members were granted ministerial posts within the government. However, smaller militant Hutu groups – such as the Forces for National Liberation – remained active.

===UN involvement===

Between 1993 and 2003, many rounds of peace talks, overseen by regional leaders in ,  and [[]], gradually established power-sharing agreements to satisfy the majority of the contending groups. Initially the  Protection Support Detachment was deployed to protect  leaders returning from exile. These forces became part of the [[African Union Mission in |African Union Mission to ]], deployed to help oversee the installation of a transitional government. In June 2004, the UN stepped in and took over peacekeeping responsibilities as a signal of growing international support for the already markedly advanced peace process in .

The mission's mandate, under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]], has been to monitor cease-fire, carry out disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former military personnel, support humanitarian assistance and refugee and IDP return, assist with elections, protect international staff and  civilians, monitor 's troublesome borders, including halting illicit arms flows, and assist in carrying out institutional reforms including those of the Constitution, judiciary, armed forces and police. The mission has been allotted 5,650 military personnel, 120 civilian police and about 1,000 international and local civilian personnel. The mission has been functioning well. It has greatly benefited from the transitional government, which has functioned and is in the process of transitioning to one that will be popularly elected.

The main difficulty in the early stages was continued resistance to the peace process by the last Hutu nationalist rebel group. This organisation continued its violent conflict on the outskirts of the capital despite the UN's presence. By June 2005, the group had stopped fighting and its representatives were brought back into the political process. All political parties have accepted a formula for inter-ethnic power-sharing: no political party can gain access to government offices unless it is ethnically integrated.

The focus of the UN's mission had been to enshrine the power-sharing arrangements in a popularly voted constitution, so that elections may be held and a new government installed. Disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration were done in tandem with elections preparations. In February 2005, the [[Constitution of |constitution]] was approved with over 90% of the popular vote. In May, June and August 2005, three separate elections were also held at the local level for the Parliament and the presidency.

While there are still some difficulties with refugee returns and securing adequate food supplies for the war-weary population, the mission managed to win the trust and confidence of a majority of the formerly warring leaders, as well as the population at large. It was involved with several "quick effect" projects, including rehabilitating and building schools, orphanages, health clinics and rebuilding infrastructure such as water lines.

The  2005 Constitution formalised a complex power-sharing architecture that has been described as "associational" in its logic, as it aims to provide guarantees of representation for the Tutsi minority without entrenching the ethnic cleavage at the centre of  politics. This institutional design provides an original contribution from  negotiators and constitution makers to institutional options to manage ethnic conflict.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}

===2006 to 2018===
[[File:BujumburaFromCathedral.jpg|thumb|alt=aerial view of highrise building and low rise red roofed buildings|View of the economic capital city Bujumbura in 2006]]
Reconstruction efforts in  started to practically take effect after 2006. The UN shut down its peacekeeping mission and re-focused on helping with reconstruction. Toward achieving [[economic reconstruction]], , [[|D.R.]] and  relaunched the regional [[Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries]]. In addition, , along with , joined the [[East African Community]] in 2007.

However, the terms of the September 2006 Ceasefire between the government and the last remaining armed opposition group, the [[National Liberation Front ()|FLN]] (Forces for National Liberation, also called NLF or FROLINA), were not totally implemented, and senior FLN members subsequently left the truce monitoring team, claiming that their security was threatened. In September 2007, rival FLN factions clashed in the capital, killing 20 fighters and causing residents to begin fleeing. Rebel raids were reported in other parts of the country. The rebel factions disagreed with the government over disarmament and the release of political prisoners. In late 2007 and early 2008, FLN combatants attacked government-protected camps where former combatants were living. The homes of rural residents were also pillaged.

The 2007 report of [[Amnesty International]] mentions many areas where improvement is required. Civilians are victims of repeated acts of violence done by the FLN. The latter also recruits child soldiers. The rate of violence against women is high. Perpetrators regularly escape prosecution and punishment by the state. There is an urgent need for reform of the judicial system. [[Genocide]], [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] continued to go unpunished.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

In late March 2008, the FLN sought for the parliament to adopt a law guaranteeing them 'provisional immunity' from arrest. This would cover ordinary crimes, but not grave violations of international humanitarian law like war crimes or crimes against humanity . Even though the government has granted this in the past to people, the FLN has been unable to obtain the provisional immunity.

On 17 April 2008, the FLN bombarded Bujumbura. The  army fought back and the FLN suffered heavy losses. A new ceasefire was signed on 26 May 2008. In August 2008, President Nkurunziza met with the FLN leader [[Agathon Rwasa]], with the mediation of [[Charles Nqakula]], 's Minister for Safety and Security. This was the first direct meeting since June 2007. Both agreed to meet twice a week to establish a commission to resolve any disputes that might arise during the peace negotiations.

The UN has attempted to evaluate the impact of its peace-building initiatives. In the early 2010s, the UN peacekeeping mission in  sought to assess the success of its Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration program by counting the number of arms that had been collected, given the prevalence of arms in the country. However, these evaluations failed to include data from local populations, which are significant in impact evaluations of peacebuilding initiatives.

As of 2012,  was participating in African Union peacekeeping missions, including the [[African Union Mission to |mission to ]] against Al-Shabaab militants. In 2014, the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission ()|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] was established, initially for four years and then extended for another four in 2018.

====2015 unrest====
{{Main| unrest (2015–2018)}}
In April 2015 protests broke out after the ruling party announced President [[Pierre Nkurunziza]] would seek a third term in office. Protestors claimed Nkurunziza could not run for a third term in office but the country's constitutional court agreed with Nkurunziza (although some of its members had fled the country at the time of its vote).

[[2015  coup d'état attempt|An attempted coup d'état on 13 May]] failed to depose Nkurunziza.

 He returned to , began purging his government, and arrested several of the coup leaders. Following the attempted coup, however, protests continued; over 100,000 people had fled the country by 20 May, causing a humanitarian emergency. There are reports of continued and widespread abuses of human rights, including unlawful killings, torture, disappearances, and restrictions on freedom of expression.

Despite calls by the [[United Nations]], the [[African Union]], the , , [[]], , and various other governments to refrain, the ruling party [[ legislative election, 2015|held parliamentary elections on 29 June]], but these were boycotted by the opposition.

On 30 September 2016, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] established the Commission of Inquiry on  through resolution 33/24. Its mandate is to "conduct a thorough investigation into human rights violations and abuses committed in  since April 2015, to identify alleged perpetrators and to formulate recommendations." On 29 September 2017 the Commission of Inquiry on  called on  government to put an end to serious [[human rights violations]]. It further stressed that, "The  government has so far refused to cooperate with the Commission of Inquiry, despite the Commission's repeated requests and initiatives." The violations the Commission documented include [[arrests|arbitrary arrests]] and detentions, acts of [[torture]] and cruel, [[inhuman or degrading treatment]], [[extrajudicial execution]]s, [[enforced disappearances]], [[rape]] and other forms of sexual violence."

In a [[2018  constitutional referendum|constitutional referendum]] in May 2018,  voted by 79.08% to approve an amended constitution that ensured that Nkurunziza could remain in power until 2034. However, much to the surprise of most observers, Nkurunziza later announced that he did not intend to serve another term, paving the way for a new president to be elected in the [[2020  general election|2020 general election]].

On 20 May 2020, [[Évariste Ndayishimiye|Evariste Ndayishimiye]], a candidate who was hand-picked as Nkurunziza's successor by the CNDD-FDD, won the election with 71.45% of the vote. Shortly after, on 9 June 2020, Nkurunziza died of a cardiac arrest, at the age of 55. There was some speculation that his death was COVID-19 related, though this is unconfirmed. As per the constitution, [[Pascal Nyabenda]], the president of the national assembly, led the government until Ndayishimiye's inauguration on 18 June 2020.

In December 2021, a [[Gitega prison fire|large prison fire killed dozens]] in the capital city of [[Gitega]].

[[File:Indo-European migrations.jpg|thumb|300px|Early [[Indo-European migrations]] from the [[Pontic steppes]] of present-day  and |left]]

Evidence for the earliest securely dated hominin presence in Europe comes from 1.4 million-year-old stone tools from [[Korolevo]], in western . Settlement by [[modern humans]] in  and its vicinity dates back to 32,000 BC, with evidence of the [[Gravettian culture]] in the [[Crimean Mountains]]. By 4,500 BC, the [[Neolithic]] [[Cucuteni–Trypillia culture]] was flourishing in wide areas of modern , including [[Trypillia]] and the entire [[Dnieper]]-[[Dniester]] region.  is a probable location for the first [[domestication of the horse]]. The [[Kurgan hypothesis]] places the Volga-Dnieper region of  and southern  as the [[linguistic homeland]] of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. Early [[Indo-European migrations]] from the Pontic steppes in the 3rd millennium BC spread [[Yamnaya culture|Yamnaya]] [[Western Steppe Herders|Steppe pastoralist]] ancestry and [[Indo-European languages]] across large parts of Europe. During the [[Iron Age]], the land was inhabited by [[Eastern  languages|]]-speaking [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], and [[Sarmatians]]. Between 700&nbsp;BC and 200&nbsp;BC it was part of the [[Scythia]]n kingdom.

From the 6th&nbsp;century BC, [[Ancient |]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] colonies were established on the north-eastern shore of the [[Black Sea]], such as at [[Tyras]], [[Olbia, |Olbia]], and [[Chersonesus]]. These thrived into the 6th&nbsp;century AD. The [[Goths]] stayed in the area, but came under the sway of the [[Huns]] from the 370s. In the 7th&nbsp;century, the territory that is now eastern  was the centre of [[Old Great ]]. At the end of the century, the majority of Bulgar tribes migrated in different directions, and the [[Khazars]] took over much of the land.

In the 5th and 6th centuries, the [[Antes (people)|Antes]], which some relate as an [[early Slavs|early Slavic]] people, lived in . Migrations from the territories of present-day  throughout the [[Balkans]] established many [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] nations. Northern migrations, reaching almost to [[Lake Ilmen]], led to the emergence of the [[Ilmen Slavs]] and [[Krivichs]]. Following an [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] raid in 602 and the collapse of the Antes Union, most of these peoples survived as separate tribes until the beginning of the second millennium.

=== Golden Age of Kyiv ===

{{Main|Kievan Rus'|Principality of Kiev|Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia}}

[[File:Principalities of Kievan Rus' (1054-1132).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The furthest extent of [[Kievan Rus']], 1054–1132]]

The establishment of the state of [[Kievan Rus']] remains obscure and uncertain. The state included much of present-day ,  and the western part of [[European ]]. According to the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', the [[Rus' people]] initially consisted of [[Varangian]]s from [[Scandinavia]]. In 882, the pagan [[Oleg of Novgorod|Prince Oleg]] (Oleh) conquered [[Kyiv]]<!--See [[Talk:Kiev/naming]] re Kiev/Kyiv. --> from [[Askold and Dir]] and proclaimed it as the new capital of the Rus'. [[Anti-Normanism|Anti-Normanist]] historians however argue that the East Slavic tribes along the southern parts of the [[Dnieper River]] were already in the process of forming a state independently. The Varangian elite, including the ruling [[Rurik dynasty]], later assimilated into the Slavic population. Kievan Rus' was composed of several [[principality|principalities]] ruled by the interrelated Rurikid ''[[knyaz|kniazes]]'' ("princes"), who often fought each other for possession of Kyiv.

During the 10th and 11th&nbsp;centuries, Kievan Rus' became the largest and most powerful state in Europe, a period known as its Golden Age. It began with the reign of [[Vladimir the Great]] (980–1015), who [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|introduced Christianity]]. During the reign of his son, [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–1054), Kievan Rus' reached the zenith of its cultural development and military power. The state soon fragmented as the relative importance of regional powers rose again. After a final resurgence under the rule of [[Vladimir II Monomakh]] (1113–1125) and his son [[Mstislav I of Kiev|Mstislav]] (1125–1132), Kievan Rus' finally disintegrated into separate principalities following Mstislav's death, though ownership of Kyiv would still carry great prestige for decades. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the nomadic confederacy of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking [[Cumans]] and [[Kipchaks]] was the dominant force in the [[Pontic steppe]] north of the Black Sea.

The [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasions]] in the mid-13th century devastated Kievan Rus'; following the [[Siege of Kyiv (1240)|Siege of Kyiv in 1240]], the city was destroyed by the Mongols. In the western territories, the principalities of [[Principality of Halych|Halych]] and [[Principality of Volhynia|Volhynia]] had arisen earlier, and were merged to form the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia|Principality of Galicia–Volhynia]]. [[Daniel of Galicia]], son of [[Roman the Great]], re-united much of south-western Rus', including [[Volhynia]], [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], as well as Kyiv. He was subsequently crowned by a [[Pope|papal]] envoy as the first [[King of Ruthenia|king of Galicia–Volhynia]] (also known as the Kingdom of [[Ruthenia]]) in 1253.

In 1349, in the aftermath of the [[Galicia–Volhynia Wars]], the region was partitioned between the [[Kingdom of ]] and the [[Grand Duchy of ]]. From the mid-13th century to the late 1400s, the [[Republic of Genoa]] founded numerous [[colonies]] on the northern coast of the Black Sea and transformed these into large commercial centres headed by the consul, a representative of the Republic. In 1430, the region of [[Podolia]] was incorporated into , and the lands of modern-day  became increasingly settled by [[ people|Poles]]. In 1441, [[Genghisid]] prince [[Haci I Giray]] founded the [[Crimean Khanate]] on the [[Crimean Peninsula]] and the surrounding steppes; the Khanate orchestrated [[Tatars|Tatar]] [[Crimean–Nogai slave raids in Eastern Europe|slave raids]]. Over the next three centuries, the [[Crimean slave trade]] would enslave an estimated two million in the region.

In 1569, the [[Union of Lublin]] established the [[– Commonwealth]], and most of the  lands were transferred from  to the [[Crown of the Kingdom of ]], becoming ''[[de jure]]''  territory. Under the pressures of [[Polonisation]], many landed gentry of Ruthenia converted to [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]] and joined the circles of the [[ nobility]]; others joined the newly created [[Ruthenian Uniate Church]].

=== Cossack Hetmanate ===
{{main|Cossack Hetmanate|Zaporozhian Sich}}

Deprived of native protectors among the Ruthenian nobility, the peasants and townspeople began turning for protection to the emerging [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]]. In the mid-17th&nbsp;century, a Cossack military quasi-state, the [[Zaporozhian Host]], was formed by [[Dnieper Cossacks]] and Ruthenian peasants.  exercised little real control over this population, but found the Cossacks to be useful against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] and Tatars, and at times the two were allies in [[Ottoman wars in Europe|military campaigns]]. However, the continued harsh [[serf|enserfment]] of Ruthenian peasantry by  [[szlachta]] (many of whom were Polonised [[Ruthenian nobility|Ruthenian nobles]]) and the suppression of the Orthodox Church alienated the Cossacks. The latter did not shy from taking up arms against those they perceived as enemies and occupiers, including the Catholic Church with its local representatives.

[[File:Hondius Bohdan Khmelnytsky.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Hetmans of  Cossacks|Hetman]] [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] established an independent [[Cossack Hetmanate|Cossack state]] after the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|1648 uprising]] against ]]
In 1648, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] led the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|largest of the Cossack uprisings]] against the Commonwealth and the [[List of  monarchs| king]], which enjoyed wide support from the local population. Khmelnytsky founded the [[Cossack Hetmanate]], which existed until 1764 (some sources claim until 1782). After Khmelnytsky suffered a crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Berestechko]] in 1651, he turned to the [[List of  monarchs| tsar]] for help. In 1654, Khmelnytsky was subject to the [[Pereiaslav Agreement]], forming a military and political alliance with  that acknowledged loyalty to the  monarch.

After his death, the Hetmanate went through a devastating 30-year war amongst , , the Crimean Khanate, the Ottoman Empire, and [[Cossacks]], known as "[[The Ruin ( history)|The Ruin]]" (1657–1686), for control of the Cossack Hetmanate. The [[Treaty of Perpetual Peace (1686)|Treaty of Perpetual Peace]] between  and  in 1686 divided the lands of the Cossack Hetmanate between them, reducing the portion over which  had claimed sovereignty to  west of the Dnieper river. In 1686, the [[Metropolitanate of Kyiv]] was [[Annexation of the Metropolitanate of Kyiv by the Moscow Patriarchate|annexed by the Moscow Patriarchate]] through a synodal letter of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Dionysius IV of Constantinople|Dionysius IV]], thus placing the [[Metropolitanate of Kyiv#Orthodox Church of |Metropolitanate of Kyiv]] under the authority of [[Moscow]]. An attempt to reverse the decline was undertaken by Cossack Hetman [[Ivan Mazepa]] (1639–1709), who ultimately defected to the [[|Swedes]] in the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721) in a bid to get rid of  dependence, but Hetmanate's capital city [[Baturyn]] was [[Sack of Baturyn|sacked]] (1708) and they were crushed in the [[Battle of Poltava]] (1709).

The Hetmanate's autonomy was severely restricted since Poltava. In the years 1764–1781, [[Catherine the Great]] incorporated much of [[Central ]] into the [[ Empire]], abolishing the Cossack Hetmanate and the [[Zaporozhian Sich]], and was one of the people responsible for the suppression of the last major Cossack uprising, the [[Koliivshchyna]]. After the [[annexation of Crimea by the  Empire|annexation of Crimea by ]] in 1783, the newly acquired lands, now called [[Novorossiya]], were opened up to settlement by . The [[tsarist autocracy]] established a policy of [[Russification]], suppressing the use of the [[ language]] and curtailing the  national identity. The western part of present-day  was subsequently split between  and [[Habsburg]]-ruled [[ Empire|]] after the [[Partitions of |fall]] of the – Commonwealth in 1795.

The 19th century saw the rise of  nationalism. With growing urbanisation and modernisation and a cultural trend toward [[romantic nationalism]], a  [[intelligentsia]] committed to national rebirth and social justice emerged. The serf-turned-national-poet [[Taras Shevchenko]] (1814–1861) and political theorist [[Mykhailo Drahomanov]] (1841–1895) led the growing nationalist movement. While conditions for its development in  [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]] under the [[Habsburgs]] were relatively lenient, the  part (historically known as "[[Little ]]" or "South ") faced severe restrictions, going as far as [[Ems Ukaz|banning virtually all books from being published in ]] in 1876.

The  part of  [[Poverty in  Galicia|was particularly destitute]], which forced hundreds of thousands of peasants into emigration, who created the backbone of an extensive [[ diaspora]] in countries such as [[ |]], the [[ |]] and [[ |]]. Some of the  settled in the Far East, too. According to the [[1897 census]], there were 223,000 ethnic  in [[Siberia]] and 102,000 in [[Central Asia]]. An additional 1.6 million emigrated to the east in the ten years after the opening of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] in 1906. [[ Far East|Far Eastern]] areas with an ethnic  population became known as [[Green ]].

Initially, the  were split between -, fighting for the [[Central Powers]], though the vast majority served in the [[Military history of Imperial |Imperial  Army]], which was part of the [[Triple Entente]], under . As the  Empire collapsed, the conflict evolved into the [[ War of Independence]], with  fighting alongside, or against, the [[Red Army|Red]], [[White Army|White]], [[Makhnovshchina|Black]] and [[Green armies]], with the Poles,  (in [[Transcarpathian Rus'|Transcarpathia]]), and  also intervening at various times.

An attempt to create an independent state, the left-leaning [[ People's Republic]] (UNR), was first announced by [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], but the period was plagued by an extremely unstable political and military environment. It was first deposed in a [[coup d'état]] led by [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]], which yielded the [[ State]] under the  protectorate, and the attempt to restore the UNR under the [[Directorate of |Directorate]] ultimately failed as the  army was regularly overrun by other forces. The short-lived [[West  People's Republic]] and [[Hutsul Republic]] also failed to join the rest of .

The result of the conflict was a partial victory for the [[Second  Republic]], which annexed the Western  provinces, as well as a larger-scale victory for the pro-Soviet forces, which succeeded in dislodging the remaining factions and eventually established the [[ Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Soviet ). Meanwhile, modern-day [[Bukovina]] was occupied by [[Kingdom of |]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] was admitted to [[First Czechoslovak Republic|]] as an autonomous region.

The conflict over , a part of the broader [[ Civil War]], devastated the whole of the former  Empire, including eastern and central . The fighting left over 1.5 million people dead and hundreds of thousands homeless in the former  Empire's territory. [[ famine of 1921–1922|Famine in 1921]] further hit the eastern provinces.

<!-- 1922–1939 -->During the inter-war period, in , Marshal [[Józef Piłsudski]] sought  support by offering local autonomy as a way to minimise Soviet influence in 's eastern [[Kresy]] region. However, this approach was abandoned after Piłsudski's death in 1935, due to continued unrest among the  population, including assassinations of  government officials by the [[Organisation of  Nationalists]] (OUN); with the  government responding by restricting rights of people who declared  nationality. In consequence, the underground [[ nationalism| nationalist]] and militant movement, which arose in the 1920s gained wider support.

Meanwhile, the recently constituted Soviet  became one of the founding republics of the [[Soviet Union]]. During the 1920s, under the Ukrainisation policy pursued by the national Communist leadership of [[Mykola Skrypnyk]], Soviet leadership at first encouraged a national renaissance in [[Culture of | culture]] and language. [[Ukrainisation]] was part of the Soviet-wide policy of [[Korenisation]] (literally ''indigenisation''), which was intended to promote the advancement of native peoples, their language and culture into the governance of their respective republics.

Around the same time, Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] instituted the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), which introduced a form of [[market socialism]], allowing some private ownership of small and medium-sized productive enterprises, hoping to reconstruct the post-war Soviet Union that had been devastated by both WWI and later the civil war. The NEP was successful at restoring the formerly war-torn nation to pre-WWI levels of production and agricultural output by the mid-1920s, much of the latter based in . These policies attracted many prominent former UNR figures, including former UNR leader Hrushevsky, to return to Soviet , where they were accepted, and participated in the advancement of  science and culture. In July 1922, arrests and [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportations]] of  intellectuals (e.g. university professors) began in Soviet  and continued throughout the 1920s.

This period was cut short when [[Joseph Stalin]] became the leader of the USSR following Lenin's death. Stalin did away with the NEP in what became known as the [[Great Break (USSR)|Great Break]]. Starting from the late 1920s and now with a [[planned economy|centrally planned economy]], Soviet  took part in an [[Industrialization in the USSR|industrialisation scheme]] which quadrupled its industrial output during the 1930s.

Nevertheless, Stalin sought to prevent the  aspirations for the independence of  and took severe measures to eliminate  peasantry and elite  intellectuals and culturists. As a consequence of Stalin's new policy, the  peasantry suffered from the [[Collectivization in the USSR|programme of collectivisation]] of agricultural crops. Collectivisation was part of the [[First five-year plan (Soviet Union)|first five-year plan]] and was enforced by regular troops and the secret police known as [[Cheka]]. Those who resisted were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|arrested and deported]] to [[gulag]]s and work camps. As members of the collective farms were sometimes not allowed to receive any grain until unrealistic quotas were met, millions starved to death in a [[Droughts and famines in  and the Soviet Union|famine]] known as the [[Holodomor]] or the "Great Famine", which was recognised by some countries as an act of [[genocide]] perpetrated by Joseph Stalin and other Soviet notables.

Following on the  Civil War and collectivisation, the [[Great Purge]], while killing Stalin's perceived political enemies, resulted in a profound loss of a new generation of  intelligentsia, known today as the [[Executed Renaissance]].

Following the [[invasion of ]] in September 1939, [[Nazi |]] and [[Soviet Army|Soviet]] troops divided the territory of . Thus, Eastern Galicia and Volhynia with their  population became part of . For the first time in history, the nation was united. Further territorial gains were secured in 1940, when the  SSR incorporated the northern and southern districts of [[Bessarabia]], [[Northern Bukovina]], and the [[Hertsa region]] from the territories the USSR [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|forced  to cede]], though it handed over the western part of the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] to the newly created [[Moldavian SSR]].

After its conquest, most of the  SSR was organised within the [[Reichskommissariat ]], with the intention of exploiting its resources and eventual  settlement. Some western , who had only joined the Soviet Union in 1939, hailed the  as liberators, but that did not last long as the Nazis made little attempt to exploit dissatisfaction with Stalinist policies. Instead, the Nazis preserved the collective-farm system, carried out [[Mass graves in the Soviet Union|genocidal policies]] against [[History of the Jews in |Jews]], [[OST-Arbeiter|deported millions of people to work in ]], and began a depopulation programme to prepare for  colonisation. They blockaded the transport of food on the Dnieper River.

Although the majority of  fought in or alongside the Red Army and [[Soviet partisans|Soviet resistance]], in Western  an independent [[ Insurgent Army]] movement arose (UPA, 1942). It was created as the armed forces of the underground [[Organization of  Nationalists|Organisation of  Nationalists]] (OUN). Both organisations, the OUN and the UPA, supported the goal of an [[Declaration of  Independence, 1941|independent  state]] on the territory with a  ethnic majority. Although this brought conflict with Nazi , at times the [[Melnykites|Melnyk wing of the OUN]] allied with the Nazi forces. From mid-1943 until the end of the war, the UPA carried out [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia|massacres of ethnic Poles]] in the Volhynia and [[Eastern Galicia]] regions, killing around 100,000  civilians, which brought reprisals. These organised massacres were an attempt by the OUN to create a homogeneous  state without a  minority living within its borders, and to prevent the post-war  state from asserting its sovereignty over areas that had been part of pre-war . After the war, the UPA continued to fight the USSR until the 1950s. At the same time, the [[ Liberation Army]], another nationalist movement, fought alongside the Nazis.

The republic was heavily damaged by the war, and it required significant efforts to recover. More than 700 cities and towns and 28,000 villages were destroyed. The situation was worsened by a [[famine]] in 1946–1947, which was caused by a drought and the wartime destruction of infrastructure, killing at least tens of thousands of people. In 1945, the  SSR became one of the founding members of the [[United Nations]] (UN), part of a special agreement at the [[Yalta Conference]], and, alongside , had voting rights in the UN even though they were not independent. Moreover,  once more expanded its borders as it annexed [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]], and the population became much more homogenised due to post-war population transfers, most of which, as in the case of [[Flight and expulsion of  (1944–1950)|]] and [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatars]], were forced. As of 1 January 1953,  were second only to  among adult "[[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special deportees]]", comprising 20% of the total.

Following the death of Stalin in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became the new leader of the USSR, who began the policies of [[De-Stalinization|de-stalinisation]] and the [[Khrushchev Thaw]]. During his term as head of the Soviet Union, [[Crimean Oblast|Crimea]] was [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] from the [[ SFSR]] to the [[ SSR]], formally as a friendship gift to  and for economic reasons. This represented the final extension of  territory and formed the basis for the internationally recognised borders of  to this day. Many top positions in the Soviet Union were occupied by , including notably [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] from 1964 to 1982. However, it was he and his [[Communist Party of  (Soviet Union)|appointee in ]], [[Volodymyr Shcherbytsky]], who presided over the extensive [[Russification of |Russification]] of  and who were instrumental in repressing a new generation of  intellectuals known as the [[Sixtiers]].

By 1950, the republic had fully surpassed pre-war levels of industry and production. Soviet  soon became a European leader in industrial production and an important centre of the Soviet [[arms industry]] and high-tech research, though heavy industry still had an outsided influence. The Soviet government invested in hydroelectric and nuclear power projects to cater to the energy demand that the development carried. On 26 April 1986, however, a reactor in the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] exploded, resulting in the [[Chernobyl disaster]], the worst [[nuclear reactor]] accident in history.

After a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|failed coup]] by some Communist leaders in Moscow at deposing Gorbachov, outright independence was proclaimed on 24 August 1991.

These documents sealed the fate of the Soviet Union, which formally voted itself out of existence on 26 December.

 was initially viewed as having favourable economic conditions in comparison to the other regions of the Soviet Union, though it was one of the poorer Soviet republics by the time of the dissolution. However, during its transition to the market economy, the country experienced deeper economic slowdown than almost all of the other [[former Soviet Republics]]. During the recession, between 1991 and 1999,  lost 60% of its GDP and suffered from [[hyperinflation]] that peaked at 10,000% in 1993. The situation only stabilised well after the new currency, the [[hryvnia]], fell sharply in late 1998 partially as a fallout from the [[ debt default]] earlier that year. The legacy of the economic policies of the nineties was the mass privatisation of state property that created a class of extremely powerful and rich individuals known as the [[ oligarch|oligarchs]].

From the political perspective, one of the defining features of the [[politics of ]] is that for most of the time, it has been divided along two issues: the relation between , the [[Western world|West]] and , and the classical [[Left–right political spectrum|left-right]] divide. The first two presidents, Kravchuk and [[Leonid Kuchma]], tended to balance the competing visions of , though [[Yushchenko]] and [[Yanukovych]] were generally pro-Western and pro-, respectively. There were two major protests against Yanukovych: the [[Orange Revolution]] in 2004, when tens of thousands of people went in protest of [[election rigging]] in his favour (Yushchenko was eventually elected president), and another one in the winter of 2013/2014, when more gathered on the [[Euromaidan]] to oppose Yanukovych's refusal to sign the [[European Union– Association Agreement]]. By the end of the protests on 21 February 2014, he fled from  and was removed by the parliament in what is termed the [[Revolution of Dignity]], but  refused to recognise the interim pro-Western government, calling it a ''[[Military junta|junta]]'' and denouncing the events as a coup d'état sponsored by the .

==History==
{{main|History of }}

===Early history===
The northwestern part of present-day  was populated by [[hunter-gatherer]]s from 14,000 BC to 5,000 BC. Their tools, including [[scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], [[chisel]]s and [[arrowhead]]s, were discovered in 1973 through [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavations]]. Agricultural settlements were established between 3600 and 2600&nbsp;BC. The [[Bura culture]] was an [[Iron Age|Iron-Age]] [[civilization]] centred in the southwest portion of modern-day  and in the southeast part of contemporary . [[Iron industry]], in [[smelting]] and [[forging]] for tools and weapons, had developed in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] by 1200&nbsp;BC. To date, the oldest evidence of iron smelting found in  dates from 800 to 700 BC and forms part of the [[Ancient Ferrous Metallurgy Sites of |Ancient Ferrous Metallurgy]] World Heritage Site. From the 3rd to the 13th centuries AD, the [[Iron Age]] [[Bura culture]] existed in the territory of present-day southeastern  and southwestern . Various ethnic groups of present-day , such as the [[Mossi people|Mossi]], [[Fula people|Fula]] and [[Dyula people|Dioula]], arrived in successive waves between the 8th and 15th centuries. From the 11th century, the Mossi people established [[Mossi Kingdoms|several separate kingdoms]].
[[File:Africa de l'Oèst en 1875-es.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|West Africa {{Circa|1875}}]]

===8th to 18th centuries===
There is debate about the exact dates when 's many ethnic groups arrived to the area. The proto-[[Mossi people|Mossi]] arrived in the far eastern part of what is today  sometime between the 8th and 11th centuries, and accepted [[Islam]] as their religion in the 11th century. The [[Samo language (Burkina)|Samo]] arrived around the 15th century. The [[Dogon people|Dogon]] lived in 's north and northwest regions until sometime in the 15th or 16th centuries, and many of the other ethnic groups that make up the country's population arrived in the region during this time.

[[File:MossiCavalry.jpg|thumb|The cavalry of the [[Mossi Kingdoms]] were experts at raiding deep into enemy territory, even against the formidable [[ Empire]].]]
[[File:Pg381 Des hommes sur les toits s'opposent.jpg|thumb|Armed men prevent the  explorer [[Louis-Gustave Binger]] from entering Sia (Bobo-Dioulasso) during his stay in April 1892.]]

During the [[Middle Ages]], the Mossi established several separate kingdoms including those of Tenkodogo, Yatenga, Zandoma, and Ouagadougou. Sometime between 1328 and 1338, Mossi warriors raided [[Timbuktu]] but the Mossi were defeated by [[Sonni Ali]] of [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] at the Battle of Kobi in  in 1483.

During the early 16th century, the Songhai conducted many slave raids into what is today . During the 18th century, the [[Gwiriko|Gwiriko Empire]] was established at [[Bobo Dioulasso]] and ethnic groups such as the Dyan, Lobi, and Birifor settled along the [[Black Volta]].

Starting in the early 1890s during the European [[Scramble for Africa]], a series of European military officers made attempts to claim parts of what is today . At times these [[Colonialism|colonialists]] and their armies fought the local peoples; at times they forged alliances with them and made treaties. The colonialist officers and their home governments also made treaties among themselves. The territory of  was invaded by [[ Third Republic|]], becoming a [[ colonial empire| protectorate]] in 1896.

[[File:Carte de l'Afrique-Occidentale française, 1914.svg|thumb|[[ West Africa]] c. 1913]]

The eastern and western regions, where a standoff against the forces of the powerful ruler [[Samori Ture]] complicated the situation, came under  occupation in 1897. By 1898, the majority of the territory corresponding to  was nominally conquered; however,  control of many parts remained uncertain.

The [[Anglo- Convention of 1898|Franco- Convention of 14 June 1898]] created the country's modern borders. In the  territory, a war of conquest against local communities and political powers continued for about five years. In 1904, the largely pacified territories of the [[Volta River|Volta basin]] were integrated into the [[Upper  and ]] colony of [[ West Africa]] as part of the reorganization of the  West African colonial empire. The colony had its capital in [[Bamako]].

The language of colonial administration and schooling became . The public education system started from humble origins. Advanced education was provided for many years during the colonial period in Dakar.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

The indigenous population was highly discriminated against. For example, African children were not allowed to ride bicycles or pick fruit from trees, "privileges" reserved for the children of colonists. Violating these regulations could land parents in jail.

[[Conscription|Draftees]] from the territory participated in the European fronts of [[World War I]] in the battalions of the [[Tirailleurs sénégalais| Rifles]]. Between 1915 and 1916, the districts in the western part of what is now  and the bordering eastern fringe of  became the stage of one of the most important armed oppositions to colonial government: the [[Volta-Bani War]].

The  government finally suppressed the movement but only after suffering defeats. {{Verify source|date=May 2025}} It also had to organize its largest expeditionary force of its colonial history to send into the country to suppress the insurrection. Armed opposition wracked the Sahelian north when the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and allied groups of the Dori region ended their truce with the government.

[[File:Mittelholzer-ouagadougou.jpg|thumb|The capital, [[Ouagadougou]], in 1930]]

[[ Upper Volta]] was established on 1 March 1919. The  feared a recurrence of armed uprising and had related economic considerations. To bolster its administration, the colonial government separated the present territory of  from Upper  and .

The new colony was named ''Haute Volta'' for its location on the upper courses of the [[Volta River]] (the [[Black Volta|Black]], [[Red Volta|Red]] and [[White Volta]]), and François Charles Alexis Édouard Hesling became its first [[List of governors of Upper Volta|governor]]. Hesling initiated an ambitious road-making program to improve infrastructure and promoted the growth of cotton for export. The cotton policy – based on [[coercion]] – failed, and revenue generated by the colony stagnated. The colony was dismantled on 5 September 1932, being split between the  colonies of [[]], [[ ]] and [[]].  received the largest share, which contained most of the population as well as the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

 reversed this change during the period of intense anti-colonial agitation that followed the end of [[World War II]]. On 4 September 1947, it revived the colony of Upper Volta, with its previous boundaries, as a part of the [[ Union]]. The  designated its colonies as departments of [[metropolitan ]] on the European continent.

On 11 December 1958, the colony achieved [[Self-governance|self-government]] as the [[Republic of Upper Volta]]; it joined the Franco-African Community. A revision in the organization of  Overseas Territories had begun with the passage of the Basic Law (Loi Cadre) of 23 July 1956. This act was followed by reorganization measures approved by the  parliament early in 1957 to ensure a large degree of self-government for individual territories. Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the  community on 11 December 1958. Full independence from  was received in 1960.

===Upper Volta (1958–1984)===
{{main|Republic of Upper Volta}}
[[File:Maurice Yaméogo and Louis Jacquinot exchanging instruments of ratification for the independence of the Upper Volta.jpg|thumb|[[Maurice Yaméogo]], the first president of Upper Volta, examines documents pertaining to the ratification of the country's independence in 1960.]]

The Republic of Upper Volta ({{langx|fr|link=no|République de Haute-Volta}}) was established on 11 December 1958 as a [[self-governing colony]] within the [[ Community]]. The name ''Upper Volta'' related to the nation's location along the upper reaches of the [[Volta River]]. The river's three [[Tributary|tributaries]], the [[Black Volta|Black]], [[White Volta|White]] and [[Red Volta]], were expressed in the three colors of the [[Flag of Upper Volta|former national flag]].

Before attaining autonomy, it had been  Upper Volta and part of the  Union. On 5 August 1960, it attained full independence from [[ Fourth Republic|]]. The first president, [[Maurice Yaméogo]], was the leader of the [[Voltaic Democratic Union]] (UDV). The 1960 constitution provided for election by [[universal suffrage]] of a president and a national assembly. Soon after coming to power, Yaméogo banned all political parties other than the UDV. The government lasted until 1966. After much unrest, including mass demonstrations and strikes by students, labor unions, and civil servants, the military intervened.

==== Lamizana's rule and multiple coups ====

The [[1966 Upper Voltan coup d'état|1966 military coup]] deposed Yaméogo, suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lt. Col. [[Sangoulé Lamizana]] at the head of a government of senior army officers. The army remained in power for four years. On 14 June 1976, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a four-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. Lamizana's rule coincided with the beginning of the [[Sahel drought]] and famine which had a devastating impact on Upper Volta and neighboring countries. After conflict over the 1976 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977. Lamizana was re-elected by open elections in 1978.

Lamizana's government faced problems with the country's traditionally powerful trade unions, and on 25 November 1980, Col. [[Saye Zerbo]] overthrew President Lamizana in a [[1980 Upper Voltan coup d'état|bloodless coup]]. Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority, thus eradicating the 1977 constitution.

Colonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later by Maj. Dr. [[Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo]] and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP) in the [[1982 Upper Voltan coup d'état]]. The CSP continued to ban political parties and organizations, yet promised a transition to civilian rule and a new constitution.

====1983 coup d'état====

Infighting developed between the right and left factions of the CSP. The leader of the leftists, Capt. [[Thomas Sankara]], was appointed prime minister in January 1983, but was subsequently arrested. Efforts to free him, directed by Capt. [[Blaise Compaoré]], resulted in a military coup d'état on 4 August 1983.

The coup brought Sankara to power and his government began to implement a series of revolutionary programs which included mass-vaccinations, infrastructure improvements, the expansion of women's rights, encouragement of domestic agricultural consumption, and anti-desertification projects.

===  (since 1984) ===
On 2 August 1984, on Sankara's initiative, the country's name changed from "Upper Volta" to "", or ''land of the honest men''; (the literal translation is ''land of the upright men'').{{request quotation|date=March 2020}} The presidential decree was confirmed by the National Assembly on 4 August 1984.

Sankara's government comprised the National Council for the Revolution (CNR – {{langx|fr|Conseil national révolutionnaire}}), with Sankara as its president, and established popular [[Committees for the Defense of the Revolution ()|Committees for the Defense of the Revolution]] (CDRs). The [[Pioneers of the Revolution]] youth programme was also established.

Sankara launched an ambitious socioeconomic programme for change, one of the largest ever undertaken on the African continent. His foreign policies centred on [[anti-imperialism]], with his government rejecting all [[foreign aid]], pushing for [[odious debt]] reduction, nationalising all land and mineral wealth and averting the power and influence of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[World Bank]]. His domestic policies included a nationwide literacy campaign, land redistribution to peasants, railway and road construction and the outlawing of [[female genital mutilation]], [[forced marriage]]s and [[polygamy]].

Sankara pushed for agrarian self-sufficiency and promoted public health by vaccinating 2,500,000 children against [[meningitis]], [[yellow fever]], and [[measles]]. His national agenda also included planting more than 10,000,000 trees to halt the growing [[desertification]] of the [[Sahel]]. Sankara called on every village to build a medical dispensary and had more than 350 communities build schools with their own labour.

In the 1980s, when ecological awareness was still very low, Sankara was one of the few African leaders to consider environmental protection a priority. He engaged in three major battles: against bush fires "which will be considered as crimes and will be punished as such"; against cattle roaming "which infringes on the rights of peoples because unattended animals destroy nature"; and against the illegitimate cutting of firewood "whose profession will have to be organized and regulated". As part of a development program involving a large part of the population, ten million trees were planted in  in fifteen months during the revolution. To face the advancing desert and recurrent droughts, Sankara also proposed the planting of wooded strips about fifty kilometers wide, crossing the country from east to west. Cereal production, close to 1.1 billion tons before 1983, was predicted to rise to 1.6 billion tons in 1987. Jean Ziegler, former UN special rapporteur for the right to food, said that the country "had become food self-sufficient."

==== Compaoré presidency ====
[[File:Blaise Compaore with George Bush July 16, 2008.jpg|thumb|[[Blaise Compaoré]] (left), President 1987–2014, shaking hands with [[George W. Bush]]]]
On 15 October 1987, Sankara and twelve other government officials were assassinated in a coup d'état organized by Blaise Compaoré, Sankara's former colleague, who took over as 's president. He held the position until October 2014. After the coup and although Sankara was known to be dead, some CDRs mounted an armed resistance to the [[Army of |army]] for several days. A majority{{quantify|date=March 2020}} of Burkinabè citizens hold that [[Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs ()|'s foreign ministry]], the [[Quai d'Orsay]], was behind Compaoré in organizing the coup. There is some evidence for 's support of the coup.

Compaoré gave the deterioration in relations with neighbouring countries as one of the reasons for the coup. He argued that Sankara had jeopardised foreign relations with the former colonial power ([[]]) and with neighbouring [[]]. Following the coup, Compaoré immediately reversed the nationalizations, overturned nearly all of Sankara's policies, returned the country back into the IMF fold, and ultimately spurned most of Sankara's legacy. Following an alleged [[1989  coup attempt|coup-attempt in 1989]], Compaoré introduced limited democratic reforms in 1990. Under the new (1991) [[Constitution of |constitution]], Compaoré was [[1991 Burkinabé presidential election|re-elected]] without opposition in December 1991. In 1998 Compaoré won [[1998 Burkinabé presidential election|election]] in a landslide. In 2004, 13 people were tried for plotting a coup against President Compaoré and the coup's alleged mastermind was sentenced to life imprisonment.

In 2000, the constitution was amended to reduce the presidential term to five years and set term limits to two, preventing successive re-election. The amendment took effect during the 2005 elections. If passed beforehand, it would have prevented Compaoré from being reelected. Other presidential candidates challenged the election results. But in October 2005, the constitutional council ruled that the amendment would not apply until the end of his second term in office. This cleared the way for his candidacy in [[2005 Burkinabé presidential election|the 2005 election]]. On 13 November 2005, he was reelected in a landslide.

In the [[2010 Burkinabé presidential election|2010 presidential election]], Compaoré was re-elected. Only 1.6 million Burkinabè voted, out of a total population 10 times that size. In February 2011, the death of a schoolboy provoked the [[2011 Burkinabè protests]], a series of popular protests, coupled with a military mutiny and a magistrates' strike, that called for Compaoré's resignation, democratic reforms, higher wages for troops and public servants and economic freedom. As a result, governors were replaced and wages for public servants were raised. In April 2011, there was an [[2011  mutiny|army mutiny]]; the president named new chiefs of staff, and a curfew was imposed in [[Ouagadougou]].

Compaoré's government played the role of negotiator in several West-African disputes, including the [[2010–2011 Ivorian crisis]], the Inter- Dialogue (2007), and the [[2012  coup d'état|2012  Crisis]]. {{As of|2014}},  remained one of the [[Least developed country|least-developed countries]] in the world.

==== Kafando presidency ====
{{Main|2014 Burkinabè uprising}}
[[File: Protests.png|thumb|Thousands of protesters march through Ouagadougou]]

Starting on 28 October 2014 protesters began to march and demonstrate in Ouagadougou against President Compaoré, who appeared{{request quotation|date=March 2020}} ready to amend the constitution and extend his rule. On 30 October protesters set fire to the parliament building and took over the national TV headquarters. [[Ouagadougou Airport|Ouagadougou International Airport]] closed and MPs suspended the vote on changing the constitution (the change would have allowed Compaoré to stand for re-election in 2015). Later in the day, the military dissolved all government institutions and imposed a [[curfew]].

On 31 October 2014, Compaoré resigned. [[Yacouba Isaac Zida|Lt. Col. Isaac Zida]] said that he would lead the country during its transitional period before the planned [[2015 Burkinabè general election|2015 presidential election]], but there were concerns{{by whom|date=March 2020}} over his close ties to the former president. In November 2014 opposition parties, [[civil society|civil-society]] groups and religious leaders adopted a plan for a transitional authority to guide  to elections. Under the plan [[Michel Kafando]] became the transitional president and Lt. Col. Zida became the acting Prime Minister and Defense Minister.

On 16 September 2015, the [[Regiment of Presidential Security]] (RSP) carried out a [[2015  coup d'état|coup d'état]], seizing the president and prime minister and then declaring the [[National Council for Democracy]] the new national government. However, on 22 September 2015, the coup leader, [[Gilbert Diendéré]], apologized and promised to restore civilian government. On 23 September 2015 the prime minister and interim president were restored to power.

[[2015 Burkinabè general election|General elections]] took place on 29 November 2015. [[Roch Marc Christian Kaboré]] won the election in the first round with 53.5% of the vote, defeating businessman [[Zéphirin Diabré]], who took 29.7%. Kaboré was sworn in as president on 29 December 2015. Kaboré was re-elected in the [[2020 Burkinabè general election|general election of 22 November 2020]], but his party Mouvement du Peuple pour le Progrès (MPP), failed to reach absolute parliamentary majority. It secured 56 seats out of a total of 127. The Congress for Democracy and Progress (CDP), the party of former President Blaise Compaoré, was distant second with 20 seats.

A [[Jihadist insurgency in |Jihadist insurgency]] began in August 2015, part of the [[Islamist insurgency in the Sahel]]. Between August 2015 and October 2016, seven different posts were attacked across the country. On 15 January 2016, terrorists [[2016 Ouagadougou attacks|attacked the capital city]] of [[Ouagadougou]], killing 30 people. [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] and [[Al-Mourabitoun (militant group)|Al-Mourabitoune]], which until then had mostly operated in neighbouring [[]], claimed responsibility for the attack.

In 2016, attacks increased after a new group [[Ansar ul Islam (Western Africa)|Ansarul Islam]], led by imam [[Ibrahim Malam Dicko]], was founded. Its attacks focused particularly on [[Soum Province|Soum province]] and it killed dozens of people in the [[Nassoumbou attack|attack on Nassoumbou]] on 16 December.

Between 27 March and 10 April 2017, the governments of [[]], , and  launched a joint operation named "Operation Panga", which involved 1,300 soldiers from the three countries, in the Fhero Forest, near the [[- border]], considered a sanctuary for Ansarul Islam. The head of Ansarul Islam, Ibrahim Malam Dicko, was killed in June 2017 and [[Jafar Dicko]] became leader.

On 2 March 2018, [[Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin]] [[2018 Ouagadougou attacks|attacked the  embassy]] in [[Ouagadougou]] as well as the general staff of the Burkinabè army. Eight soldiers and eight attackers were killed, and a further 61 soldiers and 24 civilians were injured. The insurgency expanded to the east of the country and, in early October, the Armed Forces of  launched a major military operation in the country's East, supported by  forces. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], between mid-2018 to February 2019, at least 42 people were murdered by jihadists and a minimum of 116 mostly Fulani civilians were killed by military forces without trial. The attacks [[2019 attacks in |increased significantly in 2019]]. According to the [[Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project|ACLED]], armed violence in  jumped by 174% in 2019, with nearly 1,300 civilians dead and 860,000 displaced. Jihadist groups also began to specifically target [[Christianity in |Christians]].
[[File:Des déplacés peuls sur le site de Barsalogho au petit matin, au , le 15 janvier 2019.png|thumb|Displaced Fulani civilians in the aftermath of the [[Yirgou massacre]]]]
On 8 July 2020, the  raised concerns after a [[Human Rights Watch]] report revealed mass graves with at least 180 bodies, which were found in northern  where soldiers were fighting jihadists. On 4 June 2021, the Associated Press reported that according to the government of , gunmen killed at least 100 people in Solhan village in northern  near the  border. A local market and several homes were also burned down. A government spokesman blamed jihadists. Heni Nsaibia, senior researcher at the [[Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project]] said it was the deadliest attack recorded in  since the beginning of the jihadist insurgency.{{fcn|date=July 2025}}

From 4–5 June 2021, unknown militants [[Solhan and Tadaryat massacres|massacred more than 170 people in the villages of Solhan and Tadaryat]]. Jihadists killed 80 people in [[Gorgadji Department|Gorgadji]] on 20 August. On 14 November, the [[Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin]] attacked a gendarmerie in [[Inata, |Inata]], killing 53 soldiers, the heaviest loss of life by the  military during the insurgency, and a major [[morale]] loss in the country. In December Islamists killed 41 people in an ambush, including the popular vigilante leader Ladji Yoro. Yoro was a central figure in the [[Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland]] (VDP) a pro-government militia that had taken a leading role in the struggle against Islamists.

In 2023, shortly after the murder of a Catholic priest by insurgents, the bishop of Dori, Laurent Dabiré, claimed in an interview with Catholic charity [[Aid to the Church in Need]] that around 50% of the country was in the hands of Islamists.

[[File:Alliance of Sahel States.svg|thumb|upright|The [[Alliance of Sahel States]] between ,  and ]]
In a successful coup on 24 January 2022, mutinying soldiers arrested and deposed President [[Roch Marc Christian Kaboré]] following gunfire. The [[Patriotic Movement for Safeguard and Restoration]] (MPSR) supported by the military declared itself to be in power, led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba]]. On 31 January, the military junta restored the constitution and appointed Damiba interim president. In the aftermath of the coup, [[Economic Community of West African States|ECOWAS]] and the [[African Union]] suspended 's membership. On 10 February, the Constitutional Council declared Damiba president. He was sworn in as president on 16 February. On 1 March 2022, the junta approved a charter allowing a military-led transition of 3 years. The charter provides for the transition process to be followed by the holding of elections. [[Roch Marc Christian Kaboré|President Kaboré]], who had been detained since the military junta took power, was released on 6 April 2022.

The insurgency continued following the coup, with about 60% of the country under government control. The [[Siege of Djibo]] began in February 2022 and continued as of June 2023. Between 100 and 165 people [[2022 Seytenga massacre|were killed]] in [[Seytenga Department]], [[Séno Province]] on 12–13 June and around 16,000 people fled their homes. In June 2022, the Government announced the creation of "military zones", which civilians were required to vacate so that the country's Armed and Security Forces could fight insurgents without any "hindrances".

On 30 September 2022, Damiba was ousted in a military coup led by Capt. [[Ibrahim Traoré]]. This came eight months after Damiba had seized power. The rationale given by Traoré for the coup d'état was the purported inability of Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba to deal with an Islamist insurgency. Damiba resigned and left the country. On 6 October 2022, Captain Ibrahim Traoré was officially appointed as president. [[Apollinaire Joachim Kyélem de Tambèla]] was appointed interim Prime Minister on 21 October 2022.

On 13 April 2023, authorities in  declared a mobilisation in order to give the nation all means necessary to combat terrorism and create a "legal framework for all the actions to be taken" against the insurgents in recapturing 40% of the national territory from Islamist insurgents. On 20 April, the Rapid Intervention Brigade committed the [[Karma massacre]], rounding up and executing civilians ''en masse''. Between 60 and 156 civilians were killed.

On 25 August 2024, [[Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin|JNIM]] again launched [[2024 Barsalogho attack|a major attack]] in the region of [[Barsalogho Department|Barsalogho]], killing at least 400 people.

In 2025, the armed forces foiled an attempted coup which they said had been planned by plotters based in the [[]]. Thousands rallied in Ouagadougou in support of the military government after the foiled coup plot. In May, reports of a digital [[cult]] around Traoré began to surface.

The islands of the Caribbean were first settled around 6,000 years ago by hunter-gatherer peoples originating from Central America or northern South America. The [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan-speaking]] ancestors of the [[Taíno]] moved into the Caribbean from South America during the 1st millennium BCE, reaching Hispaniola by around 600 CE. These Arawakan peoples engaged in farming, fishing, hunting and gathering, and the widespread production of [[ceramic]] goods.

The estimates of Hispaniola's population in 1492 vary widely, ranging from tens of thousands to 2 million.

By 1492, the island was divided into five Taíno chiefdoms. The Taíno name for the entire island was either ''Ayiti'' or ''Quisqueya''.

===European colonization===
[[File:Basílica Menor de Santa María SD RD 02 2017 1947.jpg|thumb|[[Catedral Santa María La Menor]] is the oldest cathedral built in the Americas]]
[[Christopher Columbus]] arrived on the island on December 5, 1492, during the first of his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|four voyages]] to the Americas. He claimed the land for  and named it ''La Española'', due to its diverse climate and terrain, which reminded him of the [[|]] landscape. In 1496, [[Bartholomew Columbus]], Christopher's brother, built the city of [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Santo Domingo]], Western Europe's first permanent settlement in the "[[New World]]". The Spaniards created a [[plantation economy]].

Initially, after friendly relationships, the Taínos resisted the conquest, led by female Chief [[Anacaona]] of Xaragua and her ex-husband Chief [[Caonabo]] of Maguana, as well as Chiefs [[Guacanagaríx]], [[Guamá]], [[Hatuey]], and [[Enriquillo]]. The latter's successes gained his people an autonomous enclave on the island. Within a few years after 1492, the population of Taínos had declined drastically due to [[smallpox]], measles, and other diseases that arrived with the Europeans. African slaves were imported to replace the dwindling Taínos.

The last record of pure Taínos in the country was from 1864. Still, Taíno biological heritage survived due to intermixing. Census records from 1514 reveal that 40% of  men in Santo Domingo were married to Taíno women, and some present-day  have Taíno ancestry.

[[File:Treaty of Aranjuez .svg|thumb|Map showing the border situation on Hispaniola following the [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1777)]]]]
By the time of the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] in 1697, which ceded the western one-third of the island to , the population of Santo Domingo consisted of a few thousand whites, approximately 30,000 black slaves, and a few Taínos.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=341}} By 1789, the population had grown to 125,000, but Santo Domingo remained one of 's less wealthy and strategically important colonies in the New World.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=341}} The population composition of Santo Domingo sharply contrasted with that of the neighboring  colony of [[-Domingue]]—the wealthiest colony in the Caribbean and whose population of half a million was 90% enslaved and four times as numerous as Santo Domingo.

In 1795,  ceded Santo Domingo to  by the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]] as a result of its defeat in the [[War of the Pyrenees]]. -Domingue achieved independence as  from  on January 1, 1804.

[[File:LaTrinitaria.jpg|thumb|In 1838, [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] and others established a secret patriotic society called ''[[La Trinitaria ()|La Trinitaria]]'', which helped undermine  occupation.]]
After a dozen years of discontent and failed independence plots by various opposing groups, including a [[1812 Mendoza and Mojarra conspiracy|failed 1812 revolt]] led by [[Freedman|freedmen]], Santo Domingo's former Lieutenant-Governor (top administrator), [[José Núñez de Cáceres]], declared the colony's independence from the [[ Empire| crown]] as [[Republic of  | ]], on November 30, 1821. This period is also known as the Ephemeral independence.

The newly independent republic ended two months later, when it was occupied and annexed by , then under the leadership of [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]]. For twenty-two years,  controlled Santo Domingo, which it called ''Partie de l'Est'', treating it as a colonial territory. The unpaid  army sustained itself by taking resources from the  people and land without compensation.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=343}}

===First Republic (1844–1861)===
[[File:Flag of the  (up to 1844).svg|thumb|Original [[flag of the ]] (up to 1849)]]
In 1838, [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] founded a secret society called [[La Trinitaria ()|La Trinitaria]], which sought the complete independence of Santo Domingo without any foreign intervention.{{rp|p147–149}} Also [[Francisco del Rosario Sánchez]] and [[Ramon Matias Mella]], despite not being among the founding members of La Trinitaria, were decisive in the fight for independence. Duarte, Mella, and Sánchez are considered the Founding Fathers of the .

On February 27, 1844, the members of ''La Trinitaria'' declared independence from . They were backed by [[Pedro Santana]], a wealthy cattle rancher, who became general of the army of the nascent republic. The decades that followed were filled with tyranny, factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of government, and exile for political opponents. Archrivals Santana and [[Buenaventura Báez]] held power most of the time, both ruling arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new nation to a major power. The 's first [[Constitution of the |constitution]] was adopted on November 6, 1844, and its population  in 1845 was approximately 230,000 people (100,000 whites; 40,000 blacks; and 90,000 mulattoes).{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=343}}

By April 15,  forces had defeated the  forces on both land and sea.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=344}} In early July 1844, Duarte was urged by his followers to take the title of President of the Republic. Duarte agreed, but only if free elections were arranged. However, Santana's forces took Santo Domingo on July 12, and they declared Santana ruler of the . Santana then put Mella, Duarte, and Sánchez in jail. On February 27, 1845, Santana executed [[María  Sánchez]], heroine of La Trinitaria, and others for conspiracy.

After defeating a third  invasion in April 1849 at the [[Battle of Las Carreras]], Santana marched on Santo Domingo and deposed president [[Manuel Jimenes]] (who had ousted Santana as president) in a [[coup d'état]]. At his behest, Congress elected Buenaventura Báez as president, but Báez was unwilling to serve as Santana's puppet. In November–December 1849,  seamen raided the  coasts, plundered seaside villages, as far as [[Dame-Marie, Grand'Anse|Dame Marie]], and butchered crews of captured enemy ships. A fourth and final invasion by  in November 1855 was defeated by  forces by January 27, 1856, resulting in thousands of  casualties.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=347}} Again Santana and Báez plotted against each other for political dominance, with Báez winning the first encounter and expelling Santana in 1857, and Santana winning the second and expelling Báez in 1859.

===Restoration republic===

In 1861, after imprisoning, exiling, and executing many of his opponents and due to political and economic reasons, Santana asked Queen [[Isabella II of ]] to retake control of the . , which had not come to terms with the loss of its mainland  colonies 40 years earlier, [[Annexation of the  to |annexed the country]].

[[File:Monumento a los Héroes de la Restauración 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|"Monument to the Heroes of the Restoration"]]
By 1865, the  forces had confined the  troops to Santo Domingo, and the Spaniards were afraid to venture outside the capital.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=349}} After nearly two years of fighting,  abandoned the island in July 1865. One military historian estimates  casualties at 10,888 killed or wounded in action and thousands dead from [[yellow fever]], while the  forces fighting for  suffered 10,000 casualties.{{sfn|Clodfelter|2017|p=306}} Another military historian estimates that  lost 18,000 dead, a figure that does not include the , , and Puerto Ricans fighting alongside them.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=349}} The  fighting for independence against  suffered more than 4,000 dead.

Political strife again prevailed in the following years; warlords ruled, military revolts were extremely common, and the nation amassed debt. It was now Báez's turn to act on his [[Proposed annexation of Santo Domingo|plan of annexing the country to the ]], where two successive presidents were supportive. U.S. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] desired a naval base at [[Samaná Bay|Samaná]] and also a place for resettling newly freed African . The treaty was defeated in the [[ Senate]] in 1870. Báez was toppled in 1874, returned, and was toppled for good in 1878.

Relative peace came to the country in the 1880s, which saw the coming to power of General [[Ulises Heureaux]]. "Lilís", as the new president was nicknamed, put the nation deep into debt while using much of the proceeds for his personal use and to maintain his police state. In 1899, he was assassinated. However, the relative calm over which he presided allowed improvement in the  economy. The sugar industry was modernized,{{rp|p10}} and the country attracted foreign workers and immigrants. , , Turks, and  began to arrive in the country during the latter part of the 19th century. During the U.S. occupation of 1916–24, peasants from the countryside, called Gavilleros, would not only kill U.S. Marines, but would also attack and kill Arab vendors traveling through the countryside.

===20th century (1900–1930)===
[[File:Alejandro Woss y Gil.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Alejandro Woss y Gil]] taking office in 1903]]
From 1902 on, short-lived governments were again the norm, with their power usurped by caudillos in parts of the country. Furthermore, the national government was bankrupt and, unable to pay its debts to European creditors, faced the threat of military intervention by , [[ Empire|]], and [[Kingdom of |]].  President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sought to prevent European intervention, largely to protect the routes to the future [[ Canal]]. He made a small military intervention to ward off European powers, to proclaim his famous [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], and also to obtain his 1905  agreement for U.S. administration of  customs, which was the chief source of income for the  government. A 1906 agreement provided for the arrangement to last 50 years. The  agreed to use part of the customs proceeds to reduce the immense foreign debt of the  and assumed responsibility for said debt.

After six years in power, President [[Ramón Cáceres]] (who had himself assassinated Heureaux) was assassinated in 1911. The result was several years of great political instability and [[ Civil War (1911–1912)|civil war]]. U.S. mediation by the [[William Howard Taft]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] administrations achieved only a short respite each time. A political deadlock in 1914 was broken after an ultimatum by Wilson telling the  to choose a president or see the U.S. impose one. A provisional president was chosen, and later the same year relatively free elections put former president (1899–1902) [[Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra]] back in power. With his former [[Secretary of War]] [[Desiderio Arias]] maneuvering to depose him and despite a U.S. offer of military aid against Arias, Jimenes resigned on May 7, 1916. Wilson thus ordered the U.S. occupation of the .

U.S. Marines landed on May 16, 1916, and seized the capital and other ports, while General Arias fell back to his inland Santiago stronghold.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=49}} A significant weaponry disparity led to Arias's defeat as his forces tried to block the Marines' advance on Santiago with trenches and black-powder rifles. The clashes with the U.S. Marines marked the first time the  had ever encountered a machine gun.{{sfn|Musicant|1990|p=252}} A peace delegation from Santiago surrendered the city on July 5, coinciding with General Arias' surrender to the  governor. The military government established by the U.S. under the Navy and Marine Corps on November 29, led by Vice Admiral [[Harry Shepard Knapp]], was widely repudiated by the , but organized resistance ceased.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=52}}

The occupation regime kept most  laws and institutions and largely pacified the general population. The occupying government also revived the  economy, reduced the nation's debt, built a road network that at last interconnected all regions of the country, and created a professional National Guard to replace the warring partisan units. Additionally, with grass-roots support from local communities and assistance from both  and US officials, the  education system expanded significantly during US occupation. Between 1918 and 1920, more than three hundred schools were established nationwide. The system of forced labour used by the [[ occupation of |Marines in ]] was largely absent in the .{{sfn|Gleijeses|1978|p=17}}

The U.S. government's rule ended in October 1922, and elections were held in March 1924. The victor was former president (1902–03) [[Horacio Vásquez]]. He was inaugurated on July 13, 1924, and the last U.S. forces left in September.{{sfn|Musicant|1990|p=284}} In 1930, General [[Rafael Trujillo]], who was trained by the U.S. Marines during the occupation, seized power following a military revolt against the government of Vásquez.

Trujillo consolidated his power after [[Hurricane San Zenón]] devastated Santo Domingo in September 1930, killing 8,000 people. A few of the former caudillos initially opposed the new dictator. General Cipriano Bencosme led an uprising but was defeated and killed in November 1930 during a confrontation with the army near Puerto Plata. General Desiderio Arias was also unsuccessful, dying in combat near [[Mao, |Mao]] in June of the following year.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1978|p=22}}

===Trujillo Era (1930–1961)===
[[File:Rafael L. Trujillo en la silla presidencial (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rafael Trujillo]] imposed a dictatorship of 31 years (1930–1961).]]
There was considerable economic growth during [[Rafael Trujillo]]'s long and iron-fisted regime, although a great deal of the wealth was taken by the dictator and other regime elements. There was progress in healthcare, education, and transportation, with the building of hospitals, clinics, schools, roads, and harbors. Trujillo also carried out an important housing construction program and instituted a pension plan. He finally negotiated an undisputed border with  in 1935, and achieved the end of the 50-year customs agreement in 1941, well before it would have expired in 1956. He made the country debt-free in 1947. This was accompanied most noticeably by absolute repression and the copious use of murder, torture, and terrorist methods against the opposition.

Several  were assassinated in [[New York City]] after taking part in anti-Trujillo activities. In October 1937,  troops murdered 10,000 to 15,000  men, women, and children—mostly with machetes—along the - border under the orders of Trujillo.

During [[World War II]], Trujillo symbolically sided with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. During the course of the war,  U-boats torpedoed and sank two  merchant vessels—the ''San Rafael'' off the coast of , and the ''[[SS Presidente Trujillo|Presidente Trujillo]]'' off [[Fort-de-]]—along with four other -manned ships in the Caribbean. The country did not make a military contribution to the war, but  sugar and other agricultural products supported the Allied war effort, and the  also accepted Jewish refugees [[Évian Conference|fleeing Nazi persecution]].

The arsenal at [[San Cristóbal Province|San Cristóbal]], operated under Trujillo's regime, produced rifles, machine guns, and ammunition.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=175}} Trujillo also formed a Foreign Legion of 3,000 mercenaries to attempt to overthrow [[Fidel Castro]] in . Major [[William Alexander Morgan|William Morgan]] agreed to lead the attack for $1 million, but Castro learned of the plot and instructed Morgan to go along with it and report back. Trujillo was tricked into believing that Morgan had captured [[, |]]. On August 13, 1959, a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] transport flying from the  carrying military advisors and supplies landed at  airport. Castro seized the aircraft and the ten occupants and arrested some 4,000 suspects throughout .{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=240}} Earlier in June,  soldiers and -trained  guerrillas attempted an unsuccessful invasion of the . Between 1946 and 1949, the  government purchased military aircraft and warships from the  government, which were used to defeat the invasion by air and sea.

On November 25, 1960, Trujillo's henchmen killed three of the four [[Mirabal sisters]], nicknamed ''Las Mariposas'' (The Butterflies). Along with their husbands, the sisters were conspiring to overthrow Trujillo in a violent revolt. The [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]] is observed on the anniversary of their deaths.

For a long time, the U.S. and the  elite supported the Trujillo government. This support persisted despite the assassinations of political opposition, the [[parsley massacre|massacre of ]], and Trujillo's plots against other countries. The U.S. finally broke with Trujillo in 1960, after Trujillo's agents attempted to assassinate the  president [[Rómulo Betancourt]] with a car bomb, as he was a fierce critic of Trujillo. The assassination attempt in [[Caracas]] wounded the  president and his Minister of Defense, and killed an air force colonel and a policeman. During Betancourt's earlier exile in , Trujillo's agents attempted to inject poison into him on a Havana street in broad daylight.

After its representatives confirmed Trujillo's complicity in the nearly successful assassination attempt, the [[Organization of  States]] (OAS), for the first time in its history, decreed sanctions against a member state.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1978|p=28}} The OAS voted unanimously to condemn the  for its aggression and imposed an arms embargo.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=256}} The  severed diplomatic relations with the  on August 26, 1960, and in January 1961 suspended the export of trucks, parts, crude oil, gasoline and other petroleum products. U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] also took advantage of OAS sanctions to drastically cut purchases of  sugar, the country's major export. This action ultimately cost the  almost $22,000,000 in lost revenues at a time when its economy was in a rapid decline. Trujillo had become expendable, and dissidents inside the  argued that assassination was the only certain way to remove him.

On May 30, 1961, Trujillo was shot and killed by  dissidents during a car chase.

===Post-Trujillo (1961–1996)===
[[File:Juan Bosch (1963).jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]], the first democratically elected president after Trujillo]] After the assassination, [[Ramfis Trujillo]], the dictator's son, remained in de facto control of the government for the next 6 months, as commander of the armed forces. Trujillo's brothers, Hector Bienvenido and Jose Arismendi Trujillo, returned to the country and plotted against President Balaguer. On November 18, 1961, as a planned coup became more evident, U.S. Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] issued a warning that the US would not "remain idle" if the Trujillos attempted to "reassert dictatorial domination". Following this warning, and the arrival of a 14-vessel U.S. naval task force within sight of Santo Domingo, Ramfis and his uncles fled the country on November 19. The OAS lifted its sanctions on January 4, 1962.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1978|p=62}}

In February 1963, a democratically elected government under leftist [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] took office but it was overthrown by a military coup in September. On April 24, 1965, a second military coup ousted the military-installed president [[Donald Reid Cabral]].{{sfn|Musicant|1990|p=363}} Despite tank assaults, [[strafing]], and aerial bombardment by the opposing Loyalists, the pro-Bosch Constitutionalists maintained control of most of the capital. By April 26, 5,000 armed civilians outnumbered the 1,500 original rebel military regulars. Radio Santo Domingo, now fully under rebel control, began to call for more violent actions and the killing of all police officers.

On April 28, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] deployed U.S. Marines from [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] to Santo Domingo to protect  citizens, with U.S. forces subsequently expanded to 24,000 troops. On April 30, two battalions of the [[82nd Airborne Division]] landed at [[San Isidro Air Base|San Isidro airfield]]. Hours later, U.S. troops crossed the Duarte Bridge to link up with Loyalists, who were to secure a corridor for the Marines guarding the U.S. Embassy. However, the Loyalists withdrew to San Isidro airfield instead.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=276}} On May 2, U.S. forces were authorized to link up, and the outgunned Constitutionalists retreated to the southeastern part of the city. A ceasefire was declared on May 5. The following day, U.S. diplomats persuaded the OAS to establish an [[Inter- Peace Force]] to support  troops. The following countries volunteered:  (1,250 soldiers),  (25 police),  (250 soldiers),  (164 soldiers), and  (286 soldiers).{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=277}}

U.S. and OAS peacekeeping troops remained in the country for over a year and left after supervising elections in 1966 won by [[Joaquín Balaguer]]. He had been Trujillo's last puppet-president. Balaguer remained in power as president for 12 years. His tenure was a period of repression of human rights and civil liberties. His rule was criticized for a growing disparity between rich and poor. It was, however, praised for an ambitious infrastructure program, which included construction of large housing projects, sports complexes, theaters, museums, aqueducts, roads, highways, and the massive [[Columbus Lighthouse]], completed in 1992 during a later tenure.

In 1978, Balaguer was succeeded to the presidency by opposition candidate [[Antonio Guzmán Fernández]], of the [[ Revolutionary Party]] (PRD). [[Hurricane David]] hit the  in August 1979, which left upwards of 2,000 people dead and 200,000 homeless. The hurricane caused over $1 billion in damage. Another PRD win in 1982 followed, under [[Salvador Jorge Blanco]]. Balaguer regained the presidency in 1986 and was re-elected in 1990 and 1994, in the latter defeating PRD candidate [[José Francisco Peña Gómez]], a former mayor of Santo Domingo.<!--some info needs to be added about Balaguer's performance 1986-96--> The 1994 elections were flawed, bringing international pressure, to which Balaguer responded by scheduling another presidential contest in 1996. Balaguer was not a candidate. The PSRC candidate was his Vice President [[Jacinto Peynado Garrigosa]].

===1996–present===
In 1996, with the support of Joaquín Balaguer and the Social Christian Reform Party in a coalition called the Patriotic Front, [[Leonel Fernández]] achieved the first-ever win for the [[ Liberation Party]] (PLD), which Bosch had founded in 1973 after leaving the PRD. Fernández oversaw a fast-growing economy: growth averaged 7.7% per year, unemployment fell, and exchange and inflation rates were stable.

[[File:Protestas dominicanas en Santo Domingo 2020.jpg|thumb|[[2020  protests]] in Plaza de La Bandera, Santo Domingo]]
In 2000, the PRD's [[Hipólito Mejía]] won the election. This was a time of economic troubles. Under Mejía, the  participated in the US-led coalition, as part of the Multinational [[Plus Ultra Brigade]], during the 2003 [[ War|invasion of ]], suffering no casualties. In 2008, Fernández was elected for a third term. Fernández and the PLD are credited with initiatives that moved the country forward technologically. His administrations were accused of corruption.

[[Danilo Medina]] of the PLD was elected president in 2012 and re-elected in 2016. A significant increase in crime, government corruption and a weak justice system threatened to overshadow their administrative period. He was succeeded by the opposition candidate [[Luis Abinader]] in the [[2020  general election|2020 election]] (weeks after [[2020  protests|protests erupted in the country]] against Medina's government), marking the end to 16 years in power of the centre-left  Liberation Party (PLD). In May 2024, President Luis Abinader won a second term in the [[2024  general election|elections]]. His tough policies towards migration from neighbouring  was popular among voters.

Its borders were defined after the capture of the hinterland by  forces and signing agreements with  and Britain. In 1905, this became the  colony of [[Togoland]].

=== Independence ===
The  Republic was proclaimed on 27 April 1960. In the [[ general election, 1961]], [[Sylvanus Olympio]] became the first president, gaining 100 per cent of the vote in elections boycotted by the opposition. On 9 April 1961, the Constitution of the  Republic was adopted, according to which the supreme legislative body was the [[National Assembly of ]]. In December 1961, leaders of opposition parties were arrested because they were accused of the preparation of an anti-government conspiracy. A decree was issued on the dissolution of the opposition parties. Olympio tried to reduce dependence on  by establishing cooperation with the , , and [[West ]]. He rejected the efforts of  soldiers who were demobilized after the [[ War]] and tried to get a position in the  army. These factors eventually led to a military coup on 13 January 1963 during which he was [[assassinate]]d by a group of soldiers under the direction of Sergeant [[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]]. A state of emergency was declared in . The military handed over power to an interim government led by [[Nicolas Grunitzky]]. In May 1963, Grunitzky was elected President of the Republic. The new leadership pursued a policy of developing relations with . His main aim was to dampen the divisions between north and south, promulgate a new constitution, and introduce a multiparty system.

On 13 January 1967, Eyadéma overthrew Grunitzky in a bloodless coup and assumed the presidency. He created the [[Rally of the  People|Rally of the  People Party]], banned activities of other political parties and introduced a [[one-party system]] in November 1969. He was reelected in 1979 and 1986. In 1983, the [[privatization]] program launched and in 1991 other political parties were allowed. In 1993, the [[European Union]] froze the partnership, describing Eyadéma's re-election in 1993, 1998 and 2003, as a seizure of power. In April 2004, in [[Brussels]], talks were held between the EU and  on the resumption of cooperation.

Eyadéma Gnassingbé died on Saturday, 5 February 2005. The military's installation of his son, [[Faure Gnassingbé]], as president provoked international condemnation, except from . Some "democratically elected" African leaders such as [[Abdoulaye Wade]] of [[]] and [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] of [[]] supported the move, creating a rift within the [[African Union]]. Gnassingbé left power and held elections, which he won two months later. The opposition declared that the election results were fraudulent. The events of 2005 led to questions regarding the government's commitment to [[democracy]] that had been made in an attempt to normalize relations with the EU which cut off [[aid]] in 1993 due to questions about 's human rights situation. Up to 400 people were killed in the violence surrounding the presidential elections, according to the UN. Around 40,000  fled to neighbouring countries. Gnassingbé was reelected in 2010 and 2015.

=== Pre-Columbian ===
The first evidence of human habitation in  dates to 12,000 BC. Archaeological evidence, such as [[obsidian]] [[arrowhead]]s found in various parts of the country, suggests a human presence as early as 18,000 BC. There is archaeological proof that early  settlers were [[hunter-gatherers]]. [[Maize]] cultivation had been developed by the people by 3500 BC. Sites dating to 6500 BC have been found in the [[Quiché department|Quiché]] region in the Highlands, and [[Sipacate]] and [[Escuintla]] on the central Pacific coast.

Archaeologists divide the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] history of Mesoamerica into the Preclassic period (3000 BC to 250 AD), the Classic period (250 to 900 AD), and the Postclassic period (900 to 1500 AD). Until recently, the Preclassic was regarded by researchers as a formative period, in which the peoples typically lived in huts in small villages of farmers, with few permanent buildings. This notion has been challenged since the late 20th century by discoveries of monumental architecture from that period, such as the [[Mirador Basin]] cities of [[Nakbé]], Xulnal, [[El Tintal]], Wakná and [[El Mirador]].

[[File:Tikal mayan ruins 2009.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.35|Maya city of [[Tikal]]]]
The Classic period of [[Mesoamerican]] civilization corresponds to the height of the [[Maya civilization]]. It is represented by countless sites throughout , although the largest concentration is in [[Petén Basin|Petén]]. This period is characterized by urbanization, the emergence of independent city-states, and contact with other Mesoamerican cultures.

This lasted until approximately 900 AD, when the [[Classic Maya collapse|Classic Maya civilization collapsed]]. The Maya abandoned many of the cities of the central lowlands or died during a drought-induced [[famine]]. The cause of the collapse is debated, but the drought theory is gaining currency, supported by evidence such as lakebeds, ancient pollen, and others. A series of prolonged droughts in what is otherwise a seasonal desert is thought to have decimated the Maya, who relied on regular rainfall to support their dense population.{{sfn|Foster|2000}}

The Post-Classic period is represented by regional kingdoms, such as the [[Itza people|Itza]], [[Kowoj]], [[Yalain]] and [[Kejache]] in Petén, and the [[Mam people|Mam]], [[K'iche' people|Ki'che']], [[Kaqchikel people|Kackchiquel]], [[Chajoma]], [[Tz'utujil people|Tz'utujil]], [[Poqomchi' people|Poqomchi']], [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi']] and [[Ch'orti' people|Ch'orti']] peoples in the highlands. Their cities preserved many aspects of Maya culture.

The Maya civilization shares many features with other Mesoamerican civilizations due to the high degree of interaction and [[cultural diffusion]] that characterized the region. Advances such as writing, [[epigraphy]], and the [[Maya calendar|calendar]] did not originate with the Maya; however, their civilization fully developed them. Maya influence can be detected from [[]], [[]], , and Northern [[]] to as far north as central , more than {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[Geography of Mesoamerica#Maya Region|Maya area]]. Many outside influences are found in [[Maya art]] and architecture, which are thought to have resulted from trade and cultural exchange rather than direct external conquest.

The [[ conquest of ]] began in the early 16th century, led by conquistador [[Pedro de Alvarado]], who was appointed by [[Hernán Cortés]] to extend  control into [[Central America]]. In 1523–1524, Alvarado launched a military campaign into the [[ Highlands| highlands]], initially allying with the [[Kaqchikel language|Kaqchikel Maya]] to defeat their rivals, the [[Kʼicheʼ people|K'iche' (Quiché) Maya]]. However, relations with the Kaqchikel soon deteriorated, leading to further conflict and eventual  dominance over the region.

The  incursion introduced devastating epidemics, including [[smallpox]], which significantly reduced the indigenous population even before full military conquest was achieved. In 1524, the  established their first capital, Villa de Santiago de , near the ruins of [[Iximche|Iximché]], the former [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] capital. This settlement was later relocated to the [[Ciudad Vieja|Almolonga Valley]] (present-day [[Ciudad Vieja]]) in 1527 due to indigenous resistance.

On 11 September 1541, a catastrophic [[lahar]] from [[Volcán de Agua]] destroyed [[Ciudad Vieja]], prompting the relocation of the capital to the Panchoy Valley, where it was renamed [[Santiago de los Caballeros de ]] (now [[Antigua ]]). In 1542, the region was formally organized as the [[Captaincy General of ]] (Capitanía General de ), a subdivision of the [[New |Viceroyalty of New ]]. This administrative unit encompassed present-day , [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], and the [[|]] state of [[Chiapas]].

Due to its strategic location on the [[Pacific coast]],  became integrated into the [[Manila galleon|Manila Galleon]] trade network, which connected  colonies in [[Asia]] and [[Americas|the Americas]] between 1565 and 1815. Goods such as silver, porcelain, silk, and spices passed through  en route between [[Manila]] and [[Acapulco]].

In 1773, the [[1773  earthquake|Santa Marta earthquakes]] devastated [[Antigua ]], leading to the relocation of the capital to its current site in the [[ City|Ermita Valley]]. The new city, officially founded in 1776, became known as [[ City|La Nueva ]] de la Asunción (modern-day  City).

This region was formally a part of the [[New |Viceroyalty of New ]] throughout the colonial period, but as a practical matter had been administered separately from . It was not until 1825 that  created its own flag.

In 1838, the liberal forces of  leader [[Francisco Morazán]] and  [[José Francisco Barrundia]] invaded  and reached San Sur, where they executed Chúa Alvarez, father-in-law of [[Rafael Carrera]], then a military commander and later the first president of .

After sending several envoys, whom Carrera would not receive – and especially not Barrundia whom Carrera did not want to murder in cold blood – Morazán began a scorched-earth offensive, destroying villages in his path and stripping them of assets. The Carrera forces had to hide in the mountains.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=86}} Believing Carrera totally defeated, Morazán and Barrundia marched to [[ City]], and were welcomed as saviors by state governor Pedro Valenzuela and members of the conservative {{Interlanguage link|Aycinena clan|es|Clan Aycinena}}, who proposed to sponsor one of the liberal battalions, while Valenzuela and Barrundia gave Morazán all the  resources needed to solve any financial problem he had.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=87}} The [[criollo people|criollos]] of both parties celebrated until dawn that they finally had a criollo caudillo like Morazán, who was able to crush the peasant rebellion.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=88}}

Morazán used the proceeds to support Los Altos and then replaced Valenzuela with [[Mariano Rivera Paz]], a member of the Aycinena clan, although he did not return to that clan any property confiscated in 1829. In revenge, [[Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol]] voted to dissolve the [[Central  Federation]] in [[San Salvador]] a little later, forcing Morazán to return to  to fight for his federal mandate. Along the way, Morazán increased repression in eastern , as punishment for helping Carrera.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=89}} Knowing that Morazán had gone to , Carrera tried to take [[Salamá]] with the small force that remained, but was defeated, and lost his brother Laureano in combat. With just a few men left, he managed to escape, badly wounded, to [[Sanarate]].{{sfn|González Davison|2008|pp=91-92}} After recovering somewhat, he attacked a detachment in [[Jutiapa]] and got a small amount of booty which he gave to the volunteers who accompanied him.

In September of that year, Carrera attempted an assault on the capital of , but the liberal general [[Carlos Salazar Castro]] defeated him in the fields of [[Villa Nueva, |Villa Nueva]] and Carrera had to retreat.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959|p=20 April}} After unsuccessfully trying to take [[Quetzaltenango]], Carrera found himself both surrounded and wounded. He had to capitulate to  General [[Agustín Guzmán]], who had been in Quetzaltenango since [[Vicente Filísola]]'s arrival in 1823. Morazán had the opportunity to shoot Carrera, but did not, because he needed the support of the  peasants to counter the attacks of [[Francisco Ferrera]] in [[]]. Instead, Morazán left Carrera in charge of a small fort in Mita, without any weapons. Knowing that Morazán was going to attack , Francisco Ferrera gave arms and ammunition to Carrera and convinced him to attack  City.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=96}}

Meanwhile, despite insistent advice to definitively crush Carrera and his forces, Salazar tried to negotiate with him diplomatically; he even went as far as to show that he neither feared nor distrusted Carrera by removing the fortifications of the  capital, in place since the battle of Villa Nueva.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959|p=20 April}} Taking advantage of Salazar's good faith and Ferrera's weapons, Carrera took  City by surprise on 13 April 1839; Salazar, [[Mariano Gálvez]] and Barrundia fled before the arrival of Carrera's militiamen.

In the meantime, Carrera decided to return to  and did so, entering at [[Huehuetenango]], where he met with native leaders and told them that they must remain united to prevail; the leaders agreed and slowly the segregated native communities started developing a new  identity under Carrera's leadership.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}} In the meantime, in the eastern part of , the [[Jalapa]] region became increasingly dangerous; former president [[Mariano Rivera Paz]] and rebel leader Vicente Cruz were both murdered there after trying to take over the Corregidor office in 1849.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}}

When Carrera arrived to [[Chiantla]] in [[Huehuetenango]], he received two altenses emissaries who told him that their soldiers were not going to fight his forces because that would lead to a native revolt, much like that of 1840; their only request from Carrera was to keep the natives under control.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}} The altenses did not comply, and led by Guzmán and his forces, they started chasing Carrera; the caudillo hid, helped by his native allies and remained under their protection when the forces of [[Miguel Garcia Granados]] arrived from [[ City]] looking for him.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}}

On learning that officer [[José Víctor Zavala]] had been appointed as Corregidor in Suchitepéquez, Carrera and his hundred [[jakaltek people|jacalteco]] bodyguards crossed a dangerous jungle infested with [[jaguar]]s to meet his former friend. Zavala not only did not capture him, he agreed to serve under his orders, thus sending a strong message to both liberal and conservatives in  City that they would have to negotiate with Carrera or battle on two fronts – Quetzaltenango and Jalapa.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=278}} Carrera went back to the Quetzaltenango area, while Zavala remained in Suchitepéquez as a tactical maneuver.{{sfn|González Davison|2008}} Carrera received a visit from a cabinet member of Paredes and told him that he had control of the native population and that he assured Paredes that he would keep them appeased.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=278}} When the emissary returned to  City, he told the president everything Carrera said, and added that the native forces were formidable.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=279}}

Guzmán went to [[Antigua, |Antigua]] to meet with another group of Paredes emissaries; they agreed that Los Altos would rejoin , and that the latter would help Guzmán defeat his enemy and also build a port on the Pacific Ocean.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=279}} Guzmán was sure of victory this time, but his plan evaporated when in his absence Carrera and his native allies occupied Quetzaltenango; Carrera appointed Ignacio Yrigoyen as [[Corregidor (position)|Corregidor]] and convinced him that he should work with the K'iche', Q'anjobal and [[Mam people|Mam]] leaders to keep the region under control.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=280}} On his way out, Yrigoyen murmured to a friend: "Now he is the king of the , indeed!"{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=280}}

Guzmán then left for Jalapa, where he struck a deal with the rebels, while [[Luis Batres Juarros]] convinced President Paredes to deal with Carrera. Back in  City within a few months, Carrera was commander-in-chief, backed by military and political support of the  communities from the densely populated western highlands.{{sfn|Weaver|1999|p=138}} During the first presidency, from 1844 to 1848, he brought the country back from excessive conservatism to a moderate regime, and – with the advice of Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol and [[Pedro de Aycinena]] – restored relations with the Church in Rome with a [[Concordat of 1854|Concordat]] ratified in 1854.{{sfn|Calvert|1985|p=36}}

==== Second Carrera government (1851–1865) ====
[[File:Carrerayturcios 2014-06-22 09-46.jpg|thumb|upright|Captain General [[Rafael Carrera]] after being appointed president for Life in 1854]]

After Carrera returned from exile in 1849 the president of , [[Doroteo Vasconcelos]], granted asylum to the  liberals, who harassed the  government in several different ways. José Francisco Barrundia established a liberal newspaper for that specific purpose. Vasconcelos supported a rebel faction named "La Montaña" in eastern , providing and distributing money and weapons. By late 1850, Vasconcelos was getting impatient at the slow progress of the war with  and decided to plan an open attack. Under that circumstance, the Salvadorean head of state started a campaign against the conservative  regime, inviting [[]] and [[]] to participate in the alliance; only the [[|]] government led by [[Juan Lindo]] accepted.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930}} In 1851  defeated an Allied army from  and  at the [[Battle of La Arada]].

In 1854 Carrera was declared "supreme and perpetual leader of the nation" for life, with the power to choose his successor. He held that position until he died on 14 April 1865. While he pursued some measures to set up a foundation for economic prosperity to please the conservative landowners, military challenges at home and a three-year war with , , and  dominated his presidency.

His rivalry with Gerardo Barrios, President of , resulted in open war in 1863. At [[Coatepeque, Quetzaltenango|Coatepeque]] the  suffered a [[Battle of Coatepeque|severe defeat]], which was followed by a truce.  joined with , and  and  with . The contest was finally settled in favor of Carrera, who besieged and occupied [[San Salvador]], and dominated  and . He continued to act in concert with the Clerical Party, and tried to maintain friendly relations with European governments. Before he died, Carrera nominated his friend and loyal soldier, Army Marshall [[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]], as his successor.

==== Vicente Cerna y Cerna regime (1865–1871) ====
[[File:VicenteCerna.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]] was the president of  from 1865 to 1871.]]
{{Further|Vicente Cerna y Cerna}}
[[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]] was [[president of ]] from 24 May 1865 to 29 June 1871. Liberal author {{Interlanguage link|Alfonso Enrique Barrientos|es}},{{sfn|Barrientos|1948|p=106}} described Marshall Cerna's government in the following manner:{{sfn|Barrientos|1948|p=106}}

{{blockquote|A conservative and archaic government, badly organized and with worse intentions, was in charge of the country, centralizing all powers in Vicente Cerna, ambitious military man, who not happy with the general rank, had promoted himself to the Army Marshall rank, even though that rank did not exist and it does not exist in the  military. The Marshall called himself President of the Republic, but in reality he was the foreman of oppressed and savaged people, cowardly enough that they had not dared to tell the dictator to leave threatening him with a revolution.}}

The State and Church were a single unit, and the conservative régime was strongly allied to the power of [[regular clergy]] of the [[Catholic Church]], who were then among the largest landowners in . The tight relationship between church and state had been ratified by the [[Concordat of 1854|Concordat of 1852]], which was the law until Cerna was deposed in 1871.{{sfn|Aycinena|1854|pp=2–16}} Even liberal generals like {{Interlanguage link|Serapio Cruz|es}} realized that Rafael Carrera's political and military presence made him practically invincible. Thus the generals fought under his command,{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930}} and waited—for a long time—until Carrera's death before beginning their revolt against the tamer Cerna.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=428}} During Cerna's presidency, liberal party members were prosecuted and sent into exile; among them, those who started the Liberal Revolution of 1871.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930}}

In 1871, the merchants guild, Consulado de Comercio, lost their exclusive court privilege. They had major effects on the economics of the time, and therefore land management. From 1839 to 1871, the Consulado held a consistent monopolistic position in the regime.

==== Liberal governments (1871–1898) ====
{{Further|Justo Rufino Barrios}}
's "Liberal Revolution" came in 1871 under the leadership of [[Justo Rufino Barrios]], who worked to modernize the country, improve trade, and introduce new crops and manufacturing. During this era coffee became an important crop for .{{sfn|Foster|2000|pp=173–175}} Barrios had ambitions of reuniting Central America and took the country to war in an unsuccessful attempt to attain it, losing his life on the battlefield in 1885 against forces in .

[[Manuel Barillas]] was president from 16 March 1886 to 15 March 1892. Manuel Barillas was unique among liberal presidents of  between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his successor peacefully. When election time approached, he sent for the three Liberal candidates to ask them what their government plan would be.{{sfn|De los Ríos|1948|p=78}} Happy with what he heard from general [[José María Reyna Barrios|Reyna Barrios]],{{sfn|De los Ríos|1948|p=78}} Barillas made sure that a huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicapán indigenous people came down from the mountains to vote for him. Reyna was elected president.{{Sfn|De los Ríos|1948|p=82}}

[[José María Reina Barrios]] was president between 1892 and 1898. During Barrios's first term in office, the power of the landowners over the rural peasantry increased. He oversaw the rebuilding of parts of [[ City]] on a grander scale, with wide, Parisian-style avenues. He oversaw  hosting the first "[[Exposición Centroamericana]]" ("Central  Fair") in 1897. During his second term, Barrios printed [[bond (finance)|bond]]s to fund his ambitious plans, fueling [[monetary inflation]] and the rise of popular opposition to his regime.

His administration also worked on improving the roads, installing national and international telegraphs and introducing electricity to  City. Completing a transoceanic railway was a main objective of his government, with a goal to attract international investors at a time when the [[ Canal]] was not yet built.

==== Manuel Estrada Cabrera regime (1898–1920) ====
{{Main|Manuel Estrada Cabrera}}
[[File:Estrada Cabrera, 16 yrs. Pres. of  LCCN2016821114 (cropped).tif|thumb|[[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]] governed  between 1898 and 1920.]]
After the assassination of general [[José María Reina Barrios]] on 8 February 1898, the  cabinet called an emergency meeting to appoint a new successor, but declined to invite Estrada Cabrera to the meeting, even though he was the designated successor to the presidency. There are two different descriptions of how Cabrera was able to become president. The first states that Cabrera entered the cabinet meeting "with pistol drawn" to assert his entitlement to the presidency,{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=54}} while the second states that he showed up unarmed to the meeting and demanded the presidency by virtue of being the designated successor.{{sfn|Arévalo Martinez|1945|p=42}}

The first civilian  head of state in over 50 years, Estrada Cabrera overcame resistance to his regime by August 1898 and called for elections in September, which he won handily.{{sfn|Arévalo Martinez|1945|p=46}} In 1898 the legislature convened for the election of President Estrada Cabrera, who triumphed thanks to the large number of soldiers and policemen who went to vote in civilian clothes and to the large number of illiterate family that they brought with them to the polls.{{sfn|Torres Espinoza|2007|p=42}}

One of Estrada Cabrera's most famous and most bitter legacies was allowing the entry of the [[United Fruit Company]] (UFCO) into the  economic and political arena. As a member of the [[Liberalism in Latin America|Liberal Party]], he sought to encourage development of the nation's infrastructure of [[highway]]s, [[railroad]]s, and [[sea port]]s for the sake of expanding the export economy. By the time Estrada Cabrera assumed the presidency there had been repeated efforts to construct a railroad from the major port of [[Puerto Barrios]] to the capital,  City. Owing to lack of funding exacerbated by the collapse of the internal coffee trade, the railway fell {{convert|60|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} short of its goal. Estrada Cabrera decided, without consulting the legislature or judiciary, that striking a deal with the UFCO was the only way to finish the railway.{{sfn|Dosal|1993}} Cabrera signed a contract with UFCO's [[Minor Cooper Keith]] in 1904 that gave the company tax exemptions, land grants, and control of all railroads on the Atlantic side.{{sfn|Chapman|2007}}

In 1906 Estrada faced serious revolts against his rule; the rebels were supported by the governments of some of the other [[Central America]]n nations, but Estrada succeeded in putting them down. Elections were held by the people against the will of Estrada Cabrera and thus he had the president-elect murdered in retaliation. In 1907 Estrada narrowly survived an assassination attempt when a bomb exploded near his carriage.{{sfn|de Aerenlund|2006}} It has been suggested that the extreme despotic characteristics of Estrada did not emerge until after an attempt on his life in 1907.{{sfn|Arévalo Martinez|1945|p=146}}

[[ City]] was badly damaged in the [[1917  earthquake]].

Estrada Cabrera continued in power until forced to resign after new revolts in 1920. By that time his power had declined drastically and he was reliant upon the loyalty of a few generals. While the  threatened intervention if he was removed through revolution, a bipartisan coalition came together to remove him from the presidency. He was removed from office after the national assembly charged that he was mentally incompetent, and appointed [[Carlos Herrera]] in his place on 8 April 1920.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=27}}

 joined with  and  in the Federation of Central America from 9 September 1921 until 14 January 1922.

Carlos Herrera served as President of  from 1920 until 1921. He was succeeded by [[José María Orellana]], who served from 1921 until 1926. [[Lázaro Chacón González]] then served until 1931.

==== Jorge Ubico regime (1931–1944) ====
{{Main|Jorge Ubico}}
[[File:Presidente Jorge Ubico Castañeda.png|thumb|upright|Jorge Ubico in 1931]]
The [[Great Depression]] began in 1929 and badly damaged the  economy, causing a rise in [[unemployment]], and leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Afraid of a popular revolt, the  landed elite lent their support to [[Jorge Ubico]], who had become well known for "efficiency and cruelty" as a provincial governor. Ubico won the election that followed in 1931, in which he was the only candidate.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=12–15}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=10–11}} After his election his policies quickly became authoritarian. He replaced the system of debt [[peon]]age with a brutally enforced [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] law, requiring all men of working age who did not own land to work a minimum of 100 days of hard labor.{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} His government used unpaid  labor to build roads and railways. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property,{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} an action described by historians as legalizing murder.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=13}} He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it into one of the most efficient and ruthless in Latin America.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=17}} He gave them greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. These laws created tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=29–32}} The government became highly militarized; under his rule, every provincial governor was a general in the army.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=14}}

Ubico continued his predecessor's policy of making massive concessions to the United Fruit Company, often at a cost to . He granted the company {{convert|200000|ha|acre}} of public land in exchange for a promise to build a port, a promise he later waived.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=22}} Since its entry into , the UFCO had expanded its land-holdings by displacing farmers and converting their farmland to [[banana plantation]]s. This process accelerated under Ubico's presidency, with the government doing nothing to stop it.{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=19}} The company received import duty and real estate tax exemptions from the government and controlled more land than any other individual or group. It also controlled the sole railroad in the country, the sole facilities capable of producing electricity, and the port facilities at [[Puerto Barrios]] on the Atlantic coast.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=67–71}}

Ubico saw the  as an ally against the supposed communist threat of , and made efforts to gain its support. When the US [[ declaration of war upon  (1941)|declared war]] against  in 1941, Ubico acted on  instructions and arrested all people in  of [[ | descent]].{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=20}} He also permitted the US to establish an air base in , with the stated aim of protecting the [[ Canal]].{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=37}} However, Ubico was an admirer of European [[Fascism|fascist]]s, such as [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Benito Mussolini]],{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=19}} and considered himself to be "another [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]".{{sfn|De los Ríos|1948|p=98}} He occasionally compared himself to [[Adolf Hitler]].{{sfn|Shillington|2002|pp=38–39}} He dressed ostentatiously and surrounded himself with statues and paintings of Napoleon, regularly commenting on the similarities between their appearances. He militarized numerous political and social institutions—including the post office, schools, and symphony orchestras—and placed military officers in charge of many government posts.{{sfn|Streeter2000|pp=11–12}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=32}}{{sfn|Grandin|2000|p=195}}{{sfn|Benz|1996|pp=16–17}}{{sfn|Loveman|Davies|1997|pp=118–120}}

====  Revolution (1944–1954) ====
{{Main| Revolution}}
On 1 July 1944 Ubico was forced to resign from the presidency in response to a wave of protests and a [[general strike]] inspired by brutal labor conditions among plantation workers. His chosen replacement, General [[Juan Federico Ponce Vaides]], was forced out of office on 20 October 1944 by a [[coup d'état]] led by Major [[Francisco Javier Arana]] and Captain [[Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán]]. About 100 people were killed in the coup. The country was then led by a [[military junta]] made up of Arana, Árbenz, and [[Jorge Toriello Garrido]].{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=89–91}}

[[File:Jacoboarbenz1950.jpg|thumb|upright|'s democratically elected president [[Jacobo Árbenz]] was overthrown in a coup planned by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. The [[United Fruit Company]] had lobbied the US to overthrow him.]]
The junta organized 's first free election, which the philosophically conservative writer and teacher [[Juan José Arévalo]], who wanted to turn the country into a [[liberalism|liberal]] [[capitalism|capitalist]] society won with a majority of 86%.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=12–15}} His "[[Christian socialism|Christian Socialist]]" policies were inspired to a large extent by the US [[New Deal]] of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during the [[Great Depression]]. Arévalo built new health centers, increased funding for education, and drafted a more liberal labor law,{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=14–15}} while criminalizing unions in workplaces with less than 500 workers,{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=98–99}} and cracking down on communists.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=15–16}} Although Arévalo was popular among nationalists, he had enemies in the church and the military, and faced at least 25 coup attempts during his presidency.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=16–17}}

Arévalo was constitutionally prohibited from contesting the 1950 elections. The largely free and fair elections were won by [[Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán]], Arévalo's defense minister.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=73–84}} Árbenz continued the moderate capitalist approach of Arévalo.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=18–19}} His most important policy was [[Decree 900]], a sweeping agrarian reform bill passed in 1952.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=64–67}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=144–146}} Decree 900 transferred uncultivated land to landless peasants.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=64–67}} Only 1,710 of the nearly 350,000 private land-holdings were affected by the law,{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=149–164}} which benefited approximately 500,000 individuals, or one-sixth of the population.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=149–164}}

==== Coup and civil war (1954–1996) ====
{{Main|1954  coup d'état| Civil War| genocide}}
{{see also| involvement in regime change}}
Despite their popularity within the country, the reforms of the  Revolution were disliked by the  government, which was predisposed by the [[Cold War]] to see it as communist, and by the UFCO, whose hugely profitable business had been affected by the end to brutal labor practices.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=15–16}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=48–50}} The attitude of the US government was also influenced by a propaganda campaign carried out by the UFCO.{{sfn|Paterson|2009|p=304}}

US President [[Harry Truman]] authorized [[Operation PBFortune]] to topple Árbenz in 1952, with the support of  dictator [[Anastasio Somoza García]],{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|p=102}} but the operation was aborted when too many details became public.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|p=102}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=228–231}} [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was elected US president in 1952, promising to take a harder line against communism; the close links that his staff members [[John Foster Dulles]] and [[Allen Dulles]] had to the UFCO also predisposed him to act against Árbenz.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=122–127}} Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSuccess in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by [[Carlos Castillo Armas]].{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=161–170}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=171–175}} The force invaded  on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of [[psychological warfare]], including bombings of [[ City]] and an anti-Árbenz radio station claiming to be genuine news.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=161–170}} The invasion force fared poorly militarily, but the psychological warfare and the possibility of a US invasion intimidated the  army, which refused to fight. Árbenz resigned on 27 June.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=173–178}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=190–204}}

Following negotiations in [[San Salvador]], Carlos Castillo Armas became president on 7 July 1954.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=173–178}} Elections were held in early October, from which all political parties were barred from participating. Castillo Armas was the only candidate and won the election with 99% of the vote.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=173–178}} Castillo Armas reversed [[Decree 900]] and ruled until 26 July 1957, when he was assassinated by Romeo Vásquez, a member of his personal guard. After the rigged election that followed, General [[José Miguel Ramón Ydígoras Fuentes|Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes]] assumed power. He is celebrated for challenging the  president to a gentleman's [[duel]] on the bridge on the south border to end a feud on the subject of illegal fishing by  boats on 's Pacific coast, two of which were sunk by the  Air Force. Ydigoras authorized the training of 5,000 anti-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]] [[]] in . He also provided airstrips in the region of [[Petén (department)|Petén]] for what later became the US-sponsored, failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in 1961.

On 13 November 1960, a group of left-wing junior military officers of the ''Escuela Politécnica'' national military academy led a failed revolt against Ydigoras' government. The rebels fled to the mountains of eastern  and neighboring  and formed MR-13 ([[Revolutionary Movement 13th November|Movimiento Revolucionario 13 Noviembre]]). On 6 February 1962, in Bananera, they attacked the offices of the United Fruit Company. The attack sparked sympathetic strikes and university student [[walkout]]s throughout the country, to which the government responded with a violent crackdown.

In 1963, Ydígoras, despite the firm opposition of the [[Kennedy administration]], had pledged to allow Arévalo return from exile and run in a free and open election. Arévalo returned on 27 March 1963 to announce his candidacy for the scheduled November presidential elections, however Ydigoras' government was ousted on 31 March 1963, when the  Air Force attacked several military bases; the coup was led by his Defense Minister, Colonel [[Enrique Peralta Azurdia]]. The new régime intensified its counterinsurgency campaign against the guerrillas that had begun under Ydígoras-Fuentes.

In 1966, [[Julio César Méndez ]] was elected president of  under the banner "Democratic Opening". Mendez  was the candidate of the Revolutionary Party, a center-left party that had its origins in the post-Ubico era. During this time, rightist [[paramilitary]] organizations, such as the "White Hand" (''[[Mano Blanca]]''), and the Anticommunist Secret Army (''Ejército Secreto Anticomunista'') were formed. Those groups were the forerunners of the infamous "[[Death squad|Death Squads]]". Military advisers from the [[Special Forces ( Army)| Army Special Forces]] (Green Berets) were sent to  to train 's armed forces and help transform it into a modern counter-insurgency force, which eventually made it the most sophisticated in Central America.

In 1970, Colonel [[Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio]] was elected president. By 1972, members of the guerrilla movement entered the country from  and settled in the Western Highlands. In the [[ general election, 1974|disputed election of 1974]], General [[Kjell Eugenio Laugerud García|Kjell Laugerud García]] defeated General [[Efraín Ríos Montt]], a candidate of the Christian Democratic Party, who claimed that he had been cheated out of a victory through fraud.

On 4 February 1976, a major earthquake destroyed several cities and caused more than 25,000 deaths, especially among the poor, whose housing was substandard. The government's failure to respond rapidly to the aftermath of the earthquake and to relieve homelessness gave rise to widespread discontent, which contributed to growing popular unrest. General [[Romeo Lucas García]] assumed power in 1978 in a fraudulent election.

The 1970s saw the rise of two new guerrilla organizations, the Guerrilla Army of the Poor (EGP) and the Organization of the People in Arms (ORPA). They began guerrilla attacks that included urban and rural warfare, mainly against the military and some civilian supporters of the army. The army and the paramilitary forces responded with a brutal counter-insurgency campaign that resulted in tens of thousands of civilian deaths.{{sfn|LaFeber|1993|p=165}} In 1979, US President [[Jimmy Carter]], who had until then been providing public support for the government forces, ordered a ban on all military aid to the  Army because of its widespread and systematic abuse of human rights. However, documents have since come to light that suggest that  aid continued throughout the Carter years, through clandestine channels.

[[File:Memorial Rio Negro.jpg|thumb|Memorial to the victims of the [[Río Negro massacres]]]]
On 31 January 1980, a group of indigenous [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] took over the  Embassy to protest army massacres in the countryside. The  government armed forces launched an assault that killed almost everyone inside in a [[Burning of the  Embassy|fire that consumed the building]]. The  government claimed that the activists set the fire, thus [[Self-immolation|immolating]] themselves. However the  ambassador survived the fire and disputed this claim, saying that the  police intentionally killed almost everyone inside and set the fire to erase traces of their acts. As a result, the government of  broke off diplomatic relations with .

This government was overthrown in 1982 and General [[Efraín Ríos Montt]] was named president of the military junta. He continued the bloody campaign of torture, [[forced disappearance]]s, and "[[scorched earth]]" warfare. The country became a [[pariah state]] internationally, although the regime received considerable support from the [[Reagan Administration]], and Reagan himself described Ríos Montt as "a man of great personal integrity". Ríos Montt was overthrown by General [[Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores]], who called for an election of a national constituent assembly to write a new constitution, leading to a free election in 1986, won by [[Marco Vinicio Cerezo Arévalo|Vinicio Cerezo Arévalo]], the candidate of the Christian Democracy Party.

In 1982, the four guerrilla groups, EGP, ORPA, FAR and PGT, merged and formed the [[ National Revolutionary Unity|URNG]], influenced by the [[|]] guerrilla [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front|FMLN]], the [[]]n [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|FSLN]] and [[]]'s government, in order to become stronger. As a result of the Army's "scorched earth" tactics in the countryside, more than 45,000  fled across the border to . The  government placed the refugees in camps in [[Chiapas]] and [[Tabasco]].

In 1992, the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] was awarded to [[Rigoberta Menchú]] for her efforts to bring international attention to the government-sponsored [[ genocide|genocide against the indigenous population]].

The [[ Civil War]] ended in 1996 with a peace accord between the guerrillas and the government, negotiated by the United Nations through intense brokerage by nations such as  and . Both sides made major concessions. The guerrilla fighters disarmed and received land to work. According to the U.N.-sponsored [[truth commission]] (the [[Commission for Historical Clarification]]), government forces and state-sponsored, CIA-trained paramilitaries were responsible for over 93% of the human rights violations during the war.

In the last few years,{{Clarify timeframe|date=July 2025}} millions of documents related to crimes committed during the civil war have been found abandoned by the former  police. The families of over 45,000  activists who [[Forced Disappearance|disappeared]] during the civil war are now reviewing the documents, which have been digitized. This could lead to further legal actions.

During the first ten years of the civil war, the victims of the state-sponsored terror were primarily students, workers, professionals, and opposition figures, but in the last years they were thousands of mostly rural [[Maya peoples|Maya]] farmers and non-combatants. More than 450 Maya villages were destroyed and over 1 million people became refugees or displaced within .

In 1995, the Catholic Archdiocese of  began the Recovery of Historical Memory (REMHI) project, known in  as "El Proyecto de la Recuperación de la Memoria Histórica", to collect the facts and history of 's long civil war and confront the truth of those years. On 24 April 1998, REMHI presented the results of its work in the report ": Nunca Más!". This report summarized testimony and statements of thousands of witnesses and victims of repression during the Civil War. "The report laid the blame for 80 per cent of the [[atrocity crime|atrocities]] at the door of the  Army and its collaborators within the social and political elite."

Catholic Bishop [[Juan José Gerardi Conedera]] worked on the Recovery of Historical Memory Project and two days after he announced the release of its report on victims of the  Civil War, ": Nunca Más!", in April 1998, Bishop Gerardi was attacked in his garage and beaten to death. In 2001, in the first trial in a civilian court of members of the military in  history, three Army officers were convicted of his death and sentenced to 30 years in prison. A priest was convicted as an accomplice and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

According to the report, ''Recuperación de la Memoria Histórica'' (REMHI), some 200,000 people died. More than one million people were forced to flee their homes and hundreds of villages were destroyed. The Historical Clarification Commission attributed more than 93% of all documented violations of human rights to 's military government, and estimated that Maya  accounted for 83% of the victims. It concluded in 1999 that state actions constituted genocide.

In some areas such as [[Baja Verapaz]], the Truth Commission found that the  state engaged in an intentional policy of genocide against particular ethnic groups in the [[ Civil War|Civil War]]. In 1999, US President [[Bill Clinton]] said that the US had been wrong to have provided support to the  military forces that took part in these brutal civilian killings.

==== Since 2000 ====
Since the peace accords  has had both economic growth and successive democratic elections, most recently in 2023. In the 2023 elections, [[Bernardo Arévalo]] won the presidency. He assumed office in January 2024.

In January 2012 Efrain Rios Montt, the former dictator of , appeared in a  court on genocide charges. During the hearing, the government presented evidence of over 100 incidents involving at least 1,771 deaths, 1,445 rapes, and the displacement of nearly 30,000  during his 17-month rule from 1982 to 1983. The prosecution wanted him incarcerated because he was viewed as a flight risk but he remained free on bail, under house arrest and guarded by the  National Civil Police (PNC). On 10 May 2013, Rios Montt was found guilty and sentenced to 80 years in prison. It marked the first time that a national court had found a former head of state guilty of genocide. The conviction was later overturned, and Montt's trial resumed in January 2015. In August 2015, a  court ruled that Rios Montt could stand trial for genocide and crimes against humanity, but that he could not be sentenced due to his age and deteriorating health.

Ex-President [[Alfonso Portillo]] was arrested in January 2010 while trying to flee . He was acquitted in May 2010, by a panel of judges that threw out some of the evidence and discounted certain witnesses as unreliable. The  Attorney-General, [[Claudia Paz y Paz]], called the verdict "a terrible message of injustice", and "a wake up call about the power structures". In its appeal, the [[International Commission Against Impunity in ]] (CICIG), a UN judicial group assisting the  government, called the decision's assessment of the meticulously documented evidence against Portillo Cabrera "whimsical" and said the decision's assertion that the president of  and his ministers had no responsibility for handling public funds ran counter to the constitution and laws of . A New York grand jury had indicted Portillo Cabrera in 2009 for embezzlement; following his acquittal on those charges in  that country's Supreme Court authorized his extradition to the US. The  judiciary is deeply corrupt and the selection committee for new nominations has been captured by criminal elements.

===== Pérez Molina government and "La Línea" =====
{{Main|Otto Pérez Molina}}[[File:10 Aerial view - Zona 14 - Ciudad de .jpg|thumb|[[ City]] is the capital and largest city of  and the most populous urban area in [[Central America]].]]

Retired general [[Otto Pérez Molina]] was elected president in 2011 along with [[Roxana Baldetti]], the first woman ever elected vice-president in ; they began their term in office on 14 January 2012. But on 16 April 2015, a United Nations (UN) anti-corruption agency report implicated several high-profile politicians including Baldetti's private secretary, Juan Carlos Monzón, and the director of the  Internal Revenue Service (SAT).{{who|date=July 2016}} The revelations provoked more public outrage than had been seen since the presidency of General [[Kjell Eugenio Laugerud García]]. The [[International Commission against Impunity in ]] (CICIG) worked with the  attorney-general to reveal the scam known as "[[La Línea corruption case|La Línea]]", following a year-long investigation that included [[telephone tapping|wire taps]].

Officials received bribes from importers in exchange for discounted import tariffs, a practice rooted in a long tradition of customs corruption in the country, as a fund-raising tactic of successive military governments for counterinsurgency operations during 's 36-year-long [[ Civil War|civil war]].

A Facebook event using the hashtag ''#RenunciaYa'' (Resign Now) invited citizens to go downtown in [[ City]] to ask for Baldetti's resignation. Within days, over 10,000 people RSVPed that they would attend. Organizers made clear that no political party or group was behind the event, and instructed protesters at the event to follow the law. They also urged people to bring water, food and sunblock, but not to cover their faces or wear political party colors. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of  City. They protested in front of the presidential palace. Baldetti resigned a few days later. She was forced to remain in  when the  revoked her visa. The  government arraigned her, since it had enough evidence to suspect her involvement in the "La Linea" scandal. The prominence of US Ambassador Todd Robinson in the  political scene once the scandal broke led to the suspicion that the US government was behind the investigation, perhaps because it needed an honest government in  to counter the presence of  and  in the region.

The UN anti-corruption committee has reported on other cases since then, and more than 20 government officials have stepped down. Some were arrested. Two of those cases involved two former presidential private secretaries: Juan de Dios Rodríguez in the  Social Service and Gustave Martínez, who was involved in a bribery scandal at the coal power plant company. {{Interlanguage link|Jaguar Energy|es}} Martínez was also Perez Molina's son-in-law.

Leaders of the political opposition have also been implicated in CICIG investigations: several legislators and members of Libertad Democrática Renovada party (LIDER) were formally accused of bribery-related issues, prompting a large decline in the electoral prospects of its presidential candidate, Manuel Baldizón, who until April had been almost certain to become the next  president in the 6 September 2015 presidential elections. Baldizón's popularity steeply declined and he filed accusations with the Organization of  States against CICIG leader Iván Velásquez of international obstruction in  internal affairs.

CICIG reported its cases so often on Thursdays that  coined the term "CICIG Thursdays". But a Friday press conference brought the crisis to its peak: on Friday 21 August 2015, the CICIG and Attorney General Thelma Aldana presented enough evidence to convince the public that both President Pérez Molina and former vice President Baldetti were the actual leaders of "La Línea". Baldetti was arrested the same day and an impeachment was requested for the president. Several cabinet members resigned and the clamor for the president's resignation grew after Perez Molina defiantly assured the nation in a televised message broadcast on 23 August 2015 that he was not going to resign.

Thousands of protesters took to the streets again, this time to demand the increasingly isolated president's resignation. 's Congress named a commission of five legislators to consider whether to remove the president's immunity from prosecution. The Supreme Court approved. A major day of action kicked off early on 27 August, with marches and roadblocks across the country. Urban groups who had spearheaded regular protests since the scandal broke in April, on the 27th sought to unite with the rural and indigenous organizations who orchestrated the road blocks.

The strike in  City was full of a diverse and peaceful crowd ranging from the indigenous poor to the well-heeled, and it included many students from public and private universities. Hundreds of schools and businesses closed in support of the protests. The ''Comité Coordinador de Asociaciones Agrícolas, Comerciales, Industriales y Financieras'' (CACIF) 's most powerful business leaders, issued a statement demanding that Pérez Molina step down, and urged Congress to withdraw his immunity from prosecution.

The attorney general's office released its own statement, calling for the president's resignation "to prevent ungovernability that could destabilize the nation". As pressure mounted, the president's former ministers of defense and of the interior, who had been named in the corruption investigation and resigned, abruptly left the country. Pérez Molina meanwhile had been losing support by the day. The private sector called for his resignation; however, he also managed to get support from entrepreneurs that were not affiliated with the private sector chambers: Mario López Estrada – grandchild of former dictator [[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]] and the billionaire owner of cellular phone companies – had some of his executives assume the vacated cabinet positions.

The  radio station Emisoras Unidas reported exchanging text messages with Perez Molina. Asked whether he planned to resign, he wrote: "I will face whatever is necessary to face, and what the law requires." Some protesters demanded the general election be postponed, both because of the crisis and because it was plagued with accusations of irregularities. Others warned that suspending the vote could lead to an institutional vacuum. However, on 2 September 2015 Pérez Molina resigned, a day after Congress impeached him. On 3 September 2015 he was summoned to the Justice Department for his first legal audience for the [[La Linea corruption case]].

In June 2016 a United Nations-backed prosecutor described the administration of Pérez Molina as a crime syndicate and outlined another corruption case, this one dubbed ''Cooperacha'' (Kick-in). The head of the Social Security Institute and at least five other ministers pooled funds to buy Molina luxurious gifts such as motorboats, spending over $4.7 million in three years.

===== Jimmy Morales and Alejandro Giammattei in power (2016–2024) =====
In the [[2015  general election|October 2015 presidential election]], former TV comedian [[Jimmy Morales]] was elected as the new president of  after huge anti-corruption demonstrations. He took office in January 2016.

In December 2017, President Morales announced that  will move its embassy in  to Jerusalem, becoming the first nation to follow the .

In January 2020, [[Alejandro Giammattei]] replaced Jimmy Morales as the president of . Giammattei had won the [[2019  general election|presidential election]] in August 2019 with his "tough-on-crime" agenda.

In November 2020, large [[2020  protests|protests and demonstrations]] occurred in  against President Alejandro Giammattei and the legislature, because of cutting educational and health spending.

In August 2023, [[Bernardo Arévalo]], the candidate of the center-left [[Semilla (political party)|Semilla]] (Seed) Movement, had a landslide victory in 's [[2023  general election|presidential election]]. The outgoing Giammattei administration attempted to control the outcome of the election by cracking down on journalists, anti-corruption investigators and social movements. After Arévalo's victory, the outgoing government attempted to prevent him from taking power. However, indigenous-led protests and international pressure forced the government to accept the election results.

===== Bernardo Arévalo and Movimiento Semilla (2024–present) =====
[[File:Retrato oficial del Presidente de la República Bernardo Arévalo de León, como Comandante General de las Fuerzas Armadas de .png|thumb|upright|[[Bernardo Arévalo]], president of ]]
[[Bernardo Arévalo]] is the son of the former president [[Juan José Arévalo]], who was the first democratically chosen president of . Arévalo was scheduled to assume the role as the 52nd president of  with leadership of [[Semilla (political party)|Semilla]] on 14 January 2024, however, his inauguration would be delayed due to the failure of the event's commission to approve a congressional delegation.

Minutes after midnight, he was finally sworn in as 's president on 15 January.
His campaign promotes anti-corruption and economic opportunities for . In his first few days in office, Arévalo reversed a government agreement signed by his [[Alejandro Giammattei|predecessor]] that would have granted security and vehicles to former officials from the [[Cabinet of Alejandro Giammattei|Giammattei cabinet]] for six years.

On 8 February 2024, Arévalo and Francisco Jiménez, the [[Ministry of the Interior ()|Minister of the Interior]], announced the creation of the Special Group Against Extortion (GECE), a special force within the [[National Civil Police ()|National Civil Police]] (PNC) aimed at combatting violent crime and extortions. The GECE will consist of 400 motorized officers who will patrol different regions of the country in phases. At the request of Arévalo, the  government donated equipment to support the new task force.

On 23 April 2024, during a public event marking the first 100 days of his government, Arévalo historically fulfilled one of his campaign promises by reducing the presidential salary by 25%. As a result of this reduction, the head of state of  is no longer the highest-paid president in [[Latin America]]. Concurrently, Vice President [[Karin Herrera|Herrera]] also announced a 25% reduction in her salary.

Arévalo's opposition has sought to weaken his administration through prosecutions of Semilla party members and indigenous leaders of the 2023 protests that led to his election being upheld.

Owing to its location, the present territory of  was a corridor of early human civilization from [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Caribbean]] to the [[Andes]] and [[Amazon basin]]. The oldest archaeological finds are from the Pubenza and El Totumo sites in the Magdalena Valley {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} southwest of Bogotá. These sites date from the [[Paleo-|Paleoindian]] period (18,000–8000&nbsp;BCE). At [[Puerto Hormiga archaeological site|Puerto Hormiga]] and other sites, traces from the [[Archaic Period (Americas)|Archaic Period]] (~8000–2000&nbsp;BCE) have been found. Vestiges indicate that there was also early occupation in the regions of [[El Abra]] and [[Tequendama]] in [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]]. The oldest pottery discovered in the Americas, found in [[San Jacinto, Bolívar|San Jacinto]], dates to 5000–4000&nbsp;BCE.

Indigenous people inhabited the territory that is now  by 12,500&nbsp;BCE. Nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]] tribes at the El Abra, [[Tibitó]] and Tequendama sites near present-day [[Bogotá]] traded with one another and with other cultures from the [[Magdalena River]] Valley. A site including {{Convert|8|mi|0|spell=in|sp=us}} of [[Pictogram|pictographs]] that is under study at Serranía de la Lindosa was revealed in November 2020. Their age is suggested as being 12,500 years old (c. 10,480 B.C.) by the anthropologists working on the site, because of extinct fauna depicted. It was during the earliest known human occupation of the area.

Between 5000 and 1000&nbsp;BCE, hunter-gatherer tribes transitioned to agrarian societies; fixed settlements were established, and pottery appeared. Beginning in the 1st millennium BCE, groups of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] including the [[Muisca]], [[Zenú]], [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya]], and [[Tairona]] developed the political system of ''[[cacicazgo]]s'' with a pyramidal structure of power headed by ''caciques''. The Muisca inhabited mainly the area of what is now the [[Departments of |Departments]] of [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] and [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] high plateau (''[[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]]'') where they formed the [[Muisca Confederation]]. They farmed maize, potato, quinoa, and cotton, and traded gold, [[ emeralds|emeralds]], blankets, ceramic handicrafts, coca and especially [[Halite|rock salt]] with neighboring nations. The Tairona inhabited northern  in the isolated mountain range of [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]]. The Quimbaya inhabited regions of the [[Cauca River]] Valley between the [[Cordillera Occidental ()|Western]] and [[Cordillera Central ()|Central]] Ranges of the  Andes. Most of the Amerindians practiced agriculture and the social structure of each indigenous community was different. Some groups of indigenous people such as the Caribs lived in a state of permanent war, but others had less bellicose attitudes. During the 1200s, [[Austronesian expansion|Malayo-Polynesian]]s and [[Indigenous peoples in |Native ]] in  made contact, thereby spreading Native  genetics from Precolonial  to some Pacific Ocean islands.

[[Christopher Columbus]] navigated near the Caribbean in 1502. In 1508, [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] accompanied an expedition to the territory through the region of [[Gulf of Urabá]] and they founded the town of [[Santa María la Antigua del Darién]] in 1510, the first stable settlement on the continent.{{efn|Balboa is best known for being the first European to see the Pacific Ocean in 1513, which he called ''Mar del Sur'' (or "Sea of the South") and would facilitate  exploration and settlement of South America.}} [[Santa Marta]] was founded in 1525, and [[Cartagena, |Cartagena]] in 1533.  [[conquistador]] [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] led an expedition to the interior in April 1536, and christened the districts through which he passed "[[New Kingdom of Granada]]". In August 1538, he provisionally founded its capital near the Muisca [[cacicazgo]] of [[Bacatá|Muyquytá]], and named it "Santa Fe". The name soon acquired a suffix and was called Santa Fe de Bogotá. Two other notable journeys by early conquistadors to the interior took place in the same period. [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]], conqueror of [[Quito]], traveled north and founded [[Cali]], in 1536, and [[Popayán]], in 1537; from 1536 to 1539,  conquistador [[Nikolaus Federmann]] crossed the [[Orinoquía natural region|Llanos Orientales]] and went over the [[Cordillera Oriental ()|Cordillera Oriental]] in a search for [[El Dorado]], the "city of gold". The legend and the gold would play a pivotal role in luring the  and other Europeans to New Granada during the 16th and 17th centuries.

The [[List of conquistadors in |conquistadors]] made frequent alliances with the enemies of different indigenous communities. [[ auxiliaries|Indigenous allies]] were crucial to conquest, as well as to creating and maintaining empire. Indigenous peoples in  experienced a decline in population due to conquest as well as Eurasian diseases, such as [[smallpox]], to which they had no immunity. Regarding the land as deserted, the  Crown sold properties to all persons interested in colonized territories, creating large farms and possession of mines. In the 16th century, the [[Navigation|nautical science]] in  reached a great development thanks to numerous scientific figures of the [[Casa de Contratación]] and nautical science was an essential pillar of the [[Iberian ship development, 1400–1600|Iberian expansion]]. In 1542, the region of New Granada, along with all other  possessions in South America, became part of the [[Viceroyalty of ]], with its capital in [[Lima]]. In 1547, New Granada became a separate captaincy-general within the viceroyalty, with its capital at Santa Fe de Bogota. In 1549, the [[Real Audiencia|Royal Audiencia]] was created by a royal decree, and New Granada was ruled by the [[Royal Audience of Santa Fe de Bogotá]], which at that time comprised the provinces of Santa Marta, Rio de San Juan, Popayán, Guayana and Cartagena. But important decisions were taken from the colony to  by the [[Council of the Indies]].

The [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] was established in 1717, then temporarily removed, and then re-established in 1739. Its capital was Santa Fé de Bogotá. This Viceroyalty included some other provinces of northwestern South America that had previously been under the jurisdiction of the [[New |Viceroyalties of New ]] or [[Viceroyalty of |]] and correspond mainly to today's , , and . Bogotá became one of the principal administrative centers of the  possessions in the New World, along with [[Lima]] and [[ City]], though it remained less developed compared to those two cities in several economic and logistical ways.

[[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] declared war [[War of Jenkins' Ear|on ]] in 1739, and the city of Cartagena quickly became a top target for the . A massive  expeditionary force was dispatched to capture the city, but, after achieving initial inroads, devastating outbreaks of disease crippled their numbers, and the  were forced to withdraw. The battle became one of 's most decisive victories in the conflict, and secured  dominance in the Caribbean until the [[Seven Years' War]]. The 18th-century priest, botanist, and mathematician [[José Celestino Mutis]] was delegated by Viceroy [[Antonio Caballero y Góngora]] to conduct an inventory of the nature of New Granada. Started in 1783, this became known as the [[Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada]]. It classified plants and wildlife, and founded the first astronomical observatory in the city of Santa Fe de Bogotá. In July 1801 the Prussian scientist [[Alexander von Humboldt]] reached Santa Fe de Bogotá where he met with Mutis. In addition, historical figures in the process of independence in New Granada emerged from the expedition as the astronomer [[Francisco José de Caldas]], the scientist [[Francisco Antonio Zea]], the zoologist [[Jorge Tadeo Lozano]] and the painter [[Salvador Rizo]].

Rebellions against  rule had occurred in the empire since the advent of conquest and colonization, but most were either crushed or remained too weak to change the overall situation. The last one that sought outright independence from  sprang up around 1810 and culminated in the  Declaration of Independence, issued on 20 July 1810, the day that is now celebrated as the nation's Independence Day. This movement followed the independence of [[-Domingue]] (present-day ) in 1804, which provided some support to an eventual leader of this rebellion: [[Simón Bolívar]]. [[Francisco de Paula Santander]] also would play a decisive role.

A movement was initiated by [[Antonio Nariño]], who opposed  centralism and led the opposition against the [[Viceroyalty]]. [[Cartagena, |Cartagena]] became independent in November 1811. In 1811, the [[United Provinces of New Granada]] were proclaimed, headed by [[Camilo Torres Tenorio]]. The emergence of two distinct ideological currents among the patriots ([[federalism]] and [[Unitary state|centralism]]) gave rise to a period of instability called the [[Patria Boba]]. Shortly after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] ended, [[Ferdinand VII]], recently restored to the throne in , unexpectedly decided [[ reconquest of New Granada|to send military forces]] to retake most of northern South America. The viceroyalty was restored under the command of [[Juan de Sámano]], whose regime punished those who participated in the patriotic movements, ignoring the political nuances of the [[Junta (  Independence)|junta]]s. The retribution stoked renewed rebellion, which, combined with a weakened , made possible a successful rebellion led by the -born [[Military career of Simón Bolívar|Simón Bolívar]], who finally proclaimed [[  wars of independence|independence]] in 1819. The [[Royalist (  Independence)|pro- resistance]] was defeated in 1822 in the present territory of  and in 1823 in . During the Independence War, between 250 and 400 thousand people (12–20% of the pre-war population) died.
[[File:Cambios territoriales de .gif|thumb|upright=1.2|Changes to the borders of  between 1811 and 2012]]
The territory of the Viceroyalty of New Granada became the [[Gran |Republic of ]], organized as a [[subdivisions of Gran |union of the current territories]] of , , , , parts of  and  and north of [[Marañón River]]. The [[Congress of Cúcuta]] in 1821 adopted a [[ Constitution of 1821|constitution]] for the new Republic. Simón Bolívar became the first [[President of ]], and Francisco de Paula Santander was made [[Vice President of |Vice President]].

Internal political and territorial divisions led to the dissolution of [[Gran ]] in 1830. The so-called "[[Cundinamarca Province|Department of Cundinamarca]]" adopted the name "[[Republic of the New Granada|New Granada]]", which it kept until 1858 when it became the "Confederación Granadina" ([[Granadine Confederation]]). After a [[ Civil War (1860–1862)|two-year civil war]] in 1863, the [[ of ]] was created, which became known as the Republic of  in 1886.

After Rojas' deposition, the  Conservative Party and the  Liberal Party agreed to create the [[National Front ()|National Front]], a coalition that would jointly govern the country. Under the deal, the presidency would alternate between conservatives and liberals every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices. The National Front ended "La Violencia", and National Front administrations attempted to institute far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the [[Alliance for Progress]]. Despite the progress in certain sectors, many social and political problems continued, and guerrilla groups were formally created such as the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of |FARC]], the [[National Liberation Army ()|ELN]] and the [[19th of April Movement|M-19]] to fight the government and political apparatus.

Since the 1960s, the country has suffered from an [[Asymmetric warfare|asymmetric]] [[Low intensity conflict|low-intensity]] [[ armed conflict (1964–present)|armed conflict]] between [[Military Forces of |government forces]], [[Guerrilla movements in |leftist guerrilla groups]] and [[Paramilitarism in |right wing paramilitaries]]. The conflict escalated in the 1990s, mainly in remote rural areas. Since the beginning of the armed conflict, [[human rights defenders]] have fought for the respect for human rights, despite staggering opposition.{{efn|[[Héctor Abad Gómez|Héctor Abad]] was a prominent medical doctor, university professor, and human rights leader whose holistic vision of healthcare led him to found the  National School of Public Health.

{{Main|History of }}

===Pre-Columbian era===
[[File:Copia de Cacicazgos de la Hispaniola.png|thumb|upright=1.6|The five [[cacique]]doms of Hispaniola at the time of the arrival of Christopher Columbus]]
The island of Hispaniola, of which  occupies the western three-eighths, has been inhabited since around 6,000 years ago by Native  who are thought to have arrived from Central or northern South America. These Archaic Age people are thought to have been largely hunter gatherers. During the [[1st millennium BC]], the Arawakan-speaking ancestors of the Taino people began to migrate into the Caribbean. Unlike the Archaic peoples, they practiced the intensive production of [[pottery]] and agriculture. The earliest evidence of the ancestors of the Taino people on Hispaniola is the Ostionoid culture, which dates to around 600 AD. {{Main|Chiefdoms of Hispaniola}}In Taíno society the largest unit of political organization was led by a ''[[cacique]]'', or chief, as the Europeans understood them. At the time of European contact, the island of Hispaniola was divided among five 'caciquedoms': the Magua in the northeast, the Marien in the northwest, the Jaragua in the southwest, the Maguana in the central regions of Cibao, and the Higüey in the southeast.

Taíno cultural artifacts include [[cave paintings]] in several locations in the country. These have become national symbols of  and tourist attractions. Modern-day [[Léogâne]], started as a  colonial town in the southwest, is beside the former capital of the caciquedom of ''Xaragua.''

[[File:Columbus landing on Hispaniola adj.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|[[Artist's impression]] of [[Christopher Columbus]] landing on [[Hispaniola]], engraving by [[Theodor de Bry]]]]
Navigator [[Christopher Columbus]] landed in  on 6 December 1492, in an area that he named ''[[Môle--Nicolas]]'', and claimed the island for the [[Crown of Castile]]. Nineteen days later, his ship the ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'' ran aground near the present site of [[Cap-Haïtien]]. Columbus left 39 men on the island, who founded the settlement of [[La Navidad]] on 25 December 1492. Relations with the native peoples, initially good, broke down and the settlers were later killed by the Taíno.

The sailors carried endemic Eurasian [[infectious disease]]s, causing [[epidemic]]s that killed a large number of native people. The first recorded [[smallpox]] epidemic in the Americas erupted on Hispaniola in 1507. Their numbers were further reduced by the harshness of the ''{{lang|es|[[encomienda]]}}'' system, in which the  forced natives to work in gold mines and plantations.

The  passed the [[Laws of Burgos]] (1512–1513), which forbade the maltreatment of natives, endorsed their [[Proselytism|conversion]] to Catholicism, and gave legal framework to ''{{lang|es|encomiendas}}.'' The natives were brought to these sites to work in specific plantations or industries.

As the  re-focused their colonization efforts on the greater riches of mainland Central and South America, Hispaniola became reduced largely to a trading and refueling post. As a result [[Piracy in the Caribbean|piracy]] became widespread, encouraged by European powers hostile to  such as  (based on [[Tortuga ()|Île de la Tortue]]) and England. The  largely abandoned the western third of the island, focusing their colonization effort on the eastern two-thirds. The western part of the island was thus gradually settled by  [[buccaneer]]s; among them was [[Bertrand d'Ogeron]], who succeeded in growing [[tobacco]] and recruited many  colonial families from [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. In 1697 [[Kingdom of |]] and [[Imperial |]] settled their hostilities on the island by way of the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] of 1697, which divided Hispaniola between them.

{{Main|-Domingue| West Indies}}

 received the western third and subsequently named it -Domingue, the  equivalent of ''[[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]]'', the  colony on [[Hispaniola]]. The  set about creating sugar and coffee plantations, worked by vast numbers of those enslaved imported from [[Africa]], and -Domingue grew to become their richest colonial possession, generating 40% of ’s foreign trade and doubling the wealth generation of all of England’s colonies, combined.

The  settlers were outnumbered by enslaved persons by almost 10 to 1. According to the 1788 Census, 's population consisted of nearly 25,000 Europeans, 22,000 free coloreds and 700,000 Africans in slavery. In contrast, by 1763 the white population of [[New | ]], a far larger territory, had numbered only 65,000. In the north of the island, those enslaved were able to retain many ties to African cultures, religion and language; these ties were continually being renewed by newly imported Africans. Some West Africans in slavery held on to their traditional [[ Vodou|Vodou]] beliefs by secretly syncretizing it with Catholicism.

The  enacted the ''[[Code Noir]]'' ("Black Code"), prepared by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and ratified by [[Louis XIV]], which established rules on slave treatment and permissible freedoms. -Domingue has been described as one of the most brutally efficient slave colonies; at the end of the eighteenth century it was supplying two-thirds of Europe's tropical produce while one-third of newly imported Africans died within a few years. Many enslaved persons died from diseases such as [[smallpox]] and [[typhoid fever]]. They had low [[birth rate]]s, and there is evidence that some women [[abortion|aborted]] fetuses rather than give birth to children within the bonds of [[slavery]]. The colony's environment also suffered, as forests were cleared to make way for plantations and the land was overworked so as to extract maximum profit for  plantation owners.

[[File:Fire in -Domingo 1791,  copper engraving.jpg|thumb|-Domingue [[Slave rebellion|slave revolt]] in 1791]]
As in its [[Louisiana (New )|Louisiana colony]], the [[New | colonial]] government allowed some rights to [[free people of color]] ({{Lang|fr|gens de couleur}}), the [[mixed-race]] descendants of European male colonists and African enslaved females (and later, mixed-race women). Over time, many were released from slavery and they established a separate [[social class]]. White  [[Creole peoples|Creole]] fathers frequently sent their mixed-race sons to [[]] for their education. Some men of color were admitted into the military. More of the free people of color lived in the south of the island, near [[Port-au-Prince]], and many intermarried within their community. They frequently worked as artisans and tradesmen, and began to own some property, including enslaved persons of their own. The free people of color petitioned the [[New |colonial]] government to expand their rights.

The brutality of slave life led many people in bondage to escape to mountainous regions, where they set up their own autonomous communities and became known as [[ Maroon|maroons]]. One maroon leader, [[François Mackandal]], led a rebellion in the 1750s; however, he was later captured and executed by the .

==== Revolution (1791–1804)====
{{Main| Revolution}}
[[File:Général Toussaint Louverture.jpg|thumb|upright|General Toussaint Louverture]]
Inspired by the [[ Revolution]] of 1789 and principles of the [[rights of man]], the  settlers and free people of color pressed for greater political freedom and more [[civil rights]]. Tensions between these two groups led to conflict, as a militia of free-coloreds was set up in 1790 by [[ Ogé]], resulting in his capture, torture and execution. Sensing an opportunity, in August 1791 the first slave armies were established in northern  under the leadership of [[Toussaint Louverture]] inspired by the Vodou ''houngan'' (priest) Boukman, and backed by the  in Santo Domingo – soon a full-blown slave rebellion had broken out across the entire colony.

In 1792, the [[ First Republic|]] government sent three commissioners with troops to re-establish control; to build an alliance with the ''[[gens de couleur]]'' and enslaved persons commissioners [[Léger-Félicité Sonthonax]] and [[Étienne Polverel]] abolished slavery in the colony. Six months later, the [[National Convention]], led by [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] and the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]], endorsed [[abolition of slavery timeline|abolition]] and extended it to all the  colonies.

The [[]], which was a new republic itself, oscillated between supporting or not supporting [[Toussaint Louverture]] and the emerging country of , depending on who was President of the US. Washington, who was a slave holder and isolationist, kept the  neutral, although private US citizens at times provided aid to  [[Planter (plantation owner)|planters]] trying to put down the revolt. [[John Adams]], a vocal opponent of slavery, fully supported the slave revolt by providing diplomatic recognition, financial support, munitions and warships (including the [[USS Constitution]]) beginning in 1798. This support ended in 1801 when Jefferson, another slave-holding president, took office and recalled the US Navy.

With slavery abolished, Toussaint Louverture pledged allegiance to , and he fought off the  and  forces who had taken advantage of the situation and invaded -Domingue. The  were later forced to cede their part of the island to  under the terms of the [[Peace of Basel]] in 1795, uniting the island under one government. However, an insurgency against  rule broke out in the east, and in the west there was fighting between Louverture's forces and the free people of color led by [[André Rigaud]] in the [[War of the Knives]] (1799–1800). The ' support for the blacks in the war contributed to their victory over the mulattoes. More than 25,000 whites and free blacks left the island as refugees.

[[File:Battle for Palm Tree Hill.jpg|thumb|Battle between [[ Legions (Napoleonic period)| troops]] in  service and the [[ Revolution| rebels]]. The majority of  soldiers eventually deserted the  army and fought alongside the .]]
After Louverture created a separatist constitution and proclaimed himself governor-general for life, [[Napoléon Bonaparte]] in 1802 sent an [[-Domingue expedition|expedition]] of 20,000 soldiers and as many sailors under the command of his brother-in-law, [[Charles Leclerc (general, born 1772)|Charles Leclerc]], to reassert  control. The  achieved some victories, but within a few months most of their [[ Army|army]] had died from [[yellow fever]]. Ultimately more than 50,000  troops died in an attempt to retake the colony, including 18 generals. The  managed to capture Louverture, transporting him to  for trial. He was imprisoned at [[Fort de Joux]], where he died in 1803 of exposure and possibly [[tuberculosis]].
[[File:Revenge taken by the Black Army for the Cruelties practised on them by the .png|thumb| hanging  soldiers]]
The enslaved persons, along with free {{Lang|fr|gens de couleur}} and allies, continued their fight for independence, led by generals [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], [[Alexandre Pétion]] and [[Henry Christophe]]. The rebels finally managed to decisively defeat the  troops at the [[Battle of Vertières]] on 18 November 1803, establishing the first state ever to successfully gain independence through a slave revolt. Under the overall command of Dessalines, the  armies avoided open battle, and instead conducted a successful guerrilla campaign against the Napoleonic forces, working with diseases such as yellow fever to reduce the numbers of  soldiers. Later that year  withdrew its remaining 7,000 troops from the island and Napoleon gave up his idea of re-establishing a North  empire, selling [[Louisiana (New )]] to the [[]], in the [[Louisiana Purchase]].

Throughout the revolution, an estimated 20,000  troops succumbed to yellow fever, while another 37,000 were [[killed in action]], exceeding the total  soldiers killed in action across various 19th-century colonial campaigns in , , Indochina, , and West Africa, which resulted in approximately 10,000  soldiers killed in action combined. The  sustained 45,000 dead. Additionally, 200,000  died. In the process, Dessalines became arguably the most successful military commander in the struggle against Napoleonic .

====First Empire (1804–1806)====

The independence of -Domingue was proclaimed under the native name '' by [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] on 1 January 1804 in [[Gonaïves]] and he was proclaimed "Emperor for Life" as Emperor Jacques I by his troops. Dessalines at first offered protection to the white planters and others. However, once in power, he ordered the [[1804  Massacre|genocide]] of nearly all the remaining whites; between January and April 1804, 3,000 to 5,000 whites were killed, including those who had been friendly and sympathetic to the black population. Only [[1804  massacre#Aftermath|three categories of white people]] were selected out as exceptions and spared: [[ |]] soldiers, some of whom had deserted from the  army and fought alongside the  rebels; the small group of [[ |]] colonists invited to the [[Nord-Ouest (department)|north-west region]]; and a group of [[Doctor of Medicine|medical doctors]] and professionals. Reportedly, people with connections to officers in the  army were also spared, as well as the women who agreed to marry non-white men.

Fearful of the potential impact the slave rebellion could have in the [[slave states]], U.S. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] refused to recognize the new republic. The Southern politicians who were a powerful voting bloc in the  Congress prevented U.S. recognition for decades until they withdrew in 1861 to form the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].

The revolution led to a wave of emigration. In 1809, 9,000 refugees from -Domingue, both white planters and people of color, settled ''en masse'' in [[New Orleans]], doubling the city's population, having been expelled from their initial refuge in  by  authorities. In addition, the newly arrived enslaved persons added to the city's African population.

The plantation system was re-established in , albeit for wages; however, many  were marginalized and resented the heavy-handed manner in which this was enforced in the new nation's politics. The rebel movement splintered, and Dessalines was assassinated by rivals on 17 October 1806.{{Deep link needed|date=March 2023}}

{{main|State of |Kingdom of }}

After Dessalines' death  became split into two, with the [[Kingdom of ]] in the north directed by Henri Christophe, later declaring himself [[Henri Christophe|Henri I]], and a republic in the south centered on [[Port-au-Prince]], directed by [[Alexandre Pétion]], an ''homme de couleur''. Pétion's republic was less absolutist, and he initiated a series of land reforms which benefited the peasant class. President Pétion also gave military and financial assistance to the revolutionary leader [[Simón Bolívar]], which were critical in enabling him to liberate the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]]. Meanwhile, the , who had managed to maintain a precarious control of eastern Hispaniola, were [[ reconquest of Santo Domingo|defeated]] by insurgents led by [[Juan Sánchez Ramírez]], with the area returning to  rule in 1809 following the [[Battle of Palo Hincado]].

====Unification of Hispaniola (1821–1844)====
{{main|Republic of  (1820–1849)| occupation of Santo Domingo}}
[[File:President Jean-Pierre Boyer of  (Hispaniola Unification Regime) Portrait.jpg|thumb|Jean-Pierre Boyer, ruler of  1818–1843]]
Beginning in 1821, President [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], also an ''homme de couleur'' and successor to Pétion, reunified the island following the suicide of Henry Christophe. After [[Republic of  |Santo Domingo]] declared its independence from  on 30 November 1821, Boyer invaded, seeking to [[Unification of Hispaniola|unite the entire island]] by force and ending slavery in Santo Domingo.

Struggling to revive the agricultural economy to produce [[commodity crops]], Boyer passed the Code Rural, which denied peasant laborers the right to leave the land, enter the towns, or start farms or shops of their own, causing much resentment as most peasants wished to have their own farms rather than work on plantations.

Starting in September 1824, more than 6,000 [[African ]] migrated to , with transportation paid by an  philanthropic group similar in function to the [[ Colonization Society]] and its efforts in [[]].{{Better source needed|reason=The current source is insufficiently reliable ([[WP:NOTRS]]).|date=August 2025}} Many found the conditions too harsh and returned to the .{{Citation needed|date=June 2024}}

In July 1825, [[Charles X of |King Charles X]] of [[]], during a period of restoration of the [[ monarchy]], sent a [[ Navy|fleet]] to reconquer . Under pressure, President Boyer agreed to a treaty by which  formally recognized the independence of the state in exchange for [[ indemnity controversy|a payment]] of 150 million [[francs]], or $560 million in today's dollars. By an order of 17 April 1826, the King of  renounced his rights of sovereignty and formally recognized the independence of . The enforced payments to  hampered 's economic growth for years, exacerbated by the fact that many [[Western world|Western]] states continued to refuse formal [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] recognition to ; Britain recognized  independence in 1833, and the  not until 1862.  borrowed heavily from Western banks at extremely high interest rates to repay the debt, an amount estimated to be between $21 billion and $115 billion in lost economic growth over time, or as much as eight times the size of 's economy in 2020. Although the amount of the reparations was reduced to 90 million in 1838, by 1900 80% of 's government spending was debt repayment and the country did not finish repaying it until 1947.

====Loss of the eastern portion of the island====
{{main| War of Independence}}
After losing the support of 's elite, Boyer was ousted in 1843, with [[Charles Rivière-Hérard]] replacing him as president. Nationalist  forces in eastern Hispaniola led by [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] seized control of Santo Domingo on 27 February 1844. The  forces, unprepared for a significant uprising, capitulated to the rebels, effectively ending  rule of eastern Hispaniola. In March, Rivière-Hérard attempted to reimpose his authority, but the [[|]] inflicted heavy losses. Rivière-Hérard was removed from office by the mulatto hierarchy and replaced with the aged general [[Philippe Guerrier]], who assumed the presidency on 3 May 1844.

Guerrier died in April 1845, and was succeeded by General [[Jean-Louis Pierrot]]. Pierrot's most pressing duty as the new president was to check the incursions of the , who were harassing the  troops.  gunboats were also making depredations on 's coasts. President Pierrot decided to open a campaign against the , whom he considered merely as insurgents; however, the  offensive of 1845 was stopped on the frontier.

On 1 January 1846, Pierrot announced a fresh campaign to reimpose  suzerainty over eastern Hispaniola, but his officers and men greeted this fresh summons with contempt. Thus, a month later – February 1846 – when Pierrot ordered his troops to march against the , the  army mutinied, and its soldiers proclaimed his overthrow as president of the republic. With the war against the  having become very unpopular in , it was beyond the power of the new president, General [[Jean-Baptiste Riché]], to stage another invasion.

====Second Empire (1849–1859)====
{{main|Second Empire of }}
[[File:Faustin I.jpg|thumb|Faustin I, from ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 16 February 1856]]
On 27 February 1847, President Riché died after only a year in power and was replaced by an obscure officer, General [[Faustin Soulouque]]. During the first two years of Soulouque's administration the conspiracies and opposition he faced in retaining power were so manifold that the  were given a further breathing space in which to consolidate their independence. But, when in 1848  finally recognized the  as a free and independent state and provisionally signed a treaty of peace, friendship, commerce and navigation,  immediately protested, claiming the treaty was an attack upon their own security. Soulouque decided to invade the new Republic before the  Government could ratify the treaty.

On 21 March 1849,  soldiers attacked the  garrison at [[Las Matas de Farfán|Las Matas]]. The demoralized defenders offered almost no resistance before abandoning their weapons. Soulouque pressed on, capturing [[San Juan Province ()|San Juan]]. This left only the town of [[Azua, |Azua]] as the remaining  stronghold between the  army and the capital. On 6 April, Azua fell to the 18,000-strong  army, with a 5,000-man  counterattack failing to oust them. The way to [[Santo Domingo]] was now clear. But the news of discontent existing at Port-au-Prince, which reached Soulouque, arrested his further progress and caused him to return with the army to his capital.

Emboldened by the sudden retreat of the  army, the  counter-attacked. Their flotilla went as far as [[Dame-Marie, Grand'Anse|Dame-Marie]] on the west coast of , which they plundered and set on fire. After another  campaign in 1855, Britain and  intervened and obtained an armistice on behalf of the , who declared independence as the .

The sufferings endured by the soldiers during the campaign of 1855, and the losses and sacrifices inflicted on the country without yielding any compensation or any practical results provoked great discontent. In 1858 a revolution began, led by General [[Fabre Geffrard]], Duke of Tabara. In December of that year, Geffrard defeated the Imperial Army and seized control of most of the country. As a result, the Emperor abdicated his throne on 15 January 1859. Faustin was taken into exile and General Geffrard succeeded him as president.

====Late 19th century–early 20th century====
[[File:Luders Affair, , .jpg|thumb| Captain Thiele of the ''Charlotte'' handing over the  Ultimatum on 6 December 1897 during the Lüders Affair]]
The period following Soulouque's overthrow down to the turn of the century was a turbulent one for , with repeated bouts of political instability. President Geffrard was overthrown in a coup in 1867, as was his successor, [[Sylvain Salnave]], in 1869. Under the Presidency of [[Michel Domingue]] (1874–76) relations with the  were dramatically improved by the signing of a treaty, in which both parties acknowledged the independence of the other. Some modernisation of the economy and infrastructure also occurred in this period, especially under the Presidencies of [[Lysius Salomon]] (1879–1888) and [[Florvil Hyppolite]] (1889–1896).

's relations with outside powers were often strained. In 1889 the  attempted to [[Môle -Nicolas affair|force ]] to permit the building of a naval base at [[Môle -Nicolas]], which was firmly resisted by President Hyppolite. In 1892 the [[ Empire| government]] supported suppression of the reform movement of [[Anténor Firmin]], and in 1897, the  used [[gunboat diplomacy]] to intimidate and then humiliate the  government of President [[Tirésias Simon Sam]] (1896–1902) during the [[Lüders Affair]].

In the first decades of the 20th century,  experienced great political instability and was heavily in debt to ,  and the . A series of short lived presidencies came and went: President [[Pierre Nord Alexis]] was forced from power in 1908, as was his successor [[François C. Antoine Simon]] in 1911; President [[Cincinnatus Leconte]] (1911–12) was killed in a (possibly deliberate) explosion at the National Palace; [[Michel Oreste]] (1913–14) was ousted in a coup, as was his successor [[Oreste Zamor]] in 1914.

In December 1914, the  removed $500,000 from the  National Bank, but rather than seize it to help pay the debt, it was removed for safe-keeping in New York, thus giving the  control of the bank and preventing other powers from doing so. This gave a stable financial base on which to build the economy, and to enable the debt to be repaid.

In 1915, 's new President [[Vilbrun Guillaume Sam]] sought to strengthen his tenuous rule by a mass execution of 167 political prisoners. Outrage at the killings led to riots, and Sam was captured and killed by a lynch mob. Fearing possible foreign intervention, or the emergence of a new government led by the anti-  politician [[Rosalvo Bobo]], President [[Woodrow Wilson]] sent U.S. Marines into  in July 1915. The {{USS|Washington|ACR-11|6}}, under Rear Admiral [[William Banks Caperton|Caperton]], arrived in Port-au-Prince in an attempt to restore order and protect U.S. interests. Within days, the Marines had taken control of the capital city and its banks and customs house. The Marines declared martial law and severely censored the press. Within weeks, a new pro-U.S.  president, [[Philippe Sudré Dartiguenave]], was installed and a new constitution written that was favorable to the interests of the . The constitution (written by future US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]) included a clause that allowed, for the first time, foreign ownership of land in , which was bitterly opposed by the  legislature and citizenry.

The occupation improved some of 's [[infrastructure]] and centralized power in Port-au-Prince. 1700&nbsp;km of roads were made usable, 189 bridges were built, many irrigation canals were rehabilitated, hospitals, schools, and public buildings were constructed, and drinking water was brought to the main cities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} Agricultural education was organized, with a central school of agriculture and 69 farms in the country.{{sfn|Heinl|1996|pp=454–455}}{{incomplete short citation|date=February 2023}} However, many infrastructure projects were built using the [[corvée]] system that allowed the government/occupying forces to take people from their homes and farms, at gunpoint if necessary, to build roads, bridges etc. by force, a process that was deeply resented by ordinary . [[Sisal]] was also introduced to , and sugarcane and [[cotton]] became significant exports, boosting prosperity.  traditionalists, based in rural areas, were highly resistant to U.S.-backed changes, while the urban elites, typically mixed-race, welcomed the growing economy, but wanted more political control. Together they helped secure an end to the occupation in 1934, under the Presidency of [[Sténio ]] (1930–1941). The debts were still outstanding, though less due to increased prosperity, and the U.S. financial advisor-general receiver handled the budget until 1941.

The U.S. Marines were instilled with a special brand of paternalism towards  "expressed in the metaphor of a father's relationship with his children." Armed opposition to the US presence was led by the [[Cacos (military group)|cacos]] under the command of [[Charlemagne Péralte]]; his capture and execution in 1919 earned him the status of a national martyr. During Senate hearings in 1921, the commandant of the Marine Corps reported that, in the 20 months of active unrest, 2,250  had been killed. However, in a report to the Secretary of the Navy, he reported the death toll as being 3,250.  historians have claimed the true number was much higher, but this is not supported by most historians outside .

====Post-occupation era (1934–1957)====
After U.S. forces left in 1934,  dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] used [[Antihaitianismo|anti-]] sentiment as a nationalist tool. In 1937, in an event that became known as the [[Parsley massacre|Parsley Massacre]], he ordered his army to kill  living on the  side of the border. Few bullets were used; instead, 20,000–30,000  were bludgeoned and bayoneted, then herded into the sea, where sharks finished what Trujillo had begun. The indiscriminate massacre occurred over a period of five days and involved hundreds of  troops.

 President [[Sténio |]], under U.S. pressure owing to his increasingly dictatorial actions, resigned in 1941 and was replaced by [[Élie Lescot]] (1941–46). In 1941, during the [[Second World War]], Lescot declared war on [[Empire of |]] (8 December), [[Nazi |]] (12 December), [[Kingdom of |]] (12 December), [[Kingdom of |]] (24 December), [[Kingdom of  (1920-46)|]] (24 December) and [[Kingdom of |]] (24 December). Out of these six [[Axis Powers|Axis]] countries, only  reciprocated, declaring war on  on the same day (24 December 1941). On 27 September 1945,  became a [[member states of the United Nations|founding member]] of the [[United Nations]] (the successor to the [[Member states of the League of Nations|League of Nations]], of which  was also a founding member).

In 1946, Lescot was overthrown by the military, with [[Dumarsais Estimé]] later becoming the new president (1946–50). Estimé sought to improve the economy and education, and to boost the role of black ; however, as he sought to consolidate his rule he too was overthrown in a coup led by [[Paul Magloire]], who replaced him as president (1950–56). Firmly anti-Communist, he was supported by the ; with greater political stability tourists started to visit . The waterfront area of Port-au-Prince was redeveloped to allow cruise ship passengers to walk to cultural attractions.

====Duvalier dynasty (1957–1986)====
{{main|Duvalier dynasty}}
[[File:Duvalier crop2.jpg|thumb|upright|"Papa Doc" [[François Duvalier|Duvalier]] in 1968]]
In 1956–57  underwent severe political turmoil; Magloire was forced to resign and leave the country in 1956 and he was followed by four short-lived presidencies. In the [[ presidential election, 1957|September 1957 election]] [[François Duvalier]] was elected President of . Known as 'Papa Doc' and initially popular, Duvalier remained President until his death in 1971. He advanced black interests in the public sector, where over time, people of color had predominated as the educated urban elite. Not trusting the army, despite his frequent purges of officers deemed disloyal, Duvalier created a private militia known as ''[[Tonton Macoute|Tontons Macoutes]]'' ("Bogeymen"), which maintained order by terrorizing the populace and political opponents. In 1964 Duvalier proclaimed himself 'President for Life'; [[Jérémie Vespers|an uprising]] against his rule that year in [[Jérémie]] was violently suppressed, with the ringleaders publicly executed and hundreds of mixed-raced citizens in the town killed. The bulk of the educated and professional class began leaving the country, and corruption became widespread. Duvalier sought to create a personality cult, identifying himself with [[Baron Samedi]], one of the [[loa]] (or ''lwa''), or spirits, of [[ Vodou]]. Despite the well-publicized abuses under his rule, Duvalier's firm anti-Communism earned him the support of the , who furnished the country with aid.

In 1971, Duvalier died, and he was succeeded by his son [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]], nicknamed 'Baby Doc', who ruled until 1986. He largely continued his father's policies, though curbed some of the worst excesses in order to court international respectability. Tourism, which had nosedived in Papa Doc's time, again became a growing industry. However, as the economy continued to decline, Baby Doc's grip on power began to weaken. 's pig population was slaughtered following an outbreak of swine fever in the late 1970s, causing hardship to rural communities who used them as an investment. The opposition became more vocal, bolstered by a visit to the country by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1983, who publicly lambasted the president. Demonstrations occurred in Gonaïves in 1985 which then spread across the country; under pressure from the , Duvalier left the country in February 1986.

In total, roughly 40,000 to 60,000  are estimated to have been killed during the reign of the Duvaliers. Through the use of his intimidation tactics and executions, many intellectual  had fled, leaving the country with a massive brain-drain from which it has yet to recover.

====Post-Duvalier era (1986–2004)====
[[File:DD-SD-99-03743.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] returns to  following the [[Operation Uphold Democracy|U.S.-led invasion]] in 1994 designed to remove the [[Raoul Cédras|regime]] installed by the [[1991  coup d'état]]]]
Following Duvalier's departure, army leader General [[Henri Namphy]] headed a new [[National Council of Government ()|National Governing Council]]. [[ presidential election, 1987|Elections]] scheduled for November 1987 were aborted after dozens of inhabitants were shot in the capital by soldiers and ''Tontons Macoutes''. Fraudulent [[ presidential election, 1988|elections followed]] in 1988, in which only 4% of the citizenry voted. The newly elected president, [[Leslie Manigat]], was then overthrown some months later in the [[June 1988  coup d'état]].

Another [[September 1988  coup d'état|coup followed]] in September 1988, after the [[St. Jean Bosco massacre]] in which approximately 13 to 50 people were killed while attending a mass led by prominent government critic and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priest [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]]. General [[Prosper Avril]] subsequently led a military regime until March 1990.

Avril transferred power to the army chief of staff, General [[Hérard Abraham]], on 10 March 1990. Abraham gave up power three days later, becoming the only military leader in  during the twentieth century to voluntarily give up power. Abraham later helped to secure the [[1990–91  general election]].

In December 1990, Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected president in the [[ general election, 1990–91| general election]]. However, his ambitious reformist agenda worried the elites, and in September of the following year he was overthrown by the military, led by [[Raoul Cédras]], in the [[1991  coup d'état]]. Amidst the continuing turmoil many  attempted to flee the country.

In September 1994, the  negotiated the departure of 's military leaders and the peaceful entry of 20,000 US troops under [[Operation Uphold Democracy]]. This enabled the restoration of the democratically elected Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president, who returned to  in October to complete his term. As part of the deal Aristide had to implement free market reforms in an attempt to improve the  economy, with mixed results. In November 1994, [[Hurricane Gordon (1994)|Hurricane Gordon]] brushed , dumping heavy rain and creating [[flash flood]]ing that triggered mudslides. Gordon killed an estimated 1,122 people, although some estimates go as high as 2,200.

[[1995  general election|Elections]] were held in 1995 which were won by [[René Préval]], gaining 88% of the popular vote, albeit on a low turnout. Aristide subsequently formed his own party, [[Fanmi Lavalas]], and political deadlock ensued; the [[ presidential election, 2000|November 2000 election]] returned Aristide to the presidency with 92% of the vote. The election had been boycotted by the opposition, then organized into the [[Convergence Démocratique]], over a dispute in the [[ legislative election, 2000|May legislative elections]]. In subsequent years, there was increasing violence between rival political factions and [[human rights abuse]]s. Aristide spent years negotiating with the Convergence Démocratique on new elections, but the Convergence's inability to develop a sufficient electoral base made elections unattractive.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

In 2004, [[2004  coup d'état|an anti-Aristide revolt began]] in northern . The rebellion eventually reached the capital, and Aristide was forced into exile. The precise nature of the events are disputed; some, including Aristide and his bodyguard, Franz Gabriel, stated that he was the victim of a "new [[coup d'état]] or modern kidnapping" by U.S. forces. These charges were denied by the US government. As political violence and crime continued to grow, a [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in |United Nations Stabilisation Mission (MINUSTAH)]] was brought in to maintain order. However, MINUSTAH proved controversial, since their periodically heavy-handed approach to maintaining law and order and several instances of abuses, including the alleged sexual abuse of civilians, provoked resentment and distrust among ordinary .

[[Boniface Alexandre]] assumed interim authority until 2006, when René Préval was re-elected President following [[ general election, 2006|elections]] with 55% voter turnout.

====Post-Aristide era (2004–present)====
{{See also| crisis (2018–present)}}
Amidst the continuing political chaos, a series of natural disasters hit . In 2004, [[Hurricane Jeanne#|Tropical Storm Jeanne]] skimmed the north coast, leaving 3,006 people dead in flooding and [[mudslide]]s, mostly in the city of [[Gonaïves]]. In 2008,  was again struck by tropical storms; [[Tropical Storm Fay (2008)|Tropical Storm Fay]], [[Hurricane Gustav]], [[Hurricane Hanna (2008)|Hurricane Hanna]] and [[Hurricane Ike]] all produced heavy winds and rain, resulting in 331 deaths and about 800,000 in need of humanitarian aid. The state of affairs produced by these storms was intensified by already high food and fuel prices that had caused a food crisis and political unrest in April 2008.

[[File: national palace earthquake.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The [[National Palace ()| National Palace]], located in Port-au-Prince, , heavily damaged after the [[2010  earthquake|earthquake of 2010]]. This was originally a two-story structure; the second story completely collapsed.]]

On 12 January 2010, at 4:53pm local time,  was struck by a [[moment magnitude scale|magnitude]]-7.0 [[2010  earthquake|earthquake]]. This was the country's most severe earthquake in over 200 years. The earthquake was reported to have left between 160,000 and 300,000 people dead and up to 1.6 million homeless, making it one of the [[List of natural disasters by death toll|deadliest natural disasters ever recorded]]. An estimated 80% of schools, more than half of 's hospitals were destroyed or damaged. It is also one of the deadliest earthquakes ever recorded. The situation was exacerbated by a subsequent massive [[ cholera outbreak|cholera outbreak]] that was triggered when cholera-infected waste from a [[United Nations]] peacekeeping station contaminated the country's main river, the [[Artibonite River|Artibonite]]. In 2017, it was reported that roughly 10,000  had died and nearly a million had been made ill. After years of denial, the United Nations apologized in 2016, but {{as of|2017|lc=y}}, they have refused to acknowledge fault, thus avoiding financial responsibility.

General elections had been planned for January 2010 but were postponed due to the earthquake. [[2010–11  general election|Elections were held on 28 November 2010]] for the senate, the parliament and the first round of the presidential elections. The run-off between [[Michel Martelly]] and [[Mirlande Manigat]] took place on 20 March 2011, and preliminary results, released on 4 April, named Michel Martelly the winner. In 2011, both former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier and Jean-Bertrand Aristide returned to ; attempts to try Duvalier for crimes committed under his rule were shelved following his death in 2014. In 2013, the  government called for European governments to pay [[reparations for slavery]] and establish an official commission for the settlement of past wrongdoings. Meanwhile, after continuing political wrangling with the opposition and allegations of electoral fraud, Martelly agreed to step down in 2016 without a successor in place. After numerous postponements, partly owing to the effects of devastating [[Hurricane Matthew]], [[November 2016  presidential election|elections]] were held in November 2016 with a record low voter turnout of just 17%. The victor, [[Jovenel Moïse]] of the [[ Tèt Kale Party]], was sworn in as president in 2017. [[ crisis (2018–present)|Protests began]] on 7 July 2018, in response to increased fuel prices. Over time these protests evolved into demands for the resignation of president Moïse.

On 7 July 2021, President Moïse was [[Assassination of Jovenel Moïse|assassinated]] in an attack on his private residence, and First Lady [[Martine Moïse]] was hospitalized. Amid the political crisis, the government of  installed [[Ariel Henry]] as the acting prime minister on 20 July 2021. On 14 August 2021,  suffered [[2021  earthquake|another huge earthquake]], with many casualties. The earthquake also damaged 's economic conditions and led to a rise in [[Gang|gang violence]] which, by September 2021, had escalated to a long-lasting full-blown [[Gang war in |gang war]] and other violent crimes within the country. As of March 2022,  still had no president, no parliamentary quorum, and a dysfunctional high court due to a lack of judges. In 2022, [[2022  crisis|protests]] against the government and [[Global energy crisis (2021–present)|rising fuel prices]] intensified.

By the end of 2023, gangs and armed groups controlled an estimated 80% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. During 2023, gangs killed 4,789 people, kidnapped 2,490 more and displaced an estimated 362,000 from their homes (mostly in Port-au-Prince). Doctors, lawyers, and other wealthy members of society were kidnapped and held for ransom. Many victims were killed when ransom demands were not met, leading those with the means to do so to flee the country, further hampering efforts to pull the country out of the crisis. It is estimated that amidst the crisis up to 20% of qualified medical staff had left  by the end of 2023.

In March 2024, Ariel Henry was prevented by gangs from returning to , following a visit to [[]]. Henry agreed to resign once a transitional government had been formed. As of that month, nearly half of 's population was living under [[Hunger|acute food insecurity]], according to the [[World Food Programme]]. On 25 April 2024, the [[Transitional Presidential Council]] took over the Governance of  and is scheduled to stay in power until 2026.  [[Michel Patrick Boisvert]] was named interim prime minister. On 3 June 2024, the council swore in [[Garry Conille]] as acting prime minister. On 10 November 2024, [[Alix Didier Fils-Aimé]] replaced Conille as acting prime minister.

===Prehistoric and ancient period===
{{Main|Prehistoric |Ancient history of }}

Hunter-gatherers first arrived on  around 13–12,000 years ago (11,000 to 10,000 BC), based on dating of sites like [[Aetokremnos]] on the south coast and the inland site of Vretsia Roudias. The arrival of the first humans coincides with the extinction of the {{Convert|75|cm|ft|abbr=on}} high [[ pygmy hippopotamus]] and {{Convert|1|m}} tall [[ Dwarf Elephant| dwarf elephant]], the only large mammals native to the island. [[Neolithic]] farming communities emerged on the island by around 10,500 years ago (8500 BC).

Remains of an eight-month-old cat were discovered buried with a human body at a separate [[Neolithic]] site in . The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old (7500&nbsp;BC), predating [[ancient ]]ian civilisation and pushing back the [[Domestication of the cat|earliest known feline-human association]] significantly. The remarkably well-preserved Neolithic village of [[Khirokitia]] is a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], dating to approximately 6800&nbsp;BC.

During the Late [[Bronze Age]], from around 1650 BC  (identified in whole or part as [[Alashiya]] in contemporary texts) became more connected to the wider Mediterranean world driven by the trade in [[copper]] extracted from the Troodos Mountains, which stimulated the development of urbanised settlements across the island, with records suggesting that  at this time was ruled by "kings" who corresponded with the leaders of other Mediterranean states (like the [[pharaoh]]s of the [[New Kingdom of ]], as documented in the [[Amarna letters]]). The first recorded name of a  king is ''Kushmeshusha'', as appears on letters sent to [[Ugarit]] in the 13th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC.

At the end of the Bronze Age, the island experienced two waves of  settlement. The first wave consisted of [[Mycenaean |Mycenaean ]] traders, who started visiting  around 1400&nbsp;BC. A major wave of  settlement is believed to have taken place following the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] of Mycenaean  from 1100 to 1050&nbsp;BC, with the island's predominantly  character dating from this period.   occupies an important role in [[ mythology]], being the birthplace of [[Aphrodite]] and [[Adonis]], and home to [[Cinyras|King Cinyras]], [[Teucer]] and [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]. Literary evidence suggests an early Phoenician presence at [[Kition]], which was under [[Tyre, |Tyrian]] rule at the beginning of the 10th century BC. Some [[Phoenicia]]n merchants who were believed to come from [[Tyre, |Tyre]] [[colony|colonised]] the area and expanded the political influence of Kition. After c.&nbsp;850&nbsp;BC, the Phoenicians rebuilt and reused the sanctuaries [at the Kathari site].[[File:Kition, Zeus Keraunios.jpg|thumb|upright|Zeus Keraunios, 500–480 BC, Nicosia museum]]

 is at a strategic location in the Eastern Mediterranean. It was ruled by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] for a century starting in 708&nbsp;BC, before a brief spell under  rule and eventually [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] rule in 545&nbsp;BC. The , led by [[Onesilus]], king of Salamis, joined their fellow  in the [[Ionia]]n cities during the unsuccessful [[Ionian Revolt]] in 499&nbsp;BC against the Achaemenids. The revolt was suppressed, but  managed to maintain a high degree of autonomy and remained inclined towards the  world. 
During the whole period of the Persian rule, there is a continuity in the reign of the  kings and during their rebellions they were crushed by Persian rulers from Asia Minor, which is an indication that the  were ruling the island with directly regulated relations with the Great King and there was not a Persian [[satrap]]. The Kingdoms of  enjoyed special privileges and a semi-autonomous status, but they were still considered vassal subjects of the Great King.

The island was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333&nbsp;BC and  navy helped Alexander during the [[siege of Tyre (332 BC)]]. The  fleet was also sent to help [[Amphoterus (admiral)|Amphoterus]]. In addition, Alexander had two  generals [[Stasander]] and [[Stasanor]] both from the [[Soli, |Soli]] and later both became satraps in Alexander's empire.
Following Alexander's death, the [[Partition of Babylon|division of his empire]], and the subsequent [[Wars of the Diadochi]],  became part of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic empire]] of [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic ]]. It was during this period that the island was fully [[Hellenization|Hellenised]]. In 58&nbsp;BC  was acquired by the [[Roman Republic]] and became [[Roman ]] in 22 BC.

[[File:Kyrenia 01-2017 img11 Castle exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Kyrenia Castle]] was originally built by the Byzantines and enlarged by the Venetians.]]
When the [[Roman Empire]] was divided into Eastern and Western parts in 286,  became part of the East Roman Empire (also called the [[Byzantine Empire]]); the island would remain part of the empire for some 900 years. Under Byzantine rule, the  orientation that had been prominent since antiquity developed the strong Hellenistic-Christian character that continues to be a hallmark of the   community.

Beginning in 649,  endured repeated attacks and raids launched by [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. Many were quick raids, but others were large-scale attacks in which many  were killed and great wealth carried off or destroyed. The city of [[Salamis, |Salamis]] was destroyed and never rebuilt. Byzantine control remained stronger in the northern coast, the Arabs exerted more influence in the south. In 688, Emperor [[Justinian II|Justinian&nbsp;II]] and Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] signed a treaty whereby  would be paying an equal amount of tribute to the Caliphate and tax to the Empire, but would remain politically neutral to both while being retained as a province administered by the Empire. There are no Byzantine churches which survive from this period, and the island entered a period of impoverishment. Full Byzantine rule was restored in 965, when Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros&nbsp;II Phokas]] scored decisive victories on land and sea.

In 1156 [[Raynald of Châtillon]] and [[Thoros II|Thoros II of ]] brutally sacked  over a period of three weeks, stealing so much plunder and capturing so many of the leading citizens and their families for ransom, that the island took generations to recover. Several  priests were mutilated and sent away to Constantinople.

In 1185 [[Isaac Komnenos of |Isaac Komnenos]], a member of the Byzantine imperial family, took over  and declared it independent of the Empire. In 1191, during the [[Third Crusade]], [[Richard I of England]] captured the island from Isaac. He used it as a major supply base that was relatively safe from the [[Saracen]]s. A year later Richard sold the island to the [[Knights Templar]], who, following a bloody revolt, in turn sold it to [[Guy of Lusignan]]. His brother and successor [[Aimery of |Aimery]] was recognised as [[Kingdom of |King of ]] by [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]].

Following the death in 1473 of [[James II of |James&nbsp;II]], the last Lusignan king, the [[Republic of Venice]] assumed control of the island, while the late king's Venetian widow, Queen [[Catherine Cornaro]], reigned as figurehead. Venice formally annexed the [[Kingdom of ]] in 1489, following the abdication of Catherine. The Venetians fortified [[Nicosia]] by building the [[Walls of Nicosia]], and used it as an important commercial hub. Throughout Venetian rule, the [[Ottoman Empire]] frequently raided . In 1539 the Ottomans destroyed [[Limassol]] and so fearing the worst, the Venetians also fortified [[Famagusta]] and [[Kyrenia]].

Although the Lusignan  aristocracy remained the dominant social class in  throughout the medieval period, the former assumption that  were treated only as serfs on the island is no longer considered by academics to be accurate. It is now accepted that the medieval period saw increasing numbers of   elevated to the upper classes, a growing  [[middle class|middle ranks]], and the Lusignan royal household even marrying . This included King [[John II of |John&nbsp;II of ]] who married [[Helena Palaiologina]].

In 1570, a full-scale Ottoman assault with 60,000 troops brought the island under Ottoman control, despite stiff resistance by the inhabitants of Nicosia and Famagusta. Ottoman forces capturing  [[ massacre|massacred]] many  and  Christian inhabitants. The previous Latin elite were destroyed and the first significant demographic change since antiquity took place with the formation of a Muslim community. Soldiers who fought in the conquest settled on the island and  peasants and craftsmen were brought to the island from [[]]. This new community also included banished Anatolian tribes, "undesirable" persons and members of various "troublesome" Muslim sects, as well as a number of new converts on the island.
[[File:Buyuk Han, Nicosia - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Büyük Han]], a [[caravanserai]] in Nicosia, is an example of the surviving Ottoman architecture in .]]
The Ottomans abolished the [[feudal]] system previously in place and applied the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]] to , under which non-Muslim peoples were governed by their own religious authorities. In a reversal from the days of Latin rule, the head of the [[Church of ]] was invested as leader of the   population and acted as mediator between Christian   and the Ottoman authorities. This status ensured that the Church of  was in a position to end the [[Catholic Church]]'s constant expansion efforts on the island. Ottoman rule of  was at times indifferent, at times oppressive, depending on the temperaments of the sultans and local officials.

The ratio of Muslims to Christians fluctuated throughout the period of Ottoman domination. In 1777–78, 47,000 Muslims constituted a majority over the island's 37,000 Christians. By 1872, the population of the island had risen to 144,000, comprising 44,000 Muslims and 100,000 Christians. The Muslim population included numerous [[crypto-Christians]], including the [[Linobambaki]], a crypto-Catholic community that arose due to religious persecution of the Catholic community by the Ottoman authorities; this community would assimilate into the   community during  rule.

As soon as the [[ War of Independence]] broke out in 1821, several   left for  to join the  forces. In response, the Ottoman governor of  arrested and executed 486 prominent  , including the Archbishop of , [[Kyprianos of |Kyprianos]], and four other bishops. In 1828, modern 's first president [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] called for union of  with , and numerous minor uprisings took place. Reaction to Ottoman misrule led to uprisings by both  and  , although none were successful. After centuries of neglect by the Ottoman Empire, the poverty of most of the people and the ever-present tax collectors fuelled  nationalism, and by the 20th century the idea of ''[[enosis|union]]'' with newly independent  was firmly rooted among  .

Under Ottoman rule, numeracy, school enrolment and literacy rates were all low. They persisted some time after Ottoman rule ended, and then increased rapidly during the twentieth century.

The island would serve Britain as a key military base for its colonial routes. By 1906, when the Famagusta harbour was completed,  was a strategic naval outpost overlooking the [[Suez Canal]], the crucial main route to  which was then Britain's most important overseas possession. Following the outbreak of the [[First World War]] and the decision of the Ottoman Empire to join the war on the side of the [[Central Powers]], on 5 November 1914 the  Empire formally annexed  and declared the Ottoman ''[[Khedive|Khedivate]]'' of [[Khedivate of | and ]] a [[Sultanate of |''Sultanate'' and  protectorate]].

In October 1915, Britain offered  to , ruled by King [[Constantine I of ]], on the condition that  join the war on the side of the  and went to [[Kingdom of |]]’s assistance, in order to fulfill her Treaty obligations under the [[– Alliance of 1913|Serbo- pact]] of May 1913. It gave  a golden 
“opportunity” in achieving ''[[enosis]]'' with . Alternatively it was a
“lost opportunity” when the [[Alexandros Zaimis|Zaimis]] administration declined the  proposal.

In 1923, under the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]], the nascent  republic relinquished any claim to , and in 1925 it was declared a  [[crown colony]]. During the [[Second World War]], many  and   enlisted in the [[ Regiment]].

The   population, meanwhile, had become hopeful that the  administration would lead to ''enosis''. The idea of ''enosis'' was historically part of the ''[[Megali Idea]]'', a greater political ambition of a  state encompassing the territories with large  populations in the former Ottoman Empire, including  and [[Asia Minor]] with a capital in [[Constantinople]], and was actively pursued by the [[ Orthodox Church]], which had its members educated in . These religious officials, together with  military officers and professionals, some of whom still pursued the ''Megali Idea'', would later found the guerrilla organisation [[EOKA]] ''(Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston'' or National Organisation of  Fighters). The   viewed the island as historically  and believed that union with  was a natural right. In the 1950s, the pursuit of ''enosis'' became a part of the  national policy.

Initially, the   favoured the continuation of the  rule. However, they were alarmed by the   calls for ''enosis'', as they saw the union of [[Cretan State|Crete]] with , which led to the exodus of [[Cretan Turks]], as a precedent to be avoided, and they took a pro-partition stance in response to the militant activity of EOKA. The   also viewed themselves as a distinct ethnic group of the island and believed in their having a separate right to [[self-determination]] from  . Meanwhile, in the 1950s,  leader [[Adnan Menderes|Menderes]] considered  an "extension of ", rejected the partition of  along ethnic lines and favoured the annexation of the whole island to . Nationalistic slogans centred on the idea that " is " and the ruling party declared  to be a part of the  homeland that was vital to its security. Upon realising that the fact that the   population was only 20% of the islanders made annexation unfeasible, the national policy was changed to favour partition. The slogan "Partition or Death" was frequently used in   and  protests starting in the late 1950s and continuing throughout the 1960s. Although after the Zürich and London conferences  seemed to accept the existence of the  state and to distance itself from its policy of favouring the partition of the island, the goal of the  and   leaders remained that of creating an independent  state in the northern part of the island.

In January 1950, the Church of  organised a [[ enosis referendum, 1950|referendum]] under the supervision of clerics and with no   participation, where 96% of the participating   voted in favour of ''enosis''.{{rp|9}} The  were 80.2% of the total island's population at the time ([[Demographics of |census 1946]]). Restricted autonomy under a constitution was proposed by the  administration but eventually rejected. In 1955 the EOKA organisation was founded, seeking union with  through armed struggle. At the same time the [[ Resistance Organisation]] (TMT), calling for Taksim, or partition, was established by the   as a counterweight.  officials also tolerated the creation of the  underground organisation TMT The Secretary of State for the Colonies in a letter dated 15 July 1958 had advised the Governor of  not to act against TMT despite its illegal actions so as not to harm  relations with the  government.

During  rule, the future of the island became a matter of disagreement between the two prominent ethnic communities, [[ ]], who made up 77% of the population in 1960, and [[ ]], who made up 18% of the population. From the 19th century onwards, the   population pursued ''[[enosis]]'', union with [[]], which became a  national policy in the 1950s. The   population initially advocated the continuation of the  rule, then demanded the annexation of the island to , and in the 1950s, together with , established a policy of ''[[Taksim (politics)|taksim]]'', the partition of  and the creation of a  polity in the north.[[File:Ethnographic distribution in  1960.jpg|thumb|Ethnic map of  according to the 1960 census]]

As per the [[Zürich and London Agreement]],  officially attained independence on 16 August 1960, and at the time had a total population of 573,566; of whom 442,138 (77.1%) were , 104,320 (18.2%) Turks, and 27,108 (4.7%) others. The UK retained the two [[Sovereign Base Areas]] of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]], while government posts and public offices were allocated by ethnic quotas, giving the minority   a permanent veto, 30% in parliament and administration, and granting the three mother-states guarantor rights.

However, the division of power as foreseen by the constitution soon resulted in legal impasses and discontent on both sides, and nationalist militants started training again, with the military support of  and  respectively. The   leadership believed that the rights given to   under the 1960 constitution were too extensive and designed the [[Akritas plan]], which was aimed at reforming the constitution in favour of  , persuading the international community about the correctness of the changes and violently subjugating   in a few days should they not accept the plan. Tensions were heightened when  President Archbishop [[Makarios&nbsp;III]] called for [[Zürich and London Agreement#13 Amendments proposed by Makarios III|constitutional changes]], which were rejected by {{rp|17–20}} and opposed by  .

Intercommunal violence [[Bloody Christmas (1963)|erupted]] on 21 December 1963, when two   were killed at an incident involving the   police. The violence resulted in the death of 364&nbsp; and 174&nbsp; , destruction of 109   or mixed villages and displacement of 25,000–30,000  . The crisis resulted in the end of the   involvement in the administration and their claiming that it had lost its legitimacy;{{rp|56–59}} the nature of this event is still controversial.

In 1964,  threatened to invade  in response to the continuing [[ intercommunal violence]], but this was stopped by a strongly worded telegram from the US President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on 5 June, warning that the US would not stand beside  in case of a consequential Soviet invasion of  territory. Meanwhile, by 1964, ''enosis'' was a  policy and would not be abandoned; Makarios and the  prime minister [[Georgios Papandreou]] agreed that ''enosis'' should be the ultimate aim and King [[Constantine II of |Constantine]] wished  "a speedy union with the mother country".  dispatched 10,000 troops to  to counter a possible  invasion.

The [[Bloody Christmas (1963)|crisis of 1963–64]] had brought further [[ intercommunal violence|intercommunal violence]] between the two communities, displaced more than 25,000   into [[  enclaves|enclaves]]{{rp|56–59}} and brought the end of   representation in the republic.

[[File:Famagusta-Varosha 2007.JPG|thumb|[[Varosha, Famagusta|Varosha (Maraş)]], a suburb of Famagusta, was abandoned when its inhabitants fled in 1974 and remains under  military control.]]
On 15 July 1974, the [[ military junta of 1967–1974| military junta]] under [[Dimitrios Ioannides]] carried out a [[1974  coup d'état|coup d'état]] in , to [[Enosis|unite the island with ]]. The coup ousted president [[Makarios&nbsp;III]] and replaced him with pro-[[enosis]] nationalist [[Nikos Sampson]]. In response to the coup,{{efn|See:}} five days later, on 20 July 1974, the [[ invasion of | army invaded]] the island, citing a right to intervene to restore the constitutional order from the 1960 [[Treaty of Guarantee (1960)|Treaty of Guarantee]]. This justification has been rejected by the [[United Nations]] and the international community.

The  air force began bombing  positions in , and hundreds of [[paratroopers]] were dropped in the area between Nicosia and Kyrenia, where well-armed   enclaves had been long-established; while off the Kyrenia coast,  troop ships landed 6,000 men as well as tanks, trucks and armoured vehicles.

Three days later, when a ceasefire had been agreed,  had landed 30,000 troops on the island and captured Kyrenia, the corridor linking Kyrenia to Nicosia, and the   quarter of Nicosia itself. The junta in [[Athens]], and then the Sampson regime in  fell from power. In Nicosia, [[Glafkos Clerides]] temporarily assumed the presidency. But after the peace negotiations in [[Geneva]], the  government reinforced their Kyrenia bridgehead and started a second invasion on 14 August. The invasion resulted in [[Morphou]], [[Karpass Peninsula|Karpass]], Famagusta and the [[Mesaoria]] coming under  control.

International pressure led to a ceasefire, and by then 36% of the island had been taken over by the Turks and 180,000   had been evicted from their homes in the north. At the same time, around 50,000   were displaced to the north and settled in the properties of the displaced  . Among a variety of sanctions against , in mid-1975 the US Congress imposed an arms embargo on  for using US-supplied equipment during the [[ invasion of ]] in 1974. There were 1,534   and 502   missing as a result of the fighting from 1963 to 1974.

The Republic of  has ''[[de jure]]'' [[sovereignty]] over the entire island, including its [[territorial waters]] and [[exclusive economic zone]], with the exception of the Sovereign Base Areas of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]], which remain under the UK's control according to the [[London-Zürich Agreements|London and Zürich Agreements]]. However, the island is ''[[de facto]]'' partitioned into two main parts: the area under the effective control of the Republic of , in the south and west and comprising about 59% of the island's area, and the north, administered by the self-declared  Republic of Northern , covering about 36% of the island's area. Another nearly 4% of the island's area is covered by the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in |UN buffer zone]]. The international community considers the northern part of the island to be territory of the Republic of  occupied by  forces.{{efn|See:}} The occupation is viewed as illegal under international law and amounting to illegal occupation of EU territory since  became a member of the [[European Union]].

===Post-division===

After the restoration of constitutional order and the return of Archbishop [[Makarios&nbsp;III]] to  in December 1974,  troops remained, occupying the northeastern portion of the island. In 1983, the [[Assembly of the Republic (Northern )|  parliament]], led by the   leader [[Rauf Denktaş]], [[Declaration of Independence of the  Republic of Northern |proclaimed]] the  Republic of Northern  (TRNC), which is recognised only by .

The events of the summer of 1974 dominate the [[ dispute|politics]] on the island, as well as [[Greco- relations]]. [[ settlers in Northern | settlers]] have been settled in the north with the encouragement of the  and   states.

Attempts to resolve the  dispute have continued. In 2004, the [[Annan Plan]], drafted by then UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]], was put to a [[ Annan Plan referendums, 2004|referendum]] in both  administrations. 65% of   voted in support of the plan and 74%   voted against the plan, saying that it disproportionately favoured   and gave unreasonable influence over the nation to . In total, 66.7% of the voters [[ Annan Plan referendum, 2004|rejected the Annan Plan]].

On 1 May 2004  joined the [[European Union]], together with nine other countries.  was accepted into the EU as a whole, although the EU legislation is suspended in Northern  until a final settlement of the  problem.

Efforts have been made to enhance freedom of movement between the two sides. In April 2003, Northern  unilaterally eased checkpoint restrictions, permitting  to cross between the two sides for the first time in 30 years. In March 2008, a wall that had stood for decades at the boundary between the Republic of  and the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in |UN buffer zone]] was demolished. The wall had cut across [[Ledra Street]] in the heart of Nicosia and was seen as a strong symbol of the island's 32-year division. On 3 April 2008, Ledra Street was reopened in the presence of  and   officials. The two sides relaunched reunification talks in 2015, but these collapsed in 2017.

The [[European Union]] warned in February 2019 that  was selling [[Passports of the European Union|EU passports]] to [[ oligarch]]s, and thus would allow [[organized crime|organised crime]] syndicates to infiltrate the EU. In 2020, leaked documents revealed a wider range of former and current officials from , , Dubai, , the  Federation, ,  and  who bought a  citizenship prior to a change of the law in July 2019. Since 2020  and  have been [[– maritime zones dispute|engaged in a dispute]] over the extent of their [[exclusive economic zone]]s, ostensibly sparked by oil and gas exploration in the area.

In November 2023, the [[ Confidential]] data leak published by the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] showed the country's financial network entertaining strong links with  oligarchs and high-up figures in the Kremlin, supporting the regime of [[Vladimir Putin]].

In July 2024, on the 50th anniversary of the  invasion of Northern ,  President Erdoğan rejected a United Nations-endorsed plan for a federal government and supported the idea of having two separate states within .   immediately rejected Erdoğan's two-state proposal, calling it a "non-starter".

===Prehistory===
[[File:Sailing Canoe brailed on starboard tack, Jaliut Lagoon,  (1899-1900).jpg|thumb|Marshall Islanders sailing, with sails [[brail]]ed ([[reefing|reefed]]), c. 1899–1900]]

Linguistic and anthropological studies have suggested that the first [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] settlers of the  arrived from the [[ (archipelago)|]]. [[Radiocarbon dating]] suggests that [[Bikini Atoll]] may have been inhabited as early as 1200 BCE, though samples may not have been collected from secure [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] contexts and older driftwood samples may have affected results. Archaeological digs on other atolls have found evidence of human habitation dating around the 1st century CE at the village of [[Laura, |Laura]] on [[Majuro]] and on [[Kwajalein Atoll]].

The Austronesian settlers [[Domesticated plants and animals of Austronesia|introduced Southeast Asian crops]], including [[coconut]]s, [[Cyrtosperma merkusii|giant swamp taro]], and [[breadfruit]], as well as domesticated chickens throughout the . They possibly seeded the islands by leaving coconuts at seasonal fishing camps before permanently settling years later. The southern islands receive heavier rainfall than the north, so communities in the wet south subsisted on prevalent taro and breadfruit, while northerners were more likely to subsist on [[pandanus]] and coconuts. Southern atolls probably supported larger, more dense populations.

[[File:Stick chart-BHM 1920.530.0032-P8260228.JPG|thumb|A  [[ stick chart|stick chart]]. Most were made from a grid of coconut frond midribs with small shells representing the relative location of islands.]]

The  sailed between islands on [[walap]]s made from breadfruit-tree wood and coconut-fiber rope. They navigated by using the stars for orientation and initial course setting, but also developed a [[piloting]] technique of interpreting disruptions in [[Swell (ocean)|ocean swells]] to determine the location of low coral atolls below the horizon. They noticed that swells refracted around the undersea slope of atolls. When refracted swells from different directions met, they created noticeable disruption patterns, which  pilots could read to determine the direction of an island. When interviewed by anthropologists, some  sailors noted that they piloted their canoes by both sight and feeling changes in the motion of the boat. Sailors also invented [[ stick chart|stick charts]] to map the swell patterns, but unlike western navigational charts, the  stick charts were tools for teaching students and for consultation before embarking on a voyage; navigators did not take charts with them when they set sail.

When  explorer [[Otto von Kotzebue]] visited the Marshalls in 1817, the islanders still showed few signs of western influence. He observed that the  lived in thatched-roof huts, but their villages did not include the large ornate meeting houses found in other parts of . They did not have furniture, except for woven mats, which they used for both floor coverings and clothing. The  had pierced ears and [[tattoo]]s. He learned that  families practiced [[infanticide]] after the birth of a third child as a form of population planning due to frequent [[famine]]s. He also noted that  [[Iroijlaplap|iroij]] held considerable authority and rights to all property, though he had a more favorable view of the condition of  commoners than of that of [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] commoners. The Marshalls' two island groups, the [[Ratak]] and [[Ralik]] chains, were each ruled by a paramount chief, or iroijlaplap, who held authority over the individual island iroij.

===European exploration===
[[File:Reception of the Manila Galleon by the Chamorro in the Ladrones Islands, ca. 1590.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Manila galleon|Manila Galleon]] in the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] and [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]], c. 1590 [[Boxer Codex]]]]

On August 21, 1526,  explorer [[Alonso de Salazar]] was the first European to sight the . While commanding the ''[[Loaísa Expedition|Santa Maria de la Victoria]]'', he sighted an atoll with a green lagoon, which may have been [[Bokak Atoll|Taongi]]. The crew could not land, because of strong currents and water too deep for the ship's anchor, so the ship sailed for [[Guam]] two days later.

On January 2, 1528, the expedition of [[Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón]] landed on an uninhabited island, possibly in [[Ailinginae Atoll]], where they resupplied and stayed for six days. Natives from a neighboring island briefly met the . This expedition named the islands 'Los Pintados' or "the Painted Ones" for the natives who wore tattoos. Later  explorers of the Marshalls included [[Ruy López de Villalobos]], [[Miguel López de Legazpi]], [[Alonso de Arellano]], and [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira]], though coordinates and geographic descriptions in 16th century  logs are sometimes imprecise, leaving uncertainty about the specific islands they sighted and visited.

On July 6, 1565, the  ship ''San Jeronimo'' nearly wrecked at [[Ujelang Atoll]] after the ship's pilot [[Lope Martín]] led a mutiny. While the mutineers were resupplying at Ujelang, several crew members took back control of the ship and marooned Martín and twenty-six other mutineers in the Marshalls. By the late 16th century,  galleons sailing between the Americas and the  kept to a sea lane at 13°N and provisioned at Guam, avoiding the Marshalls, which  sailors saw as unprofitable islands amid hazardous waters.

The  sea captains [[John Marshall (Royal Navy officer, born 1748)|John Marshall]] and [[Thomas Gilbert (sea captain)|Thomas Gilbert]] visited the islands in 1788. Their vessels had been part of the [[First Fleet]] taking convicts from England to [[Botany Bay]] in [[New South Wales]], and were en route to [[Guangzhou]] when they passed through the [[Gilbert Islands]] and . On June 25, 1788, the  ships had peaceful interactions and traded with islanders at [[Mili Atoll]]; their meeting may have been the first contact between Europeans and  since the Mendaña expedition of 1568. Subsequent navigational charts and maps named the islands for John Marshall.

From the 1820s through the 1850s, the Marshall Islanders became increasingly hostile to western vessels, possibly because of violent punishments that sea captains exacted for theft as well as the [[Blackbirding|abduction]] of  people for sale into slavery on Pacific plantations. One of the earliest violent encounters occurred in February 1824, when the inhabitants of Mili Atoll massacred marooned sailors from the  [[whaler]] ''[[Globe (1815 whaleship)|Globe]]''. Similar encounters occurred as late as 1851 and 1852, when three separate  attacks on ships occurred at [[Ebon Atoll|Ebon]], [[Jaluit Atoll|Jaluit]], and [[Namdrik Atoll]]s.

===Colonial period===
[[File: colonial album 1880s img26.jpg|thumb|Offices of the Pacific Navigation Co. at Jaluit Atoll in the late 1880s]]

In 1857, [[ Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] sent two families to establish a mission church and school at [[Ebon Atoll|Ebon]]. By 1875, the missionaries had established churches on five atolls and had baptized more than 200 islanders, and one traveler noted that most women on Ebon wore western clothes and many men wore trousers by the mid-1870s.

In 1859, Adolph Capelle and another merchant arrived at Ebon and set up a trading post for the  company Hoffschlaeger & Stapenhorst. When the firm went bankrupt in 1863, Capelle partnered with  ex-whaler Anton Jose DeBrum to establish a [[copra]] trading firm: Capelle & Co. In 1873, the company moved its headquarters to [[Jaluit Atoll|Jaluit]], the home of [[Kabua the Great|Kabua]], a powerful [[iroijlaplap|iroij]] and disputed successor for the [[paramount chief]]tainship of the southern [[Ralik|Ralik Chain]]. In the 1870s, various other companies from , Hawaii, , and the  engaged in the copra trade in the . By 1885, the  firms [[Hernsheim & Co]]. and Deutsche Handels- und Plantagen-Gesellschaft Der Südsee Inseln zu Hamburg controlled two-thirds of the trade.

Contact between the  and westerners led to sometimes lethal outbreaks of western diseases, including [[influenza]], [[measles]], [[syphilis]], and [[typhoid fever]]. Increased access to alcohol led to social problems in some  communities, and on several atolls conflicts erupted between rival iroij with access to firearms.

==== protectorate====
[[File: colonial album 1880s img12.jpg|thumb| colonial administration building at Jaluit Atoll in 1886]]

In 1875, the  and  governments conducted a series of secret negotiations to divide the Western Pacific into [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]. The  sphere included the . On November 26, 1878, the  warship [[SMS Ariadne (1871)|SMS ''Ariadne'']] anchored at Jaluit to begin treaty negotiations with the chiefs to grant the [[ Empire]] "[[Most favoured nation|most favored nation]]" status in the Ralik Chain. During the second day of negotiations, Captain {{ill|Bartholomäus von Werner|de}} ordered his men to give military demonstrations which he later said were intended to "show the islanders, who have not seen anything like it before, the power of the Europeans." On November 29, Werner signed a treaty with Kabua and several other Ralik Chain iroij which secured a  [[fuelling station]] at Jaluit and free use of the atoll's harbor.

On August 29, 1885, [[Chancellor of | Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] authorized the annexation of the  as a [[protectorate]] following repeated petitions by  business interests. The  gunboat {{SMS|Nautilus|1871|2}} docked at Jaluit on October 13 to take control. On October 15, iroij Kabua, Loeak, Nelu, Lagajime, and Launa signed a protection treaty in  and  at the  consulate. While the  text made no distinction of rank among the five chiefs, the  text recognized Kabua as the King of the , despite an ongoing dispute between Kabua and Loeak over the [[iroijlaplap|paramount chief]]tainship. A company of  marines hoisted the [[flag of the  Empire]] over Jaluit, and performed similar ceremonies at seven other atolls in the Marshalls, though several pro- iroij refused to recognize the  protectorate until threatened with  naval force in mid-1886. [[]] was incorporated into the  Protectorate of the  in 1888, following the [[Anglo- Declarations about the Western Pacific Ocean|Anglo- Declarations]] of April 1886.

The  commercial interests formed the [[Joint-stock company|joint-stock]] [[Jaluit Company]], which was responsible for financing the colony's administration. In addition to controlling two-thirds of the  copra trade, the company had the authority to collect commercial license fees and an annual [[poll tax]]. The company also had the right to be consulted on all new laws and ordinances and nominated all colonial administrative staff. The company's licensing fees and legal advantages pushed out  and  competition, creating a monopoly in the  Pacific colonies. The  government protested the regulations benefiting the Jaluit Company as a violation of the Anglo- Declarations' free-trade provision. On March 31, 1906, the  government assumed direct control and reorganized the  and  as part of the protectorate of [[ New ]].

==== mandate====
[[File:Nan'yo-cho Jaluit Branch Office.JPG|thumb|South Seas Government branch office, Jaluit, c. 1932]]

The [[Imperial  Navy]] invaded [[Enewetak Atoll|Enewetak]] on September 29, 1914, and [[Jaluit Atoll|Jaluit]] on September 30 at the beginning of [[Asian and Pacific theatre of World War I|World War I]]. An occupation force was stationed on Jaluit on October 3. At the [[Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919, 's Pacific colonies north of the equator became the  [[South Seas Mandate]] under the system of [[League of Nations mandate]]s.  ceded the  to  with the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] on June 28, 1919.

The  navy administered the islands from late 1914 through 1921. The civilian {{nihongo|South Seas Government|南洋廳|Nan'yō-chō}} set up its headquarters in [[]] in April 1922 and administered the Marshalls until World War II.  surveys determined that the Marshalls' value was primarily strategic, because they could enable future [[Nanshin-ron|southward expansion]]. The Marshalls also continued to be a major producer of copra during the  period, with the {{nihongo|South Seas Trading Company|南洋貿易会社|Nan'yō Bōeki Kaisha}} taking over the Jaluit Company's operations and building upon the  colonial infrastructure. Other parts of the South Seas Mandate experienced heavy  settlement, shifting the population to majority  in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] and , but  settlers remained a minority under 1,000 people in the  throughout the  period, because the islands were distant from  and had the most limited economic potential in .

[[File:Kwajalein-Invasion 1944.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Kwajalein]] in 1944]]

On March 27, 1933,  declared its intentions to withdraw from the [[League of Nations]], officially withdrawing in 1935 but continuing to control the territory of the South Seas Mandate.  military planners initially discounted the Marshalls as too distant and indefensible for extensive fortification, but as  developed long-range bombers, the islands became useful as a forward base to attack ,  colonies, and the . In 1939 and 1940, the navy built military airfields on [[Kwajalein Atoll|Kwajalein]], [[Maloelap Atoll|Maloelap]], and [[Wotje Atoll]]s as well as seaplane facilities at Jaluit.

After the outbreak of the [[Pacific War]], the [[ Pacific Fleet]] carried out the [[Marshalls–Gilberts raids]], which struck Jaluit, Kwajalein, Maloelap, and Wotje on February 1, 1942. They were the first  air raids on  territory. The  invaded the  on January 31, 1944, during the [[Gilbert and  campaign]]. The  simultaneously invaded Majuro and Kwajalein.

As the  campaign advanced through  and [[Volcano and Ryukyu Islands campaign|into the Ryukyu Islands]], the four -held atolls were cut off from supplies and subject to  bombardment. The garrisons began running out of provisions in late 1944, leading to high casualties from starvation and disease.

From 1946 to 1958, it served as the [[Pacific Proving Grounds]] for the  and was the site of 67 [[nuclear test]]s on various atolls.

[[Operation Crossroads]] atomic bomb testing began in 1946 on [[Bikini Atoll]] after some of the residents were forcibly evacuated.

The world's first [[hydrogen bomb]], codenamed "[[Ivy Mike|Mike]]", was tested at the [[Enewetak atoll]] in the  on November 1 (local date) in 1952, which produced significant fallout in the region.

Over the years just one of over 60 islands was cleaned by the U.S. government, and the inhabitants are still waiting for the 2 billion dollars in compensation assessed by the Nuclear Claims Tribunal. Many of the islanders and their descendants still live in exile, as the islands remain contaminated with high levels of radiation.

A significant [[radar]] installation was constructed on [[Kwajalein]] atoll.

There have been a number of local and national elections since the Republic of the  was founded. The United Democratic Party, running on a reform platform, won the [[1999  general election|1999 general election]], taking control of the presidency and cabinet.

The islands signed a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the  in 1986. Trusteeship was ended under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 683]] of December 22, 1990. Until 1999 the islanders received [[ dollar|US$]]180 million for continued  use of Kwajalein atoll, US$250 million in compensation for [[nuclear test]]ing, and US$600 million in other payments under the compact.

Despite the constitution, the government was largely controlled by Iroij. It was not until 1999, following [[political corruption]] allegations, that the [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] government was overthrown, with [[Imata Kabua]] replaced by the [[commoner]] [[Kessai Note]].

The Runit Dome was built on [[Runit Island]] to deposit U.S.-produced [[radioactive]] soil and debris, including lethal amounts of [[plutonium]]. There are ongoing concerns about deterioration of the waste site and a potential [[radioactive contamination|radioactive spill]].

Following independence, the  continued to play a prominent role in the testing and launches of missiles and rockets for both military and commercial space purposes. All five of the [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 1]] rocket flights were carried out on [[Omelek Island]] within the Kwajalein Atoll. The fourth launch of the [[Falcon 1]] was successful, marking the first time in history a privately developed, fully liquid-fueled launch vehicle achieved orbit.

In early 2025, the  established its first marine protected area, covering 48,000 sq kms around the northern atolls of [[Bikar]] and [[Bokak]], in its intention to protect two of the country's most pristine marine ecosystems, including the largest turtle nesting site and a significant shark population, by prohibiting extractive activities of fishing. The MPA combines traditional knowledge with modern science to preserve its vital ocean habitats for the future.{{citation needed|date=November 2025}}

The longest continuous inhabitants are groups such as the [[Baka people ( and )|Baka]] ([[Pygmy peoples|Pygmies]]). From there, [[Bantu expansion|Bantu migrations]] into eastern, southern and central Africa are believed to have occurred about 2,000 years ago. The [[Sao civilisation|Sao]] culture arose around Lake , {{circa|500 CE}}, and gave way to the Kanem and its successor state, the [[Kanem–Bornu Empire|Bornu Empire]]. Kingdoms, [[Fon (title)|fondoms]], and [[chiefdom]]s arose in the west.

They noted an abundance of the ghost shrimp ''[[Lepidophthalmus turneranus]]'' in the [[Wouri River]] and named it {{lang|pt|Rio dos Camarões}} (''Shrimp River''), which became '''' in . Over the following few centuries, European interests regularised trade with the coastal peoples, and Christian [[missionaries]] pushed inland.

Later, [[Gustav Nachtigal]] made a treaty with one of the local kings to annex the region for the  emperor. The [[ Empire]] claimed the territory as the colony of [[Kamerun]] in 1884 and began a steady push inland; the natives resisted in the [[Bafut Wars]] and [[Adamawa Wars]]. Under the aegis of , commercial companies were local administrations. These [[Concession (contract)|concession]]s used [[Unfree labour|forced labour]] to run profitable banana, rubber, palm oil, and cocoa plantations. Even infrastructure projects relied on a regimen of forced labour. This economic policy was much criticised by the other colonial powers.

The federal republic was composed of two federated states, [[East ]] and [[West ]], each with its own legislature, government, and prime minister. 1 October is now observed as [[Unification Day ()|Unification Day]], a [[Public holidays in |public holiday]].

Ahidjo's political party, the [[ National Union| National Union]] (CNU), became the sole legal political party on 1 September 1966, and on 20 May 1972, a [[1972  constitutional referendum|referendum]] was passed to abolish the [[Federation|federal system of government]] in favour of a United Republic of , headed from [[Yaoundé]]. This day is now the country's [[National Day ()|National Day]], a public holiday. Ahidjo pursued an economic policy of [[planned liberalism]], prioritising [[cash crops]] and petroleum development. The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects; however, many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them. The [[Flag of |national flag]] was changed on 20 May 1975 with the two stars removed and replaced with a large central star as a symbol of national unity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2025}}

Ahidjo stepped down on 4 November 1982 and left power to his constitutional successor, [[Paul Biya]]. However, Ahidjo remained in control of the CNU and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning. Biya began his administration by moving toward a more democratic government, but a failed [[ Palace Guard Revolt|coup d'état]] nudged him toward the leadership style of his predecessor.

In June 2006, talks concerning a territorial dispute over the [[Bakassi]] peninsula were resolved. The talks involved President Paul Biya of , then President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] of , and then UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], and resulted in  control of the oil-rich peninsula. The northern portion of the territory was formally handed over to the  government in August 2006, and the remainder of the peninsula was left to  two years later, in 2008. The boundary change triggered a [[Bakassi conflict|local separatist insurgency]], as many Bakassians refused to accept  rule.

In September, separatists started [[Anglophone Crisis|a guerilla war]] for the independence of the Anglophone region as the Federal Republic of [[Ambazonia]]. The government responded with a military offensive, and the insurgency spread across the Northwest and Southwest regions. {{As of|2019}}, fighting between separatist guerillas and government forces continues. During 2020, numerous terrorist attacks—many of them carried out without claims of credit—and government reprisals have led to bloodshed throughout the country. Since 2016, more than 450,000 people have fled their homes.

{{Main|Early  history|Kingdom of Kongo}}

The geographical area now known as the  was populated as early as 90,000 years ago, as shown by the 1988 discovery of the [[Semliki harpoon]] at [[Katanda Territory|Katanda]], one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found, believed to have been used to catch [[Bagrus|giant river catfish]].

[[Bantu peoples]] reached [[Central Africa]] at some point during the first millennium BC, then gradually started to expand southward. Their propagation was accelerated by the adoption of [[pastoralism]] and of [[Iron Age]] techniques. The people living in the south and southwest were foraging groups, whose technology involved only minimal use of metal technologies. The development of metal tools during this time period revolutionized agriculture. This led to the displacement of the [[African pygmies]]. Following the Bantu migrations, a period of state and class formation began circa 700 with three centres in the modern-day territory; one to the west around [[Pool Malebo]], one east around [[Lake Mai-Ndombe]], and a third even further east and south around the [[Upemba Depression]].{{Rp|page=|pages=17–18}}

By the 13th century, there were three main confederations of states in the western  Basin around Pool Malebo. In the east were the [[Seven Kingdoms of Kongo dia Nlaza]], considered to be the oldest and most powerful, which likely included [[Nsundi]], [[Mbata Kingdom|Mbata]], [[Mpangu]], and possibly [[Kundi kingdom|Kundi]] and [[Okanga]]. South of these was [[Mpemba]] which stretched from modern-day [[]] to the [[ River]]. It included various kingdoms such as [[Mpemba Kasi]] and [[Vunda]]. To its west across the  River was a confederation of three small states; [[Vungu]] (its leader), [[Kakongo]], and [[Ngoyo]].{{Rp|pages=24–25}}

The [[Kingdom of Kongo]] was founded in the 14th century and dominated the western region. The empire of [[Mwene Muji]] was founded around Lake Mai-Ndombe. From the Upemba Depression the [[Luba Empire]] and [[Lunda Empire]] emerged in the 15th and 17th centuries respectively dominated the eastern region.

[[ Free State| exploration]] and administration took place from the 1870s until the 1920s. It was first led by [[Henry Morton Stanley]], who undertook his explorations under the sponsorship of King [[Leopold II of ]]. The eastern regions of the precolonial  were heavily disrupted by constant [[slave raiding]], mainly from Arab–Swahili [[Arab slave trade|slave traders]] such as the infamous [[Tippu Tip]], who was well known to Stanley. Leopold had designs on what was to become the  as a colony. In a succession of negotiations, Leopold, professing humanitarian objectives in his capacity as chairman of the [[front organization]] ''[[Association Internationale Africaine]]'', actually played one European rival against another.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} King Leopold formally acquired rights to the  territory at the [[Berlin Conference|Conference of Berlin]] in 1885 and made the land his private property. He named it the [[ Free State]]. Leopold's regime began various infrastructure projects, such as the construction of the [[Matadi–Kinshasa Railway|railway that ran from the coast to the capital]] of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa), which took eight years to complete.

In the  Free State, colonists coerced the local population into producing rubber to meet the growing international demand driven by the spread of automobiles and the development of rubber tires. Rubber sales made a fortune for Leopold, who built several buildings in [[Brussels]] and [[Ostend]] to honor himself and his country. To enforce the rubber quotas, the ''[[Force Publique]]'' was called in and made the practice of cutting off the limbs of the natives a matter of policy. Under the  Free State, concessions were granted to private industries, giving them monopolies over violence and resource extraction. The most brutal of these concession zones surrounded rubber plantations. Concession regions were aligned with villages, where local chiefs were employed to help enforce strict quotas. Failure to comply or meet these quotas often resulted in the kidnapping of family members, who were held for ransom until quotas were met or subjected to physical violence. Violence was carried out by "village sentries"—militias led by European officers and composed of African soldiers—tasked with ensuring rubber collection. These sentries operated with full impunity, lacked proper oversight, and were reportedly known to kill and eat underperforming workers

During 1885–1908, between 1.2 and 13 million  died as a consequence of exploitation and disease. In some areas the population declined dramatically – it has been estimated that [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] and [[smallpox]] killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower  River. News of the abuses began to circulate. In 1904, the [[ Empire| consul]] at [[Boma, |Boma]] in the , [[Roger Casement]], was instructed by the  government to investigate. His report, called the [[Casement Report]], confirmed the accusations of humanitarian abuses. The  Parliament forced Leopold II to set up an independent commission of inquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement's report of abuses, concluding that the population of the  had been "reduced by half" during this period. Determining precisely how many people died is impossible, as no accurate records exist.

In 1908, the  parliament, in spite of initial reluctance, bowed to international pressure (especially from the [[ of Great Britain and |]]) and took over the Free State from King Leopold II. On 18 October 1908, the  parliament voted in favour of annexing the  as a  colony. Executive power went to the [[Minister of the Colonies ()| minister of colonial affairs]], assisted by a Colonial Council (Conseil Colonial) (both located in Brussels). The  parliament exercised legislative authority over the  . In 1923 the colonial capital moved from [[Boma, |Boma]] to Léopoldville, some {{convert|300|km}} further upstream into the interior. [[File: belge campagne 1918.jpg|upright|thumbnail|left|''[[Force Publique]]'' soldiers in the   in 1918. At its peak, the Force Publique had around 19,000  soldiers, led by 420  officers.]]The transition from the  Free State to the   was a break, but it also featured a large degree of continuity. The last governor-general of the  Free State, Baron [[Théophile Wahis]], remained in office in the   and the majority of Leopold II's administration with him. Opening up the  and its natural and mineral riches to the  economy remained the main motive for colonial expansion&nbsp;– however, other priorities, such as healthcare and basic education, slowly gained in importance.

Colonial administrators ruled the territory and a dual legal system existed (a system of European courts and another one of indigenous courts, ''tribunaux indigènes''). Indigenous courts had only limited powers and remained under the firm control of the colonial administration. The  authorities permitted no political activity in the  whatsoever, and the ''Force Publique'' put down any attempts at rebellion.

The   was directly involved in the two world wars. During [[World War I]] (1914–1918), an initial stand-off between the ''Force Publique'' and the  colonial army in [[ East Africa]] turned into open warfare with a joint Anglo-- invasion of  colonial territory in 1916 and 1917 during the [[East African campaign (World War I)|East African campaign]]. The ''Force Publique'' gained a notable victory when it marched into [[Tabora]] in September 1916 under the command of General [[Charles Tombeur]] after heavy fighting.

After 1918,  was rewarded for the participation of the ''Force Publique'' in the East African campaign with a [[League of Nations]] mandate over the previously  colony of [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. During [[World War II]], the   provided a crucial source of income for the [[ government in exile]] in London, and the ''Force Publique'' again participated in [[East African campaign (World War II)|Allied campaigns in Africa]].   forces under the command of  officers notably fought against the  colonial army in  in [[Asosa]], Bortaï and [[Siege of Saïo|Saïo]] under Major-General [[Auguste Gilliaert|Auguste-Eduard Gilliaert]].

In May 1960, a growing nationalist movement, the [[Mouvement National Congolais]] led by [[Patrice Lumumba]], won the [[1960   general election|parliamentary elections]]. Lumumba became the first [[Prime Minister of the |Prime Minister]] of the , on 24 June 1960. The parliament elected [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] as [[President of the |president]] of the Alliance des Bakongo ([[ABAKO]]) party. Other parties that emerged included the [[Parti Solidaire Africain]] led by [[Antoine Gizenga]], and the Parti National du Peuple led by Albert Delvaux and [[Laurent Mbariko]].

The   achieved independence on 30 June 1960 under the name "République du " ("Republic of " or "" in ). Shortly after, on 15 August 1960, the neighboring  colony of [[ |Middle ]] also gained independence and adopted the same name, '[[|Republic of ]].' To avoid confusion between the two, the former   became known as the  ('''DR '''), while the former  colony retained the name '' ('''''').

Shortly after independence the ''Force Publique'' mutinied, and on 11 July the [[Katanga Province|province of Katanga]] (led by [[Moïse Tshombe]]) and [[South Kasai]] [[ Crisis|engaged in secessionist struggles]] against the new leadership. Most of the 100,000 [[White people in the |Europeans]] who had remained behind after independence fled the country. After the United Nations rejected Lumumba's call for help to put down the secessionist movements, Lumumba asked for assistance from the Soviet Union, who accepted and sent military supplies and advisers. On 23 August, the  armed forces [[Invasion of South Kasai|invaded South Kasai]]. Lumumba was dismissed from office on 5 September 1960 by Kasa-Vubu who publicly blamed him for massacres by the armed forces in South Kasai and for involving Soviets in the country. On 7 September, Lumumba made a speech to the  House of Representatives, arguing his dismissal was illegal under the nation's laws.  law gave parliament, not the president, the authority to dismiss a government minister. The House and Senate both rejected the dismissal of Lumumba, but the removal proceeded unconstitutionally.

On 14 September, Colonel [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Joseph Mobutu]], with the backing of the US and , removed Lumumba from office. On 17 January 1961, Lumumba was handed over to Katangan authorities and executed by -led Katangan troops. A 2001 investigation by 's Parliament found  "morally responsible" for the murder of Lumumba, and the country has since officially apologised for its role in his death.

On 18 September 1961, in ongoing negotiations of a ceasefire, a [[1961 Ndola United Nations DC-6 crash|plane crash near Ndola]] resulted in the death of [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], along with all 15 passengers, setting off a succession crisis. Amidst widespread confusion and chaos, a temporary government was led by technicians (the [[College of Commissioners-General|Collège des commissaires généraux]]). Katangan secession ended in January 1963 with the [[United Nations Operation in the |assistance of UN forces]]. Several short-lived governments of [[Joseph Iléo|Joseph Ileo]], [[Cyrille Adoula]], and Moise Kapenda Tshombe took over in quick succession.

Meanwhile, in the east of the country, Soviet and -backed rebels called the [[Simba rebellion|Simbas]] rose up, taking a significant amount of territory and proclaiming a communist "People's " in Stanleyville. The Simbas were pushed out of Stanleyville in November 1964 during [[Operation Dragon Rouge]], a military operation conducted by  and  forces to rescue hundreds of hostages.  government forces fully defeated the Simba rebels by November 1965.

Lumumba had previously appointed Mobutu chief of staff of the new  army, [[Armed Forces of the |Armée Nationale Congolaise]]. Taking advantage of the leadership crisis between Kasavubu and Tshombe, Mobutu garnered enough support within the army to launch a coup. A [[1964  (Léopoldville) constitutional referendum|constitutional referendum]] the year before [[Second Mobutu coup d'état|Mobutu's coup of 1965]] resulted in the country's official name being changed to the "". In 1971 Mobutu changed the name again, this time to "Republic of Zaire".

Mobutu had the staunch support of the  because of his [[Anti-communism|opposition to communism]]; the U.S. believed that his administration would serve as an effective counter to communist movements in Africa. A [[One-party state|single-party system]] was established, and Mobutu declared himself [[List of heads of state of the |head of state]]. He periodically held elections in which he was the only candidate. Although relative peace and stability were achieved, Mobutu's government was guilty of severe [[human rights]] violations, [[political repression]], a [[cult of personality]] and [[Corruption in the |corruption]].

By late 1967, Mobutu had successfully neutralized his political opponents and rivals, either through co-opting them into his regime, arresting them, or rendering them otherwise politically impotent.{{sfn|Young|Turner|2013|p=58}} Throughout the late 1960s, Mobutu continued to shuffle his governments and cycle officials in and out of the office to maintain control. Joseph Kasa-Vubu's death in April 1969 ensured that no person with First Republic credentials could challenge his rule.{{sfn|Young|Turner|2013|pp=61–62}} By the early 1970s, Mobutu was attempting to assert Zaire as a leading African nation. He traveled frequently across the continent while the government became more vocal about African issues, particularly those relating to the southern region. Zaire established semi-clientelist relationships with several smaller African states, especially , , and .{{sfn|Young|Turner|2013|p=64}}

Corruption became so common the term "''le mal Zairois''" or "Zairian sickness", meaning gross corruption, theft and mismanagement, was coined, reportedly by Mobutu.{{sfn|Young|Turner|2013|p=74}} International aid, most often in the form of loans, enriched Mobutu while he allowed national infrastructure such as roads to deteriorate to as little as one-quarter of what had existed in 1960. Zaire became a [[kleptocracy]] as Mobutu and his associates embezzled government funds.

In a campaign to identify himself with African nationalism, starting on 1 June 1966, Mobutu renamed the nation's cities: Léopoldville became Kinshasa (the country was known as -Kinshasa), Stanleyville became [[Kisangani]], Elisabethville became [[Lubumbashi]], and Coquilhatville became [[Mbandaka]]. In 1971, Mobutu renamed the country the ''Republic of Zaire'', its fourth name change in eleven years and its sixth overall. The  River was renamed the Zaire River.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Mobutu was invited to visit the  on several occasions, meeting with U.S. Presidents [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]]. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] U.S. relations with Mobutu cooled, as he was no longer deemed necessary as a [[Cold War]] ally. Opponents within Zaire stepped up demands for reform. This atmosphere contributed to Mobutu's declaring the Third Republic in 1990, whose constitution was supposed to pave the way for democratic reform. The reforms turned out to be largely cosmetic. Mobutu continued in power until armed forces forced him to flee in 1997. "From 1990 to 1993, the  facilitated Mobutu's attempts to hijack political change", one academic wrote, and "also assisted the rebellion of Laurent-Desire Kabila that overthrew the Mobutu regime."

In September 1997, Mobutu died in exile in .

By 1996, following the [[ Civil War]] and [[ genocide|genocide]] and the ascension of a [[Tutsi]]-led government in ,  [[Hutu]] militia forces ([[Interahamwe]]) fled to eastern Zaire and used refugee camps as bases for incursions against . They allied with the Zairian Armed Forces to launch a campaign against  ethnic Tutsis in eastern Zaire.

A coalition of  and  armies invaded Zaire to overthrow the government of Mobutu, launching the First  War. The coalition allied with some opposition figures, led by [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], becoming the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of ]]. In 1997 Mobutu fled and Kabila marched into Kinshasa, naming himself as president and reverting the name of the country to the .

Kabila later requested that foreign military forces return to their own countries.  troops retreated to [[Goma]] and launched a new Tutsi-led rebel military movement called the [[Rally for  Democracy|Rassemblement Congolais pour la Democratie]] to fight Kabila, while  instigated the creation of a rebel movement called the [[Movement for the Liberation of the ]], led by  warlord [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The two rebel movements, along with  and  troops, started the Second  War by attacking the DRC army in 1998. , , and  militaries entered the hostilities on the side of the government.

Kabila was assassinated in 2001. His son [[Joseph Kabila]] succeeded him and called for multilateral peace talks. UN peacekeepers, MONUC, now known as [[MONUSCO]], arrived in April 2001. In 2002–03, Bemba intervened in the  on behalf of its former president, [[Ange-Félix Patassé]]. Talks led to a peace accord under which Kabila would share power with former rebels, implemented between 2002 and 2003. The most widely reported estimate for the death toll during the Second  War is 5.4 million people, though other estimates put it at three million. It has been described as the deadliest conflict since [[World War II]]. By June 2003 all foreign armies except those of  had pulled out of . A [[Transitional Government of the |transitional government]] was set up until an election was held. A constitution was approved by voters; further, on 30 July 2006, DRC held its [[2006  general election|first multi-party elections]]. These were the first free national elections since 1960, which many believed would mark the end to violence in the region. However, an election-result dispute between Kabila and Bemba turned into a skirmish between their supporters in Kinshasa. MONUC took control of the city. The second round of the election took place in October 2006, which Kabila won, and in December 2006 he was sworn in as president.

In March 2009, after a deal between the DRC and ,  troops entered the DRC and arrested Nkunda and were allowed to pursue FDLR militants. The CNDP signed a peace treaty with the government in which it agreed to become a political party and to have its soldiers integrated into the national army in exchange for the release of its imprisoned members. In 2012 [[Bosco Ntaganda]], the leader of the CNDP, and troops loyal to him, [[M23 rebellion (2012–2013)|mutinied]] and briefly captured the provincial capital of Goma in November 2012.

Neighboring countries have been accused of arming rebel groups and using them as proxies to gain control of the resource-rich country. In March 2013, the [[United Nations Security Council]] authorized the [[United Nations Force Intervention Brigade]] to neutralize armed groups. In 2013, the [[Mai-Mai]] created by Laurent Kabila briefly invaded the provincial capital of [[Lubumbashi]] and 400,000 people are displaced in the province {{As of|2013|lc=y}}. On and off fighting in the [[Ituri conflict]] occurred between the [[Nationalist and Integrationist Front]] and the [[Union of  Patriots]]. In the northeast, [[Joseph Kony]]'s [[Lord's Resistance Army]] moved from their original bases in  and  to DR  in 2005 and set up camps in the [[Garamba National Park]].

In 2015, [[19 January 2015 DRC protests|major protests]] broke out across the country and protesters demanded that Kabila step down as president. On 27 November 2016  foreign minister [[Raymond Tshibanda]] told the press no elections would be held in 2016: "it has been decided that the voter registration operation will end on July 31, 2017, and that election will take place in April 2018." [[December 2016  protests|Protests broke out in the country on 20 December]] when Kabila's term in office ended. Across the country, dozens of protesters were killed and hundreds were arrested.

Human Rights Watch said in 2017 that Kabila recruited former 23 March Movement fighters to put down country-wide protests over his refusal to step down from office at the end of his term. "M23 fighters patrolled the streets of 's main cities, firing on or arresting protesters or anyone else deemed to be a threat to the president," they said. Fierce fighting has erupted in Masisi between government forces and a powerful local warlord, General Delta. The United Nations mission in the DRC is its largest and most expensive peacekeeping effort, but it shut down five UN bases near Masisi in 2017, after the U.S. led a push to cut costs.

On 30 December 2018, a [[2018  general election|general election]] was held. The election was originally scheduled for 23 December, but was postponed after a warehouse fire destroyed several electronic voting machines, prompting concerns about potential tampering. Polling eventually opened on 30 December across most of the country, though voting remained suspended in certain areas—a measure officials said was intended to protect residents from an ongoing Ebola outbreak in eastern provinces.

After polls closed, the government imposed an internet blackout in some regions, announcing that service would be restored following the release of results, which had been slated for 6 January.

On 10 January 2019, the electoral commission announced opposition candidate [[Félix Tshisekedi]] as the winner of the presidential vote, and he was officially sworn in as president on 24 January. However, there were widespread suspicions that the results were rigged and that a deal had been made between Tshisekedi and Kabila, as professional election polls carried out on election day found that Martin Fayulu, the leading opposition candidate, was expected to take 47% of the vote, compared to 23% for Felix Tshisekedi and 19% for Emmanuel Shadary, Kabila's hand-picked successor.

In August 2019, six months after the inauguration of Félix Tshisekedi, a coalition government was announced. Tshisekedi succeeded in strengthening his hold on power, gaining the support of almost 400 out of 500 members of the National Assembly, the pro-Kabila speakers of both houses of parliament being forced out. In April 2021, the [[Lukonde cabinet|new government]] was formed without the supporters of Kabila.

A [[2019–2020 measles outbreak in the |major measles outbreak]] in the country left nearly 5,000 dead in 2019. The [[2018 Équateur province Ebola outbreak|Ebola outbreak]] ended in June 2020, after causing 2,280 deaths over 2 years. The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] also [[COVID-19 pandemic in the |reached the DRC]] in March 2020, with a [[COVID-19 vaccination in the |vaccination campaign]] beginning on 19 April 2021.

On 22 April 2021, meetings between  President [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] and Tshisekedi resulted in new agreements increasing international trade and security (counterterrorism, immigration, cyber security, and customs) between the two countries. In February 2022, [[2022  coup d'état allegations|allegations of a coup d'état]] in the country led to uncertainty, but the coup attempt failed. In December 2023, President Felix Tshisekedi won [[2023  general election|reelection]] with more than 70% of the vote.

The M23 Movement had a [[M23 campaign (2022–present)|resurgence in 2022]] and [[– conflict (2022–present)|received military assistance from ]], which accused the  government of supporting the [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of |FDLR]] Hutu militia. In early 2025, the conflict escalated with the M23 capture of [[2025 Goma offensive|Goma]] and [[2025 Bukavu offensive|Bukavu]], involving thousands of  troops. Peace negotiations between  and the DRC brokered by the  took place in the spring of 2025, and culminated in the signing of a peace deal on 27 June 2025. The [[2025 – peace agreement|peace agreement]] calls for the withdrawal of  troops from eastern  within 90 days and the end of the DRC's support for the FDLR, along with the creation of a regional economic integration framework for the two countries. Despite the treaty, the [[United Nations Human Rights Office|United Nations Humans Rights Office (UNHRO)]] found that hostilities in the provinces where Goma and Bukavu are located, increased during the period from January to July 2025. UNHRO found that M23, along with the occupying [[ Defence Force| Defense Force (RDF)]] soldiers allegedly massacred hundreds of civilians in four villages within [[Rutshuru]], a region within [[North Kivu]] province. In July 2025, a Declaration of Principles was signed in [[Doha]] as a first agreement on shared objectives for a ceasefire, and to limit future violence in the conflict. In October 2025, former president Joseph Kabila was sentenced to death in absentia for alleged collaboration with the rebel group M23.
==History==
{{Main|History of }}

===Prehistoric ===
{{main|Prehistoric }}
During the [[last glacial period]], and until about 16,000 BC, much of  was periodically covered in ice. The [[relative sea level]] was less than 50&nbsp;m lower resulting in an [[ice bridge]] (but not a [[land bridge]]) forming between  and Great Britain. By 14,000 BC this ice bridge existed only between Northern  and Scotland and by 12,000 BC  was completely separated from Great Britain. Later, around 6,100 BC, Great Britain became separated from continental Europe. Until recently, the earliest evidence of human activity in  was dated at 12,500 years ago, demonstrated by a butchered bear bone found in a cave in [[County Clare]]. In 2021, a reindeer bone with chop marks, which had been found in Castlepook Cave near [[Doneraile]], County Cork in the early twentieth century during [[Richard J. Ussher]]'s excavations, was dated to 33,000 years ago by Dr Ruth Carden a [[paleozoologist]] from the School of Archaeology in [[University College Dublin]], pushing back the earliest signs of human activity by 20,000 years.

By about 8,000 BC, more sustained occupation of the island has been shown, with evidence for [[Mesolithic]] communities around the island.

Some time before 4,000 BC, [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] [[Early European Farmers|settlers]] introduced cereal [[cultivar]]s, domesticated animals such as cattle and sheep, built large timber buildings, and stone monuments. The earliest evidence for farming in  or Great Britain is from [[Ferriter's Cove]], [[County Kerry]], where a flint knife, cattle bones and a sheep's tooth were [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon-dated]] to {{circa|4,350 BC}}. Field systems were developed in different parts of , including at the {{lang|ga|[[Céide Fields]]}}, that has been preserved beneath a blanket of peat in present-day [[Tyrawley]] in northwest Mayo.  An extensive [[field system]], arguably the oldest in the world, consisted of small divisions separated by [[dry-stone wall]]s. The fields were farmed for several centuries between 3,500 BC and 3,000 BC. [[Wheat]] and [[barley]] were the principal crops.

The [[Bronze Age]] began around 2,500 BC, with technology changing people's everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the wheel, harnessing [[oxen]], [[weaving|weaving textiles]], brewing [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[metalworking]], which produced new weapons and tools, along with fine gold decoration and jewellery, such as [[brooch]]es and [[torc]]s.

=== Celts ===
How and when the island became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the [[Celts]] being one of the more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. The most recent genetic research strongly associates the spread of [[Indo-European languages]] (including [[Celtic languages|Celtic]]) through Western Europe with a people bringing a composite [[Bell Beaker culture]], with its arrival in Britain and  dated to around the middle of the third millennium BC. According to [[John T. Koch]] and others,  in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading culture called the [[Atlantic Bronze Age]] that also included Britain, western  and Iberia, and that this is where Celtic languages developed. This contrasts with the traditional view that their origin lies in mainland Europe with the [[Hallstatt culture]].

[[File:Uragh Stone Circle.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Uragh Stone Circle|The Uragh Stone Circle]], a [[Neolithic]] [[stone circle]] in [[Tuosist]], close to Gleninchaquin Park, [[County Kerry]]]]
The long-standing traditional view is that the Celtic language, [[Ogham]] script and culture were brought to  by waves of invading or migrating Celts from mainland Europe. This theory draws on the ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'', a medieval Christian pseudo-history of , along with the presence of Celtic culture, language and artefacts found in  such as Celtic bronze spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of . The [[Priteni]] were said to be the first, followed by the [[Belgae]] from northern [[Gaul]] and Britain. Later, [[Laigin|Laighin]] tribes from [[Armorica]] were said to have invaded  and Britain more or less simultaneously. Lastly, the [[Milesians ()|Milesians]] ([[Gaels]]) were said to have reached  from either northern Iberia or southern Gaul. It was claimed that a second wave named the Euerni, belonging to the Belgae people of northern Gaul, began arriving about the 6th century BC. They were said to have given their name to the island.

The theory was advanced in part because of the lack of archaeological evidence for large-scale Celtic immigration, though it is accepted that such movements are notoriously difficult to identify. Historical linguists are skeptical that this method alone could account for the absorption of Celtic language, with some saying that an assumed processual view of Celtic linguistic formation is 'an especially hazardous exercise'. Genetic lineage investigation into the area of Celtic migration to  has led to findings that showed no significant differences in [[mitochondrial DNA]] between  and large areas of continental Europe, in contrast to parts of the Y-chromosome pattern. When taking both into account, a study concluded that modern Celtic speakers in  could be thought of as European "Atlantic Celts" showing a shared ancestry throughout the Atlantic zone from northern Iberia to western Scandinavia rather than substantially central European.
In 2012, research showed that the occurrence of genetic markers for the earliest farmers was almost eliminated by Beaker-culture immigrants: they carried what was then a new Y-chromosome R1b marker, believed to have originated in Iberia about 2,500 BC. The prevalence amongst modern  men of this mutation is a remarkable 84%, the highest in the world, and closely matched in other populations along the Atlantic fringes down to . A similar genetic replacement happened with lineages in mitochondrial DNA. This conclusion is supported by recent research carried out by the geneticist [[David Reich (geneticist)|David Reich]], who says: " and  skeletons from the Bronze Age that followed the Beaker period had at most 10 per cent ancestry from the first farmers of these islands, with other 90 per cent from people like those associated with the Bell Beaker culture in the ." He suggests that it was Beaker users who introduced an Indo-European language, represented here by Celtic (i.e. a new language and culture introduced directly by migration and genetic replacement).

[[File:Dalriada.png|right|thumb|upright=0.75|The [[Scoti]] were [[Gaels|Gaelic]]-speaking people from  who settled in western Scotland in the 6th century or before.]]
The earliest written records of  come from classical [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] geographers. [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' refers to  as ''Mikra Brettania'' ("Little Britain"), in contrast to the larger island which he called ''Megale Brettania'' ("Great Britain"). In [[Ptolemy's map of |his map of ]] in his later work, ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', Ptolemy refers to  as ''[[Hibernia|Iouernia]]'' and to Great Britain as ''Albion''. These names were likely to have been the local names for the islands at the time. The earlier names, [[Exonym and endonym|in contrast]], were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made.

The [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] referred to  by this name too in its [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] form, ''Hibernia'', or [[Scotia]]. Ptolemy records 16 nations inhabiting every part of  in 100 AD. The relationship between the Roman Empire and the kingdoms of ancient  is unclear. However, finds of Roman coins have been made, for example at the Iron Age settlement of Freestone Hill near [[Gowran]] and [[Newgrange]].

 continued as a patchwork of rival kingdoms; however, beginning in the 7th century, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through the concept of a [[High King of ]]. [[Medieval  literature]] portrays an almost unbroken sequence of high kings stretching back thousands of years, but some modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.

All of the  kingdoms had their own kings but were nominally subject to the high king. The high king was drawn from the ranks of the provincial kings and ruled also the royal [[kingdom of Meath]], with a ceremonial capital at the [[Hill of Tara]]. The concept did not become a political reality until the [[Viking Age#|Viking Age]] and even then was not a consistent one.  did have a culturally unifying rule of law: the early written judicial system, the [[Brehon Laws]], administered by a professional class of jurists known as the ''brehons''.

''[[The Chronicle of ]]'' records that in 431, Bishop [[Palladius (bishop of )|Palladius]] arrived in  on a mission from [[Pope Celestine I]] to minister to the  "already believing in Christ". The same chronicle records that [[ Patrick]], 's best known [[Patron  of places|patron ]], arrived the following year. There is continued debate over the missions of Palladius and Patrick, but the consensus is that they both took place and that the older [[druid]] tradition collapsed in the face of Christianity.  Christian scholars excelled in the study of Latin and  learning and Christian theology. In the monastic culture that followed the Christianisation of , Latin and  learning was preserved in  during the [[Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]] in contrast to elsewhere in Western Europe, where the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]] followed the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]].{{page needed|date=October 2019}}

[[File:KellsFol032vChristEnthroned.jpg|thumb|right|A folio of the [[Book of Kells]] showing Christ enthroned]]
The arts of [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]], metalworking and sculpture flourished and produced treasures such as the ''[[Book of Kells]]'', ornate jewellery and the many carved stone crosses that still dot the island today. A mission founded in 563 on [[Iona]] by the  monk  [[Columba]] began [[Hiberno- mission|a tradition of  missionary]] work that spread [[Celtic Christianity]] and learning to Scotland, England and the [[Frankish Empire]] on continental Europe after the fall of Rome. These missions continued until the [[late Middle Ages]], establishing monasteries and centres of learning, producing scholars such as [[Sedulius Scottus]] and [[Johannes Eriugena]] and exerting much influence in Europe.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

From the 9th century, waves of [[Viking]] raiders plundered  monasteries and towns. These raids added to a pattern of raiding and [[endemic warfare]] that was already deep-seated in . The Vikings were involved in establishing most of the major coastal settlements in : [[Dublin]], [[Limerick]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Wexford]], [[Waterford]], as well as other smaller settlements.{{unreliable source?|date=October 2019}}

[[File:Trim Castle 6.jpg|thumb|Remains of the 12th-century [[Trim Castle]] in [[County Meath]], the largest [[Norman architecture|Norman castle]] in ]]
On 1 May 1169, an expedition of [[Cambro-Norman]] knights, with an army of about 600 men, landed at [[Bannow|Bannow Strand]] in present-day [[County Wexford]]. It was led by [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]], known as 'Strongbow' owing to his prowess as an archer. The invasion, which coincided with a period of renewed Norman expansion, was at the invitation of [[Diarmait Mac Murchada|Dermot Mac Murrough]], [[Kings of Leinster|King of Leinster]].

In 1166, Mac Murrough had fled to [[County of Anjou|Anjou]], , following a war involving [[Tighearnán Ua Ruairc]], of [[Breifne]], and sought the assistance of the [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]] King [[King Henry II of England|Henry II]], in recapturing his kingdom. In 1171, Henry arrived in  in order to review the general progress of the expedition. He wanted to re-exert royal authority over the invasion which was expanding beyond his control. Henry successfully re-imposed his authority over Strongbow and the Cambro-Norman warlords and persuaded many of the  kings to accept him as their overlord, an arrangement confirmed in the 1175 [[Treaty of Windsor 1175|Treaty of Windsor]].

The invasion was legitimised by reference to provisions of the alleged [[Papal Bull]] ''[[Laudabiliter]]'', issued by an Englishman, [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]], in 1155. The document apparently encouraged Henry to take control in  in order to oversee the financial and administrative reorganisation of the [[Celtic Church| Church]] and its integration into the Roman Church system. Some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the [[Synod of Kells]] in 1152. There has been significant controversy regarding the authenticity of ''Laudabiliter'', and there is no general agreement as to whether the bull was genuine or a forgery. Further, it had no standing in the  legal system.
[[File: 1450.png|thumb|left|Political boundaries in  in 1450, before the [[plantations of |plantations]]]]

In 1172, Pope [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]] further encouraged Henry to advance the integration of the  Church with Rome. Henry was authorised to impose a tithe of one penny per hearth as an annual contribution. This church levy, called [[Peter's Pence]], is extant in  as a voluntary donation. In turn, Henry assumed the title of [[Lord of ]] which Henry conferred on his younger son, [[John Lackland]], in 1185. This defined the Anglo-Norman administration in  as the [[Lordship of ]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} When Henry's successor, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] died unexpectedly in 1199, [[John of England|John]] inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of . Over the century that followed, Norman feudal law gradually replaced the Gaelic Brehon Law across large areas, so that by the late 13th century the [[Hiberno-Norman|Norman-]] had established a feudal system throughout much of . Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and the seeds of the modern county system. A version of [[Magna Carta]] (the [[Great Charter of ]]), substituting ''Dublin'' for ''London'' and the '' Church'' for, the  church at the time, the ''Catholic Church'', was published in 1216 and the [[Parliament of ]] was founded in 1297.

=== Gaelicisation ===
From the mid-14th century, after the [[Black Death]], Norman settlements in  went into a period of decline. The Norman rulers and the Gaelic  elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the [[Parliament of #Middle Ages| parliament]] passed the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] in 1367. These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into  society by requiring  subjects in  to speak , follow  customs and abide by  law.

By the end of the 15th century, central  authority in  had all but disappeared, and a renewed  culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was again dominant.  Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as [[The Pale]], and under the provisions of [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] of 1494,  Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the [[ Privy Council]].

The title of [[King of ]] was re-created in 1542 by [[Henry VIII]], the then [[King of England]], of the [[Tudor dynasty]].  rule was reinforced and expanded in  during the latter part of the 16th century, leading to the [[Tudor conquest of ]]. A near-complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the 17th century, following the [[Nine Years' War ()|Nine Years' War]] and the [[Flight of the Earls]].

This control was consolidated during the wars and conflicts of the 17th century, including the  and  colonisation in the [[Plantations of ]], the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] and the [[Williamite War in |Williamite War]].  losses during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (which, in , included the [[ Confederacy]] and the [[Cromwellian conquest of ]]) are estimated to include 20,000 battlefield casualties. 200,000 civilians are estimated to have died as a result of a combination of war-related famine, displacement, guerrilla activity and pestilence throughout the war. A further 50,000{{efn|Numbers vary, from a low of 12,000. [[Giovanni Battista Rinuccini]] wrote 50,000, T. N. Burke said 80,000 to 100,000.}} were sent into [[indentured servitude]] in the [[West Indies]]. Physician-general [[William Petty]] estimated that 504,000 Catholic  and 112,000 Protestant settlers died, and 100,000 people were transported, as a result of the war. If a prewar population of 1.5 million is assumed, this would mean that the population was reduced by almost half.

The religious struggles of the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in . Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the  King and Parliament. After the passing of [[Test Act#Test Act of 1673|the Test Act 1672]], and the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] over the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the  Parliament. Under the emerging [[Penal Laws ()|Penal Laws]],  Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various civil rights, even the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed in 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists. The new Anglo- ruling class became known as the [[Protestant Ascendancy]].

The "[[ Famine (1740–1741)#Cause|Great Frost]]" struck  and the rest of Europe between December 1739 and September 1741, after a decade of relatively mild winters. The winters destroyed stored crops of potatoes and other staples, and the poor summers severely damaged harvests.{{page needed|date=October 2019}} This resulted in the [[ Famine (1740–1741)|famine of 1740]]. An estimated 250,000 people (about one in eight of the population) died from the ensuing pestilence and disease. The  government halted export of corn and kept the army in quarters but did little more. Local gentry and charitable organisations provided relief but could do little to prevent the ensuing mortality.

In the aftermath of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared in the latter part of this century and the [[ architecture|architectural legacy of ]]  was built. In 1782, [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] was repealed, giving  legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The  government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of  without the consent of the  parliament.

In 1798, members of the Protestant Dissenter tradition (mainly [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the [[Society of United Irishmen]], with the aim of creating an independent . Despite assistance from  the [[ Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] was put down by  and  government and yeomanry forces. The rebellion lasted from the 24th of May to the 12th of October that year and saw the establishment of the short lived [[ Republic (1798)]] in the province of [[Connacht]]. It saw numerous battles across the island with an estimated 30,000 people dead.{{citation needed|date=November 2024}}

===Union with Great Britain===
{{Main| of Great Britain and }}

As a direct result of the 1798 rebellion in its aftermath in 1800, the  and  parliaments both passed [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the [[Kingdom of ]] and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] to create a [[ of Great Britain and ]].

The passage of the Act in the  Parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities, having failed on the first attempt in 1799. According to contemporary documents and historical analysis, this was achieved through a considerable degree of bribery, with funding provided by the  Secret Service Office, and the awarding of peerages, places and honours to secure votes. Thus, the parliament in  was abolished and replaced by a [[Parliament of the |united parliament at Westminster]] in London, though resistance remained, as evidenced by [[Robert Emmet]]'s failed [[ Rebellion of 1803]].

Aside from the development of the [[linen]] industry,  was largely passed over by the [[Industrial Revolution]], partly because it lacked coal and iron resources and partly because of the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw  as a source of agricultural produce and capital.

[[File:(1891) p118 THE FAMINE AT BOFIN.jpg|thumb|A depiction of the [[Great Famine ()|Great Famine]] from ''Our Boys in '' by Henry Willard  (1891)]]
The [[Great Famine ()|Great Famine]] of 1845–1851 devastated , as in those years 's population fell by one-third. More than one million people died from starvation and disease, with an additional million people emigrating during the famine, mostly to the  and . In the century that followed, an economic depression caused by the famine resulted in a further million people emigrating. By the end of the decade, half of all [[immigration to the ]] was from . The period of civil unrest that followed until the end of the 19th century is referred to as the [[Land War]]. Mass emigration became deeply entrenched and the population continued to decline until the mid-20th century. Immediately prior to the famine the population was recorded as 8.2 million by the [[1841 census of |1841 census]]. The population has never returned to this level since. The population continued to fall until 1961; [[County Leitrim]] was the final  county to record a population increase post-famine, in 2006.

The 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of modern [[ nationalism]], primarily among the Roman Catholic population. The pre-eminent  political figure after the Union was [[Daniel O'Connell]]. He was elected as Member of Parliament for [[Ennis (UK Parliament constituency)|Ennis]] in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat [[The Test Act|as a Roman Catholic]]. O'Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the Prime Minister, the -born soldier and statesman, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. Steering the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Bill]] through Parliament, aided by future prime minister [[Robert Peel]], Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant [[George IV of the |George IV]] to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. [[George III|George's father]] had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]], to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing [[Catholic Emancipation]] to be in conflict with the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].

Daniel O'Connell led a subsequent campaign, for the repeal of the Act of Union, which failed. Later in the century, [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or "[[ Home Rule Bills|Home Rule]]". Unionists, especially those located in Ulster, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests. After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914. To prevent this from happening, the [[Ulster Volunteers]] were formed in 1913 under the leadership of [[Edward Carson]].

Their formation was followed in 1914 by the establishment of the [[ Volunteers]], whose aim was to ensure that the [[Third Home Rule Act|Home Rule Bill]] was passed. The Act was passed but with the "temporary" exclusion of the six counties of Ulster, which later became Northern . Before it could be implemented, however, the Act was suspended for the duration of the [[First World War]]. The  Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under [[John Redmond]], took the name [[National Volunteers]] and supported [[ and World War I| involvement]] in the war. A minority, approximately 13,000, retained the  Volunteers' name and opposed 's involvement in the war.

[[File:Sackville Street (Dublin) after the 1916 Easter Rising.JPG|thumb|Sackville Street (now [[O'Connell Street]]), Dublin, after the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]]]
The [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 was carried out by the latter group together with a smaller socialist militia, the [[ Citizen Army]]. The  response, executing 15 leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people, turned the mood of the country in favour of the rebels. Support for [[Physical force  republicanism| republicanism increased]] further due to the ongoing war in Europe, as well as the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]].

The pro-independence republican party, [[Sinn Féin]], received overwhelming endorsement in the [[1918  general election|general election of 1918]], and in 1919 proclaimed an [[ Republic]], setting up its own parliament ({{lang|ga|[[First Dáil|Dáil Éireann]]}}) and government. Simultaneously the Volunteers, which became known as the [[ Republican Army]] (IRA), launched a [[ War of Independence|three-year guerrilla war]], which ended in a truce in July 1921 (although violence continued until June 1922, mostly in Northern ).

===Partition===
{{Main|Partition of }}

In December 1921, the [[Anglo- Treaty]] was concluded between the  government and representatives of the [[Second Dáil]]. It gave  complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed [[Northern ]] to remain within the , which it immediately exercised. Additionally, Members of the [[Third Dáil|Free State Parliament]] were required to swear [[Oath of Allegiance ()|an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the  Free State]] and make a statement of faithfulness to the king. Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent [[ Civil War]] between the new government of the [[ Free State]] and those opposed to the treaty, led by [[Éamon de Valera]]. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.

====Independence====
{{main|History of the Republic of |Economy of the Republic of }}

[[File:Anglo- Treaty Griffith annotated2.gif|thumb|Annotated page from the [[Anglo- Treaty]] that established the [[ Free State]] and independence for 26 out of 32 [[Counties of | counties]]]]
During its first decade, the newly formed  Free State was governed by the victors of the civil war. When de Valera achieved power, he took advantage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] and [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|political circumstances]] to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government. The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted. This completed a process of gradual separation from the  Empire that governments had pursued since independence. However, it was not until 1949 that the state was declared, officially, to be the [[Republic of ]].

[[ neutrality|The state was neutral]] during [[The Emergency ()|World War II]], but offered [[ neutrality during World War II|clandestine assistance to the Allies]], particularly in the potential defence of Northern . Despite their country's neutrality, approximately 50,000 volunteers from independent  joined the  forces during the war, four being awarded [[Victoria Crosses]].

The [[Abwehr| intelligence]] was also active in . Its operations ended in September 1941 when [[Garda Síochána|police]] made arrests based on surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in Dublin. To the authorities, counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence. With a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand men at the start of the war, and with limited supplies of modern weapons, the state would have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side in the conflict.

Large-scale emigration marked most of the post-WWII period (particularly during the 1950s and 1980s), but beginning in 1987 the economy improved, and the 1990s saw the beginning of substantial economic growth. This period of growth became known as the [[Celtic Tiger]]. The Republic's real GDP grew by an average of 9.6% per annum between 1995 and 1999, in which year the Republic joined the [[euro]]. In 2000, it was the sixth-richest country in the world in terms of GDP per capita. Historian [[R. F. Foster (historian)|R. F. Foster]] argues the cause was a combination of a new sense of initiative and the entry of  corporations. He concludes the chief factors were low taxation, pro-business regulatory policies, and a young, tech-savvy workforce. For many multinationals, the decision to do business in  was made easier still by generous incentives from the [[IDA |Industrial Development Authority]]. In addition [[European Union]] membership was helpful, giving the country lucrative access to markets that it had previously reached only through the , and pumping huge subsidies and investment capital into the  economy.

Modernisation brought secularisation in its wake. The traditionally high levels of religiosity have sharply declined. Foster points to three factors: First,  feminism, largely imported from America with liberal stances on contraception, abortion and divorce, undermined the authority of bishops and priests. Second, the mishandling of the paedophile scandals humiliated the Church, whose bishops seemed less concerned with the victims and more concerned with covering up for errant priests. Third, prosperity brought hedonism and materialism that undercut the ideals of saintly poverty.

The [[post-2008  economic downturn]] dramatically ended this period of boom. GDP fell by 3% in 2008 and by 7.1% in 2009, the worst year since records began (although earnings by foreign-owned businesses continued to grow). The state has since experienced deep recession, with unemployment, which doubled during 2009, remaining above 14% in 2012.

====Northern ====
{{Main|History of Northern |Economy of Northern }}

Northern  resulted from the division of the  by the [[Government of  Act 1920]], and until 1972 was a self-governing jurisdiction within the  with its own parliament and prime minister. Northern , as part of the , was not neutral during the Second World War, and [[Belfast Blitz|Belfast suffered four bombing raids]] in 1941. [[Conscription]] was not extended to Northern , and roughly an equal number volunteered from Northern  as volunteered from the Republic of .

Although Northern  was largely spared the strife of the civil war, in the decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter-communal violence. Nationalists, mainly Roman Catholic, wanted to unite  as an independent republic, whereas unionists, mainly Protestant, wanted Northern  to remain in the . The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern  voted largely along [[sectarian]] lines, meaning that the government of Northern  (elected by [[Plurality electoral system|"first-past-the-post"]] from 1929) was controlled by the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as [[gerrymandering]] and discrimination in housing and employment.

In the late 1960s, nationalist grievances were aired publicly in mass civil rights protests, which were often confronted by [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] counter-protests. The government's reaction to confrontations was seen to be one-sided and heavy-handed in favour of unionists. Law and order broke down as unrest and inter-communal violence increased. The Northern  government requested the [[ Army]] to aid the police and protect the [[ Nationalist]] population. In 1969, the paramilitary [[Provisional  Republican Army|Provisional IRA]], which favoured the creation of a [[united ]], emerged from a split in the [[ Republican Army (1922–1969)| Republican Army]] and began a campaign against what it called the " occupation of the six counties".{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

Other groups, both the unionist and nationalist participated in violence, and a period known as "[[the Troubles]]" began. More than 3,600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict. Owing to the civil unrest during the Troubles, the  government suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed [[Direct rule over Northern |direct rule]]. There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the [[Good Friday Agreement]] was concluded as a treaty between the  and  governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks.

The substance of the Agreement (formally referred to as the Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of . The Agreement restored self-government to Northern  on the basis of power-sharing in a regional [[Northern  Executive|Executive]] drawn from the major parties in a new [[Northern  Assembly]], with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]] drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994, and in 2005, the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning|independent commission]] supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.

The Assembly and power-sharing Executive were suspended several times but were restored again in 2007. In that year the  government officially ended its military support of the police in Northern  ([[Operation Banner]]) and began withdrawing troops. On 27 June 2012, Northern 's deputy first minister and former IRA commander, [[Martin McGuinness]], shook hands with Queen Elizabeth II in Belfast, symbolising reconciliation between the two sides.

At the end of the 15th century, western  was inhabited by several indigenous peoples related by culture to the Mesoamerican civilizations of the [[Aztecs|Aztec]] and [[Maya peoples|Maya]], and by language to the [[Mesoamerican language area]].

The first attempt to conquer  was by the conquistador [[Gil González Dávila]], who had arrived in  in January 1520. 

In 1522, González Dávila ventured to the area that later became the [[Rivas Department]] of .{{rp|35}}{{rp|92}} There he encountered an indigenous Nahua tribe led by chief Macuilmiquiztli, whose name has sometimes been erroneously referred to as "[[Nicarao (cacique)|Nicarao]]" or "". The tribe's capital was Quauhcapolca. González Dávila conversed with Macuilmiquiztli thanks to two indigenous interpreters who had learned , whom he had brought along. 

After exploring and gathering gold{{rp|35}}{{rp|55}} in the fertile western valleys, González Dávila and his men were attacked and driven off by the Chorotega, led by chief [[Diriangen|Diriangén]]. The  tried to convert the tribes to Christianity; Macuilmiquiztli's tribe was baptized,{{rp|86}} but Diriangén was openly hostile to the Spaniards. Western , at the Pacific Coast, became a port and shipbuilding facility for the Galleons plying the waters between [[Manila]], [[]] and [[Acapulco]], [[]].

In 1524, the first  permanent settlements were founded. That year, the conquistador [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (founder of )|Francisco Hernández de Córdoba]] founded two of 's main cities: [[Granada, |Granada]] on [[Lake ]], and then [[León, |León]], west of [[Lake Managua]].{{rp|35, 193}}{{rp|92}} Córdoba soon built defenses for the cities and fought against incursions by other conquistadors.{{rp|92}} Córdoba was later publicly beheaded for having defied his superior, [[Pedro Arias Dávila]].{{rp|35}} Córdoba's tomb and remains were discovered in 2000 in the [[León Viejo|ruins of León Viejo]].

The clashes among  forces did not impede their destruction of the indigenous people and their culture. The series of battles came to be known as the "War of the Captains". Pedro Arias Dávila was a winner;{{rp|35}} although he lost control of , he moved to  and established his base in León. In 1527, León became the capital of the colony.{{rp|93}} Through diplomacy, Arias Dávila became the colony's first governor.

Without women in their parties,{{rp|123}} the  conquerors took Nahua and Chorotega wives and partners, beginning the multiethnic mix of indigenous and European stock now known as "''[[mestizo]]''", which constitutes the great majority of the population in western . Many indigenous people were killed by European [[infectious disease]]s, compounded by neglect by the Spaniards, who controlled their subsistence. Many other indigenous peoples were captured and transported as slaves to  and  between 1526 and 1540.{{rp|193}}{{rp|104–105}}

The [[Act of Independence of Central America]] dissolved the [[Captaincy General of ]] in September 1821, and  soon [[Central America under  rule|became part]] of the [[First  Empire]]. In July 1823, after the overthrow of the  monarchy in March of the same year,  joined the newly formed [[Federal Republic of Central America|United Provinces of Central America]], a country later known as the Federal Republic of Central America.  definitively became an independent republic in 1838.

The early years of independence were characterized by rivalry between the [[Constitutionalist Liberal Party|Liberal]] elite of León and the [[Conservative Party ()|Conservative]] elite of Granada, which often degenerated into civil war, particularly during the 1840s and 1850s. [[Managua]] rose to undisputed preeminence as the nation's capital in 1852 to allay the rivalry between the two feuding cities.

Great Britain, which had claimed the [[Mosquito Coast]] as a [[protectorate]] since 1655, delegated the area to  in 1859 before transferring it to  in 1860. The Mosquito Coast remained an [[autonomous area]] until 1894. [[José Santos Zelaya]], President of  from 1893 to 1909, negotiated the integration of the Mosquito Coast into .

On 18&nbsp;November 1909, U.S. warships were sent to the area after 500 revolutionaries (including two ) were executed by order of Zelaya. The U.S. justified the intervention by claiming to protect U.S. lives and property. Zelaya resigned later that year.{{cn|date=July 2025}}

Mena fled Managua with his brother, the chief of police of Managua, to start an insurrection. After Mena's troops captured steam boats of an  company, the U.S. delegation asked President Díaz to ensure the safety of  citizens and property during the insurrection.

After the U.S. Marines withdrew from  in January 1933, Sandino and the newly elected administration of President [[Juan Bautista Sacasa]] reached an agreement that Sandino would cease his guerrilla activities in return for amnesty, a land grant for an agricultural colony, and retention of an armed band of 100 men for a year. However, due to a growing hostility between Sandino and National Guard director [[Anastasio Somoza García]] and a fear of armed opposition from Sandino, Somoza García ordered his assassination.  

Sacasa invited Sandino for dinner and to sign a peace treaty at the Presidential House on the night of 21&nbsp;February 1934. After leaving the Presidential House, Sandino's car was stopped by National Guard soldiers and they kidnapped him. Later that night, Sandino was assassinated by National Guard soldiers. Later, hundreds of men, women, and children from Sandino's agricultural colony were murdered.

[[File:Trujillo-Somoza 1952.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Anastasio Somoza García]] (left) with [[|]] President [[Rafael Trujillo]] in 1952]]
 has experienced several military dictatorships, the longest being the hereditary dictatorship of the [[Somoza family]], who ruled for 43 nonconsecutive years during the 20th century. The Somoza family came to power in 1937 partly as a result of a U.S.-engineered pact in 1927 that stipulated the formation of the ''Guardia Nacional'' to replace the marines who had long reigned in the country. Somoza García slowly eliminated officers in the national guard who might have stood in his way, and then deposed Sacasa and became president on 1&nbsp;January 1937, in a [[Electoral fraud|rigged election]].

In 1941, during the [[Second World War]],  declared war on [[Empire of |]] (8 December), [[Nazi |]] (11 December), [[Kingdom of |]] (11 December), [[Kingdom of |]] (19 December), [[Kingdom of  (1920–1946)|]] (19 December) and [[Kingdom of |]] (19 December). Only  reciprocated, declaring war on  on the same day (19 December 1941). No soldiers were sent to the war, but Somoza García confiscated properties held by [[ ]] residents. In 1945,  was among the first countries to ratify the United Nations Charter.

On 29 September 1956, Somoza García was shot to death by [[Rigoberto López Pérez]], a 27-year-old Liberal  poet. [[Luis Somoza Debayle]], the eldest son of the late president, was appointed president by the congress and officially took charge of the country. He is remembered by some as moderate, but after only a few years in power died of a heart attack. His successor as president was [[René Schick Gutiérrez]], whom most  viewed "as nothing more than a puppet of the Somozas". Somoza García's youngest son, [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]], often referred to simply as "Somoza", became president in 1967.

An [[1972  earthquake|earthquake in 1972]] destroyed nearly 90% of Managua, including much of its infrastructure. Instead of helping to rebuild the city, Somoza Debayle siphoned off relief money. The mishandling of relief money also prompted [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] star [[Roberto Clemente]] to personally fly to Managua on 31&nbsp;December 1972, but he died ''en route'' in an airplane accident. Even the economic elite were reluctant to support Somoza, as he had acquired monopolies in industries that were key to rebuilding the nation.

The Somoza family was among a few families or groups of influential firms which reaped most of the benefits of the country's growth from the 1950s to the 1970s. When Somoza was deposed by the Sandinistas in 1979, the family's worth was estimated to be between $500&nbsp;million and $1.5&nbsp;billion.

[[File:10th anniversary of the  revolution in Managua, 1989.jpg|thumb|Celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the [[ Revolution]] in [[Managua]] in 1989]]
In 1961, [[Carlos Fonseca]] looked back to the historical figure of Sandino, and along with two other people, one of whom was believed to be Casimiro Sotelo, who was later assassinated, founded the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (FSLN). After the 1972 earthquake and Somoza's apparent corruption, the ranks of the Sandinistas were flooded with young disaffected  who no longer had anything to lose.

In December 1974, a group of the FSLN, in an attempt to kidnap U.S. ambassador Turner Shelton, held some Managuan partygoers hostage after killing the party's host, former agriculture minister Jose Maria Castillo, until the Somoza government met their demands for a large ransom and free transport to [[]]. Somoza granted the demand, and then subsequently sent his national guard out into the countryside to look for the kidnappers, who were described by opponents as terrorists.

On 10 January 1978, [[Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal]], the editor of the national newspaper ''[[La Prensa (Managua)|La Prensa]]'' and ardent opponent of Somoza, was assassinated. It is alleged that the planners and perpetrators of the murder were at the highest echelons of the Somoza regime.

The Sandinistas forcefully took power in July 1979, ousting Somoza, and prompting the exodus of the majority of 's middle class, wealthy landowners, and professionals, many of whom settled in the . The Carter administration decided to work with the new government, while attaching a provision for aid forfeiture if it was found to be assisting insurgencies in neighboring countries. Somoza fled the country, and eventually ended up in [[]], where he was assassinated in September 1980, allegedly by members of the Argentinian Revolutionary Workers' Party.

In 1980, the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Carter administration]] provided $60&nbsp;million in aid to  under the Sandinistas, but the aid was suspended when the administration obtained evidence of  shipment of arms to El  rebels. {{Clarify span|Most people sided with  against the Sandinistas.|date=May 2024}}

====Contras (1981–1990)====
{{Main|Contras}}
[[File:Contra_commandas_1987.jpg|thumb|A group of [[Contras]] in the former [[Zelaya Department]]. Women [[Role of women in the  Revolution|commonly joined]] as combatants.]]
In response to the Sandinistas, various rebel groups collectively known as the "[[Contras]]" were formed to oppose the new government. The [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] ultimately authorized the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to [[ and state-sponsored terrorism#|help the Contra rebels]] with funding, weapons, and training. The Contras operated from camps in the neighboring countries of  to the north and  to the south.

They engaged in a systematic campaign of terror among rural  to disrupt the social reform projects of the Sandinistas. Several historians have criticized the Contra campaign and the [[Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration|Reagan administration's support for the Contras]], citing the brutality and numerous human rights violations of the Contras, alleging that health centers, schools, and cooperatives were destroyed by rebels, and that murder, rape, and torture occurred on a large scale in Contra-dominated areas. The U.S. also carried out a campaign of economic sabotage, and disrupted shipping by planting underwater mines in 's port of [[Corinto, |Corinto]], an action [[ v. |condemned]] by the [[International Court of Justice]] as illegal. The court also found that the U.S. encouraged acts contrary to humanitarian law by producing the manual ''[[Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare]]'' and disseminating it to the Contras. The manual, among other things, advised on how to rationalize killings of civilians. The U.S. also sought to place economic pressure on the Sandinistas, and the Reagan administration imposed a full trade embargo.

The Sandinistas were also accused of human rights abuses including torture, disappearances and mass executions. The [[Inter- Commission on Human Rights]] investigated abuses by Sandinista forces, including an execution of 35 to 40 [[Miskito people|Miskitos]] in December 1981, and an execution of 75 people in November 1984.

In the [[ general election, 1984| general elections of 1984]], which were judged by at least one visiting 30-person delegation of NGO representatives to have been free and fair, the Sandinistas won the parliamentary election and their leader [[Daniel Ortega]] won the presidential election. The Reagan administration criticized the elections as a "sham" based on the claim that [[Arturo Cruz]], the candidate nominated by the [[Coordinadora Democrática Nicaragüense]], comprising three right wing political parties, did not participate in the elections. However, the administration privately argued against Cruz's participation for fear that his involvement would legitimize the elections, and thus weaken the case for  aid to the Contras.

In 1983 the U.S. Congress prohibited federal funding of the Contras, but the Reagan administration illegally continued to back them by covertly selling arms to [[]] and channeling the proceeds to the Contras in the [[–Contra affair]], for which several members of the Reagan administration were convicted of felonies. The [[International Court of Justice]], in regard to the case of [[ v. ]] in 1986, found, "the  of America was under an obligation to make reparation to the Republic of  for all injury caused to  by certain breaches of obligations under customary international law and treaty-law committed by the  of America". During the war between the Contras and the Sandinistas, 30,000 people were killed.

=== Post-war (1990–2018) ===
[[File:Violeta Chamorro 1993.jpg|thumb|In 1990, after the [[Contras|Contra]] war, [[Violeta Chamorro]] became the first woman president democratically elected in the history of the [[Americas]].]]

In the [[1990  general election]], a coalition of anti-Sandinista parties from both the left and right of the political spectrum led by [[Violeta Chamorro]], the widow of Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal, defeated the Sandinistas. The defeat shocked the Sandinistas, who had expected to win.

Exit polls of  reported Chamorro's victory over [[Daniel Ortega|Ortega]] was achieved with a 55% majority. Chamorro was the first woman president of . Ortega vowed he would govern ''desde abajo'' (from below). Chamorro came to office with an economy in ruins, primarily because of the financial and social costs of the Contra War with the Sandinista-led government. In the [[1996  general election|1996 general election]], Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas of the FSLN lost again, this time to [[Arnoldo Alemán]] of the [[Constitutionalist Liberal Party ()|Constitutional Liberal Party]] (PLC).

In [[2001  general election|the 2001 elections]], the PLC again defeated the FSLN, with Alemán's Vice President [[Enrique Bolaños]] succeeding him as president. However, Alemán was convicted and sentenced in 2003 to 20 years in prison for [[embezzlement]], [[money laundering]], and corruption; liberal and Sandinista parliament members combined to strip the presidential powers of President Bolaños and his ministers, calling for his resignation and threatening [[impeachment]]. The Sandinistas said they no longer supported Bolaños after U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] told Bolaños to distance from the FSLN. This "slow motion ''coup d'état''" was averted partially by pressure from the Central  presidents, who vowed not to recognize any movement that removed Bolaños; the U.S., the OAS, and the [[European Union]] also opposed the action.

 briefly participated in the [[ War]] in 2004 as part of the [[Plus Ultra Brigade]], a military contingent of mixed personnel.

Before [[2006  general election|the general elections on 5 November 2006]], the [[National Assembly of |National Assembly]] passed a bill further restricting [[abortion in ]]. As a result,  is one of five countries in the world where abortion is illegal with no exceptions.

Legislative and presidential elections took place on 5 November 2006. Ortega returned to the presidency with 37.99% of the vote. This percentage was enough to win the presidency outright, because of a change in electoral law which lowered the percentage requiring a runoff election from 45% to 35% (with a 5% margin of victory). [[2011  general election|'s 2011 general election]] resulted in the re-election of Ortega, with a landslide 62.46% of the vote. In 2014 the National Assembly approved changes to the constitution allowing Ortega to run for a third successive term.

In November 2016, [[2016  general election|Ortega was elected for his third consecutive term]] (his fourth overall). International monitoring of the elections was initially prohibited, and as a result the validity of the [[Elections in |elections]] has been disputed, but observation by the [[Organization of  States|OAS]] was announced in October. Ortega was reported by  election officials as having received 72% of the vote. However, the [[Broad Front for Democracy]] (FAD), having promoted boycotts of the elections, claimed that 70% of voters had abstained (while election officials claimed 65.8% participation).

In April 2018, [[2018–2020  protests|demonstrations]] were held to oppose a decree increasing taxes and reducing benefits in the country's pension system. Local independent press organizations documented at least 19 dead and over 100 missing in the ensuing conflict. A reporter from NPR spoke to protestors who explained that while the initial issue was the pension reforms, the uprisings that spread across the country reflected many grievances about the government's time in office, and that the fight is for President Ortega and his vice president, his wife, to step down. 

24&nbsp;April 2018 marked the day of the greatest march in opposition of the Sandinista party. On 2&nbsp;May 2018, university student leaders made a public announcement giving the government seven days to set a date and time for a dialogue that was promised to the people due to the recent events of repression. The students also scheduled another peaceful protest march on that same day. As of May 2018, estimates of the death toll were as high as 63, many of them student protesters, and the wounded totalled more than 400. 

Following a working visit from 17 to 21&nbsp;May, the Inter- Commission on Human Rights adopted precautionary measures aimed at protecting members of the student movement and their families after testimonies indicated the majority of them had suffered acts of violence and death threats for their participation. In the last week of May, thousands who accuse Mr. Ortega and his wife of acting like dictators joined in resuming anti-government rallies after attempted peace talks have remained unresolved. Open suppression of political dissent and more militarized policing began in April 2018, but the onset of repression was gradual. On 12 October 2024,  broke ties with [[]] in response to the ongoing [[Gaza war]], condemning 's leaders as "fascist" and "[[Gaza genocide|genocidal]]".

===Early history===
[[File:Rock Art .jpg|thumb|left|Rock art in the [[Sahara Desert]]]]
The ancient tribes of  were [[Berbers|Berber]], [[– languages|-]], and [[Bafour]] peoples. The Bafour were among the first Saharan peoples to abandon their previously nomadic lifestyle and adopt a primarily agricultural one. In response to the gradual desiccation of the [[Sahara]], they eventually migrated southward. Many of the Berber tribes have claimed to have [[]]i (and sometimes other [[Arabs|Arab]]) origins. Little evidence supports those claims; however, a 2000 [[DNA]] study of the  people suggested some ancient connection might exist between the peoples.

The [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyads]] were the first [[Arab Muslims]] to enter . During the [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic conquests]], they made incursions into  and were present in the region by the end of the seventh century. Many [[Berbers|Berber]] tribes in  fled the arrival of the Arabs to the [[Gao]] region in [[]].

Other peoples also migrated south past the Sahara and into [[West Africa]]. In the 11th century, several nomadic Berber confederations in the desert regions overlapping present-day  joined to form the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] movement. They expanded north and south, spawning an important empire that stretched from the Sahara to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in [[Europe]]. According to a disputed Arab tradition, the Almoravids traveled south and conquered the ancient and extensive [[ Empire]] around 1076.

From 1644 to 1674, the indigenous peoples of the area that is modern  made what became their final effort to repel the  [[Maqil]] Arabs who were invading their territory. This effort, which was unsuccessful, is known as the [[Char Bouba war|Char Bouba War]]. The invaders were led by the [[Beni Ḥassān|Beni Hassan]] tribe. The descendants of the Beni Hassan warriors became the [[hassane|upper stratum]] of [[Moors|Moorish]] society. [[Hassaniya Arabic|Hassaniya]], a bedouin [[Varieties of Arabic|Arabic dialect]] named for the Beni Hassan, became the dominant language among the largely [[nomad]]ic population.

Starting in the late 19th century,  [[Franco-Trarzan War of 1825|laid claim to the territories]] of present-day , from the [[ River]] area northwards. In 1901, [[Xavier Coppolani]] took charge of the imperial mission. Through a combination of strategic alliances with [[Zawaya]] tribes and military pressure on the [[Hassane]] warrior nomads, he managed to extend  rule over the  [[emirate]]s. Beginning in 1903 and 1904, the  armies succeeded in occupying [[Emirate of Trarza|Trarza]], [[Brakna Region|Brakna]], and [[Tagant Region|Tagant]]. However the northern emirate of [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar]] held out longer; the emirate was aided by the anticolonial rebellion (or ''[[jihad]]'') of ''shaykh'' [[Ma al-'Aynayn|Maa al-Aynayn]] and by insurgents from Tagant and the other occupied regions. In 1904,  organized the territory of , and it became part of [[ West Africa]], first as a [[protectorate]] and later as a colony. In 1912, the  armies defeated Adrar, and incorporated it into the territory of .

 rule brought legal prohibitions against slavery and an end to interclan warfare. During the colonial period 90% of the population remained nomadic. Gradually many individuals belonging to sedentary peoples, whose ancestors had been expelled centuries earlier, began to migrate into . Until 1902, the capital of  West Africa was in modern-day . It was first established at [[-Louis, |-Louis]] and later, from 1902 to 1960, in Dakar. When  gained its independence that year,  chose Nouakchott as the site of the new capital of . At the time, Nouakchott was little more than a fortified village (or ''ksar'').

After  independence, larger numbers of indigenous [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n peoples ([[Fula people|Haalpulaar]], [[Soninke people|Soninke]], and [[Wolof people|Wolof]]) migrated into it, most of them settling in the area north of the [[ River]]. Many of these new arrivals had been educated in the  language and customs, and became clerks, soldiers, and administrators in the new state. At the same time, the  were militarily suppressing the most intransigent Hassane tribes in the north.  pressure on those tribes altered the existing balance of power, and new conflicts arose between the southern populations and the Moors.{{Clarify |date=April 2019|reason=Unsure what this sentence is trying to convey, but it doesn't discernibly reflect anything in the cited source.}}{{Incomprehensible inline|date=April 2019|reason=}}

The great [[Droughts in the Sahel|Sahel droughts]] of the early 1970s caused massive devastation in , exacerbating problems of poverty and conflict. The arabized dominant elites reacted to changing circumstances, and to [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] calls from abroad, by increasing pressure to [[Arabization|arabize]] many aspects of  life, such as law and the education system. This was also a reaction to the consequences of the  domination under the colonial rule. Various models for maintaining the country's cultural diversity have been suggested, but none have been successfully implemented.{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}}

This ethnic discord was evident during intercommunal violence that broke out in April 1989 (the "[[– Border War]]"); the conflict has since subsided.  expelled some 70,000 sub-Saharan African  in the late 1980s. Ethnic tensions and the sensitive issue of slavery –&nbsp;past and, in some areas, present&nbsp;– are still powerful themes in the country's political debate.

In 1960,  became an independent nation. In 1964, President [[Moktar Ould Daddah]], originally installed by the , formalized  as a [[one-party state]] with a new [[Constitution of |constitution]], setting up an authoritarian presidential regime. Daddah's own [[ People's Party|Parti du Peuple Mauritanien]] <!-- (PPM) --> became the ruling organization in a [[One-party state|one-party system]]. The President justified this on the grounds that  was not ready for western style [[multi-party system|multiparty democracy]]. Under this one-party constitution, Daddah was re-elected in uncontested elections in 1976 and 1978.

Daddah was ousted in a [[1978  coup d'état|bloodless coup]] on 10 July 1978. He had brought the country to near-collapse through the disastrous [[Western Sahara War|war]] to [[annexation|annex]] the [[Tiris al-Gharbiyya|southern part]] of [[Western Sahara]]; this potential annexation was framed as an attempt to create a "[[Greater ]]".

[[Mustafa Ould Salek]]'s [[Military Committee for National Recovery]] proved incapable of either establishing a strong base of power or extracting the country from its destabilizing conflict with the [[Sahrawis|Sahrawi]] resistance movement, the [[Polisario Front]]. It quickly fell, to be replaced by another military government, the [[Military Committee for National Salvation]].

Colonel [[Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla]]h soon emerged as its strongman. By giving up all claims to [[Western Sahara]], he found peace with the Polisario and improved relations with its main backer, [[]], but relations with [[]], the other party to the conflict, and its [[Europe]]an ally [[]], deteriorated. Instability continued, and Haidallah's ambitious reform attempts foundered. His regime was plagued by attempted coups and intrigue within the military establishment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2025}} It became increasingly contested due to his harsh and uncompromising measures against opponents; many dissidents were jailed, and some executed.

He deepened these ties during the late 1990s and early 2000s, as part of 's drive to attract support from Western states and Western-aligned Arab states. Its position on the [[Western Sahara conflict]] has been, since the 1980s, one of strict neutrality.

The [[– Border War]] started as a result of a conflict in [[Diawara, |Diawara]] between Moorish  herders and [[Demographics of |]] farmers over grazing rights. On 9 April 1989,  guards killed two .

Following the incident, several [[riot]]s erupted in [[Bakel, |Bakel]], [[Dakar]] and other towns in [[]], directed against the mainly Arabized  who dominated the local retail business. The rioting, adding to the already existing tensions, led to a campaign of terror against black [[Demographics of |]]; black  are often seen as "" by the Bidān (White Moors), regardless of their nationality. As low scale conflict with  continued into 1990–91, the  government engaged in and encouraged acts of violence and seizures of property directed against the Halpularen ethnic group. The tension culminated in an international airlift agreed to by  and  under international pressure to prevent further violence. The  Government expelled thousands of black . Most of these so-called "" had few or no ties with , and many have been repatriated from  and [[]] after 2007. The exact number of expulsions is not known; however, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that, as of June 1991, 52,995  refugees were living in  and at least 13,000 in .{{rp|27}}

Opposition parties were legalized, and a new Constitution approved in 1991 which put an end to formal military rule. But President [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya|Ould Taya]]'s election wins were dismissed as fraudulent by some opposition groups.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

In the late 1980s, Ould Taya had established close co-operation with [[Ba'athist |]], and pursued a strongly [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] line.  grew increasingly isolated internationally, and tensions with Western countries grew dramatically after it took a pro- position during the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2025}}

===August 2005 military coup===
{{Main|2005  coup d'état}}
On 3 August 2005, a military coup led by Colonel [[Ely Ould Mohamed Vall]] ended President [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya]]'s 21 years of rule. Taking advantage of Ould Taya's attendance at the funeral of  [[Fahd of |King Fahd]], the military, including members of the presidential guard (BASEP), seized control of key points in the capital [[Nouakchott]]. The coup proceeded without loss of life. Calling themselves the [[Military Council for Justice and Democracy]], the officers released the following statement:

<blockquote>The national armed forces and security forces have unanimously decided to put a definitive end to the oppressive activities of the defunct authority, which our people have suffered from during the past years.</blockquote>

The Military Council later issued another statement naming Colonel Ould Mohamed Vall as president and director of the national police force, the ''Sûreté Nationale''. Vall, once regarded as a firm ally of the now-ousted president, had aided Ould Taya in the coup that had originally brought him to power, and had later served as his Security Chief. Sixteen other officers were listed as members of the council.

Though cautiously watched by the international community, the coup came to be generally accepted, with the military ''junta'' organizing elections within a promised two-year timeline. In a referendum on 26 June 2006, 97% of  approved a new constitution that limited the duration of a president's stay in office. The leader of the ''junta'', Col. Vall, promised to abide by the referendum and relinquish power peacefully. 's establishment of relations with {{spaced ndash}}it was one of only three Arab states to recognize {{spaced ndash}}was maintained by the new regime, despite widespread criticism from the opposition.

===2007 presidential elections===
[[File:Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi]]]]
's first fully democratic presidential elections took place on 11 March 2007. The elections effected the final transfer from military to civilian rule following the military coup in 2005. This was the first time since  gained independence in 1960 that it elected a president in a multi-candidate election.

The elections were won in a second round of voting by [[Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi]].

===2008 military coup===
{{Main|2008  coup d'état}}
On 6 August 2008, the head of the presidential guards took over the president's palace in Nouakchott, a day after 48 lawmakers from the ruling party resigned in protest of President Abdallahi's policies. The Army surrounded key government facilities, including the state television building, after the president fired senior officers, one of them the head of the presidential guards. The President, Prime Minister [[Yahya Ould Ahmed El Waghef|Yahya Ould Ahmed Waghef]], and Mohamed Ould R'zeizim, Minister of Internal Affairs, were arrested.

The coup was coordinated by General [[Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz]], former chief of staff of the  Army and head of the presidential guard, who had recently been fired. 's presidential spokesman, Abdoulaye Mamadouba, said the President, Prime Minister, and Interior Minister had been arrested by renegade senior  army officers and were being held under house arrest at the presidential palace in the capital.

In the apparently successful and bloodless coup, Abdallahi's daughter, Amal Mint Cheikh Abdallahi, said: "The security agents of the BASEP (Presidential Security Battalion) came to our home and took away my father." The coup plotters, all dismissed in a presidential decree shortly beforehand, included Ould Abdel Aziz, General [[Mohamed Ould Ghazouani|Muhammad Ould Al-Ghazwani]], General Philippe Swikri, and Brigadier General (Aqid) Ahmed Ould Bakri.

A  lawmaker, Mohammed Al Mukhtar, claimed that many of the country's people supported the takeover of a government that had become "an authoritarian regime" under a president who had "marginalized the majority in parliament". However, Abdel Aziz's regime was isolated internationally, and became subject to diplomatic sanctions and the cancellation of some aid projects. Domestically, a group of parties coalesced around Abdallahi to continue protesting the coup, which caused the junta to ban demonstrations and crack down on opposition activists. International and internal pressure eventually forced the release of Abdallahi, who was instead placed under house arrest in his home village. The new government broke off relations with .

After the coup, Abdel Aziz insisted on holding new presidential elections to replace Abdallahi; however, Aziz was forced to reschedule them due to internal and international opposition. During the spring of 2009, the [[Military junta|junta]] negotiated an understanding with some opposition figures and international parties. As a result, Abdallahi formally resigned under protest, as it became clear that some opposition forces had defected from him and most international players, notably including  and , now aligned with Abdel Aziz. The  continued to criticize the coup, but did not actively oppose the elections.

Abdallahi's resignation allowed the [[2009  presidential election|election]] of Abdel Aziz as civilian president, on 18 July, by a 52% majority.

Many of Abdallahi's former supporters criticized this as a political ploy and refused to recognize the results. Despite complaints, the elections were almost unanimously accepted by Western, Arab and African countries, which lifted sanctions and resumed relations with . By late summer, Abdel Aziz appeared to have secured his position and to have gained widespread international and internal support. Some figures, such as Senate chairman [[Messaoud Ould Boulkheir]], continued to refuse the new order and call for Abdel Aziz's resignation.

In February 2011, the waves of the [[Arab Spring]] spread to , where thousands of people took to the streets of the capital.

In November 2014,  was invited as a non-member guest nation to the G20 summit in [[Brisbane]].

In August 2019, [[Mohamed Ould Ghazouani]] was sworn in as president after the [[2019  presidential election|2019 elections]], which were considered 's first [[peaceful transition of power]] since independence.

In June 2021, former president Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz was arrested amidst a corruption probe into allegations of embezzlement. In December 2023, Aziz was sentenced to 5 years in prison for corruption.

In early 2024, a sudden increase of the number of refugees arriving on the [[Canary Islands]] by boat prompted a visit from [[European Commission]] president [[Ursula von der Leyen]] and  prime minister [[Pedro Sánchez]]. The EU subsequently signed a €210M deal with  to reduce passage of African migrants through its territory towards the Canary Islands. The UN estimates that 150,000 people from  have fled to .

=== Pre-colonial ===
Indigenous settlement of  dates back to 3,000 BC. The largest tribes were the [[Arawak]], a nomadic coastal tribe that lived from hunting and fishing. They were the first inhabitants in the area. The [[Kalina people|Carib]] also settled in the area and conquered the Arawak by using their superior sailing ships. They settled in Galibi (''Kupali Yumï'', meaning "tree of the forefathers") at the mouth of the [[Marowijne River]]. While the larger Arawak and Carib tribes lived along the coast and savanna, smaller groups of indigenous people lived in the inland rainforest, such as the [[Akurio people|Akurio]], [[Tiriyó people|Trió]], [[Warao people|Warao]], and [[Wayana]].

===Colonial period===
{{main|Surinam ( colony)|Surinam ( colony)}}

Beginning in the 16th century, [[Kingdom of |]], [[Habsburg |]] and [[Kingdom of England|]] explorers visited the area. A century later, [[ Republic|]] and [[Kingdom of England|]] settlers established [[plantation]] colonies along the many rivers in the fertile Guiana plains. The earliest documented colony in [[The Guianas|Guiana]] was an  settlement named Marshall's Creek along the  River. After that, there was another short-lived  colony called [[Surinam ( colony)|Surinam]] that lasted from 1650 to 1667.

From the early 17th century, Jews began to settle there after the expulsion from  and . They were granted freedom of religion in 1665 and the right to have their own courts and civil guard. They continued to enjoy autonomy after the colony was handed over to the . Over half the sugarcane plantations in  were owned by Jews. In 1825, these special rights were rescinded.

Disputes arose between the  and the  for control of this territory. In 1667, during negotiations leading to the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] after the [[Second Anglo- War]], the  decided to keep the nascent plantation colony of Surinam they had gained from the . In return the  kept [[New Amsterdam]], the main city of the former colony of [[New Netherland]] in North America on the mid-Atlantic coast. The  renamed it [[New York City|New York]], after the [[Duke of York]] who would later become King [[James&nbsp;II of England]].

In 1683, the [[Society of ]] was founded by the city of [[Amsterdam]], the [[Cornelis van Aerssen van Sommelsdijck|Van Aerssen van Sommelsdijck]] family, and the [[ West  Company]]. The society was chartered to manage and defend the colony. The planters of the colony relied heavily on [[Slavery in Africa|African slaves]] to cultivate, harvest and process the commodity crops of coffee, cocoa, sugar cane and cotton plantations along the rivers. Approximately 300,000 enslaved Africans were taken to  during the transatlantic slave trade, from the mid-1600s to the early 1800s. The treatment of slaves was notoriously brutal even by the standards of the time—historian [[C. R. Boxer]] wrote that "man's inhumanity to man just about reached its limits in Surinam"—and many slaves escaped plantations. In November 1795, the Society was nationalized by the [[Batavian Republic]] and from then on the Batavian Republic and its legal successors (the Kingdom of Holland and the Kingdom of the ) governed the territory as a national colony – barring two periods of  occupation, between 1799 and 1802, and between 1804 and 1816.



[[File:Vente d'esclaves au  en 1831.jpg|thumb|left|[[Slavery in |Slave]] auction in Paramaribo, in 1831]]

With the help of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native South ]] living in the adjoining rain forests, runaway African slaves established a new and unique culture in the interior that was highly successful in its own right. They were known collectively in  as [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]], in  as ''Nèg'Marrons'' (literally meaning "brown negroes", that is "pale-skinned negroes"), and in  as ''Marrons''. The Maroons gradually developed several independent tribes through a process of [[ethnogenesis]], as they were from different African ethnicities. These tribes include the [[Saramaka]], [[Paramaccan people|Paramaka]], [[Ndyuka people|Ndyuka]] or Aukan, [[Kwinti]], [[Aluku]] or Boni, and [[Matawai people|Matawai]].

The Maroons often raided plantations to recruit new members from the enslaved and capture women, as well as to acquire weapons, food, and supplies. They sometimes killed the  planters and their families in the raids. European colonists built defences, which were significant enough that they were shown on 18th-century maps.

The  colonists also mounted armed campaigns against the Maroons, who generally escaped through the rainforest, which they knew much better than the colonists did. To end hostilities, in the 18th century, the European colonial authorities signed several peace treaties with different tribes. They granted the Maroons sovereign status and trade rights in their inland territories.

===Abolition of slavery===
{{further|Human rights in }}
From 1861 to 1863, with the [[ Civil War]] underway, and enslaved people escaping to Northern territory controlled by the [[Union ( Civil War)|Union]],  President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Presidency of Abraham Lincoln|his administration]] looked abroad for places to relocate people who were freed from [[enslavement]] and who wanted to leave the . It opened negotiations with the  government regarding African  emigration to and colonization of the [[Surinam ( colony)| colony of ]]. Nothing came of the idea, which was dropped after 1864.

The  abolished slavery in  in 1863, under a gradual process that required slaves to work on plantations for 10 transition years for minimal pay, which was considered as partial compensation for their masters. After that transition period expired in 1873, most [[freedmen]] largely abandoned the plantations where they had worked for several generations in favour of the capital city, [[Paramaribo]]. Some of them were able to purchase the plantations they worked on, especially in the district of Para and Coronie. Their descendants still live on those grounds today. Several plantation owners did not pay their former enslaved workers the pay they owed them for the ten years following 1863. They paid the workers with the property rights of the ground of the plantation in order to escape their debt to the workers. 1 July 1863 is called [[Ketikoti]].

As a plantation colony,  had an economy dependent on labour-intensive commodity crops. To make up for a shortage of labour, the  recruited and transported contract or [[indentured labourer]]s from the [[ East Indies]] (modern ) and  (the latter through an arrangement with the , who then ruled the area). In addition, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, small numbers of labourers, mostly men, were recruited from  and the Middle East.

Although 's population remains relatively small, because of this complex colonisation and exploitation, it is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse countries in the world.

In 1942, the  government-in-exile began to review the relations between the  and its colonies in terms of the post-war period.[[File:Maroon village,  River, 1955.jpg|thumb|left|Maroon village, along [[ River]], 1955]][[File:Water-front houses in Paramaribo, 1955.jpg|thumb|Waterfront houses in [[Paramaribo]], 1955]]

In 1954,  became one of the constituent countries of the [[Kingdom of the ]], along with the [[ Antilles]] and the . In this construction, the  retained control of its defense and foreign affairs. In 1974, the local government, led by the [[National Party of ]] (NPS) (whose membership was largely [[Creole peoples|Creole]], meaning ethnically African or mixed African-European), started negotiations with the  government leading towards full independence; in contrast to [[]]'s earlier [[ National Revolution|war for independence]] from the , the path toward 's independence had been an initiative of the [[Den Uyl cabinet|then left-wing  government]]. Independence was granted on 25 November 1975. A large part of 's economy for the first decade following independence was fueled by foreign aid provided by the  government.

===Independence===

The first president of the country was [[Johan Ferrier]], the former governor, with [[Henck Arron]] (the then leader of the NPS) as prime minister. In the years leading up to independence, nearly one-third of the population of  emigrated to the , amidst concern that the new country would fare worse under independence than it had as a constituent country of the Kingdom of the .  politics did degenerate into ethnic polarisation and corruption soon after independence, with the NPS using  aid money for partisan purposes. Its leaders were accused of fraud in the [[1977  general election|1977 elections]], in which Arron won a further term, and the discontent was such that a large portion of the population fled to the , joining the already significant  community there.

===1980 military coup===
{{main|1980  coup d'état}}
On 25 February 1980, a [[1980  coup d'état|military coup]] overthrew Arron's government. It was initiated by a group of 16 sergeants, led by [[Dési Bouterse]]. Opponents of the military regime attempted counter-coups in April 1980, August 1980, 15 March 1981, and again on 12 March 1982. The first counter attempt was led by [[Fred Ormskerk]], the second by [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist-Leninists]], the third by [[Wilfred Hawker]], and the fourth by [[Surendre Rambocus]].

Hawker escaped from prison during the fourth counter-coup attempt, but he was captured and summarily executed. Between 2&nbsp;am and 5&nbsp;am on 7 December 1982, the military, under Bouterse's leadership, rounded up 13 prominent citizens who had criticized the military dictatorship and held them at [[Fort Zeelandia (Paramaribo)|Fort Zeelandia]] in Paramaribo. The dictatorship had all these men [[December murders|executed over the next three days]], along with Rambocus and [[Jiwansingh Sheombar]] (who was also involved in the fourth counter-coup attempt).

===Civil war, elections, and constitution===
The brutal [[ Guerrilla War|civil war between the  army and Maroons]] loyal to rebel leader [[Ronnie Brunswijk]], begun in 1986, continued and its effects further weakened Bouterse's position during the 1990s. Due to the civil war, more than 10,000 , mostly Maroons, fled to [[ Guiana]] in the late 1980s.

National elections were held in 1987. The National Assembly adopted a new constitution that allowed Bouterse to remain in charge of the army. Dissatisfied with the government, Bouterse summarily dismissed the ministers in 1990, by telephone.{{citation needed|date=September 2024}} This event became popularly known as the "Telephone Coup".

Before his election in 2010, he, along with 24 others, had been charged with the murders of 15 prominent dissidents in the [[December murders]]. However, in 2012, two months before the verdict in the trial, the National Assembly extended its [[amnesty]] law and provided Bouterse and the others with amnesty of these charges. He was reelected on 14 July 2015. However, Bouterse was convicted by a  court on 29 November 2019 and given a 20-year sentence for his role in the 1982 killings.

According to [[mythology]], a [[jinn]]i dropped a [[Gemstone|jewel]], which formed a great circular inferno. This became the [[Mount Karthala|Karthala volcano]], which created the island of Ngazidja (Grande Comore). [[King Solomon]] is also said to have visited the island accompanied by his queen [[Queen of Sheba|Bilqis]].

The first attested human inhabitants of the Comoro Islands are now thought to have been [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] settlers travelling by boat from [[Island Southeast Asia|islands in Southeast Asia]]. These people arrived in the area no later than the eighth century AD, the date of the earliest known archaeological site, found on [[Mayotte]], although settlement beginning in the first century has been postulated.

Subsequent settlers came from the east coast of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Malay Archipelago]], and [[]]. [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking settlers were present on the islands from the beginnings of settlement. {{Chronology citation needed|date=October 2024}} 

Development of the  is divided into phases. The earliest reliably recorded phase is the Dembeni phase (eighth to tenth centuries), during which there were several small settlements on each island. From the eleventh to the fifteenth centuries, trade with the island of  and merchants from the [[Swahili coast]] and the [[Middle East]] flourished, more villages were founded and existing villages grew. Settlers from the Arabian peninsula, particularly [[Hadhramaut]], arrived during this period.

=== Medieval  ===
According to legend, in 632, upon hearing of [[Islam]], islanders are said to have dispatched an emissary, Mtswa-Mwindza, to [[Mecca]]—but by the time he arrived there, the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] had died. Nonetheless, after a stay in Mecca, he returned to Ngazidja, where he built a mosque in his home town of Ntsaweni, and led the gradual conversion of the islanders to Islam.

In 933, the  was referred to by [[]]i sailors as the Perfume Islands.

Among the earliest accounts of East Africa, the works of [[Al-Masudi]] describe early Islamic trade routes, and how the coast and islands were frequently visited by [[Muslim]]s including [[Persia]]n and [[Arab]] merchants and sailors in search of [[coral]], [[ambergris]], [[ivory]], [[tortoiseshell]], [[gold]] and slaves for the [[Arabic slave trade]]. They also brought Islam to the people of the [[Zanj]] including the . As the importance of the  grew along the East African coast, both small and large [[mosque]]s were constructed. The  are part of the [[Swahili Coast|Swahili]] cultural and economic complex and the islands became a major hub of trade and an important location in a network of trading towns that included [[Kilwa]], in present-day , Sofala (an outlet for [[]]an gold), in [[]], and [[Mombasa]] in [[]].

The  arrived in the  Ocean at the end of the 15th century and the first  visit to the islands seems to have been that of [[Vasco da Gama]]'s second fleet in 1503. For much of the 16th century the islands provided provisions to the  fort at  and although there was no formal attempt by the  crown to take possession, a number of  traders settled and married local women.

By the end of the 16th century local rulers on the African mainland were beginning to push back and, with the support of the  Sultan [[Saif bin Sultan]] they began to defeat the  and the . One of his successors, [[Said bin Sultan]], increased  Arab influence in the region, moving his administration to nearby [[Zanzibar]], which came under [[]]i rule. Nevertheless, the  remained independent, and although the three smaller islands were usually [[List of sultans on the |politically unified]], the largest island, Ngazidja, was divided into a number of [[List of sultans on the |autonomous kingdoms]] (''ntsi'').

The islands were well placed to meet the needs of Europeans, initially supplying the  in , then ships, particularly the , on the route to , and, later, slaves to the plantation islands in the [[Mascarenes]].

In the last decade of the 18th century,  warriors, mostly [[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]] and [[Sakalava]], started raiding the  for [[slave]]s and the islands were devastated as crops were destroyed and the people were slaughtered, taken into captivity or fled to the African mainland: it is said that by the time the raids finally ended in the second decade of the 19th century only one man remained on Mwali. The islands were [[Slavery in the |repopulated by slaves]] from the mainland, who were [[ slave trade|traded to the ]] in Mayotte and the Mascarenes.

After its annexation,  attempted to convert Mayotte into a sugar plantation colony.

Meanwhile, Ndzwani (or Johanna as it was known to the ) continued to serve as a way station for  merchants sailing to  and the Far East, as well as  whalers, although the  gradually abandoned it following their possession of [[ |]] in 1814, and by the time the [[Suez Canal]] opened in 1869 there was no longer any significant supply trade at Ndzwani. Local commodities exported by the  were, in addition to slaves, coconuts, timber, cattle and tortoiseshell.  and  settlers, as well as the island's sultan, established a plantation-based economy that used about one-third of the land for export crops. In addition to sugar on Mayotte, ylang-ylang and other perfume plants, vanilla, cloves, coffee, cocoa beans, and sisal were introduced.

In 1886, Mwali was placed under  protection by its Sultan Mardjani Abdou Cheikh. That same year, Sultan Said Ali of [[Sultanate of Bambao|Bambao]], one of the sultanates on Ngazidja, placed the island under  protection in exchange for  support of his claim to the entire island, which he retained until his abdication in 1910. In 1908 the four islands were unified under a single administration (''Colonie de Mayotte et dépendances'') and placed under the authority of the  colonial [[Governor-General of ]]. In 1909, Sultan Said Muhamed of Ndzwani abdicated in favour of  rule and in 1912 the protectorates were abolished and the islands administered as a single colony. Two years later the colony was abolished and the islands became a province of the [[ |colony of ]].

Agreement was reached with  in 1973 for the  to become independent in 1978, despite the deputies of [[Mayotte]] voting for increased integration with . A [[1974  independence referendum|referendum]] was held on all four of the islands. Three voted for independence by large margins, while Mayotte voted against. On 6 July 1975, however, the  parliament passed a unilateral resolution declaring independence. Ahmed Abdallah proclaimed the independence of the  State (''État comorien''; دولة القمر) and became its first president.  did not recognise the new state until 31 December, and retained control of Mayotte.

The next 30 years were a period of political turmoil. On 3 August 1975, less than one month after independence, president [[Ahmed Abdallah]] was removed from office in an armed coup and replaced with United National Front of the  (FNUK) member [[Said Mohamed Jaffar]]. Months later, in January 1976, Jaffar was ousted in favour of his Minister of Defence [[Ali Soilihi]].

The population of [[Mayotte]] voted against independence from  in three referendums during this period. The [[1974  independence referendum|first]], held on all the islands on 22 December 1974, won 63.8% support for maintaining ties with  on Mayotte; the [[1976 Mahoran status referendum|second]], held in February 1976, confirmed that vote with an overwhelming 99.4%, while the third, in April 1976, confirmed that the people of Mayotte wished to remain a  territory. The three remaining islands, ruled by President Soilihi, instituted a number of socialist and isolationist policies that soon strained relations with . On 13 May 1978, [[Bob Denard]], once again commissioned by the  intelligence service ([[SDECE]]), returned to [[1978  coup d'état|overthrow]] President Soilihi and reinstate Abdallah with the support of the , Rhodesian and  governments. Ali Soilihi was captured and executed a few weeks later.

In contrast to Soilihi, Abdallah's presidency was marked by authoritarian rule and increased adherence to traditional Islam and the country was renamed the Federal [[Islamic Republic]] of the  (''République Fédérale Islamique des Comores''; جمهورية القمر الإتحادية الإسلامية). Bob Denard served as Abdallah's first advisor; nicknamed the "Viceroy of the ", he was considered the real strongman of the regime. Very close to , which financed his "presidential guard", he allowed Paris to circumvent the international embargo on the apartheid regime via Moroni. He also set up from the archipelago a permanent mercenary corps, called upon to intervene at the request of Paris or Pretoria in conflicts in Africa. Abdallah continued as president until 1989 when, fearing a probable coup, he signed a decree ordering the Presidential Guard, led by Bob Denard, to disarm the armed forces. Shortly after the signing of the decree, Abdallah was allegedly shot dead in his office by a disgruntled military officer, though later sources claim an antitank missile was launched into his bedroom and killed him. Although Denard was also injured, it is suspected that Abdallah's killer was a soldier under his command.

A few days later, Bob Denard was evacuated to  by  paratroopers. [[Said Mohamed Djohar]], Soilihi's older half-brother, then became president, and served until September 1995, when Bob Denard returned and attempted another coup. This time  intervened with paratroopers and forced Denard to surrender. The  removed Djohar to Reunion, and the Paris-backed [[Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim]] became president by election. He led the country from 1996, during a time of labour crises, government suppression, and secessionist conflicts, until his death in November 1998. He was succeeded by Interim President [[Tadjidine Ben Said Massounde]].

The islands of [[Ndzwani]] and [[Mwali]] declared their independence from the  in 1997, in an attempt to restore  rule. But  rejected their request, leading to bloody confrontations between federal troops and rebels. In April 1999, Colonel [[Azali Assoumani]], Army Chief of Staff, seized power in a [[1999  coup d'état|bloodless coup]], overthrowing the Interim President Massounde, citing weak leadership in the face of the crisis. This was the ' 18th coup, or attempted coup d'état since independence in 1975.

Assoumani failed to consolidate power and reestablish control over the islands, which was the subject of international criticism. The [[African Union]], under the auspices of President [[Thabo Mbeki]] of , imposed sanctions on Ndzwani to help broker negotiations and effect reconciliation. Under the terms of the Fomboni Accords, signed in December 2001 by the leaders of all three islands, the official name of the country was changed to the Union of the ; the new state was to be highly decentralised and the central union government would devolve most powers to the new island governments, each led by a president. The Union president, although elected by national elections, would be chosen in rotation from each of the islands every five years.

Assoumani stepped down in 2002 to run in the democratic election of the President of the , which he won. Under ongoing international pressure, as a military ruler who had originally come to power by force, and was not always democratic while in office, Assoumani led the  through constitutional changes that enabled new elections. A ''Loi des compétences'' law was passed in early 2005 that defines the responsibilities of each governmental body, and is in the process of implementation. The elections in 2006 were won by [[Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi]], a Sunni Muslim cleric nicknamed the "Ayatollah" for his time spent studying Islam in . Assoumani honoured the election results, thus allowing the first peaceful and democratic exchange of power for the archipelago.

Colonel [[Mohammed Bacar]], a -trained former gendarme elected President of Ndzwani in 2001, refused to step down at the end of his five-year mandate. He staged a vote in June 2007 to confirm his leadership that was rejected as illegal by the  federal government and the African Union. On 25 March 2008 hundreds of soldiers from the African Union and the  seized rebel-held Ndzwani, generally welcomed by the population: there have been reports of hundreds, if not thousands, of people tortured during Bacar's tenure.
Some rebels were killed and injured, but there are no official figures. At least 11 civilians were wounded. Some officials were imprisoned. Bacar fled in a speedboat to Mayotte to seek asylum. Anti- protests followed in the  (see [[2008 invasion of Anjouan]]). Bacar was eventually granted asylum in .

Since independence from , the  experienced more than 20 coups or attempted coups.

Following elections in late 2010, former Vice-president [[Ikililou Dhoinine]] was inaugurated as president on 26 May 2011. Dhoinine is the first President of the  from the island of Mwali. Following the 2016 elections, [[Azali Assoumani]], from Ngazidja, became president for a third term. In 2018 Assoumani held a [[2018  constitutional referendum|referendum]] on constitutional reform that would permit a president to serve two terms. The amendments passed, although the vote was widely contested and boycotted by the opposition, and in April 2019, and to widespread opposition, Assoumani was [[2019  presidential election|re-elected]] president to serve the first of potentially two five-year terms. In January 2020, the legislative [[2020  legislative election|elections]] in  were dominated by President Azali Assoumani's party, the [[Convention for the Renewal of the ]], CRC. It took an overwhelming majority in the parliament.

In 2021,  signed and ratified the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]], making it a nuclear-weapon-free state. and in 2023,  was invited as a non-member guest to the G7 summit in [[Hiroshima]]. On 18 February 2023 the  assumed the presidency of the [[African Union]].

In January 2024, President Azali Assoumani was re-elected with 63% of the vote in the disputed presidential [[2024  presidential election|election]]. In January 2025, the ruling party of president Azali Assoumani won parliamentary [[2025  parliamentary election|election]], taking 28 out of 33 parliamentary seats. The opposition parties rejected the results.

[[File:Homo Sapiens Idaltu.JPG|thumb|A ''[[Herto Man|Homo sapiens idaltu]]'' hominid skull]]

Several important finds have propelled  and the surrounding region to the forefront of&nbsp;[[Paleontology|palaeontology]]. The oldest [[Hominidae|hominid]] discovered to date in  is the 4.2&nbsp;million-year-old ''[[Ardipithecus|Ardipithecus ramidus]]'' ([[Ardi]]) found by [[Tim D. White]] in 1994. The most well-known hominid discovery is ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' ([[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]]). Known locally as ''Dinkinesh'', the specimen was found in the [[Awash Valley]] of [[Afar Region]] in 1974 by [[Donald Johanson]], and is one of the most complete and best-preserved adult [[Australopithecus|Australopithecine]] fossils ever uncovered. Lucy's taxonomic name refers to the region where the discovery was made. This hominid is estimated to have lived 3.2&nbsp;million years ago.

 is also considered one of the earliest sites of the emergence of [[Early modern human|anatomically modern humans]], ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]''. The oldest of these local fossil finds, the [[Omo remains]], were excavated in the southwestern [[Omo Kibish Formation|Omo Kibish]] area and have been dated to the [[Middle Paleolithic]], around 200,000 years ago. Additionally, skeletons of ''[[Herto Man|Homo sapiens idaltu]]'' were found at a site in the [[Middle Awash]] valley. Dated to approximately 160,000 years ago, they may represent an extinct subspecies of ''Homo sapiens'', or the immediate ancestors of anatomically modern humans. Archaic ''Homo sapiens'' fossils excavated at the [[Jebel Irhoud]] site in  have since been dated to an earlier period, about 300,000 years ago, while Omo-Kibish I (Omo I) from southern  is the oldest anatomically modern ''Homo sapiens'' skeleton currently known (196 ± 5 kya).

According to some anthropologists, the first [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations arrived in the region during the ensuing [[Neolithic]] era from the family's proposed [[Afroasiatic homeland|urheimat]] ("original homeland") in the [[Nile|Nile Valley]], or the [[Near East]]. The majority of scholars today propose that the Afroasiatic family developed in northeast Africa because of the higher diversity of lineages in that region, a telltale sign of linguistic origin.

In 2019, archaeologists discovered a 30,000-year-old [[Middle Stone Age]] rock shelter at the [[Fincha Habera, |Fincha Habera]] site in [[Bale Mountains]] at an elevation of {{convert|3469|m|abbr=off}} above sea level. At this high altitude, humans are susceptible both to [[Hypoxemia#Environmental oxygen|hypoxia]] and to extreme weather. According to a study published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', this dwelling is proof of the earliest permanent human occupation at high altitude yet discovered. Thousands of animal bones, hundreds of stone tools, and ancient fireplaces were discovered, revealing a diet that featured giant [[Spalacidae|mole rat]]s.

Evidence of some of the earliest known stone-tipped projectile weapons (a characteristic tool of ''Homo sapiens''), the stone tips of javelins or throwing spears, were discovered in 2013 at the  site of [[Gademotta]], which date to around 279,000 years ago. In 2019, additional Middle Stone Age projectile weapons were found at Aduma, dated 100,000–80,000 years ago, in the form of points considered likely to belong to darts delivered by spear throwers.

In 980 BC, [[Dʿmt]] was established in present-day [[]] and the northern part of  in the Tigray region, and is widely believed to be the successor state to [[Land of Punt|Punt]]. This polity's capital was located at [[Yeha]] in what is now northern . Most modern historians consider this civilization to be a native  one, although in earlier times many suggested it was [[Sabaeans|Sabaean]]-influenced because of the latter's hegemony of the [[Red Sea]].

Other scholars regard Dʿmt as the result of a union of Afroasiatic-speaking cultures of the Cushitic and Semitic branches; namely, local [[Agaw people]]s and Sabaeans from Southern Arabia. However, [[Geʽez|Ge'ez]], the ancient Semitic language of , is thought to have developed independently from the [[Sabaean language]]. As early as 2000 BC, other Semitic speakers were living in  and  where Ge'ez developed. Sabaean influence is now thought to have been minor, limited to a few localities, and disappearing after a few decades or a century. It may have been a trading or military colony in alliance with the  civilization of Dʿmt or some other proto-Axumite state.
[[File:The Kingdom of Aksum.png|thumb|The [[Kingdom of Aksum|Empire of Axum]] at its peak in the 6th century]]
After the fall of Dʿmt during the 4th century BC, the  plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms. In the 1st century AD, the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] emerged in what is now Tigray Region and . According to the medieval ''[[Book of Axum]]'', the kingdom's first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush. Aksum would later at times extend its rule into  on the other side of the Red Sea. The Persian prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] listed Axum with Rome, Persia, and  as one of the four great powers of his era, during the 3rd century. It is also believed that there was a connection between  and  churches. There is faint evidence that the Aksumites were associated with the [[Queen of Sheba]], via their royal inscription.

Around 316 AD, [[Frumentius]] and his brother Edesius from [[Tyre, |Tyre]] accompanied their uncle on a voyage to . When the vessel stopped at a Red Sea port, the natives killed all the travellers except the two brothers, who were taken to the court as [[Slavery in |slaves]]. They were given positions of trust by the monarch, and they converted members of the royal court to Christianity. Frumentius became the first bishop of Aksum. A coin dated to 324 shows that  was the second country to officially adopt Christianity (after  did so in 301), although the religion may have been at first confined to court circles; it was the first major power to do so. The Aksumites were accustomed to the Greco-Roman sphere of influence, but they embarked on significant cultural ties and trade connections between the [[ subcontinent]] and the Roman Empire via the [[Silk Road]], primarily exporting [[Ivory trade|ivory]], tortoise shell, gold and emeralds, and importing silk and spices. The country's gold production in 2015 is 9 metric tons.

The kingdom adopted the name "" during the reign of [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] in the 4th century. After the conquest of [[Kingdom of Kush]] in 330, the Aksumite territory reached its peak between the 5th and 6th centuries. This period was interrupted by several incursions into the South Arabian protectorate, including [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Dhu Nuwas]] of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] and the [[Aksumite–Persian wars]]. In 575, the Aksumites [[Sasanian reconquest of |besieged and retook Sana'a]] following the assassination of its governor [[Sayf ibn Dhi Yazan|Sayf ibn Dhī Yazan]]. The Red Sea was left to the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in 646, and the port city of [[Adulis]] was plundered by Arab Muslims in the 8th century; along with irrevocable [[land degradation]], claimed [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]] and sporadic rainfall precipitation from 730 to 760, these factors likely caused the kingdom to decline in power as part of an important trade route. Aksum came to an end in 960 when [[Gudit|Queen Gudit]] defeated the last king of Aksum. In response, the remnant of the Aksumite population to shift into the southern region and establish the [[Zagwe dynasty]], changing its capital to [[Lalibela]]. Zagwe's rule ended when an [[Amhara people|Amhara]] noble man [[Yekuno Amlak]] revolted against King [[Yetbarak]] and established the [[ Empire]] (known by exonym "Abyssinia").
[[File:Bete Medhane Alem in Lalibela.JPG|thumb|201x201px|[[Biete Medhane Alem]], built during [[Zagwe dynasty]] in the Middle Ages ]]
The  Empire initiated territorial expansion under the leadership of [[Amda Seyon I]]. He launched campaigns against his Muslim adversaries to the east, resulting in a significant shift in the balance of power in favor of the Christians for the next two centuries. After Amda Seyon's successful eastern campaigns, most of the Muslim principalities in the [[Horn of Africa]] came under the suzerainty of the  Empire. Stretching from [[Gojjam]] to the  Coast in [[Zeila|Zelia]]. Among these Muslim entities was the [[Sultanate of Ifat]]. During the reign of Emperor [[Zara Yaqob]], the  Empire reached its pinnacle. His rule was marked by the consolidation of territorial acquisitions from earlier rulers, the oversight of the construction of numerous churches and monasteries, the active promotion of literature and art, and the strengthening of central imperial authority.{{sfn|Connel|Killion|2011|p=160}} Ifat's successor, the [[Adal Sultanate]], tried to conquer  during the [[–Adal War]], but was ultimately defeated at the 1543 [[Battle of Wayna Daga]].

By the 16th century, an influx of migration by ethnic [[Oromo people|Oromo]] into northern parts of the region fragmented the empire's power. Embarking from present-day [[Guji Zone|Guji]] and [[Borena Zone]], the Oromos were largely motivated by several folkloric conceptions—beginning with ''Moggaasaa'' and ''Liqimssa''—many of whom related to their raids. This persisted until ''gada'' of Meslé.{{sfn|Pankhurst|1997|p=301}} According to [[Bahrey|Abba Bahrey]], the earliest expansion occurred under Emperor [[Dawit II]] ([[Luba Melbah|''luba'' Melbah]]), when they encroached to [[Bale Province, |Bale]] before invading Adal Sultanate.

 saw major diplomatic contact with  from the 17th century, mainly related to religion. Beginning in 1555,  Jesuits attempted to develop Roman Catholicism as the state religion. After several failures, they sent several missionaries in 1603, including the most influential,  Jesuit [[Pedro Páez|Pedro Paez]]. Under Emperor [[Susenyos I]], Roman Catholicism became the state religion of the  Empire in 1622. This decision caused an uprising by the Orthodox populace.

===Early Modern Period (1632–1855)===
{{Main|Gondarine period|Zemene Mesafint}}
[[File:Fasil Ghebbi IV (23869587160).jpg|thumb|Fasil Ghebbi, one of the key castles of the [[Gondarine period]]]]
In 1632, Emperor [[Fasilides]] halted Roman Catholic state administration, restoring [[Orthodox Tewahedo]] as the state religion. Fasilides' reign solidified imperial power, relocating the capital to [[Gondar]] in 1636, marking the beginning of the "[[Gondarine period]]". He reclaimed lands, and exiled [[Jesuits]] to [[Fremona]]. During his rule, Fasilides constructed the iconic royal fortress, [[Fasil Ghebbi]], built forty-four churches, and revived [[ art]]. He is also credited with building seven stone bridges over the [[Blue Nile River]].

Gondar's power declined after the death of [[Iyasu I]] in 1706. Following [[Iyasu II]]'s death in 1755, Empress [[Mentewab]] brought her brother, [[Ras (title)|Ras]] Wolde Leul, to Gondar, making him Ras Bitwaded. This led to regnal conflict between Mentewab's ''Quaregnoch'' and the Wollo group led by Wubit. In 1767, Ras [[Mikael Sehul]], a regent in [[Tigray Province]], seized Gondar, killing the child [[Iyoas I]] in 1769, the reigning emperor, and installed 70-year-old [[Yohannes II]].

Between 1769 and 1855,  witnessed the [[Zemene Mesafint]] or "Age of Princes," a period of isolation. Emperors became figureheads, controlled by regional lords and noblemen like ''Ras'' Mikael Sehul, Ras [[Wolde Selassie]] of Tigray, and by the [[Yejju]] Oromo dynasty of the [[Zemene Mesafint#Wara Sheh rulers (Yejju) (1784–1855)|Wara Sheh]], including Ras [[Gugsa of Yejju]]. Before the Zemene Mesafint, Emperor Iyoas I had introduced the Oromo language (''Afaan Oromo'') at court, replacing Amharic.

{{main| expedition to Abyssinia|Menelik's Invasions|– War|First Italo- War|Mahdist War}} isolationism ended following a  mission that concluded with an alliance between the two nations, but it was not until 1855 that the Amhara kingdoms of northern  (Gondar, [[Gojjam]], and [[Shewa]]) were briefly united after the power of the emperor was restored beginning with the reign of [[Tewodros II]]. Tewodros II began a process of consolidation, centralisation, and state-building that would be continued by succeeding emperors. This process reduced the power of regional rulers, restructured the empire's administration, and created a professional army. These changes created the basis for establishing the effective sovereignty and territorial integrity of the  state. In 1875 and 1876, Ottoman and  forces, accompanied by many European and  advisors, twice [[– War|invaded Abyssinia]] but were initially defeated. From 1885 to 1889 (under [[Yohannes IV]]),  joined the [[Mahdist War]] allied to Britain, the Ottomans, and  against the  Mahdist State. In 1887, [[Menelik II]], king of [[Shewa]], invaded the [[Emirate of Harar]] after his victory at the [[Battle of Chelenqo]]. On 10 March 1889, Yohannes IV was killed by the  Khalifah Abdullah's army whilst leading his army in the [[Battle of Gallabat]].

, in roughly its current form, began under the reign of Menelik II, who was Emperor from 1889 until his death in 1913. From his base in the central province of Shewa, Menelik set out to annex territories to the south, east, and west — areas inhabited by the Oromo, [[Sidama people|Sidama]], Gurage, [[Welayta people|Welayta]], and other peoples. He achieved this with the help of ''Ras'' [[Gobana Dacche]]'s Shewan Oromo militia, which occupied lands that had not been held since [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]]'s war, as well as other areas that had never been under  rule.

For his leadership, despite opposition from more traditional elements of society, Menelik II was heralded as a national hero. He had signed the [[Treaty of Wuchale]] with  in May 1889, by which  would recognize 's sovereignty so long as  could control an area north of  (now part of modern ). In return,  was to provide Menelik with weapons and support him as emperor. The  used the time between the signing of the treaty and its ratification by the  government to expand their territorial claims. This [[First Italo- War]] culminated in the [[Battle of Adwa]] on 1 March 1896, in which 's colonial forces were defeated by the . During this time, about a third of the population died in the [[Famines in |Great  Famine]] (1888 to 1892), and the [[1890s African rinderpest epizootic|rinderpest]] swept through the area, destroying much of the herd economy. On 11 October 1897,  adopted the [[Pan-African colours|colours of the pan-African flag]] with green, yellow and red stripes in representation of [[pan-Africanist]] ideology.

===Haile Selassie I era (1916–1974)===

The early 20th century was marked by the reign of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] (''Ras Tafari''). He came to power after [[Lij Iyasu]] was deposed, and undertook [[Modernization under Haile Selassie|a nationwide modernization campaign]] from 1916 when he was made a ''Ras'' and Regent (''Inderase'') for the [[Queen regnant|Empress Regnant]] [[Zewditu]], and became the ''de facto'' ruler of the  Empire. Following Zewditu's death, on 2 November 1930, he succeeded her as emperor. In 1931, Haile Selassie endowed  with [[1931 Constitution of |its first constitution]] in emulation of Imperial 's [[Meiji Constitution|1890 Constitution]].
The independence of  was interrupted by the [[Second Italo- War]], beginning when it was invaded by [[Kingdom of #Fascist regime (1922–1943)|]] in early October 1935, and by subsequent  rule of the country (1936–1941) after  victory in the war. , however, never managed to secure the country in its totality, due to resistance from the [[Arbegnoch]]; this made , along with [[]], the only African countries to never be fully colonized. Following the entry of  into [[World War II]], [[ Empire]] forces, together with the Arbegnoch, liberated  in the course of the [[East African campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]] in 1941. The country was placed under [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration ()| military administration]], and then 's full [[sovereignty]] was restored with the signing of the [[Anglo- Agreement]] in December 1944.

On 24 October 1945,  became a founding member of the [[United Nations]]. In 1952, Haile Selassie orchestrated a [[Federation of  and |federation with ]]. He dissolved this in 1962 and annexed , resulting in the [[ War of Independence]]. Haile Selassie also played a leading role in the formation of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU). Opinion within  turned against Haile Selassie, owing to the worldwide [[1973 oil crisis]] causing a sharp increase in gasoline prices starting on 13 February 1974, leading to student and worker protests. The feudal oligarchical cabinet of [[Aklilu Habte-Wold]] was toppled, and a new government was formed with [[Endelkachew Makonnen]] serving as Prime Minister.

===Derg era (1974–1991)===

[[File:Mengistu Haile Mariam 3.jpg|thumb|[[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] was sentenced to death [[Trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] for committing [[Red Terror ()|crimes during his rule]].|164x164px]]

Haile Selassie's rule ended on 12 September 1974, when he was [[1974  coup d'état|deposed]] by the [[Derg]], a committee made up of military and police officers. After the execution of [[Massacre of the Sixty|60 former government and military officials]], the new [[Provisional Military Administrative Council]] abolished the monarchy in March 1975 and established  as a [[Marxist-Leninist state]]. The abolition of [[feudalism]], increased [[literacy]], [[nationalization]], and sweeping [[land reform]] including the [[Resettlement and villagization in |resettlement and villagization]] from the [[ Highlands]] became priorities.

After a power struggle in 1977, [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] gained undisputed leadership of the Derg. In 1977, , which had previously been receiving assistance and arms from the [[USSR]], invaded  in the [[Ogaden War]], capturing part of the [[Ogaden]] region.  recovered it after it began receiving massive military aid from the Soviet bloc countries. By the end of the seventies, Mengistu presided over the second-largest army in all of [[sub-Saharan Africa]], as well as a formidable [[ Air Force|air force]] and navy.

In 1976–78, up to 500,000 were killed as a result of the [[Red Terror ()|Red Terror]], a violent [[political repression]] campaign by the Derg against various opposition groups. In 1987, the Derg dissolved itself and established the [[People's Democratic Republic of ]] (PDRE) upon the adoption of the [[1987 Constitution of ]]. A [[1983–1985 famine in |1983–85 famine]] affected around 8 million people, resulting in 1 million dead.

The [[Tigray People's Liberation Front]] (TPLF) merged with other ethnically based opposition movements in 1989, to form the [[ People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF).

In July 1991, the EPRDF convened a National Conference to establish the [[Transitional Government of ]] composed of an 87-member [[Council of Representatives of |Council of Representatives]] and guided by a national charter that functioned as a transitional constitution.{{sfn|Lyons|1996|pp=121–23}} In 1994, a new constitution was written that established a parliamentary republic with a bicameral legislature and a judicial system.

In April 1993, [[]] gained independence from  after a [[1993  independence referendum|national referendum]]. In May 1998, a border dispute with  led to the [[– War]], which lasted until June 2000 and cost both countries an estimated $1&nbsp;million a day. This had a negative effect on 's economy, and a [[– border conflict|border conflict]] between the two countries would continue [[2018 – summit|until 2018]]. As of 2018, further [[ civil conflict (2018–present)|civil war in ]] continues, mainly due to destabilization of the country.

[[Human rights in #Ethnic violence|Ethnic violence rose]] during the late 2010s and early 2020s, with various clashes and conflicts leading to millions of  being displaced.

The federal government decided that elections for 2020 (later being [[2021  general election|rescheduled to 2021]]) be cancelled, due to health and safety concerns about [[COVID-19 pandemic in |COVID-19]]. The [[Tigray Region]]'s TPLF opposed this, and [[2020 Tigray regional election|proceeded to hold elections]] anyway on 9 September 2020. Relations between the federal government and Tigray deteriorated rapidly, and in November 2020,  began a military offensive in Tigray in response to [[Northern Command attacks ()|attacks on army units stationed]] there, marking the beginning of the [[Tigray war]]. By March 2022, as many as 500,000 people had died as a result of [[War crimes in the Tigray war|violence]] and [[Famine in northern  (2020–present)|famine]].

Coupled with [[OLA insurgency]], the federal government relations with Fano militias, who previously allied to the government in the Tigray War, deteriorated in mid-2023, resulting in a [[War in Amhara|war in the Amhara Region]]. According to reports conducted by the [[ Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC), mass human rights violations carried out by ENDF troops including door-to-door searches, extrajudicial killings, massacres and detentions.

===Early history===
{{further|Early Slavs}}
From 5000 to 2000 BC, the [[Bandkeramik]] predominated in what now constitutes , and the [[Cimmerians]] as well as other pastoralists roamed through the area by 1,000 BC. The [[Zarubintsy culture]] later became widespread at the beginning of the [[1st millennium]]. In addition, remains from the [[Dnieper–Donets culture]] were found in  and parts of . The region was first permanently settled by [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] tribes in the 3rd century. Around the 5th century, the area was taken over by the Slavs. The takeover was partially due to the lack of military coordination of the Balts, but their gradual assimilation into Slavic culture was peaceful. Invaders from [[Asia]], among whom were the [[Huns]] and [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], swept through c. 400–600 AD, but were unable to dislodge the Slavic presence.

===Kievan Rus'===
{{further|Kievan Rus'}}
[[File:001 Kievan Rus' Kyivan Rus'  map 1220 1240.jpg|thumb|upright|[[List of early East Slavic states|Principalities]] in Eastern Europe before the Mongol and  invasions]]
In the 9th century, the territory of modern  became part of [[Kievan Rus']], a vast East Slavic state ruled by the [[Rurikids]]. Upon the death of its ruler [[Yaroslav the Wise]] in 1054, the state split into independent principalities. The [[Battle on the Nemiga River]] in 1067 was one of the more notable events of the period, the date of which is considered the founding date of [[Minsk]].

Many early principalities were virtually razed or severely affected by a major [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Mongol invasion]] in the 13th century, but the lands of modern-day  avoided the brunt of the invasion and eventually joined the [[Grand Duchy of ]]. There are no sources of military seizure, but the annals affirm the alliance and united foreign policy of [[Principality of Polotsk|Polotsk]] and  for decades.

Incorporation into the Grand Duchy of  resulted in an economic, political, and ethno-cultural unification of  lands. Of the principalities held by the duchy, nine of them were settled by a population that would eventually become the . During this time, the duchy was involved in several military campaigns, including fighting on the side of [[Kingdom of  (1025–1385)|]] against the [[Teutonic Knights]] at the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410; the joint victory allowed the duchy to control the northwestern borderlands of [[Eastern Europe]].

The [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovites]], led by [[Ivan III of ]], began military campaigns in 1486 in an attempt to incorporate the former lands of [[Kievan Rus']], including the territories of modern-day  and .

===– Commonwealth===

[[File:GDL Map, 15cent.png|thumb|A map of the [[Grand Duchy of ]] in the 15th century prior to its union with the [[Crown of the Kingdom of |Kingdom of ]].  was fully within its borders.]]

On 2 February 1386, the Grand Duchy of  and the [[Kingdom of  (1025–1385)|Kingdom of ]] were joined in a [[personal union]] through a [[Union of Krewo|marriage of their rulers]]. This union set in motion the developments that eventually resulted in the formation of the [[– Commonwealth]], created in 1569 by the [[Union of Lublin]].

In the years following the union, the process of gradual [[Polonization]] of both  and Ruthenians gained steady momentum. In culture and social life, both the [[ language]] and [[Catholicism]] became dominant, and in 1696,  replaced Ruthenian as the official language, with Ruthenian being banned from administrative use. However, the Ruthenian peasants continued to speak their native language. Also, the [[ Byzantine Catholic Church]] was formed by the Poles to bring Orthodox Christians into the [[Holy See|See of Rome]]. The  church entered into a full [[Koinonia|communion]] with the [[Latin Church]] through the [[Union of Brest]] in 1595, while keeping its Byzantine [[liturgy]] in the [[Church Slavonic]] language.

[[File:Berezyna.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's ''Grande Armée'' retreating after [[Napoleon's invasion of |his invasion of ]] and crossing the [[Berezina river]] (near [[Barysaw]], )]]
The union between  and  ended in 1795 with the [[Third Partition of ]] by Imperial , [[Prussia]], and [[Habsburg monarchy|]]. The  territories acquired by the  Empire under the reign of [[Catherine II of |Catherine&nbsp;II]] were included into the [[ Governorate]] ({{langx|ru|Белорусское генерал-губернаторство}}) in 1796 and held until their occupation by the [[ Empire]] during [[World War I]].

Under [[Nicholas I of |Nicholas I]] and [[Alexander III of |Alexander III]] the national cultures were repressed with policies of [[Polonization]] replaced by [[Russification]] which included the return to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] of  [[Union of Brest|Uniates]].  language was banned in schools while in nearby [[Samogitia]] primary school education with [[Samogitian dialect|Samogitian]] literacy was allowed.

In a [[Russification]] drive in the 1840s, [[Nicholas I of |Nicholas I]] prohibited the use of the  language in public schools, campaigned against  publications, and tried to pressure those who had converted to Catholicism under the Poles to reconvert to the Orthodox faith. In 1863, economic and cultural pressure exploded in a [[January Uprising|revolt]], led by [[Konstanty Kalinowski]] (also known as Kastus). After the failed revolt, the  government reintroduced the use of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] to  in 1864 and no documents in  were permitted by the  government until 1905.

During the negotiations of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]],  first declared independence under  occupation on 25 March 1918, forming the [[ People's Republic]]. Immediately afterwards, the [[–Soviet War]] ignited, and the territory of  was divided between  and Soviet . The Rada of the  Democratic Republic exists as a [[government in exile]] ever since then; in fact, it is currently the world's longest serving government in exile.

===Early states and interwar period===

The [[ People's Republic]] was the first attempt to create an independent  state under the name "". Despite significant efforts, the state ceased to exist, primarily because the territory was continually dominated by the [[Imperial  Army]] and the [[Imperial  Army]] in [[World War I]], and then the [[Bolshevik]] [[Red Army]]. It existed from only 1918 to 1919 but created prerequisites for the formation of a  state. The choice of name was probably based on the fact that core members of the newly formed government were educated in tsarist universities, with corresponding emphasis on the ideology of West-Russianism.

The [[Republic of Central ]] was a short-lived political entity, which was the last attempt to restore  to the historical confederacy state (it was also supposed to create  Upper and  Lower). The republic was created in 1920 following [[Żeligowski's Mutiny|the staged rebellion]] of soldiers of the [[1st – Division]] of the [[ Army]] under [[Lucjan Żeligowski]]. Centered on the historical capital of the [[Grand Duchy of ]], [[Vilna]] ({{langx|lt|Vilnius}}, {{langx|pl|Wilno}}), for 18 months the entity served as a [[buffer state]] between [[]], upon which it depended, and , which claimed the area. After a variety of delays, [[1922 Republic of Central  general election|a disputed election]] took place on 8 January 1922, and the territory was annexed to . Żeligowski later in his memoir which was published in London in 1943 condemned the annexation of the Republic by , as well as the policy of closing  schools and general disregard of Marshal [[Józef Piłsudski]]'s confederation plans by  ally.

[[File:Kurapaty 1989 meeting.jpg|thumb|Meeting in the [[Kurapaty]] woods, 1989, where between 1937 and 1941 from 30,000 to 250,000 people, including  [[intelligentsia]] members, were [[Soviet repressions in |murdered]] by the [[NKVD]] during the [[Great Purge]]]]

In January 1919, a part of  under Bolshevik  control was declared the [[Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia]] (SSRB) for just two months, but then merged with the [[ Soviet Socialist Republic]] (LSSR) to form the [[Socialist Soviet Republic of  and Belorussia]] (SSR LiB), which lost control of its territories by August.

The [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (BSSR) was created in July 1920.

The contested lands were divided between  and the [[Soviet Union]] after the war ended in 1921, and the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922. In the 1920s and 1930s, Soviet agricultural and economic policies, including [[collectivization]] and [[Five-year plans of the Soviet Union|five-year plans for the national economy]], led to famine and political repression.

The [[Western Belorussia|western part of modern ]] remained part of the [[Second  Republic]]. After an early period of liberalization, tensions between increasingly nationalistic  government and various increasingly separatist ethnic minorities started to grow, and the [[ minority in | minority]] was no exception. The [[polonization]] drive was inspired and influenced by the  [[National Democracy ()|National Democracy]], led by [[Roman Dmowski]], who advocated refusing  and  the right for a free national development. A  organization, the ''[[ Peasants' and Workers' Union]]'', was banned in 1927, and opposition to  government was met with state repressions. Nonetheless, compared to the (larger) [[ minority in | minority]],  were much less politically aware and active, and thus suffered fewer repressions than the . In 1935, after the death of Piłsudski, a new wave of repressions was released upon the minorities, with many [[ Orthodox Church|Orthodox churches]] and  schools being closed. Use of the [[ language]] was discouraged.  leadership was sent to [[Bereza Kartuska prison]].

===World War II===

In September 1939, the Soviet Union invaded and occupied eastern , following the  [[invasion of ]] two weeks earlier which marked the beginning of [[World War II]]. The territories of [[Western Belorussia]] were [[Soviet annexation of Western Belorussia|annexed]] and incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR. The Soviet-controlled Byelorussian People's Council officially took control of the territories, whose populations consisted of a mixture of Poles, ,  and Jews, on {{nowrap|28 October}} 1939 in [[Białystok]]. Nazi  [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in 1941. The [[Defense of Brest Fortress|defense]] of [[Brest Fortress]] was the first major battle of [[Operation Barbarossa]].

The Byelorussian SSR was the hardest-hit Soviet republic in World War II; it remained under [[ occupation of Byelorussia during World War II| occupation]] until 1944. The  {{lang|de|[[Generalplan Ost]]}} called for the extermination, expulsion, or enslavement of most or all  to provide more [[Lebensraum|living space]] in the [[Drang nach Osten|East]] for . Most of Western  became part of the ''[[Reichskommissariat Ostland]]'' in 1941, but in 1943 the  authorities allowed local [[Byelorussian collaboration with Nazi |collaborators]] to set up a client state, the [[ Central Council]].

During World War II,  was home to a variety of [[ resistance during World War II|guerrilla movements]], including Jewish, , and Soviet partisans.  partisan formations formed a large part of the [[Soviet partisans]], and in the modern day these partisans have formed a core part of the  national identity, with  continuing to refer to itself as the "partisan republic" since the 1970s. Following the war, many former Soviet partisans entered positions of government, among them [[Pyotr Masherov]] and [[Kirill Mazurov]], both of whom were First Secretary of the Communist Party of Byelorussia. Until the late 1970s, the  government was almost entirely composed of former partisans. Numerous pieces of media have been made about the  partisans, including the 1985 film ''[[Come and See]]'' and the works of authors [[Ales Adamovich]] and [[Vasil Bykaŭ]].

The  occupation in 1941–1944 and war on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] devastated . During that time, 209 out of 290 towns and cities were destroyed, 85% of the republic's industry, and more than one million buildings. After the war, it was estimated that 2.2 million local inhabitants had died, and of those some 810,000 were combatants—some foreign. This figure represented [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|a staggering quarter of the prewar population]]. In the 1990s some raised the estimate even higher, to 2.7 million. The [[History of the Jews in |Jewish population of ]] was devastated during [[the Holocaust]] and never recovered. The population of  did not regain its pre-war level until 1971.  was also hit hard economically, losing around half of its economic resources.

The borders of the Byelorussian SSR and  were redrawn, in accord with the 1919-proposed [[Curzon Line]].  Byelorus gained territory to the west: the formerly  [[Kresy]].

[[Joseph Stalin]] implemented a policy of [[Sovietization]] to isolate the Byelorussian SSR from [[Western world|Western influences]]. This policy involved sending  from various parts of the Soviet Union and placing them in key positions in the Byelorussian SSR government. After Stalin died in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] continued his predecessor's [[cultural hegemony]] program, stating, "The sooner we all start speaking , the faster we shall build communism."

Between Stalin's death in 1953 and 1980,  politics was dominated by former members of the Soviet partisans, including First Secretaries Kirill Mazurov and Pyotr Masherov. Mazurov and Masherov oversaw 's [[ economic miracle|rapid industrialisation]] and transformation from one of the Soviet Union's poorest republics into one of its richest. In 1986, the Byelorussian SSR was contaminated with most (70%) of the [[nuclear fallout]] from the explosion at the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] power plant located 16&nbsp;km beyond the border in the neighboring [[ Soviet Socialist Republic| SSR]].

By the late 1980s, political liberalization led to a national revival, with the [[ Popular Front]] becoming a major pro-independence force.

===Independence===

In March 1990, [[12th  Supreme Council|elections]] for seats in the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the Byelorussian SSR took place. Though the opposition candidates, mostly associated with the pro-independence [[ Popular Front]], took only 10% of the seats,  declared itself sovereign on 27 July 1990 by issuing the [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of the  Soviet Socialist Republic]].

[[1991  strikes|Wide-scale strikes]] erupted in April 1991. With the support of the [[Communist Party of Byelorussia]], the country's name was changed to the Republic of  on 25 August 1991. [[Stanislav Shushkevich]], the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of , met with [[Boris Yeltsin]] of  and [[Leonid Kravchuk]] of  on 8 December 1991 in [[Białowieża Forest]] to formally declare the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].

In January 1992, the [[ Popular Front]] campaigned for early elections later in the year, two years before they were scheduled. By May of that year, about 383,000 signatures had been collected for a petition to hold the referendum, which was 23,000 more than legally required to be put to a referendum at the time. Despite this, the meeting of the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of ]] to ultimately decide the date for the referendum was delayed by six months. However, with no evidence to suggest such, the Supreme Council rejected the petition on the grounds of massive irregularities. Elections for the Supreme Council were set for March 1994. A new law on parliamentary elections failed to pass by 1993. Disputes over the referendum were accredited to the largely conservative [[Party of  Communists]], which controlled the Supreme Council at the time and was largely opposed to political and economic reform, with allegations that some of the deputies opposed  independence.

===Lukashenko era===
[[File: 1997 CIA map.jpg|thumb|1997 map of ]]
A national constitution was adopted in March 1994 in which the functions of prime minister were given to the [[President of ]]. A two-round [[1994  presidential election|election for the presidency on 24 June 1994 and 10 July 1994]] catapulted the formerly unknown Alexander Lukashenko into national prominence. He garnered 45% of the vote in the first round and 80% in the second, defeating [[Vyacheslav Kebich]] who received 14% of the vote. The elections were the first and only free elections in  after independence.

The 2000s saw some economic disputes between  and its primary economic partner, . The first one was the [[2004 – energy dispute]] when  energy giant [[Gazprom]] ceased the import of gas into  because of price disagreements. The [[2007 – energy dispute]] centered on accusations by Gazprom that  was siphoning oil from the [[Druzhba pipeline]] that runs through . Two years later the so-called [[Milk War]], a trade dispute, started when  wanted  to recognize the independence of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]] and through a series of events ended up banning the import of dairy products from .

In 2011,  suffered [[Economy of #Crisis of 2011|a severe economic crisis]] attributed to Lukashenko's government's centralized control of the economy, with inflation reaching 108.7%. Around the same time the [[2011 Minsk Metro bombing]] occurred in which 15 people were killed and 204 were injured. Two suspects, who were arrested within two days, confessed to being the perpetrators and were executed by shooting in 2012. The official version of events as publicised by the  government was questioned in the unprecedented wording of the [[UN Security Council]] statement condemning "the apparent terrorist attack" intimating the possibility that the  government itself was behind the bombing.

The [[Kingdom of |]] explorer [[Diogo Cão]] reached the mouth of the  in 1484. Commercial relationships grew between the inland Bantu kingdoms and European merchants who traded in commodities, manufactured goods, and people captured and enslaved in the [[hinterland]]s. After centuries as a central hub for transatlantic trade, direct European colonization of the  River delta began in the 19th century, subsequently eroding the power of the Bantu societies in the region.

The area north of the  River came under  sovereignty in 1880 as a result of [[Pierre de Brazza]]'s treaty with Tio King {{ill|Iloo I|fr|Illoy Ier}}.{{efn|De Brazza promised benefits of trade and an alliance, which was likely interpreted as military assistance. While some sources attest that Iloo was aware of the condition, [[Jan Vansina]] wrote that "it seems clear that he only wanted to cede land for the establishment of a [[Trading post|commercial station]]", and that his desire for an alliance may have been influenced by the hostility of [[Henry Morton Stanley's first trans-Africa expedition|Henry Stanley's expedition]] a few years earlier.{{Reference page|pages=409-12}}}} After the death of Iloo, his widow Queen [[Ngalifourou]] upheld the terms of the treaty and became an ally to the colonizers. This  Colony became known first as [[ ]], then as Middle  in 1903.

In 1908,  organized [[ Equatorial Africa]] (AEF), comprising the Middle , [[ |]], [[ |]], and [[Oubangui-Chari]] (which later became the [[]]). The  designated [[Brazzaville]] as the federal capital. Economic development during the first 50 years of colonial rule in  centered on natural resource extraction. Construction of the [[–Ocean Railway]] following [[World War I]] has been estimated to have cost at least 14,000 lives.

During the [[Nazi occupation of ]] during [[World War II]], Brazzaville functioned as the symbolic capital of [[Free ]] between 1940 and 1943. The [[Brazzaville Conference of 1944]] heralded a period of reform in  colonial policy.  "benefited" from the postwar expansion of colonial administrative and infrastructure spending as a result of its central geographic location within AEF and the federal capital at Brazzaville. It had a local legislature after the adoption of the 1946 constitution that established the [[ Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]].

Following the revision of the [[Constitution of | constitution]] that established the [[ Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] in 1958, AEF dissolved into its constituent parts, each of which became an autonomous colony within the [[ Community]]. During these reforms, Middle  became known as the  in 1958 and published its first constitution in 1959. Antagonism between the [[Mbochi]]s (who favored [[Jacques Opangault]]) and the [[Lari people ()|Lari]]s and [[Kongo people|Kongo]]s (who favored [[Fulbert Youlou]], the first black mayor elected in  Equatorial Africa) resulted in a series of riots in Brazzaville in February 1959, which the [[ Army]] subdued.

Elections took place in April 1959. By the time the  became independent in August 1960, Opangault, the former opponent of Youlou, agreed to serve under him. Youlou, an avid anti-communist, became the first President of the . Since the political tension was so high in [[Pointe-Noire]], Youlou moved the capital to Brazzaville.{{cn|date=July 2025}}

[[File:Alphonse Massamba-Debat.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Alphonse Massamba-Débat]]'s 1-party rule (1963–1968) attempted to implement a [[political economy|political economic]] strategy of "[[scientific socialism]]".]]
The  became fully independent from  on 15 August 1960. Youlou ruled as the country's first president until labor elements and rival political parties instigated a [[Trois Glorieuses (1963)|three-day uprising]] that ousted him. The  military took over the country and installed a civilian provisional government headed by [[Alphonse Massamba-Débat]].

Under the 1963 constitution, Massamba-Débat was elected president for a five-year term. During [[Alphonse Massamba-Débat# under Massamba-Débat (1963–1968)|Massamba-Débat's term in office]], the regime adopted "[[scientific socialism]]" as the country's constitutional ideology. In 1964,  sent an official team with a single athlete at the [[1964 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] for the first time in its history. In 1965,  established relations with the [[Soviet Union]], the [[|People's Republic of ]], [[]], and [[North ]]. Under his presidency, the  began to [[industrialize]]. Some large production units with large workforces were built: the textile factory of Kinsoundi, the palm groves of Etoumbi, the match factory of [[Bétou]], the shipyards of Yoro, etc. Health centers were created as well as school groups (colleges and elementary school). The country's school enrollment rate became the highest in Black Africa.

On the night of 14 to 15 February 1965, three public officials of the  were kidnapped: {{ill|Lazare Matsocota|fr}} (prosecutor of the Republic), {{ill|Joseph Pouabou|fr}} (President of the Supreme Court), and {{ill|Anselme Massouémé|fr}} (director of the  Information Agency). The bodies of two of these men were later found, mutilated, by the  River. Massamba-Débat's regime invited some hundred [[]]n army troops into the country to train his party's militia units. These troops helped his government survive a [[1966  coup d'état attempt|''coup d'état'' in 1966]] led by paratroopers loyal to future President [[Marien Ngouabi]]. Massamba-Débat's regime ended with a bloodless [[1968  coup d'état|''coup'' in September 1968]].

Marien Ngouabi, who had participated in the coup, assumed the presidency on 31 December 1968. One year later, Ngouabi proclaimed the  Africa's first "people's republic", the [[People's ]], and announced the decision of the National Revolutionary Movement to change its name to the [[ Party of Labour| Labour Party]] (PCT). He survived an [[1972  coup d'état attempt|attempted ''coup'' in 1972]] and was assassinated on 18 March{{nbsp}}1977. An 11-member Military Committee of the Party (CMP) was then named to head an interim government, with [[Joachim Yhombi-Opango]] serving as president. Two years later, Yhombi-Opango was forced from power, and [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]] became the new president.

Sassou Nguesso aligned the country with the [[Eastern Bloc]] and signed a 20-year friendship pact with the Soviet Union. Over the years, Sassou had to rely more on [[political repression]] and less on [[patronage]] to maintain his dictatorship. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 resulted in the ending of Soviet aid to prop up the regime, and it abdicated power.

[[Pascal Lissouba]] who became 's first elected president (1992–1997) during the period of multi-party democracy attempted to implement economic reforms with IMF backing to liberalize the economy. In the years 1993 and 1994 the [[ Civil War (1993–1994)|first  Civil War in ]] occurred. In June 1996, IMF approved a three-year [[Special drawing rights|SDR]] 69.5m (US$100m) [[enhanced structural adjustment facility]] (ESAF) and was on the verge of announcing a renewed annual agreement when civil war broke out in  in 1997.

's democratic progress was derailed in 1997 when Lissouba and Sassou started to fight for power in the [[ Civil War (1997–1999)|civil war]]. As presidential elections scheduled for July 1997 approached, tensions between the Lissouba and Sassou camps mounted. On 5 June, President Lissouba's government forces surrounded Sassou's compound in Brazzaville, and Sassou ordered members of his private militia (known as "Cobras") to resist. Thus began a four-month conflict that destroyed or damaged some of Brazzaville and caused tens of thousands of civilian deaths. In October, the  government began an invasion of  to install Sassou in power and the Lissouba government fell. After that, Sassou declared himself president.

In the [[ presidential election, 2002|elections in 2002]], Sassou won with almost 90% of the vote cast. His two main rivals, Lissouba and Bernard Kolelas, were prevented from competing. A remaining rival, [[André Milongo]] advised his supporters to boycott the elections and then withdrew from the race. A [[constitution]], agreed upon by [[ constitutional referendum, 2002|referendum in January 2002]], granted the president new powers, extended his term to seven years and introduced a new bicameral assembly. International observers took issue with the organization of the presidential election and the constitutional referendum, both of which were reminiscent in their organization of 's era of the 1-party state. Following the presidential elections, fighting restarted in the [[Pool Department|Pool region]] between government forces and rebels led by [[Pastor Ntumi]]; a peace treaty to end the conflict was signed in April 2003.

Sassou won the following [[ presidential election, 2009|presidential election in July 2009]]. According to the  Observatory of Human Rights, a non-governmental organization, the election was marked by "very low" turnout and "fraud and irregularities". In March 2015, Sassou announced that he wanted to run for yet another term in office and a [[ constitutional referendum, 2015|constitutional referendum]] in October resulted in a [[Constitution of the |changed constitution]] that allowed him to run during the [[ presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]]. He won the election believed by some to be fraudulent. After violent protests in the capital, Sassou attacked the Pool region where the [[Ninja (militia)|Ninja rebel]]s of the civil war used to be based, in what was believed to be a distraction. This led to a revival of the Ninja rebels who launched attacks against the army in April 2016, leading 80,000 people to flee their homes. A ceasefire deal was signed in December 2017.

In 2023, the [[Odzala National Park|Forest Massif of Odzala-Kokoua]] was listed as a natural [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

===Prehistory and Classical era===
{{Main|Pre-colonial }}
Cultural remains at [[Jerimalai]] on the eastern tip of  have been dated to 42,000 years ago. The first known inhabitants are those who arrived during the [[Australo-Melanesian]] migration through the region, likely bringing the precursors to today's [[Papuan languages]]. A later migration of [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]]-speakers is suspected, although no such languages remain. The arrival of [[Austronesian peoples]] brought [[Austronesian languages|new languages]], and merged with existing cultures on the island. Timorese origin myths recount settlers sailing around the eastern end of the island before landing in the south. These people are sometimes noted as being from the [[Malay Peninsula]] or the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] highlands of [[Sumatra]]. [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] migration to  may be associated with the development of agriculture on the island.

While information is limited about the political system of  during this period, the island had developed an interconnected series of polities governed by customary law. Small communities, centred around a particular sacred house, were part of wider ''sucos'' (or principalities), which were themselves part of larger kingdoms led by a ''liurai''. Authority within these kingdoms was held by [[Dyad (sociology)|two individuals]], with the worldly power of the ''liurai'' balanced by the spiritual power of a ''rai nain'', who was generally associated with the primary sacred house of the kingdom. These polities were numerous and saw shifting alliances and relations, but many were stable enough that they survived from initial European documentation in the 16th century until the end of  rule.{{rp|11–15}}

From perhaps the thirteenth century, the island exported [[sandalwood]],{{rp|267}} which was valued both for its use in crafting and as a source of perfume.  was included in Southeast Asian, , and  trading networks by the fourteenth century, exporting sandalwood, honey, and wax. The island was recorded by the [[Majapahit]] Empire as a source of tribute.{{rp|89}} It was sandalwood that attracted European explorers to the island in the early sixteenth century. Early European presence was limited to trade, with the first  settlement being on the nearby island of [[Solor]].{{rp|90}}

Early  presence on  was very limited; trade was directed through  settlements on nearby islands. Only in the 17th century did they establish a more direct presence on the island, a consequence of being driven out of other islands by the .{{rp|267}} After Solor was lost in 1613, the  moved to [[Flores]]. In 1646, the capital moved to [[Kupang]] on 's west, before Kupang too was lost to the  in 1652. The  then moved to [[Lifau]], in what is now 's [[Oecusse]] exclave.{{rp|90}} Effective European occupation in the east of the island only began in 1769, when the city of [[Dili]] was founded, although actual control remained highly limited. A definitive [[– border|border]] between the  and  parts of the island was established by the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in 1914 and remains the international boundary between the successor states  and , respectively.

For the , East  remained little more than a neglected trading post, with minimal investment in infrastructure and education, until the late nineteenth century. Even when  established actual control over the interior of its colony, investment remained minimal.{{rp|269, 273}} Sandalwood continued to be the main export crop and coffee exports became significant in the mid-nineteenth century.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, a faltering domestic economy prompted the  to extract greater wealth from its colonies, which was met with  resistance. The colony was seen as an economic burden during the [[Great Depression]] and received little support or management from .{{rp|269}}

During World War II, Dili was occupied by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1941, and later by the [[Empire of |]] beginning in 1942. The mountainous interior of the colony became the scene of a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla campaign]], known as the [[Battle of  (1942–43)|Battle of ]]. Waged by  volunteers and Allied forces against the , the struggle killed between 40,000 and 70,000  civilians.

The [[Revolutionary Front for an Independent East ]] (Fretilin) resisted a [[Timorese Democratic Union]] (UDT) coup attempt in August 1975, and [[ declaration of independence|unilaterally declared independence]] on 28 November 1975. Fearing a communist state within the  Archipelago, the  military launched an [[ invasion of East |invasion of East ]] on 7 December 1975.  declared [[East  (province)|East  its 27th province]] on 17 July 1976. The [[United Nations Security Council]] opposed the invasion, and the territory's nominal status in the UN remained as "non-self-governing territory under  administration".

[[File:East  Demo.jpg|thumb|alt=Protestors holding a sign saying " out of East  NOW"|A demonstration for [[ occupation of East |independence from ]] held in  during September 1999]]
[[Fretilin]] resisted the invasion, initially as an army, holding territory until November 1978, and then as a guerrilla resistance. The [[ occupation of East | occupation]] of  was marked by violence and brutality. A detailed statistical report prepared for the [[Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East ]] cited a minimum of 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period between 1974 and 1999, including approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 [[excess death]]s from hunger and illness. The total number of conflict-related deaths during this period is difficult to determine due to a lack of data. One estimate based on , , and Catholic Church data suggests it may have been as high as 200,000. Repression and restrictions counteracted improvements in health and education infrastructure and services, meaning there was little overall improvement in living standards; economic growth mostly benefited immigrants from elsewhere in .{{rp|271}} A huge expansion of education was intended to increase  language use and internal security as much as it was for development.

The [[Santa Cruz massacre|1991 massacre]] of more than 200 demonstrators by the  military was a turning point for the independence cause, and brought increased international pressure on . Following the [[Fall of Suharto|resignation of  President Suharto]], the new President [[B. J. Habibie|BJ Habibie]], prompted by a letter from  [[Prime Minister John Howard]], decided to hold a referendum on independence. A UN-sponsored agreement between  and  allowed for a UN-supervised popular [[ independence referendum, 1999|referendum]] in August 1999. A clear vote for independence was met with [[1999  crisis|a punitive campaign of violence]] by  [[pro- militia|pro-integration militias]] supported by elements of the  military. In response, the  government allowed a multinational peacekeeping force, [[International Force East |INTERFET]], to restore order and aid  refugees and internally displaced persons. On 25 October 1999, the administration of East  was taken over by the UN through the [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East ]] (UNTAET). INTERFET deployment ended in February 2000 with the transfer of military command to the UN.

===Pre-colonial period===
{{Further|Mesoamerican chronology}}
{{See also|Bajo Aguán}}
In the pre-Columbian era, modern  was split between two pan-cultural regions: [[Mesoamerica]] in the west and the [[Isthmo- area]] in the east. Each complex had a "core area" within  (the [[Sula Valley]] for Mesoamerica, and [[La Mosquitia ()|La Mosquitia]] for the Isthmo- area), and the intervening area was one of gradual transition. However, these concepts had no meaning in the Pre-Columbian era itself and represent extremely diverse areas. The [[Lenca|Lenca people]] of the interior highlands are also generally considered to be culturally Mesoamerican, though the extent of linkage with other areas varied over time (for example, expanding during the zenith of the [[Toltec Empire]]).

In the extreme west, [[Maya civilization]] flourished for hundreds of years. The dominant, best known, and best studied state within 's borders was in [[Copán]], which was located in a mainly non-Maya area, or on the frontier between Maya and non-Maya areas. Copán declined with other Lowland centres during the conflagrations of the [[Classic Maya collapse|Terminal Classic]] in the 9th century. The Maya of this civilization survive in western  as the [[Ch'orti' people|Ch'orti']], isolated from their Choltian linguistic peers to the west.

However, Copán represents only a fraction of  pre-Columbian history. Remnants of other civilizations are found throughout the country. Archaeologists have studied sites such as {{interlanguage link|Naco ()|lt=Naco|es|Naco ()}} and La Sierra in the Naco Valley, [[Los Naranjos, |Los Naranjos]] on [[Lake Yojoa]], [[Yarumela]] in the Comayagua Valley, [[La Ceiba]] and Salitron Viejo (both now under the [[El Cajón Dam ()|Cajón Dam]] [[reservoir]]), Selin Farm and Cuyamel in the Aguan valley, [[Cerro Palenque]], Travesia, Curruste, Ticamaya, Despoloncal, and [[Playa de los Muertos]] in the lower [[Ulúa River]] valley, and many others.

In 2012, LiDAR scanning revealed that several previously unknown high density settlements existed in La Mosquitia, corresponding to the legend of "[[La Ciudad Blanca]]". Excavation and study has since improved knowledge of the region's history. It is estimated that these settlements reached their zenith from 500 to 1000 AD.

[[File:Retrato de Hernán Cortés.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Hernán Cortés]], one of the conquerors of ]]
On his fourth and the final voyage to the [[New World]] in 1502, [[Christopher Columbus]] landed near the modern town of [[Trujillo, |Trujillo]], near Guaimoreto Lagoon, becoming the first European to visit the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]] on the coast of . On 30 July 1502, Columbus sent his brother [[Bartholomew Columbus|Bartholomew]] to explore the islands and Bartholomew encountered a Mayan trading vessel from Yucatán, carrying well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo. Bartholomew's men stole the cargo they wanted and kidnapped the ship's elderly captain to serve as an interpreter in the first recorded encounter between the  and the Maya.

In March 1524, [[Gil González Dávila]] became the first Spaniard to enter  as a [[conquistador]]. followed by [[Hernán Cortés]], who had brought forces down from . Much of the conquest took place in the following two decades, first by groups loyal to [[Cristóbal de Olid]], and then by those loyal to [[Francisco de Montejo]] but most particularly by those following Alvarado.{{who|date=December 2017}} In addition to  resources, the conquerors relied heavily on armed forces from {{snd}}[[Tlaxcalans]] and [[Aztec|Mexica]] armies of thousands who remained garrisoned in the region.

Resistance to conquest was led in particular by [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]]. Many regions in the north of  never fell to the , notably the [[Mosquito Coast|Miskito Kingdom]]. After the  conquest,  became part of 's vast empire in the New World within the [[Captaincy General of |Kingdom of ]]. Trujillo and [[Gracias a Dios Department|Gracias]] were the first city-capitals.

 was organized as a province of the [[Captaincy General of |Kingdom of ]] and the capital was fixed, first at Trujillo on the Atlantic coast, and later at [[Comayagua]], and finally at [[Tegucigalpa]] in the central part of the country.

[[Silver mining]] was a key factor in the  conquest and settlement of . Initially the mines were worked by local people through the [[encomienda]] system, but as disease and resistance made this option less available, slaves from other parts of Central America were brought in. When local slave trading stopped at the end of the sixteenth century, African slaves, mostly from [[]], were imported. After about 1650, very few slaves or other outside workers arrived in .

Although the  conquered the southern or Pacific portion of  fairly quickly, they were less successful on the northern, or Atlantic side. They managed to found a few towns along the coast, at [[Puerto Cortés|Puerto Caballos]] and Trujillo in particular, but failed to conquer the eastern portion of the region and many pockets of independent indigenous people as well. The [[Mosquito Coast|Miskito Kingdom]] in the northeast was particularly effective at resisting conquest. The Miskito Kingdom found support from northern European privateers, pirates and especially the  formerly  colony of [[]], which placed much of the area under its protection after 1740.

 gained independence from  in 1821 and [[Central America under  rule|was a part]] of the [[First  Empire]] until 1823, when it became part of the [[United Provinces of Central America]]. It has been an independent [[republic]] and has held regular elections since 1838. In the 1840s and 1850s  participated in several failed attempts at Central  unity, such as the Confederation of Central America (1842–1845), the covenant of  (1842), the Diet of Sonsonate (1846), the Diet of Nacaome (1847) and National Representation in Central America (1849–1852). Although  eventually adopted the name Republic of , the unionist ideal never waned, and  was one of the Central  countries that pushed the hardest for a policy of regional unity.

Policies favoring [[international trade]] and investment began in the 1870s.  Soon, foreign interests became involved, first in shipping from the north coast, especially tropical fruit and most notably bananas, and then in building railroads. [[Comayagua]] was the capital of  until 1880, when the capital moved to [[Tegucigalpa]]. In 1888, a projected railroad line from the Caribbean coast to Tegucigalpa ran out of money when it reached [[San Pedro Sula]]. As a result, San Pedro grew into the nation's primary industrial center and second-largest city.

Since independence, nearly 300 small internal rebellions and civil wars have occurred in the country, including some changes of régime.

===20th century and the role of  companies===
{{See also|Banana Wars}}
In the late nineteenth century,  granted land and substantial exemptions to several US-based fruit and infrastructure companies in return for developing the country's northern regions. Thousands of workers came to the north coast as a result to work in [[Banana production in |banana plantations]] and other businesses that grew up around the export industry. Banana-exporting companies, dominated until 1930 by the [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]], as well as the [[United Fruit Company]], and [[Standard Fruit Company]], built an [[enclave economy]] in northern , controlling [[infrastructure]] and creating self-sufficient, tax-exempt sectors that contributed relatively little to economic growth.  troops landed in  in 1903, 1907, 1911, 1912, 1919, 1924 and 1925.

In 1904, the writer [[O. Henry]] coined the term "[[banana republic]]" to describe , publishing a book called ''[[Cabbages and Kings (novel)|Cabbages and Kings]]'', about a fictional country, [[Anchuria]], inspired by his experiences in , where he had lived for six months. In ''The Admiral'', O. Henry refers to the nation as a "small maritime banana republic"; naturally, the fruit was the entire basis of its economy. According to a literary analyst writing for ''[[The Economist]]'', "his phrase neatly conjures up the image of a tropical, agrarian country. But its real meaning is sharper: it refers to the fruit companies from the  that came to exert extraordinary influence over the politics of  and its neighbors." In addition to drawing Central  workers north, the fruit companies encouraged immigration of workers from the [[-speaking Caribbean]], notably [[]] and [[]], which introduced an African-descended, -speaking and largely Protestant population into the country, although many of these workers left following changes to immigration law in 1939.
 joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Nations]] after [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], on 8 December 1941, and signed the [[Declaration by United Nations]] on 1 January 1942, along with twenty-five other governments.

Constitutional crises in the 1940s led to reforms in the 1950s. One reform gave workers permission to organize, and a 1954 [[General strike of 1954 ()|general strike]] paralyzed the northern part of the country for more than two months, but led to reforms.

In 1877,  was made a [[Crown colony]]. [[Theophilus A. Marryshow]] founded the Representative Government Association (RGA) in 1918 to agitate for a new and participative constitutional dispensation for the  people. Due to Marryshow's lobbying, the Wood Commission of 1921–22 concluded that  was ready for constitutional reform in the form of a modified Crown colony government. This modification granted  the right to elect five of the 15 Legislative Council members on a restricted property franchise, enabling the wealthiest 4% of adult  to vote. Marryshow was named a [[1943 Birthday Honours#Commander of the Order of the  Empire (CBE)|Commander of the Order of the  Empire (CBE) in 1943]].

Civil conflict gradually broke out between Eric Gairy's government and some opposition parties, including the Marxist [[New JEWEL Movement]] (NJM). Gairy and the GULP won the [[1976  general election]], albeit with a reduced majority; however, the opposition deemed the results invalid due to fraud and the violent intimidation performed by the so-called '[[Mongoose Gang]]', a private militia loyal to Gairy.

On 13 March 1979, whilst Gairy was out of the country, the NJM launched a [[bloodless coup]] which removed Gairy, suspended the constitution, and established a [[People's Revolutionary Government]] (PRG), headed by [[Maurice Bishop]], who declared himself prime minister. His [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] government established close ties with [[]], [[]], and other [[communist bloc]] countries.

==== Coup and execution of Maurice Bishop ====
Some years later,{{when|date=August 2021}} a dispute developed between Bishop and certain high-ranking members of the NJM. Though Bishop cooperated with  and the [[USSR]] on various trade and foreign policy issues, he sought to maintain a [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned status]]. Hardline [[Marxist]] party members, including [[communist]] Deputy Prime Minister [[Bernard Coard]], deemed Bishop insufficiently revolutionary and demanded that he either step down or enter into a power-sharing arrangement.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

On 16 October 1983, Bernard Coard and his wife, Phyllis, backed by the  Army, led a coup against the government of Maurice Bishop and placed Bishop under [[house arrest]]. These actions led to street demonstrations in various parts of the island because Bishop had widespread support from the population. Because Bishop was a widely popular leader, he was freed by impassioned supporters who marched en masse to his guarded residence from a rally in the capital's central square. Bishop then led the crowd to the island's military headquarters to reassert his power.  soldiers were dispatched in armoured vehicles by the Coard faction to retake the fort. A confrontation between soldiers and civilians at the fort ended in gunfire and panic. Three soldiers and at least eight civilians died in the tumult that also injured 100 others, a school-sponsored study later found in 2000. When the initial shooting ended with Bishop's surrender, he and a group of seven of his closest supporters were taken prisoner and executed by firing squad. Besides Bishop, the group included three of his cabinet ministers, a trade union leader, and three service-industry workers.

After the execution of Bishop, the [[People's Revolutionary Army ()|People's Revolutionary Army]] (PRA) formed a military Marxist government with General [[Hudson Austin]] as chairman. The army declared a four-day total curfew, during which anyone leaving their home without approval would be shot on sight.

US President [[Ronald Reagan]] stated that particularly worrying was the presence of  construction workers and military personnel building a {{convert|10000|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Point Salines International Airport|airstrip]] on . Bishop had stated the purpose of the airstrip was to allow commercial jets to land, but some US military analysts argued that the only reason for constructing such a long and reinforced runway was so that it could be used by heavy military transport planes. The contractors,  and European companies, and the [[European Economic Community|EEC]], which provided partial funding, all claimed the airstrip did not have military capabilities. Reagan asserted that , under the direction of the Soviet Union, would use  as a refuelling stop for  and Soviet airplanes loaded with weapons destined for Central  communist insurgents.

The Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), [[]], and  all appealed to the  for assistance. On 25 October 1983, combined forces from the  and the [[Regional Security System]] (RSS) based in  invaded  in an operation codenamed ''[[Invasion of |Operation Urgent Fury]]''. The US stated this was done at the behest of , [[]]{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} and Governor-General [[Paul Scoon]]. Scoon had requested the invasion through secret diplomatic channels, but it was not made public for his safety. Progress was rapid, and within four days the  had removed the military government of Hudson Austin.{{fact|date=July 2025}}

The invasion was criticised by the governments of Britain, [[]], and . The [[United Nations General Assembly]] condemned it as "a flagrant violation of international law" by a vote of 108 to 9, with 27 abstentions. The [[United Nations Security Council]] considered a similar resolution, which was supported by 11 countries. However, the  vetoed the motion.

==== Post-invasion arrests ====
After the invasion, the pre-revolutionary  constitution came into operation once again. Eighteen members of the PRG/PRA were arrested on charges related to the murder of Maurice Bishop and seven others. The 18 included the top political leadership of  at the time of the execution, along with the entire military chain of command directly responsible for the operation that led to the executions. Fourteen were [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]], one was found not guilty, and three were sentenced to 45 years in prison. The death sentences were eventually commuted to terms of imprisonment. Those in prison have become known as the "[[ 17]]".

=== Since 1983 ===
When US troops withdrew from  in December 1983, Governor-General Scoon appointed an interim advisory council chaired by [[Nicholas Brathwaite]] to organise new elections. The first democratic elections since 1976 were [[1984  general election|held in December 1984]], and were won by the [[New National Party ()|New National Party]] under Herbert Blaize, who served as prime minister until his death in December 1989.

[[Ben Jones ()|Ben Jones]] briefly succeeded Blaize as prime minister and served until the [[1990  general election|March 1990 election]]. This election was won by the [[National Democratic Congress ()|National Democratic Congress]] under Nicholas Brathwaite, who served as prime minister until he resigned in February 1995. He was succeeded by [[George Brizan]] for a brief period until the [[1995  general election|June 1995 election]] which was won by the [[New National Party ()|New National Party]] under [[Keith Mitchell]], who went on to win the [[1999  general election|1999]] and [[2003  general election|2003 elections]], serving for a record 13 years until 2008. Mitchell re-established relations with  and also reformed the country's banking system, which had come under criticism over potential money laundering concerns.{{sfn|Steele|2003|pp=35–36}}

In 2000–02, much of the controversy of the late 1970s and early 1980s was once again brought into the public consciousness with the opening of the [[truth and reconciliation commission]]. The commission was chaired by a [[Holy Orders|Roman Catholic priest]], Father Mark Haynes, and was tasked with uncovering injustices arising from the PRA, Bishop's regime, and before. It held a number of hearings around the country. Brother Robert Fanovich, head of Presentation Brothers' College (PBC) in St. George's, tasked some of his senior students with conducting a research project into the era and specifically into the fact that Maurice Bishop's body was never discovered.
[[File: ivan.jpg|thumb|right|Aftermath of Hurricane Ivan in ]]

On 7 September 2004, after being hurricane-free for 49 years, the island was directly hit by [[Hurricane Ivan]]. Ivan struck as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3 hurricane]], resulting in 39 deaths and damage or destruction to 90% of the island's homes.{{sfn|Steele|2003|pp=35–36}} On 14 July 2005, [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Hurricane Emily]], a Category 1 hurricane at the time, struck the northern part of the island with {{convert|80|kn|km/h mph|adj=on}} winds, killing one person and causing an estimated US$110&nbsp;million (EC$297&nbsp;million) worth of damage.{{sfn|Steele|2003|pp=35–36}} Agriculture, and in particular the nutmeg industry, suffered serious losses, but that event caused changes in crop management and it is hoped that as new nutmeg trees mature, the industry will gradually rebuild.

Mitchell was defeated in the [[2008  general election|2008 election]] by the NDC under [[Tillman Thomas]]; however, he won the [[2013  general election]] by a landslide and the NNP returned to power, winning again by another landslide [[2018  general election|in 2018]].

The [[Germanic peoples]] are thought to have [[Ethnogenesis|emerged]] from the [[Jastorf culture]] during the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] or early [[Pre-Roman Iron Age|Iron Age]]. From southern [[Scandinavia]] and [[northern ]], they expanded south, east, and west, coming into contact with the [[Celts|Celtic]], [[ peoples|]], [[Balts|Baltic]], and [[Early Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. Southern  was inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, who belonged to the wider [[La Tène culture]]. They were later assimilated by the Germanic conquerors.

Under [[Augustus]], the [[Roman Empire]] began to invade lands inhabited by the Germanic tribes, creating a short-lived Roman province of [[Germania Antiqua|Germania]] between the Rhine and [[Elbe]] rivers. In 9 AD, three [[Roman legion]]s were [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|defeated]] by [[Arminius]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. The outcome of this battle dissuaded the Romans from their ambition of conquering [[Germania]] and is thus considered one of the most important events in [[European history]].{{sfn|Murdoch|2004|p=57}} By 100 AD, when [[Tacitus]] wrote ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the [[Limes Germanicus]]), occupying most of modern .

Around 260, Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands. After the invasion of the [[Huns]] in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest: the Franks established the [[Frankish Kingdom]] and pushed east to subjugate [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]].

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, laying the basis for the [[democratization of knowledge|democratisation of knowledge]]. In 1517, [[Martin Luther]] incited the Protestant Reformation and [[Luther Bible|his translation of the Bible]] began the standardisation of the language; the 1555 [[Peace of Augsburg]] tolerated the "Evangelical" faith ([[Lutheranism]]), but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects ({{lang|la|[[cuius regio, eius religio]]}}). From the [[Cologne War]] through the [[Thirty Years' War]]s (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated  lands and significantly reduced the population.

The [[Peace of Westphalia]] ended religious warfare among the [[Imperial Estate]]s. The legal system initiated by a series of [[Imperial Reform]]s (approximately 1495–1555) provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]].

[[File: Confederation (1815).svg|thumb|The  Confederation in 1815]]
Following the fall of [[Napoleon]], the [[Congress of Vienna]] founded the  Confederation, a loose league of [[States of the  Confederation|39 sovereign states]]. The appointment of the [[emperor of ]] as the permanent president reflected the Congress's rejection of [[Prussia]]'s rising influence. Disagreement within [[Concert of Europe|restoration]] politics partly led to the rise of [[Liberalism in |liberal]] movements, followed by new measures of repression by  statesman [[Klemens von Metternich]]. The {{lang|de|[[Zollverein]]}}, a tariff union, furthered economic unity.

{{Main|History of  (1945–1990)|Allied-occupied |West |East }}

[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|The [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989 was one of the first developments in the end of the [[Cold War]], leading ultimately to the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]].]]

After the surrender of Nazi , the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] ''[[de jure]]'' [[Berlin Declaration (1945)|abolished the  state]] and partitioned Berlin and 's remaining territory into four occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by , the [[]], and the [[]], were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of  (FRG) ({{langx|de|Bundesrepublik Deutschland}}); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the  Democratic Republic (GDR) ({{lang|de|Deutsche Demokratische Republik}}; DDR). They were informally known as West  and East . East  selected [[East Berlin]] as its capital, while West  chose [[Bonn]] as a provisional capital to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was temporary.

West  was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a [[social market economy]]. In 1948, West  became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the  [[Marshall Plan]]. [[Konrad Adenauer]] was elected the first [[Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of |federal chancellor of ]] in 1949. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth ({{lang|de|[[Wirtschaftswunder]]}}) beginning in the early 1950s. West  joined [[NATO]] in 1955 and was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]]. On 1 January 1957, the [[Saar Protectorate|Saarland]] joined West .

East  was an [[Eastern Bloc]] state under political and military control by the [[Soviet Union]] via occupation forces and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Although East  claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members ({{lang|de|[[Politburo|Politbüro]]}}) of the communist-controlled [[Socialist Unity Party of ]], supported by the {{lang|de|[[Stasi]]|italic=no}}, an immense secret service. While [[Communist propaganda|East  propaganda]] was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged threat of a West  invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity. The [[Berlin Wall]], built in 1961, prevented East  citizens from escaping to West , becoming a symbol of the [[Cold War]].

Tensions between East and West  were reduced in the late 1960s by Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]'s {{lang|de|[[Ostpolitik]]}}. In 1989,  decided to dismantle the [[Iron Curtain]] and [[Removal of 's border fence with |open its border with ]], causing the emigration of thousands of East  to West  via  and . This had devastating effects on the GDR, where [[Monday demonstrations in East |regular mass demonstrations]] received increasing support. In an effort to help retain East  as a state, the East  authorities eased border restrictions, but this actually led to an acceleration of the {{lang|de|Wende}} reform process, culminating in the ''[[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to |Two Plus Four Treaty]]'' under which  regained full sovereignty. This permitted [[ reunification]] on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the [[New states of |five re-established states]] of the former GDR. The [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989 became a symbol of the [[fall of Communism]], the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]],  reunification and {{lang|de|[[Die Wende]]}} ("the turning point").

The archipelago was formed approximately 40–50 million years ago during the [[Eocene]] epoch. Before the arrival of Europeans, the  Islands were uninhabited. They were discovered by [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and  navigators around 1456. According to  official records, the first discoveries were made by Genoa-born [[António de Noli]], who was afterwards appointed governor of  by  King [[Afonso V of |Afonso V]]. Other navigators mentioned as contributing to discoveries on the  archipelago are [[Diogo Dias]], Diogo Afonso, [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[Alvise Cadamosto]] and [[Diogo Gomes]] (who had accompanied António de Noli on his voyage of discovery, and who claimed to have been the first to land on [[Santiago, |Santiago]] and the first to name that island).

In 1462,  settlers arrived at Santiago and founded a settlement they called Ribeira Grande. Today it is called [[Cidade Velha]] ("Old City"), to distinguish it from [[Ribeira Grande, |Ribeira Grande]]. The original Ribeira Grande was the first permanent European settlement in the [[tropics]].

In the 16th century, the archipelago prospered from the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Pirates occasionally attacked the  settlements. [[Francis Drake]], an  [[privateer]], twice sacked Ribeira Grande in 1585 when it was a part of the [[Iberian Union]]. After a  attack in 1712, the town declined in importance relative to nearby [[Praia]], which became the capital in 1770.

The decline in the slave trade in the 19th century resulted in an economic crisis. 's early prosperity slowly vanished. However, the islands' position astride mid-Atlantic shipping lanes made  an ideal location for re-supplying ships. Because of its excellent harbour [[Mindelo]], located on the island of [[São Vicente, |São Vicente]], became an important commercial centre.

The region now known as  had been occupied for over 2,500 years when the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] arrived; however, present-day Aymara associate themselves with the ancient civilization of the [[Tiwanaku Empire|Tiwanaku Polity]], which had its capital at [[Tiwanaku]], in Western .

The [[Aymara people|Aymara]] community grew to urban proportions between AD 600 and AD 800, becoming an important regional power in the southern [[Andes]] from [[La Paz]]. According to early estimates,{{When|date=February 2014}} the city covered approximately {{convert|6.5|sqkm|abbr=off|sp=us}} at its peak, and had between 15,000 and 30,000 inhabitants.{{sfn|Kolata|1993|p=145}} However, in 1996, [[Satellite imagery|satellite imaging]] was used to map the extent of preserved ''suka kollus'' ([[Raised field|flooded raised fields]]) across the three primary valleys of [[Tiwanaku]], with the results suggesting a population-carrying capacity of anywhere between 285,000 and 1,482,000 people.{{sfn|Kolata|1996|p={{page needed|date=July 2013}}}}

Around AD 400, Tiwanaku went from being a locally-dominant force to a 'predatory' state, aggressively expanding its reach into the [[Yungas]] and bringing its culture and ways to new peoples in , , and . Nonetheless, Tiwanaku was not a violent or domineering culture; to expand its reach, the state exercised great political astuteness, created colonies, fostered local trade agreements (which made other cultures rather dependent), and instituted state cults.

As rainfall gradually decreased, the stores of food supplies decreased, and thus the elites lost power. Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1000. The area remained uninhabited for centuries thereafter.{{sfn|Kolata|1993|p={{page needed|date=July 2013}}}}

Between 1438 and 1527, [[Incan Empire]] expanded from its capital at [[Cusco]], gaining control over much of what is now the  Andes, and extending its control into the fringes of the Amazon basin.

Local government came from the [[Real Audiencia of Charcas|Audiencia de Charcas]] located in Chuquisaca (La Plata—modern [[Sucre]]).

By the late 16th century,  silver was an important source of revenue for the [[ Empire]]. A steady stream of natives served as labor force under the brutal, slave conditions of the  version of the pre-Columbian draft system called the [[Mita (Inca)|mita]]. Charcas was transferred to the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] in 1776 and the people from Buenos Aires, the capital of the Viceroyalty, coined the term "[[Upper ]]" ({{Langx|es|link=no|Alto }}) as a popular reference to the Royal Audiencia of Charcas. [[Túpac Katari]] led the indigenous rebellion that laid siege to [[La Paz]] in March 1781, during which 20,000 people died.

The [[ War of Independence|struggle for independence]] started in the city of [[Sucre]] on 25 May 1809 and the [[Chuquisaca Revolution]] (Chuquisaca was then the name of the city) is known as the first cry of Freedom in Latin America. That revolution was followed by the [[La Paz revolution]] on 16 July 1809. The La Paz revolution marked a complete split with the  government, while the Chuquisaca Revolution established a local independent junta in the name of the  King deposed by Napoleon Bonaparte. Both revolutions were short-lived and defeated by the  authorities in the Viceroyalty of the Rio de La Plata, but the following year the [[  wars of independence]] raged across the continent.

Following the renewed independence of ,  president General [[Agustín Gamarra]] invaded . On 18 November 1841, the battle de Ingavi took place, in which the  Army defeated the  troops of Gamarra (killed in the battle). After the victory,  invaded  on several fronts. The eviction of the  troops from the south of  would be achieved by the greater availability of material and human resources of ; the  Army did not have enough troops to maintain an occupation. In the district of Locumba – Tacna, a column of  soldiers and peasants defeated a  regiment in the so-called Battle of Los Altos de Chipe (Locumba). In the district of Sama and in Arica, the  colonel José María Lavayén organized a troop that managed to defeat the  forces of Colonel Rodríguez Magariños and threaten the port of Arica. In the battle of Tarapacá on 7 January 1842,  militias formed by the commander Juan Buendía defeated a detachment led by  colonel José María García, who died in the confrontation.  troops left Tacna, Arica and Tarapacá in February 1842, retreating towards Moquegua and Puno. The battles of Motoni and Orurillo forced the withdrawal of  forces occupying  territory and exposed  to the threat of counter-invasion. The Treaty of Puno was signed on 7 June 1842, ending the war. However, the climate of tension between Lima and La Paz would continue until 1847, when the signing of a Peace and Trade Treaty became effective.

In addition, during the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–83),  occupied vast territories rich in [[natural resources]] south west of , including the  [[coast]].  took control of today's [[Chuquicamata]] area, the adjoining rich ''salitre'' ([[Sodium nitrate|saltpeter]]) fields, and the port of [[Antofagasta]] among other  territories.

Since independence,  has lost over half of its territory to neighboring countries.

It also lost the [[Acre (state)|state of Acre]], in the [[Acre War]], important because this region was known for its production of rubber. Peasants and the  army fought briefly but after a few victories, and facing the prospect of a total war against , it was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Petrópolis]] in 1903, in which  lost this rich territory. Popular myth has it that  president Mariano Melgarejo (1864–71) traded the land for what he called "a magnificent white horse" and Acre was subsequently flooded with , which ultimately led to confrontation and fear of war with .

During the early 20th century, [[tin]] replaced silver as the country's most important source of wealth. A succession of governments controlled by the economic and social elite followed [[laissez-faire]] capitalist policies through the first 30 years of the 20th century.

Living conditions of the native people, who constitute most of the population, remained deplorable. With work opportunities limited to primitive conditions in the mines and in large estates having nearly feudal status, they had no access to education, economic opportunity, and [[Participation (decision making)|political participation]]. 's defeat by  in the [[Chaco War]] (1932–1935), where  lost a great part of the [[Gran Chaco]] region in dispute, marked a turning-point.

The [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]] (MNR), the most historic political party, emerged as a broad-based party. Denied its victory in the 1951 presidential elections, the MNR led a successful revolution in 1952. Under President [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro]], the MNR, having strong popular pressure, introduced [[universal suffrage]] into his political platform and carried out a sweeping land-reform promoting rural education and nationalization of the country's largest tin mines.

Twelve years of tumultuous rule left the MNR divided. In 1964, a military [[military dictatorship|junta]] overthrew President Paz Estenssoro at the outset of his third term. The 1969 death of President [[René Barrientos]], a former member of the junta who was elected president in 1966, led to a succession of weak governments. Alarmed by the rising Popular Assembly and the increase in the popularity of President [[Juan José Torres]], the military, the MNR, and others installed [[Hugo Banzer]] as president in 1971. He returned to the presidency in 1997 through 2001. Torres, who had fled , was kidnapped and assassinated in 1976 as part of [[Operation Condor]], the U.S.-supported campaign of political repression by South  right-wing dictators.

The ' [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) financed and trained the  military dictatorship in the 1960s. The revolutionary leader [[Che Guevara]] was killed by a team of CIA officers and members of the  Army on 9 October 1967, in . [[Félix Rodríguez (soldier)|Félix Rodríguez]] was a CIA officer on the team with the  Army that captured and shot Guevara. Rodriguez said that after he received a  presidential execution order, he told "the soldier who pulled the trigger to aim carefully, to remain consistent with the  government's story that Che had been killed in action during a clash with the  army." Rodriguez said the US government had wanted Che in , and "I could have tried to falsify the command to the troops, and got Che to  as the US government said they had wanted", but that he had chosen to "let history run its course" as desired by .

Elections in 1978 were marked by fraud and those in 1979 were inconclusive. There were [[Coup d'état|coups d'état]], counter-coups, and caretaker governments. Following the 1980 election, General [[Luis García Meza]] carried out a coup d'état. The [[ Workers' Center]], which tried to resist the putsch, was violently repressed. More than a thousand people were killed in less than a year. Cousin of one of the most important narco-trafficker of the country, García Meza favored the production of cocaine. After a military rebellion forced out García Meza in 1981, three other military governments in fourteen months struggled with 's growing economic problems. Unrest forced the military to convoke the [[National Congress of |Congress]] elected in 1980, and allow it to choose a new president. In October 1982, [[Hernán Siles Zuazo]] again became president, twenty-two years after the end of his first term of office (1956–1960).

=== Democratic transition ===
{{main|History of  (1982–present)}}In 1993, [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] was elected [[President of |president]] in alliance with the [[Revolutionary Liberation Movement Tupaq Katari|Tupac Katari Revolutionary Liberation Movement]], which inspired indigenous-sensitive and multicultural-aware policies. Sánchez de Lozada pursued an aggressive economic and social reform agenda. The most dramatic reform was privatization under the "capitalization" program, under which investors, typically foreign, acquired 50% ownership and management control of public enterprises in return for agreed upon capital investments. In 1993, Sanchez de Lozada introduced the ''Plan de Todos'', which led to the decentralization of government, introduction of [[intercultural bilingual education]], implementation of [[Agriculture|agrarian]] legislation, and [[privatization]] of state owned businesses. The plan explicitly stated that  citizens would own a minimum of 51% of enterprises; under the plan, most [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprises]] (SOEs), though not mines, were sold. This privatization of SOEs led to a [[neoliberal]] structuring.<!--that acknowledged a diverse population within . – Acknowledged how so?-->

The reforms and economic restructuring were strongly opposed by certain segments of society, which instigated frequent and sometimes violent protests, particularly in La Paz and the Chapare [[coca]]-growing region, from 1994 through 1996. The indigenous population of the [[Andes|Andean]] region was not able to benefit from government reforms. During this time, the umbrella labor-organization of , the [[Central Obrera Boliviana]] (COB), became increasingly unable to effectively challenge government policy. A [[1995  state of siege|teachers' strike in 1995]] was defeated because the COB could not marshal the support of many of its members, including construction and factory workers.

====1997–2002 General Banzer presidency====
In the 1997 elections, General [[Hugo Banzer]], leader of the [[Nationalist Democratic Action]] party (ADN) and former dictator (1971–1978), won 22% of the vote, while the MNR candidate won 18%. At the outset of his government, President Banzer launched a policy of using special police-units to eradicate physically the illegal coca of the Chapare region. The [[Revolutionary Left Movement ()|Revolutionary Left Movement]] (MIR) of Jaime Paz Zamora remained a coalition-partner throughout the Banzer government, supporting this policy (called the Dignity Plan). The Banzer government continued the free-market and privatization-policies of its predecessor. The relatively robust economic growth of the mid-1990s continued until about the third year of its term in office. After that, regional, global and domestic factors contributed to a decline in economic growth. Financial crises in  and , lower world prices for export commodities, and reduced employment in the coca sector depressed the  economy. The public also perceived a significant amount of public sector corruption. These factors contributed to increasing social protests during the second half of Banzer's term.

Between January 1999 and April 2000, large-scale [[2000 Cochabamba protests|protests]] erupted in [[Cochabamba]], 's third largest city at the time, in response to the [[Water privatization|privatization of water]] resources by foreign companies and a subsequent doubling of water prices. On 6 August 2001, Banzer resigned from office after being diagnosed with cancer. He died less than a year later. Vice President [[Jorge Quiroga|Jorge Fernando Quiroga Ramírez]] completed the final year of his term.

==== 2002–2005 Sánchez de Lozada / Mesa presidency ====

In the June 2002 national elections, former President [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] (MNR) placed first with 22.5% of the vote, followed by coca-advocate and native peasant-leader [[Evo Morales]] ([[Movement for Socialism ()|Movement Toward Socialism]], MAS) with 20.9%. A July agreement between the MNR and the fourth-place MIR, which had again been led in the election by former President Jaime Paz Zamora, virtually ensured the election of Sánchez de Lozada in the congressional run-off, and on 6 August he was sworn in for the second time. The MNR platform featured three overarching objectives: economic reactivation (and job creation), anti-corruption, and social inclusion.

In 2003, the [[ gas conflict]] broke out. On 12 October 2003, the government imposed martial law in El Alto after 16 people were shot by the police and several dozen wounded in violent clashes. Faced with the option of resigning or more bloodshed, Sánchez de Lozada offered his resignation in a letter to an emergency session of Congress. After his resignation was accepted and his vice president, [[Carlos Mesa]], invested, he left on a commercially scheduled flight for the .

The country's internal situation became unfavorable for such political action on the international stage. After a resurgence of gas protests in 2005, Carlos Mesa attempted to resign in January 2005, but his offer was refused by Congress. On 22 March 2005, after weeks of new street protests from organizations accusing Mesa of bowing to U.S. corporate interests, Mesa again offered his resignation to Congress, which was accepted on 10 June. The chief justice of the Supreme Court, [[Eduardo Rodríguez (politician)|Eduardo Rodríguez]], was sworn as interim president to succeed the outgoing Carlos Mesa.

====2005–2019 Morales presidency====
{{POV section|date=September 2020|talk=Talk:/Archive 2#NPOV}}
[[File:Presidentes_del_Perú_y_Bolivia_inauguran_Encuentro_Presidencial_y_III_Gabinete_Binacional_Perú-Bolivia_(36962597345)_(cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Former President, [[Evo Morales]]]]
[[Evo Morales]] won the [[ presidential election, 2005|2005 presidential election]] with 53.7% of the votes. On 1 May 2006, Morales announced his intent to [[ gas conflict|re-nationalize  hydrocarbon assets]] following protests which demanded this action. Fulfilling a campaign promise, on 6 August 2006, Morales opened the [[ Constituent Assembly]] to begin writing a new constitution aimed at giving more power to the indigenous majority.

2009 marked the creation of a new constitution and the renaming of the country to the Plurinational State of . The previous constitution did not allow a consecutive reelection of a president, but the new constitution allowed for just one reelection, starting the dispute if Evo Morales was enabled to run for a second term arguing he was elected under the last constitution. This also triggered a new general election in which Evo Morales was re-elected with 61.36% of the vote. His party, [[Movement for Socialism ()|Movement for Socialism]], also won a two-thirds majority in both houses of the [[National Congress of |National Congress]]. By 2013, after being reelected under the new constitution, Evo Morales and his party attempted a third term as President of . The opposition argued that a third term would be unconstitutional, but the  Constitutional Court ruled that Morales' first term under the previous constitution did not count towards his term limit. This allowed Evo Morales to run for a third term in 2014, and he was re-elected with 64.22% of the vote. During his third term, Evo Morales began to plan for a fourth, and the [[2016  constitutional referendum]] asked voters to override the constitution and allow Evo Morales to run for an additional term in office. Morales narrowly lost the referendum; however, in 2017 his party then petitioned the  Constitutional Court to override the constitution on the basis that the [[ Convention on Human Rights]] made term limits a human rights violation. The [[Inter- Court of Human Rights]] determined that term limits are not a human rights violation in 2018; however, once again the  Constitutional Court ruled that Morales has permission to run for a fourth term in the 2019 elections, and this permission was not retracted. "[T]he country's highest court overruled the constitution, scrapping term limits altogether for every office. Morales can now run for a fourth term in 2019 – and for every election thereafter."

The revenues generated by the partial [[nationalization]] of hydrocarbons made it possible to finance several social measures: the Renta Dignidad (or old age minimum) for people over 60 years old; the Juana Azurduy voucher (named after the revolutionary Juana Azurduy de Padilla, 1780–1862), which ensures the complete coverage of medical expenses for pregnant women and their children in order to fight infant mortality; the Juancito Pinto voucher (named after a child hero of the Pacific War, 1879–1884), an aid paid until the end of secondary school to parents whose children are in school in order to combat school dropout, and the Single Health System, which since 2018 has offered all  free medical care.

The reforms adopted made the  economic system the most successful and stable in the region. Between 2006 and 2019, GDP grew from $9 billion to over $40 billion, real wages increased, GDP per capita tripled, foreign exchange reserves rose, inflation was essentially eliminated, and extreme poverty fell from 38% to 15%, a 23-point drop.

==== Interim government 2019–2020 ====
{{See also|2019  general election|2019  political crisis}}

During the 2019 elections, the [[2019  general election|''Transmisión de Resultados Electorales Preliminares'' (TREP)]] (a quick count process used in Latin America as a transparency measure in electoral processes) was interrupted; at the time, Morales had a lead of 46.86 percent to Mesa's 36.72, after 95.63 percent of tally sheets were counted. Two days after the interruption, the official count showed Morales fractionally clearing the 10-point margin he needed to avoid a runoff election, with the final official tally counted as 47.08 percent to Mesa's 36.51 percent, starting a wave of protests and tension in the country.

Amidst allegations of fraud perpetrated by the Morales government, widespread [[2019  protests|protests]] were organized to dispute the election. On 10 November, the [[Organization of  States]] (OAS) released a preliminary report concluding several irregularities in the election, though these findings were heavily disputed. ''The New York Times'' reported on 7 June 2020 that the OAS analysis immediately after the 20 October election was flawed yet fuelled "a chain of events that changed the South  nation's history".

After weeks of protests, Morales resigned on national television shortly after the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces General [[Williams Kaliman]] had urged that he do so to restore "peace and stability". Opposition Senator [[Jeanine Áñez]] declared herself interim president, claiming constitutional succession after the president, vice president and both head of the legislature chambers. She was confirmed as interim president by the constitutional court who declared her succession to be constitutional and automatic. International politicians, scholars and journalists are divided between describing the event as a coup or a spontaneous social uprising against an unconstitutional fourth term. Protests to reinstate Morales as president continued becoming highly violent: burning public buses and private houses, destroying public infrastructure and harming pedestrians. The protests were met with more violence by security forces against Morales supporters after Áñez exempted police and military from criminal responsibility in operations for "the restoration of order and public stability".

In April 2020, the interim government took out a loan of more than $327&nbsp;million from the [[International Monetary Fund]] to meet the country's needs during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. New elections were scheduled for 3 May 2020. In response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]], the  electoral body, the TSE, made an announcement postponing the election. MAS reluctantly agreed with the first delay only. A date for the new election was delayed twice more, in the face of massive protests and violence. The final proposed date for the elections was 18 October 2020. Observers from the OAS, UNIORE, and the UN all reported that they found no fraudulent actions in the 2020 elections.

The [[2020  general election|general election]] had a record voter turnout of 88.4% and ended in a landslide win for MAS which took 55.1% of the votes compared to 28.8% for centrist former president Carlos Mesa. Both Mesa and Áñez conceded defeat.

==== Government of Luis Arce: 2020–2025 ====
On 8 November 2020, [[Luis Arce]] was sworn in as President of  alongside his Vice President [[David Choquehuanca]]. In February 2021, the Arce government returned an amount of around $351&nbsp;million to the IMF. This comprised a loan of $327&nbsp;million taken out by the interim government in April 2020 and interest of around $24&nbsp;million. The government said it returned the loan to protect 's economic sovereignty and because the conditions attached to the loan were unacceptable.

The [[Ubeidiya prehistoric site]] in northern  shows the [[Early expansions of hominins out of Africa|presence of archaic humans]] around 1.5 million years ago. The second-oldest evidence of [[anatomically modern human]]s [[Recent African origin of modern humans|outside Africa]] is a 200,000-year-old fossil from [[Misliya Cave]] on Mount Carmel. The [[Natufian culture]] ({{circa}} 10,000 BCE) may be linked to the [[Proto-Afroasiatic language]] and is notable for adopting [[sedentism]] before the [[Origins of agriculture in West Asia|advent of agriculture]] and the [[Neolithic Revolution]].

[[File:Ruins atop Tel Megiddo with circular altar-like shrine and a series of temples on top of the other dating from the early bronze-age through the iron-age periods, Tel Meggido,  (19888642855).jpg|thumb|[[Tel Megiddo]], the ruins of a Canaanite and later Israelite city]]
Early references to "[[Canaan]]" and "Canaanites" appear in ancient [[Ancient Near East|Near Eastern]] and [[Ancient |]] texts ({{Circa}} 2000 BCE); these populations were structured as politically independent [[city-state]]s. During the [[Late Bronze Age]] (1550–1200 BCE), large parts of Canaan formed [[vassal state]]s of the [[New Kingdom of ]]. As a result of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]], Canaan fell into chaos, and  control over the region collapsed. Ancestors of the [[Israelites]] are thought to have included [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] native to this area.{{rp|78–79}} Modern archaeological accounts suggest that the Israelites and their culture branched out of the Canaanite peoples through the development of a distinct [[Monolatry|monolatristic]]—and later [[Monotheism|monotheistic]]—religion centered on [[Yahweh]]. They spoke an archaic form of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], known as [[Biblical Hebrew]]. Around the same time, the [[Philistines]] settled on the southern [[ coastal plain|coastal plain]].{{sfn|Killebrew|2005|p=230}}{{sfn|Shahin|2005|p=6}}

Most modern scholars agree that the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] narrative in the [[Torah]] and [[Old Testament]] did not take place as depicted; however, some elements of these traditions do have [[Historicity of the Bible|historical roots]]. There is debate about the earliest existence of the [[History of ancient  and Judah|Kingdoms of  and Judah]] and their extent and power. While it is unclear if there was a [[Kingdom of  (united monarchy)| of ]], historians and archaeologists agree that the northern [[Kingdom of  (Samaria)|Kingdom of ]] existed by {{Abbr|ca.|circa}} 900 BCE{{rp|169–195}} and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] by {{Abbr|ca.|circa}} 850 BCE. The Kingdom of  was the more prosperous of the two and soon developed into a regional power, with a capital at [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]]; during the [[Omrides|Omride dynasty]], it controlled [[Samaria]], [[Galilee]], the upper [[ Valley]], the [[Sharon plain|plain of Sharon]] and large parts of [[ (region)|]].

The Kingdom of  was conquered around 720 BCE by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]. The Kingdom of Judah, under [[Davidic line|Davidic]] rule with its capital in [[Jerusalem]], later became a [[client state]] of first the Neo-Assyrian Empire and then the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]. It is estimated that [[Demographic history of  (region)|the region's population]] was around 400,000 in the [[Iron Age II]]. In 587/6 BCE, following a [[Judah's revolts against Babylon|revolt in Judah]], King [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|besieged and destroyed Jerusalem]] and [[Solomon's Temple]], dissolved the kingdom and [[Babylonian captivity|exiled much of the Judean elite to Babylon]].

=== Classical antiquity ===
{{Main|Second Temple period}}
After [[Fall of Babylon|capturing Babylon]] in 539 BCE, [[Cyrus the Great]], founder of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], issued [[Edict of Cyrus|a proclamation]] allowing the exiled Judean population to return. The construction of the [[Second Temple]] was completed {{Circa|520 BCE}}. The Achaemenids ruled the region as the province of [[Yehud Medinata]]. In 332 BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the region as part of his [[Wars of Alexander the Great|campaign against the Achaemenid Empire]]. After his death, the area was controlled by the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] and [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] empires as a part of [[Coele-]]. Under the Hellenistic kingdoms, ongoing [[Hellenization]] generated cultural tensions among the Jewish population that culminated under [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]], whose decrees outlawed Jewish practices and triggered the [[Maccabean Revolt]] in 167 BCE. The revolt weakened Seleucid control over Judea; by 142/141 BCE the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmoneans]] had secured autonomy and soon established an [[Hasmonean Judea|independent Jewish kingdom]] that, in the late 2nd–early 1st century BCE, expanded into neighboring territories.

[[File:-2013-Aerial 21-Masada.jpg|thumb|upright|View of the [[Masada]] fortress overlooking the [[Dead Sea]], which is the location of a [[Siege of Masada|1st-century Roman siege]]]]
The [[Roman Republic]] invaded the region in 63 BCE, first [[Third Mithridatic War|taking control of ]], and then intervening in the [[Hasmonean civil war]]. [[Roman–Parthian Wars|The struggle]] between pro-Roman and pro-[[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] factions in Judea led to the installation of [[Herod the Great]] as a [[Herodian dynasty|dynastic vassal]] of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. In 6 CE, the area was annexed as the [[Judaea (Roman province)|Roman province of Judaea]]; tensions with Roman rule led to a series of [[Jewish–Roman wars]], resulting in widespread destruction. The [[First Jewish–Roman War]] (66–73 CE) resulted in the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple]] and a sizable portion of the population being killed or displaced.

A second uprising known as the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] (132–136 CE) initially allowed the Jews to form an independent state, but the Romans brutally crushed the rebellion, devastating and depopulating Judea's countryside. Jerusalem was rebuilt as a [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colony]] ([[Aelia Capitolina]]), and the province of Judea was renamed [[ Palaestina]]. Jews were expelled from the districts surrounding Jerusalem. Nevertheless, there was a continuous small Jewish presence, and Galilee became its religious center.

=== Late antiquity and the medieval period ===
{{further|Byzantine |Bilad al-Sham|Kingdom of Jerusalem}}
[[File:Ruins of the Ancient Synagogue at Bar'am.jpg|thumb|3rd-century [[Kfar Bar'am synagogue]] in the Galilee]]
During the [[Byzantine |Byzantine period]], [[Early Christianity]] displaced [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman paganism]] in the 4th century CE, with [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] embracing and promoting the Christian religion and [[Theodosius I]] making it [[Christianity as the Roman state religion|the state religion]]. A series of laws were passed that discriminated against Jews and Judaism, and Jews were persecuted by both the church and the authorities. Many Jews had emigrated to flourishing [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] communities, while locally there was both Christian immigration and local conversion. By the middle of the 5th century, there was a Christian majority. Towards the end of the 5th century, [[Samaritan revolts]] erupted, continuing until the late 6th century and resulting in a large decrease in the Samaritan population. After the [[Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem]] and the short-lived [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius]] in 614 CE, the Byzantine Empire [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628|reconsolidated control of the area]] in 628.

In 634–641 CE, the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|conquered the Levant]]. Caliph [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] ({{Reign|634|644}}) lifted the Christian ban on Jews entering [[Jerusalem]] and permitted them to worship there. Over the next six centuries, control of the region transferred between the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]], [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]], and [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] caliphates, and subsequently the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] and [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] dynasties. The population drastically decreased during the following several centuries, dropping from an estimated 1 million during Roman and Byzantine periods to about 300,000 by the early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman period]], and there was steady [[Arabization|Arabisation]] and [[Islamization|Islamisation]]. The end of the 11th century brought the [[Crusades]], [[Pope|papally]]-sanctioned incursions of Christian crusaders intent on wresting Jerusalem and the [[Holy Land]] from Muslim control and establishing [[crusader states]]. The Ayyubids pushed back the crusaders before Muslim rule was fully restored by the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk sultans of ]] in 1291.

In 1516, the Ottoman Empire conquered the region and ruled it as part of [[Ottoman ]]. Two violent incidents took place against Jews, the [[1517 Safed attacks]] and the [[1517 Hebron attacks]], after the  Ottomans ousted the [[Mamluk]]s during the [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–1517)|Ottoman–Mamluk War]]. Under the Ottoman Empire, the Levant was fairly cosmopolitan, with religious freedoms for [[People of the Book|Christians, Muslims, and Jews]]. In 1561 the [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Ottoman sultan]] invited [[Sephardic Jews]] escaping the [[ Inquisition]] to settle in and rebuild the city of [[Tiberias]].

Under the Ottoman Empire's [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]], Christians and Jews were considered ''[[dhimmi]]'' ("protected") under [[Ottoman law]] in exchange for loyalty to the state and payment of the ''[[jizya]]'' tax. Non-Muslim Ottoman subjects faced geographic and lifestyle restrictions, though these were not always enforced. The millet system organised non-Muslims into autonomous communities on the basis of religion.

The [[Return to Zion|concept of an eventual return to Zion]] remained a symbol within religious Jewish belief which emphasised that their return should be determined by [[Divine providence in Judaism|Divine Providence]] rather than human action.{{sfn|Avineri|2017}} The Jewish population of  from the Ottoman rule to the beginning of the Zionist movement, known as the [[Old Yishuv]], comprised a minority and fluctuated in size. During the 16th century, Jewish communities struck roots in the [[Four Holy Cities]]—Jerusalem, Tiberias, [[Hebron]], and [[Safed]]—and in 1697, Rabbi Yehuda Hachasid led 1,500 Jews to Jerusalem. A 1660 [[Druze power struggle (1658–1667)# and Galilee campaign|Druze revolt]] against the Ottomans destroyed [[1660 destruction of Safed|Safed]] and [[1660 destruction of Tiberias|Tiberias]]. In the second half of the 18th century, Eastern European Jews who were [[Misnagdim|opponents]] of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]], known as the [[Perushim]], settled in .

In the late 18th century, local Arab Sheikh [[Zahir al-Umar]] created a de facto independent emirate in the Galilee. Ottoman attempts to subdue the sheikh failed. After Zahir's death the Ottomans regained control of the area. In 1799, governor [[Jazzar Pasha]] repelled an [[Siege of Acre (1799)|assault on Acre]] by [[Napoleon]]'s troops, prompting the  to abandon the  campaign. In 1834, a [[Peasants' revolt in |revolt by  Arab peasants]] against  conscription and taxation policies under [[Muhammad Ali of |Muhammad Ali]] was suppressed; Muhammad Ali's army retreated and Ottoman rule was restored with  support in 1840. The [[Tanzimat]] reforms were implemented across the Ottoman Empire.

The first wave of modern Jewish migration to [[Southern |Ottoman-ruled ]], known as the [[First Aliyah]], began in 1881, as Jews fled [[pogrom]]s in Eastern Europe. The 1882 [[May Laws]] increased economic discrimination against Jews, and restricted where they could live. In response, political [[Zionism]] took form, a movement that sought to establish a [[Jewish state]] in , thus offering a solution to the [[Jewish question]] of the European states.{{sfn|Herzl|1946|p=11}}{{better source needed|date=September 2024}} Antisemitism, pogroms and official policies in tsarist  led to the emigration of three million Jews in the years between 1882 and 1914, only 1% of whom went to . Those who went to  were driven primarily by ideas of self-determination and Jewish identity, rather than as a response to pogroms or economic insecurity.{{sfn|Avineri|2017}}

The [[Second Aliyah]] (1904–1914) began after the [[Kishinev pogrom]]; some 40,000 Jews settled in , although nearly half left eventually. Both the first and second waves of migrants were mainly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]]. The Second Aliyah included [[Labor Zionism|Zionist socialist]] groups who established the ''[[kibbutz]]'' movement based on the idea of establishing a separate Jewish economy based exclusively on Jewish labour.{{sfn|Romano|2003|p=30}} Those of the Second Aliyah who became leaders of the [[Yishuv]] in the coming decades believed that the Jewish settler economy should not depend on Arab labour. This would be a dominant source of antagonism with the Arab population, with the new Yishuv's nationalist ideology overpowering its socialist one. Though the immigrants of the Second Aliyah largely sought to create communal Jewish agricultural settlements, [[Tel Aviv]] was established as the first planned Jewish town in 1909. Jewish armed militias emerged during this period, the first being [[Bar-Giora (organization)|Bar-Giora]] in 1907. Two years later, the larger [[Hashomer]] organisation was founded as its replacement.

[[Chaim Weizmann]]'s efforts to garner  support for the Zionist movement eventually secured the [[Balfour Declaration]] of 1917, stating Britain's support for the creation of a Jewish "[[Homeland for the Jewish people|national home]]" in . Weizmann's interpretation of the declaration was that negotiations on the future of the country were to happen directly between Britain and the Jews, excluding Arabs. [[Islamic–Jewish relations|Jewish-Arab relations]] in  deteriorated dramatically in the following years.

In 1918, the [[Jewish Legion]], primarily Zionist volunteers, assisted in the  [[Sinai and  campaign|conquest of ]]. In 1920, the territory was divided between Britain and  under the [[League of Nations mandate|mandate system]], and the -administered area (including modern ) was named [[Mandatory ]]. Arab opposition to  rule and Jewish immigration led to the [[1920 Nebi Musa riots|1920  riots]] and the formation of a Jewish militia known as the [[Haganah]] as an outgrowth of Hashomer, from which the [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] paramilitaries later split. In 1922, the [[League of Nations]] granted Britain the [[Mandate for ]] under terms which included the Balfour Declaration with its promise to the Jews and with similar provisions regarding the Arab .

The [[Third Aliyah|Third]] (1919–1923) and [[Fourth Aliyah]]s (1924–1929) brought an additional 100,000 Jews to . The [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|rise of Nazism]] and the increasing persecution of Jews in 1930s Europe led to the [[Fifth Aliyah]], with an influx of a quarter of a million Jews. This was a major cause of the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in |Arab revolt of 1936–39]], which was suppressed by  security forces and Zionist militias. Several hundred  security personnel and Jews were killed; 5,032 Arabs were killed, 14,760 wounded, and 12,622 detained. An estimated ten percent of the adult male [[ people| Arab]] population was killed, wounded, imprisoned, or exiled.

With countries around the world turning away Jewish refugees fleeing [[the Holocaust]], a clandestine movement known as [[Aliyah Bet]] was organised to bring Jews to . By the end of [[World War II]], 31% of the population of  was Jewish. The UK found itself facing a [[Jewish insurgency in Mandatory |Jewish insurgency]] over immigration restrictions and continued conflict with the Arab community over limit levels. The Haganah joined Irgun and Lehi in an armed struggle against  rule.{{sfn|Fraser|2004|p=27}} The Haganah attempted to bring tens of thousands of Jewish refugees and [[Holocaust survivors]] to  by ship. Most of the ships were intercepted by the [[Royal Navy]] and the refugees placed in detention camps in [[Atlit detainee camp|Atlit]] and [[ internment camps|]].

On 22 July 1946, Irgun [[King David Hotel bombing|bombed the  administrative headquarters]] for , killing 91. The attack was a response to [[Operation Agatha]] (a series of raids, including one on the [[Jewish Agency for |Jewish Agency]], by the ) and was the deadliest directed at the  during the Mandate era. The Jewish insurgency continued throughout 1946 and 1947 despite concerted efforts by the  military and [[ Police Force]] to suppress it.

 efforts to mediate with Jewish and Arab representatives were not successful as the Jews were unwilling to accept any solution that did not involve a Jewish state and suggested a partition of  into Jewish and Arab states, while the Arabs were adamant that a Jewish state in any part of  was unacceptable and that the only solution was a unified  under Arab rule. In February 1947, the  referred the  issue to the newly formed [[United Nations]].

The Report of the Committee [[United Nations Partition Plan for |proposed a plan]] to replace the  Mandate with "an independent Arab State, an independent Jewish State, and the City of Jerusalem [...] the last to be under an International Trusteeship System".

Meanwhile, the Jewish insurgency continued and peaked in July 1947, with a series of widespread guerrilla raids culminating in [[the Sergeants affair]], in which the Irgun took two  sergeants hostage as attempted leverage against the planned execution of three Irgun operatives. After the executions were carried out, the Irgun killed the two  soldiers, hanged their bodies from trees, and left a booby trap at the scene which injured a  soldier. The incident caused widespread outrage in the UK. In September 1947, the  cabinet decided to evacuate  as the Mandate was no longer tenable.

On 29 November 1947, the General Assembly adopted [[United Nations Partition Plan for |Resolution 181 (II)]]. The plan attached to the resolution was essentially that proposed in the report of 3 September. The Jewish Agency, the recognised representative of the Jewish community, accepted the plan, which assigned 55–56% of Mandatory  to the Jews. At the time, the Jews were about a third of the population and owned around 6–7% of the land. Arabs constituted the majority and owned about 20% of the land, with the remainder held by the Mandate authorities or foreign landowners.

The [[Arab League]] and [[Arab Higher Committee]] of  rejected the partition plan on the basis that the partition plan privileged European interests over those of the , and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|pp=40–41}} On 1 December 1947, the Arab Higher Committee proclaimed a three-day strike, and [[1947 Jerusalem riots|riots broke out in Jerusalem]]. The situation spiralled into [[1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory |a civil war]]. Colonial Secretary [[Arthur Creech Jones]] announced that the  Mandate would end on 15 May 1948, at which point the  would evacuate. As Arab militias and gangs attacked Jewish areas, they were faced mainly by the Haganah as well as the smaller Irgun and Lehi.

The latter engaged in clandestine operations in countries, particularly in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, where the lives of Jews were in danger and exit was difficult. Mossad LeAliyah Bet was disbanded in 1953. The immigration was in accordance with the [[One Million Plan]]. Some immigrants held Zionist beliefs or came for the promise of a better life, while others moved to escape persecution or were expelled from their homes.

An [[Aliyah#Early statehood (1948–1960)|influx of Holocaust survivors]] and [[Jewish exodus from the Muslim world|Jews from Arab and Muslim countries]] to  during the first three years increased the number of Jews from 700,000 to 1,400,000. By 1958, the population had risen to two million. Between 1948 and 1970, approximately 1,150,000 Jewish refugees relocated to . Some immigrants arrived as refugees and were housed in temporary camps known as ''[[ma'abarot]]''; by 1952, over 200,000 people were living in these tent cities. [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jews of European background]] were often treated more favourably than Jews from [[Mizrahi Jews|Middle Eastern]] and [[Sephardi Jews|North African]] countries—housing units reserved for the latter were often re-designated for the former, so Jews newly arrived from Arab lands generally ended up staying longer in transit camps.{{sfn|Segev|2007|pp=155–157}} During this period, food, clothes and furniture were rationed in what became known as the [[Austerity in |austerity period]].

On 11 March 1978, a PLO guerilla raid from  led to the [[Coastal Road massacre]].  responded by launching an [[1978 South  conflict|invasion of southern ]] to destroy PLO bases. Begin's government meanwhile provided incentives for [[ settlement| to settle]] in the [[ occupation of the West Bank|occupied West Bank]], increasing friction with the  there.

The 1980 [[Jerusalem Law]] was believed by some to reaffirm 's 1967 annexation of Jerusalem by government decree and [[UN Security Council Resolution 478|reignited international controversy]] over the [[Status of Jerusalem|status of the city]]. No  legislation has defined the territory of , and no act specifically included East Jerusalem therein. In 1981  [[Golan Heights Law|effectively annexed]] the Golan Heights.

Around ~1.8-million-year-old stone artifacts from Ain Hanech () were considered to represent the oldest archaeological materials in North Africa. Stone artifacts and cut-marked bones that were excavated from two nearby deposits at Ain Boucherit are estimated to be ~1.9&nbsp;million years old, and even older stone artifacts to be as old as ~2.4&nbsp;million years. Hence, the Ain Boucherit evidence shows that ancestral hominins inhabited the Mediterranean fringe in northern Africa much earlier than previously thought. The evidence strongly argues for early dispersal of stone tool manufacture and use from East Africa, or a possible multiple-origin scenario of stone technology in both East and North Africa.

Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] and [[Mousterian]] styles (43,000 BC) similar to those in the [[Levant]].  was the site of the highest state of development of [[Middle Paleolithic]] [[Flake tool]] techniques. Tools of this era, starting about 30,000 BC, are called [[Aterian]] (after the archaeological site of [[Bir el Ater]], south of [[Tébessa|Tebessa]]).

The earliest blade industries in North Africa are called [[Iberomaurusian]] (located mainly in the [[Oran]] region). This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the [[Maghreb]] between 15,000 and 10,000 BC. [[neolithic|Neolithic civilisation]] (animal domestication and agriculture) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghreb perhaps as early as 11,000 BC or as late as between 6000 and 2000 BC. This life, richly depicted in the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] paintings, predominated in  until the classical period. The mixture of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called [[Berber people|Berbers]], who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa.

From their principal center of power at [[Carthage]], the [[Carthaginians]] expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a [[Phoenicia]]n presence existed at [[Tipasa]], east of [[Cherchell]], [[Hippo Regius]] (modern [[Annaba]]) and [[Rusicade]] (modern [[Skikda]]). These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.

As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. Berber civilisation was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organisation supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.

By the early 4th century BC, The north is divided into two [[Masaesyli|Masaesyli kingdom]] in west led by [[Syphax]] and [[Massylii|Massylii kingdom]] in east. Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army. In the [[Mercenary War|Revolt of the Mercenaries]], Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]]. They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name , used in  to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]].

In 146 BC, the city of [[Carthage]] was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay [[Mauretania]], which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in modern-day [[]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilisation, unequalled until the coming of the [[Almohads]] and [[Almoravids]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC.

After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Masinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].

For several centuries  was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region.  is home to the second-largest number of Roman sites and remains after . Rome, after getting rid of its powerful rival Carthage in the year 146 BC, decided a century later to include Numidia to become the new master of North Africa. They built more than 500 cities. Like the rest of North Africa,  was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products. [[Augustine of Hippo| Augustine]] was the bishop of [[Hippo Regius]] (modern-day Annaba, ), located in the Roman province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. The Germanic [[Vandals]] of [[Geiseric]] moved into North Africa in 429, and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia.When the Byzantines arrived, [[Leptis Magna]] was abandoned and the Msellata region was occupied by the indigenous [[Amazigh|Laguatan]] who  facilitated an [[Amazigh]] political, military and cultural revival. During the rule of the Romans, Byzantines, Vandals, Carthaginians, and Ottomans the Berber people were  one of the few in North Africa who remained independent. The Berber people were so resistant that even during the Muslim conquest of North Africa they still had control and possession over their mountains.

The collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] led to the establishment of a native Kingdom based in [[Altava]] (modern-day ) known as the [[Mauro-Roman Kingdom]]. It was succeeded by another Kingdom based in Altava, the [[Kingdom of Altava]]. During the reign of [[Kusaila]] its territory extended from the region of modern-day [[Fez, |Fez]] in the west to the western [[Aurès]] and later [[Kairouan|Kairaouan]] and the interior of Ifriqiya in the east.

After negligible resistance from the locals, [[Muslims|Muslim]] [[Arabs]] of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] conquered  in the early 8th century.

Large numbers of the indigenous Berber people converted to Islam. Christians, Berber and Latin speakers remained in the great majority in  until the end of the 9th century and Muslims only became a vast majority some time in the 10th. After the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate, numerous local dynasties emerged, including the [[Rustamids]], [[Aghlabids]], [[Fatimids]], [[Zirids]], [[Hammadids]], [[Almoravids]], [[Almohads]] and the [[Abdalwadid|Zayyanids]]. The Christians left in three waves: after the initial conquest, in the 10th century and the 11th. The last were evacuated to [[Sicily]] by the [[Normans]] and the few remaining died out in the 14th century.

During the [[Middle Ages]], North Africa was home to the Jewish scholar [[Judah ibn Kuraishi]], the first grammarian to write about Semitic and Berber languages, as well as the  [[Sufism|Sufi]] masters [[Abu Madyan|Sidi Boumediene (Abu Madyan)]] and [[Sidi El Houari]], and the Emirs [[Abd al-Mu'min|Abd Al Mu'min]] and [[Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan|Yāghmūrasen]]. It was during this time that the [[Fatimids]] or children of [[Fatima]], daughter of [[Muhammad]], came to the [[Maghreb]]. These "Fatimids" went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, [[Hejaz]] and the [[Levant]], boasting a secular inner government, as well as a powerful army and navy, made up primarily of [[Arabs]] and [[Levant]]ines extending from  to their capital state of [[Cairo]]. The [[Fatimid caliphate]] began to collapse when its governors the [[Zirids]] seceded. To punish them the Fatimids sent the Arab [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] against them. The resultant war is recounted in the epic [[Taghribat Bani Hilal|Tāghribāt]]. In Al-Tāghrībāt the Amazigh Zirid Hero [[Khalifa al-Zanati|Khālīfā Al-Zānatī]] asks daily, for duels, to defeat the Hilalan hero [[Abu Zayd al-Hilali|Ābu Zayd al-Hilalī]] and many other Arab knights in a string of victories. The [[Zirid]]s, however, were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of Arab customs and culture. The indigenous [[Berber people|Amazigh]] tribes, however, remained largely independent, and depending on tribe, location and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times unifying it (as under the Fatimids). The Fatimid Islamic state, also known as [[Fatimid Caliphate]] made an Islamic empire that included North Africa, Sicily, [[ (region)|]], [[]], [[]], [[]], [[]], the [[Red Sea]] coast of Africa, Tihamah, [[Hejaz]] and [[]]. Caliphates from Northern Africa traded with the other empires of their time, as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the Islamic Era.

The [[Berber people]] historically consisted of several tribes. The two main branches were the Botr and Barnès tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, [[Sanhadja]], [[Houara]], [[Zenata]], [[Masmuda|Masmouda]], [[Kutama]], Awarba, and [[Berghwata]]). All these tribes made independent territorial decisions.

Several [[Berber people|Amazigh]] dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in the Maghreb and other nearby lands. [[Ibn Khaldun]] provides a table summarising the Amazigh dynasties of the Maghreb region, the [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]], [[Emirate of Tlemcen|Ifranid]], [[Maghrawid Dynasty|Maghrawa]], [[Almoravid]], [[Hammadid]], [[Almohad]], [[Merinid]], [[Zayyanid dynasty|Abdalwadid]], [[Wattasid]], [[Meknassa]] and [[Hafsid]] dynasties. Both of the [[Hammadid]] and [[Zirid]] empires as well as the [[Fatimid]]s established their rule in all of the Maghreb countries. The [[Zirid dynasty|Zirids]] ruled land in what is now , , , , ,  and . The [[Hammadid dynasty|Hammadids]] captured and held important regions such as Ouargla, Constantine, Sfax, Susa, Algiers, Tripoli and Fez establishing their rule in every country in the Maghreb region. The [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] which was created and established by the Kutama Berbers conquered all of North Africa as well as Sicily and parts of the Middle East.

[[File:Maghrawa dynasty - dynastie maghraoua.jpg|thumb|Territories controlled by the [[Maghrawid Dynasty|Maghrawa]]]]
Following the Berber revolt numerous independent states emerged across the Maghreb. In  the [[Rustamid dynasty|Rustamid Kingdom]] was established. The Rustamid realm stretched from Tafilalt in  to the Nafusa mountains in  including south, central and western  therefore including territory in all of the modern day Maghreb countries, in the south the Rustamid realm expanded to the modern borders of [[]] and included territory in [[]].

Once extending their control over all of the Maghreb, part of  and briefly over Sicily, originating from modern , the [[Zirids]] only controlled modern [[Ifriqiya]] by the 11th century. The Zirids recognised nominal suzerainty of the Fatimid caliphs of Cairo. [[Al-Mu'izz ibn Badis|El Mu'izz]] the Zirid ruler decided to end this recognition and declared his independence. The Zirids also fought against other Zenata Kingdoms, for example the [[Maghrawa]], a Berber dynasty originating from  and which at one point was a dominant power in the Maghreb ruling over much of  and western  including Fez, [[Sijilmasa]], [[Aghmat]], [[Oujda]], most of the Sous and Draa and reaching as far as M'sila and the Zab in .

As the Fatimid state was at the time too weak to attempt a direct invasion, they found another means of revenge. Between the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]] were living [[Bedouin]] nomad tribes expelled from [[Arabia]] for their disruption and turbulency. The [[Banu Hilal]] and the [[Banu Sulaym]] for example, who regularly disrupted farmers in the [[Nile Valley]] since the nomads would often loot their farms. The then [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] vizier decided to destroy what he could not control, and broke a deal with the chiefs of these Bedouin tribes. The Fatimids even gave them money to leave.

Whole tribes set off with women, children, elders, animals and camping equipment. Some stopped on the way, especially in [[Cyrenaica]], where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in [[Ifriqiya]] by the [[Gabès Governorate|Gabe]]s region, arriving 1051. The [[Zirid]] ruler tried to stop this rising tide, but with each encounter, the last under the walls of [[Kairouan]], his troops were defeated and the Arabs remained masters of the battlefield. The Arabs usually did not take control over the cities, instead looting them and destroying them.
[[File:Mosquée de Mansourah, Tlemcen, 2024.jpg|thumb|[[Mansourah Mosque]], Tlemcen]]
The invasion kept going, and in 1057 the Arabs spread on the high plains of [[Constantine, |Constantine]] where they encircled the [[Beni Hammad Fort|Qalaa of Banu Hammad]] (capital of the [[Hammadid dynasty|Hammadid Emirate]]), as they had done in Kairouan a few decades ago. From there they gradually gained the upper [[Algiers]] and [[Oran]] plains. Some of these territories were forcibly taken back by the [[Almohads]] in the second half of the 12th century. The influx of [[Bedouin]] tribes was a major factor in the linguistic, cultural [[Arabization|Arabisation]] of the Maghreb and in the spread of [[nomad]]ism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant. [[Ibn Khaldun]] noted that the lands ravaged by the [[Banu Hilal]] tribes had become completely arid desert.

The [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] originating from modern day , although founded by a man originating from modern day  known as [[Abd al-Mu'min]] would soon take control over the Maghreb. During the time of the Almohad Dynasty [[Abd al-Mu'min]]'s tribe, the Koumïa, were the main supporters of the throne and the most important body of the empire. Defeating the weakening [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid Empire]] and taking control over  in 1147, they pushed into  in 1152, taking control over Tlemcen, Oran, and Algiers, wrestling control from the Hilian Arabs, and by the same year they defeated Hammadids who controlled Eastern .

Following their decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] in 1212, the Almohads began to collapse. In 1235, the governor of modern-day western , [[Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan]], declared independence and established the [[Kingdom of Tlemcen]] under the [[Zayyanid dynasty]]. After warring with the Almohads for 13 years, the Zayyanids decisively defeated them in 1248 by ambushing and killing the Almohad caliph near Oujda.

[[File:Maghreb 15th Century.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Kingdom of Tlemcen|Zayyanid kingdom]] of Tlemcen in the fifteenth century and its neighbours]]
The Zayyanids retained control over much of  for the next three centuries. While eastern  largely fell under the [[Hafsid dynasty]], the [[Hafsids of Bejaïa|Emirate of Bejaia]], which encompassed the Hafsid territories in , was at times independent from central  authority. At their peak, the Zayyanids held  as a western vassal expanded eastward as far as [[Tunis]], which was captured during the reign of Abu Tashfin.

Following several conflicts with local [[Barbary pirates]] sponsored by the Zayyanid sultans,  launched a campaign to invade  and defeat the Kingdom of Tlemcen. In 1505,  forces [[Capture of Mers-el-Kébir (1505)|invaded and captured Mers el Kébir]], and in 1509, they [[ conquest of Oran (1509)|conquered Oran]] after a deadly siege. Following their decisive victories over the  in the western-coastal areas of , the  expanded their campaign across the western  coast. In 1510, they captured Bejaia after [[Capture of Bejaia (1510)|a major siege]], launched an assault on Algiers, and besieged Tlemcen. In 1511, they seized [[Cherchell]] and [[Jijel]], and attacked [[Mostaganem]], which they failed to conquer but succeeded in forcing into tribute.

=== Early modern era ===
{{main|Regency of Algiers}}
[[File:Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hayreddin Barbarossa]]]]
In 1516, the  privateer brothers [[Aruj]] and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], who operated successfully under the [[Hafsids]], moved their base of operations to Algiers. They succeeded in conquering Jijel and Algiers from the [[|Spaniards]] with help from the locals who saw them as liberators from the Christians, but the brothers eventually assassinated the local noble Salim al-Tumi and took control over the city and the surrounding regions. Their state is known as the [[Regency of Algiers]]. When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his [[Fall of Tlemcen (1518)|invasion of Tlemcen]], [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Hayreddin]] succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|sultan]] gave him the title of [[beylerbey]] and a contingent of some 2,000 [[janissaries]]. With the aid of this force and native , Hayreddin conquered the whole area between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in  hands until 1792).

The next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son [[Hasan Pasha (son of Barbarossa)|Hasan]], who assumed the position in 1544. He was a [[Kouloughlis|Kouloughli]] or of mixed origins, as his mother was an  Mooresse. Until 1587 Beylerbeylik of Algiers was governed by Beylerbeys who served terms with no fixed limits. Subsequently, with the institution of a regular administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by an autonomous janissary unit, known in  as the [[Odjak of Algiers|Ojaq]] who were led by an [[Agha of the Janissaries|agha]]. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.

[[Plague (disease)|Plague]] had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost between 30,000 and 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21, and had high fatalities in 1654–57, 1665, 1691 and 1740–42.[[File:North Africa, from the "Physical And Political Map Of Africa ... 1822".png|left|thumb|Map of the Regency of Algiers in early 19th century]]
The [[Barbary pirates]] preyed on Christian and other non-Islamic shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea. The pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as [[slavery|slaves]]. They also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives. According to Robert Davis, from the 16th to 19th century, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25&nbsp;million Europeans as slaves. They often made raids on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell at [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|slave markets]] in North Africa and other parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1544, for example, [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] captured the island of [[Ischia]], taking 4,000 prisoners, and enslaved some 9,000 inhabitants of [[Lipari]], almost the entire population. In 1551, the Ottoman governor of Algiers, [[Turgut Reis]], enslaved the entire population of the  island of [[Gozo]]. Barbary pirates often attacked the [[Balearic Islands]]. The threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of [[Formentera]]. The introduction of broad-sail ships from the beginning of the 17th century allowed them to branch out into the Atlantic.

In July 1627 two pirate ships from Algiers under the command of [[ people|]] pirate [[Jan Janszoon]] sailed as far as [[History of |]], [[ Abductions|raiding and capturing slaves]]. Two weeks earlier another pirate ship from [[Sale, |Salé]] in [[Saadi dynasty|]] had also raided in . Some of the slaves brought to Algiers were later ransomed back to , but some chose to stay in . In 1629, pirate ships from  raided the [[Faroe Islands]].

In 1659, the Janissaries stationed in Algiers, known as the [[Odjak of Algiers|Odjak]] of Algiers, joined a company of corsair captains called the Reis in overthrowing the Ottoman [[viceroy]]. A new local leader was installed known as the "Agha"; the position became the "[[Dey]]" in 1671, who would be selected by the [[divan]], a council of some sixty military senior officers. Thus, Algiers became a sovereign military republic. The odjak initially dominated the system, but by the 18th century were the dey's instrument. Although Algiers remained nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, in reality it acted independently from the rest of the Empire, and often had wars with other Ottoman subjects and territories such as the [[Beylik of Tunis]].

The [[dey]] was in effect a constitutional autocrat. Though elected for a life term, over the next 159 years (1671–1830), fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of the Deylikal government was remarkably orderly. Although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest. Autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regency's authority was seldom applied in the [[Kabylie|Kabylia]], although in 1730 the Regency was able to take control of the [[Kingdom of Kuku]] in western Kabylia. Many cities in the northern  desert paid taxes to Algiers or one of its Beys.

Barbary raids in the Mediterranean continued to attack  merchant shipping, resulting in the [[ Empire]] attempting to [[Invasion of Algiers (1775)|invade Algiers in 1775]]. The [[ Navy]] bombarded the city in [[Bombardment of Algiers (1783)|1783]] but failed to pacify it; a subsequent bombing campaign in [[Bombardment of Algiers (1784)|1784]] was joined by the naval forces of other traditional enemies of Algiers, including [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of |]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of ]]. Over 20,000 cannonballs were fired, but the effort ultimately failed;  sued for peace in 1786 and paid 1&nbsp;million pesos to the Dey. In 1792, Algiers recaptured the two remaining  strongholds at Oran and Mers el Kébir. In the same year, they conquered the  [[Rif]] and [[Oujda]], which they then abandoned in 1795.

In the 19th century,  pirates remained a formidable force in the Mediterranean, even forging affiliations with Caribbean powers, paying a "license tax" in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels. Attacks on  merchantmen resulted in the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]]s, which ended the targeting of U.S. ships in 1815. A year later, a combined [[ of Great Britain and |Anglo]]-[[ of the |]] fleet, under the command of [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]], [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|bombarded Algiers]] to stop similar attacks on European fishermen. These efforts proved successful, although  piracy would continue until the [[ conquest of | conquest]] in 1830.

Under the pretext of a slight to their consul, the [[July Monarchy|]] invaded and [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830|captured Algiers]] in 1830. According to several historians, the methods used by the  to establish control over  reached [[ genocide|genocidal]] proportions. Historian [[Ben Kiernan]] wrote on the  conquest of : "By 1875, the  conquest was complete. The war had killed approximately 825,000 indigenous  since 1830".  losses from 1831 to 1851 were 92,329 dead in the hospital and only 3,336 killed in action. In 1872, The  population stood at about 2.9&nbsp;million.{{unreliable source?|date=November 2018}}  policy was predicated on "civilising" the country. The slave trade and piracy in  ceased following the  conquest. The [[ conquest of |conquest of ]] by the  took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed. A combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]]  population to decline by nearly one-third from 1830 to 1872.{{unreliable source?|date=February 2013}} On 17 September 1860, [[Napoleon III]] declared "Our first duty is to take care of the happiness of the three million Arabs, whom the fate of arms has brought under our domination." During this time, only Kabylia resisted, the Kabylians were not colonised until after the [[Mokrani Revolt]] in 1871.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] wrote and never completed an unpublished essay outlining his ideas for how to transform  from an occupied tributary state to a colonial regime, wherein he advocated for a mixed system of "total domination and total colonisation" whereby  military would wage total war against civilian populations while a colonial administration would provide rule of law and property rights to settlers within  occupied cities.

From 1848 until independence,  administered the whole Mediterranean region of  as an integral part and ''département'' of the nation. One of 's longest-held overseas territories,  became a destination for hundreds of thousands of [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigrants, who became known as ''colons'' and later, as ''[[Pied-Noir]]s.'' Between 1825 and 1847, 50,000  people emigrated to . These settlers benefited from the  government's confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land. Many Europeans settled in [[Oran]] and [[Algiers]], and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities.

During the late 19th and early 20th century, the [[White Africans of European ancestry|European share]] was almost a fifth of the population. The  government aimed at making  an assimilated part of , and this included substantial educational investments especially after 1900. The indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency, but in contrast to the other colonised countries' path in central Asia and [[Caucasus]],  kept its individual skills and a relatively human-capital intensive agriculture.

During the [[Second World War]],  came under [[Vichy |Vichy control]] before being liberated by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in [[Operation Torch]], which saw the first large-scale deployment of [[Military history of the  during World War II| troops]] in the [[North African campaign]].

Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, which lacked political and economic status under the colonial system, gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from [[Provisional Government of the  Republic|]]. In May 1945, the uprising against the occupying  forces was suppressed through what is now known as the [[Sétif and Guelma massacre]]. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the [[ War]] began after the publication of the [[Declaration of 1 November 1954]]. Historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 [[Harki]]s and their dependents were killed by the [[National Liberation Front ()|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) or by [[lynching|lynch]] mobs in . The [[National Liberation Front ()|FLN]] used hit and run attacks in  and  as part of its war, and the  conducted [[Torture during the  War of Independence|severe reprisals]]. In addition, the  destroyed over 8,000 villages and relocated over 2 million  to [[Internment camps in # War|concentration camps]].

The war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of  and hundreds of thousands of injuries. Historians, like [[Alistair Horne]] and [[Raymond Aron]], state that the actual number of  Muslim war dead was far greater than the original FLN and official  estimates but was less than the 1&nbsp;million deaths claimed by the  government after independence. Horne estimated  casualties during the span of eight years to be around 700,000. The war uprooted more than 2&nbsp;million .

The war against  rule concluded in 1962, when  gained complete independence following the March 1962 [[Evian agreements]] and the July 1962 [[ self-determination referendum, 1962|self-determination referendum]].

The number of European ''[[Pied-Noir]]s'' who fled  totalled more than 900,000 between 1962 and 1964. The exodus to mainland  accelerated after the [[Oran massacre of 1962]], in which hundreds of militants entered European sections of the city and began attacking civilians.

's first president was the Front de Libération Nationale ([[FLN ()|FLN]]) leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. 's claim to [[Greater |portions of western ]] led to the [[Sand War]] in 1963. Ben Bella was [[1965  coup d'état|overthrown in 1965]] by [[Houari Boumédiène]], his former ally and defence minister. Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly [[Socialism|socialist]] and authoritarian; Boumédienne continued this trend. However, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role. He [[collective farming|collectivised]] agriculture and launched a massive industrialisation drive. [[Extraction of petroleum|Oil extraction]] facilities were nationalised. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international [[1973 oil crisis]].

Boumédienne's successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], introduced some liberal economic reforms. He promoted a policy of [[Arabisation]] in  society and public life. Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread conventional Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to Orthodox Islam.

The  economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the [[1980s oil glut]]. Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in  social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system. Political parties developed, such as the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS), a broad coalition of Muslim groups.

In December 1991 the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] dominated the first of two rounds of [[ legislative election, 1991|legislative elections]]. Fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992, cancelling the elections. Bendjedid resigned and a [[High Council of State ()|High Council of State]] was installed to act as the Presidency. It banned the FIS, triggering a civil [[insurgency]] between the Front's armed wing, the [[Armed Islamic Group of |Armed Islamic Group]], and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 people are thought to have died. The Islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of [[List of massacres during the  Civil War|civilian massacres]].{{Failed verification|date=November 2023|reason=Graphic description of one massacre, but no mention of 100k or a "campaign"}} At several points in the conflict, the situation in  became a point of international concern, most notably during the crisis surrounding [[Air  Flight 8969]], a hijacking perpetrated by the Armed Islamic Group. The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October 1997.

 held [[ presidential election, 1999|elections in 1999]], considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups which were won by President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]]. He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a "Civil Concord" initiative, approved in a [[ Civil Concord referendum, 1999|referendum]], under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000. The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly. The [[Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat]] (GSPC), a splinter group of the Armed Islamic Group, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.

Bouteflika was re-elected in the [[ presidential election, 2004|April 2004 presidential election]] after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation. The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation. It also included a second amnesty initiative, the [[Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation]], which was approved in a [[ national reconciliation referendum, 2005|referendum in September 2005]]. It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.

In November 2008, the [[ Constitution]] was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents. This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the [[ presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]], and he was re-elected in April 2009. During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.

A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010, inspired by similar [[Arab Spring|protests across the Middle East and North Africa]]. On 24 February 2011, the government lifted 's 19-year-old [[state of emergency]]. The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties, the electoral code, and the representation of women in elected bodies. In April 2011, Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform. However, elections are routinely criticised by opposition groups as unfair and international human rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue.

On 2 April 2019, Bouteflika resigned from the presidency after [[2019–2020  protests|mass protests]] against his candidacy for a fifth term in office.

In December 2019, [[Abdelmadjid Tebboune]] became 's president, after winning the first round of the [[2019  presidential election|presidential election]] with a record abstention rate – the highest of all presidential elections since 's democracy in 1989. Tebboune is accused of being close to the military and being loyal to the deposed president. Tebboune rejects these accusations, claiming to be the victim of a witch hunt. He also reminds his detractors that he was expelled from the Government in August 2017 at the instigation of oligarchs languishing in prison. In [[2024  presidential election|September 2024]], President Tebboune won a second term with a landslide 84.3 percent of the vote, although his opponents called the results fraud.

Today there are close to a million of these manuscripts found in [[Timbuktu]] alone.]]

The rock art in the [[Sahara]] suggests that northern  has been inhabited since 10,000 BC, when the Sahara was fertile and rich in wildlife. Early ceramics have been discovered at the central  site of Ounjougou dating to about 9,400 BC, and are believed to represent an instance of the independent invention of pottery in the region. Farming took place by 5000 BC and iron was used by around 500 BC.
In the first millennium BC, early cities and towns were created by Mande peoples related to the [[Soninke people]], along the middle  River in central , including [[Dia, |Dia]] which began from around 900 BC, and reached its peak around 600 BC, and [[Djenne-Djenno]], which lasted from around 300 BC to 900 AD. Through approximately 6th century BC and 4th century BC, the lucrative trans-Saharan trade in pack-animals, gold, salt and slaves had begun, facilitating the rise of West Africa's great empires.

There are a few references to  in early Islamic literature. Among these are references to "Pene" and "Malal" in the work of [[al-Bakri]] in 1068, the story of the conversion of an early ruler, known to [[Ibn Khaldun]] (by 1397) as Barmandana, and a few geographical details in the work of [[al-Idrisi]].

 was once part of three famed West African empires which controlled [[trans-Saharan trade]] in gold, salt, other precious commodities, and [[slaves]] majorly during the reign of [[Mansa Musa]] from c. 1312 – c. 1337. These [[Sahelian kingdom]]s had neither rigid geopolitical boundaries nor rigid ethnic identities. The earliest of these empires was the [[ Empire]], which was dominated by the [[Soninke people|Soninke]], a [[Mande languages|Mande]]-speaking people. The empire expanded throughout West Africa from the eighth century until 1078, when it was conquered by the [[Almoravids]].

The [[Battle of Kirina]] in 1235, culminated in a victory for the [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] under the command of the exiled prince [[Sundiata Keita]], which led to the downfall of the [[Sosso Empire]].

The [[ Empire]] later formed on the upper [[ River]], and reached the height of power in the 14th century. Under the  Empire, the ancient cities of [[Djenné]] and [[Timbuktu]] were centers of both trade and Islamic learning. The empire later declined as a result of internal intrigue, ultimately being supplanted by the [[Songhai Empire]]. The Songhai had long been a major power in West Africa subject to the  Empire's rule.

In the late 14th century, the Songhai gradually gained independence from the  Empire and expanded, ultimately subsuming the entire eastern portion of the  Empire. The Songhai Empire's eventual collapse was largely the result of the [[Saadian invasion of the Songhai Empire| invasion]] of 1591 under the command of [[Judar Pasha]]. The fall of the Songhai Empire marked the end of the region's role as a trading crossroads. Following the [[European exploration of Africa|establishment of sea routes by the European powers]], the trans-Saharan trade routes lost significance. At that time, the  Empire's abundance in wealth expanded its commercial assets of [[salt]] and [[gold]].

One of the worst [[famine]]s in the region's recorded history occurred in the 18th century. According to [[John Iliffe (historian)|John Iliffe]], "The worst crises were in the 1680s, when famine extended from the Senegambian coast to the Upper Nile and 'many sold themselves for slaves, only to get a sustenance', and especially in 1738–1756, when West Africa's greatest recorded subsistence crisis, due to drought and locusts, reportedly killed half the population of [[Timbuktu]]."

 fell under the control of  during the [[Scramble for Africa]] in the late 19th century. By 1905, most of the area was under firm  control as a part of [[ ]]. 

In November 1915, a large [[Volta-Bani War|anti- uprising]] broke out among the tribes in the regions of present-day  and . The last resistance was suppressed only in September 1916. During the suppression of the uprising, over 100 villages were destroyed by  colonial troops.

On 24 November 1958,   (which changed its name to the  Republic) became an autonomous republic within the [[ Community]]. In January 1959,  and [[]] united to become the [[ Federation]].

=== Independence ===
The  Federation gained independence from  on 20 June 1960.  withdrew from the federation in August 1960, which allowed the  Republic to become the independent Republic of  on 22 September 1960, and that date is now the country's [[List of national independence days|Independence Day]].

[[Modibo Keïta]] was elected the first president. He quickly established a one-party state, adopted an independent African and socialist orientation with close ties to the East, and implemented extensive nationalization of economic resources. In 1960, the population of  was reported to be about 4.1&nbsp;million. On 19 November 1968, following progressive economic decline, the Keïta regime was overthrown in a bloodless military coup led by [[Moussa Traoré]], a day which is now commemorated as [[Liberation Day]].

=== Moussa Traoré regime ===
The subsequent military-led regime, with Traoré as president, attempted to reform the economy. His efforts were frustrated by political turmoil and a devastating [[Sahel drought|drought]] from 1968 to 1974, in which famine killed thousands of people. The Traoré regime faced student unrest beginning in the late 1970s and three coup attempts. The Traoré regime repressed all dissenters until the late 1980s.

[[File:Place de la liberté - Bamako.jpg|thumb|WWI Commemorative Monument to the "Armée Noire"]]

Opposition to the corrupt and dictatorial regime of General Moussa Traoré grew during the 1980s. During this time strict programs, imposed to satisfy demands of the International Monetary Fund, brought increased hardship upon the country's population, while elites close to the government supposedly lived in growing wealth. The government continued to attempt economic reforms, and the populace became increasingly dissatisfied. In response to growing demands for multi-party democracy, the Traoré regime allowed some limited political liberalization in the late 1980s, but refused to usher in a full-fledged democratic system. 

In 1990, cohesive opposition movements began to emerge, and was complicated by the turbulent rise of ethnic violence in the north following the return of many [[Tuareg people|Tuaregs]] who had migrated to [[]] and [[]] during the drought. Peaceful student protests in January 1991 were brutally suppressed, with mass arrests and torture of leaders and participants. Scattered acts of rioting and vandalism of public buildings followed, but most actions by the dissidents remained nonviolent.

From 22 March through 26 March 1991, mass pro-democracy rallies and a nationwide strike was held in both urban and rural communities, which became known as ''les évenements'' ("the events") or the March Revolution. In Bamako, in response to mass demonstrations organized by university students and later joined by trade unionists and others, soldiers opened fire indiscriminately on the nonviolent demonstrators. Riots broke out briefly following the shootings. Barricades as well as roadblocks were erected and Traoré declared a state of emergency and imposed a nightly curfew. Despite an estimated loss of 300 lives over the course of four days, nonviolent protesters continued to return to Bamako each day demanding the resignation of the dictatorial president and the implementation of democratic policies.

By 26 March, the growing refusal of soldiers to fire into the largely nonviolent protesting crowds turned into a full-scale tumult. Military soldiers clashed with peaceful protesters, resulting in the massacre of dozens under the orders of Traoré. That afternoon, Lieutenant Colonel [[Amadou Toumani Touré]] announced on the radio that he had arrested the dictatorial president, Moussa Traoré. He and three associates were, tried, convicted and received the death sentence for their role in this massacre. The date is now a national holiday in .  The coup is remembered as 's [[1991  coup d'état|March Revolution of 1991]].

=== Multi-party democracy ===
Opposition parties were legalized, a transitional government was formed and a national congress of civil and political groups met to draft a [[Constitution of |new democratic constitution]] to be approved by a national referendum. In 1992, [[Alpha Oumar Konaré]] won 's first democratic, multi-party presidential election, before being re-elected for a second term in 1997, which was the last allowed under the constitution. [[Amadou Toumani Touré]], a retired general who had been the leader of the military aspect of the 1991 democratic uprising, was elected in 2002. During this democratic period  was regarded as one of the most politically and socially stable countries in Africa.

[[Slavery in modern Africa|Slavery]] persists in  today with as many as 200,000 people held in direct servitude to a master. In the [[Tuareg Rebellion (2012)|Tuareg Rebellion of 2012]], ex-slaves were a vulnerable population with reports of some slaves being recaptured by their former masters.

In January 2012 [[Tuareg rebellion (2012)|a Tuareg rebellion]] began in northern , led by the [[National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad]] (MNLA). In March, military officer [[Amadou Sanogo]] seized power in [[2012  coup d'état|a coup d'état]], citing Touré's failures in quelling the rebellion, and leading to sanctions and an embargo by the [[Economic Community of West African States]]. The MNLA quickly took control of the north, declaring its independence as [[Azawad]]. However, Islamist groups, including [[Ansar Dine]] and [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb|Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)]], who had helped the MNLA defeat the government, turned on the Tuareg and took control of the north with the goal of implementing [[sharia]] in .

On 11 January 2013, the [[ Armed Forces]] [[Operation Serval|intervened]] at the request of the interim government of president [[Dioncounda Traoré]]. On 30 January, the coordinated advance of the  and  troops claimed to have retaken the last remaining Islamist stronghold of Kidal, which was also the last of three northern provincial capitals. On 2 February,  president [[François Hollande]] joined Dioncounda Traoré in a public appearance in recently recaptured Timbuktu.

In August 2013, [[Ibrahim Boubacar Keita]] was elected as the new [[president of ]] in the second round of [[2013  presidential election|the election]].

=== Conflict in Central  ===
In the central  province of [[Mopti Region|Mopti]], conflict has escalated since 2015 between agricultural communities like the [[Dogon people|Dogon]] and the [[Bambara people|Bambara]], and the [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] [[Fula people|Fula (or Fulani) people]]. Historically, the two sides have fought over access to land and water, factors which have been exacerbated by [[climate change]] as the Fula move into new areas. The Dogon and the Bambara communities have formed "self-defense groups" to fight the Fula. They accuse the Fula of working with armed [[Islamic terrorism|Islamists]] linked to [[al-Qaeda]]. While some Fula have joined Islamist groups, [[Human Rights Watch]] reports that the links have been "exaggerated and instrumentalized by different actors for opportunistic ends".

Added a top  military commander:<blockquote>I’ve discussed the growing violence with my commanders and with village chiefs from all sides. Yes, sure, there are jihadists in this zone, but the real problem is banditry, animal theft, score settling – people are enriching themselves using the fight against terrorists as a cover.</blockquote>

The conflict has seen the creation and growth of Dogon and Bambara militias. The government of  is suspected of supporting some of these groups under the guise of being proxies in the war against Islamists in the [[Northern  conflict]]. The government denies this. One such militia is the Dogon group [[Dan Na Ambassagou]], created in 2016.

In the [[2018  presidential election]] held on 29 July 2018, no candidate received more than 50% of the vote in the first round. A runoff was held on 12 August 2018 between the top two candidates, incumbent president [[Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta]] of the [[Rally for ]] and [[Soumaïla Cissé]] of the [[Union for the Republic and Democracy]], and Keïta was re-elected with 67% of the vote.

In September 2018, the [[Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue]] negotiated a unilateral ceasefire with Dan Na Ambassagou "in the context of the conflict which opposes the group to other community armed groups in central ". However, the group has been blamed for the [[March 2019 attacks against Fulani herders|24 March 2019 massacre of 160 Fula villagers]]. The group denied the attack, but afterwards  president Keita ordered the group to disband. The UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, [[Adama Dieng]], warned of a growing [[ethnicization]] of the conflict. By 2020, more than 600,000 people had been [[Refugee|displaced]] by the conflict in . The United Nations reported that the number of children killed in the conflict in the first six months of 2019 was twice as many for the entire year of 2018. Many of the children have been killed in intercommunal attacks attributed to ethnic militias, with the majority of attacks occurring around [[Mopti]]. It is reported that around 900 schools have closed down and that armed militias are recruiting children.

During the first week of October 2019, two jihadist attacks in the towns of Boulikessi and [[Mondoro]] killed more than 25  soldiers near the border with [[]]. President Keïta declared that "no military coup will prevail in ", continuing by saying that he does not think it "is on the agenda at all and cannot worry us". On 1 November 2019, the [[Islamic State in the Greater Sahara|IS-GS]] militants killed at least 50 soldiers in the [[2019 Indelimane attack]] in the [[Ménaka Region]] of .

Popular unrest began on 5 June 2020 following irregularities in the March and April parliamentary elections, including outrage against the kidnapping of opposition leader [[Soumaïla Cissé]]. Between 11 and 23 deaths followed protests that took place from 10 to 13 June. In July, President Keïta dissolved the constitutional court.

Members of the military led by Colonel [[Assimi Goïta]] and Colonel-Major [[Ismaël Wagué]] in [[Kati, |Kati]], [[Koulikoro Region]], began a mutiny on 18 August 2020. President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta and Prime Minister [[Boubou Cissé]] were arrested, and shortly after midnight Keïta announced his resignation, saying he did not want to see any bloodshed. Wagué announced the formation of the [[National Committee for the Salvation of the People]] (CNSP) and promised elections in the future. A curfew was begun and the streets of Bamako were quiet. The [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) condemned the coup and demanded that Keïta be reinstated as president.

On 12 September 2020, the CNSP agreed to an 18-month political transition to civilian rule. Shortly after, [[Bah Ndaw|Bah N'daw]] was named interim president by a group of 17 electors, with Goïta being appointed vice president. The government was inaugurated on 25 September 2020. On 18 January 2021, the transitional government announced that the CNSP had been disbanded, almost four months after had been promised under the initial agreement.

Tensions between the civilian transitional government and the military ran high after the handover of power in September 2020. The tensions came to a head on 24 May 2021 after a cabinet reshuffle, where two leaders of the 2020 military coup – [[Sadio Camara]] and [[Modibo Kone]] – were replaced by N'daw's administration. Later that day, journalists reported that three key civilian leaders – President N'daw, Prime Minister [[Moctar Ouane]] and Defence Minister [[Souleymane Doucouré]], were being detained in a military base in [[Kati, |Kati]], outside Bamako. On 7 June 2021, 's military commander Assimi Goïta was sworn into office as the new interim president.

On 2 May, the military government announced breaking its defence accords concluded in 2013 with , constituting an additional step in the deterioration of – relations. This latest announcement has been criticized by  authorities and considered as "illegitimate". A UN panel reported that in the first three months of 2022, 543 civilians were killed and 269 wounded, warning the 2015 peace agreement between the government and pro-independence groups was threatened by a potential risk of confrontation for the first time in five years. The report also noted a sharp increase in the number of people needing humanitarian assistance over the previous year.

Within its borders lies the ancient land of [[Sumer]], which emerged between 6000 and 5000 BC during the [[Neolithic]] [[Ubaid period]]. Sumer is recognised as the world's earliest civilisation, marking the beginning of urban development, written language, and monumental architecture. 's territory also includes the heartlands of the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]], [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Neo-Sumerian]], [[Babylonia]]n, [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]], and [[Neo-Babylonian]] empires, which dominated Mesopotamia and much of the [[Ancient Near East]] during the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages.

The  of antiquity was an innovation stronghold, producing early [[List of languages by first written accounts|written languages]], [[Sumerian literature|literary works]], and significant advancements in [[Babylonian astronomy|astronomy]], [[Babylonian mathematics|mathematics]], [[Babylonian law|law]], and [[Assyro-Babylonian literature#Philosophy|philosophy]]. This era of indigenous rule ended in 539 BC when the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] under [[Cyrus the Great]], who declared himself the "[[King of Babylon]]". The city of [[Babylon]], the ancient seat of Babylonian power, became one of the key capitals of the Achaemenid Empire. Ancient , known as the Mesopotamia, is home to world's first Jewish diaspora community, which emerged during the Babylonian exile.

The Babylonians were defeated by the Persian Empire, under the leadership of [[Cyrus the Great]]. Following the fall of Babylon, the [[Achaemenid Empire]] took control of the Mesopotamian region. Enslaved Jews were freed from the Babylonian captivity, though many remained in the land and thus the Jewish community grew in the region.  is the location of numerous Jewish sites, which are also revered by the Muslims and Christians.

In the following centuries, the regions constituting modern  came under the control of several empires, including the [[Seleucid Empire|]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], and [[Roman Empire|Romans]], establishing new centres like [[Seleucia]] and [[Ctesiphon]]. By the [[3rd century]] AD, the region fell under Persian control through the [[Sasanian Empire]], during which time Arab tribes from [[South Arabia]] migrated into Lower Mesopotamia, leading to the formation of the Sassanid-aligned [[Lakhmid kingdom]].

The Arabic name ''al-ʿIrāq'' likely originated during this period. The Sasanian Empire was eventually [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquered]] by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in the 7th century, bringing  under Islamic rule after the [[Battle of al-Qadisiyyah]] in 636. The city of [[Kufa]], founded shortly thereafter, became a central hub for the Rashidun dynasty until their [[First Fitna|overthrow]] by the [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyads]] in 661.

The campaign led to the [[Fall of Baghdad (1917)|occupation of Baghdad]] in 1917, and in 1920 Ottoman  was formally dissolved with the establishment of the [[Mandate for Mesopotamia| Mandate of Mesopotamia]].

's modern history began in the wake of World War I, as the region emerged from the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Arab forces, inspired by the promise of independence, had helped dismantle the Ottoman hold on the Middle East, but the dream of a united, sovereign Arab state was soon dashed. Despite agreements made with [[Hussein bin Ali, King of Hejaz|Hussein bin Ali]], the [[Sharif of Mecca|Sharif of Makkah]], the European powers had different plans for the region. Following the  withdrawal of support for a [[Arab state|unified Arab state]], Hussein's son, [[Faisal I of |Faisal]], briefly declared the [[Kingdom of ]] in 1920, encompassing parts of what are now [[]], [[]], [[]], and [[]]. However, the kingdom was short-lived, crushed by local opposition and the military might of , which had been granted a [[Mandatory |mandate over ]].

In , under  mandate, tensions were rising as local forces increasingly resisted foreign control. A [[ Revolt|rebellion erupted]], challenging  authority, and the need for a new strategy became clear. In 1921, the [[Cairo Conference (1921)|Cairo Conference]], led by  officials including [[Winston Churchill]] and [[T. E. Lawrence]], decided that Faisal, now exiled in [[London]], would become the [[king of ]]. This decision was seen as a way to maintain  influence in the region while placating local demands for leadership. Upon his coronation, he focused on unifying a land formerly divided into three [[Ottoman provinces]]—[[Mosul Province, Ottoman Empire|Mosul]], [[Baghdad Province, Ottoman Empire|Baghdad]], and [[Basra vilayet|Basra]]. He worked hard to gain the support of 's diverse population, including both [[Sunnis]] and [[Shiites]], and paid special attention to the country's Shiite communities, symbolically choosing the date of his coronation to coincide with [[Eid al-Ghadir|Eid al-Ghadeer]], a key day for Shiite Muslims.

His reign laid the foundations of modern . Faisal worked to establish key state institutions and fostered a sense of national identity. His education reforms included the founding of [[Ahl al-Bayt University]] in Baghdad, and he encouraged the migration of  exiles to  to serve as doctors and educators. Faisal also envisioned infrastructural links between , , and [[Emirate of |]], including plans for a railway and an [[Kirkuk–Haifa oil pipeline|oil pipeline to the Mediterranean]]. Although Faisal succeeded in securing greater autonomy for ,  influence remained strong, particularly in the country's oil industry. In 1930, [[Anglo- Treaty of 1930| signed a treaty with Britain]] that gave the country a measure of political independence while maintaining  control over key aspects, including military presence and oil rights. By 1932,  gained formal independence, becoming a member of the [[League of Nations]]. Faisal's reign was marked by his efforts to balance the pressures of external influence and internal demands for sovereignty. He was admired for his diplomatic skill and his commitment to steering  towards self-determination. Untimely, he died from a heart attack on 8 September 1933, leaving his son [[Ghazi of |Ghazi]] to inherit the throne. King Ghazi's reign was brief and turbulent, as  was impacted by numerous coup attempts. He died in a motor accident in 1939, passing the throne to his young son, [[Faisal II]], who ascended to the throne at just 3 years old. Faisal II's uncle, [[Abd al-Ilah|Crown Prince Abdullah]], assumed regency until the young king came of age.

On 1 April 1941, [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] and members of the [[Golden Square ()|Golden Square]] staged a [[1941  coup d'état|coup d'état]] and installed a [[Nazism|pro-]] and [[Fascism|pro-]] government. During the subsequent [[Anglo- War]], the [[]] invaded  for fear that the government might cut oil supplies to [[Western nations]] because of its links to the [[Axis powers]]. The war started on 2 May, and the , together with loyal [[Assyrian Levies]], defeated the forces of Al-Gaylani, forcing an armistice on 31 May. Regency of King Faisal II began in 1953. The hopes for 's future under Faisal II were high, but the nation remained divided. 's Sunni-dominated monarchy struggled to reconcile the diverse ethnic and religious groups, particularly the Shiite, Assyrian, Jewish and Kurdish populations, who felt marginalised. In 1958, these tensions culminated in a military coup, inspired by the revolutionary wave sweeping across the Arab world, particularly the [[1952  revolution]].

=== Republic and Ba'athist  ===
{{Main| Republic (1958–1968)|Ba'athist }}
[[File:Saddam_Hussein_1980.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|Saddam Hussein in 1980]]
Brigadier General and [[ nationalism|nationalist]] [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] led a coup d'état known as the [[14 July Revolution]] in 1958. This revolt was strongly anti-imperial and anti-monarchical in nature and had strong socialist elements. King [[Faysal II|Faisal II]], Prince [[Abd al-Ilah]], and [[Nuri al-Sa'id]], along with the royal family were killed brutally. Qasim controlled  through military rule and in 1958 he began a process of forcibly reducing surplus land owned by a few citizens and having the state redistribute the land. In 1959, [[Abd al-Wahab al-Shawaf]] led an uprising in Mosul against Qasim. The uprising was crushed by the government forces. He claimed [[]] as part of , when the former was granted independence in 1961. The [[Operation Vantage| deployed its army]] on the [[– border]], which forced Qasim to back down. He was overthrown by the Ba'ath Party in [[Ramadan Revolution|February 1963 coup]]. However internal division within Ba'athist factions caused another coup in November, which brought Colonel Abdul Salam Arif to power. The new regime recognised 's independence. After the latter's death in 1966, he was succeeded by his brother, [[Abdul Rahman Arif]]. Under his rule,  participated in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967.

The [[17 July Revolution]] overthrew Arif and brought the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party –  Region| Ba'ath Party]] to power in 1968, with [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] as the president of . However, the government gradually came under the control of [[Saddam Hussein]], 's then vice-president. Saddam sought to achieve stability between 's ethnic and religious groups. The [[First –Kurdish War|first –Kurdish war]] ended in 1970, after which a peace treaty was signed between Saddam and Barzani, granting autonomy to [[Kurds]]. In the 1970s, the leadership offered peace initiatives to Assyrians in  and invited exiled  Jews back to . The government introduced free healthcare and education, nationalised oil, promoted women's rights and developed infrastructure.

In 1974, the [[Second –Kurdish War|second –Kurdish war]] began and [[1974–75 Shatt al-Arab conflict|border clashes with ]] took place on [[Shatt al-Arab]].  supported Kurdish militants. The [[1975 Algiers Agreement|Algiers Agreement]] signed in 1975 by [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] and Saddam resolved the dispute and  withdrew support for the Kurds, resulting in their defeat in the war. In 1973,  participated in the [[Yom Kippur War]] against , alongside [[]] and [[]]. An attempt to ban an annual pilgrimage to Karbala in 1977 caused an [[1977 Shia uprising in |uprising by Shia Muslims across ]]. Another Shia uprising took place from 1979 to 1980, as a followup to the [[Islamic Revolution]] in . On 16 July 1979, Saddam acceded to the presidency and chairmanship of the [[Revolutionary Command Council ()|Revolutionary Command Council]], 's then [[Executive (government)|supreme executive body]].

Following months of cross-border raids with , Saddam declared war on  in September 1980, initiating the [[– War]]. Taking advantage of the post-[[ Revolution]] chaos in ,  captured some territories in southwest , but  recaptured all of the lost territories within two years, and for the next six years  was on the offensive.<sup>[''[[Wikipedia:Citing sources|page needed]]'']</sup> [[Arab countries|Sunni-led Arab countries]] and the [[ support for  during the – War| supported  throughout the war]]. In 1981,  destroyed a nuclear reactor of . In midst of the war, between 1983 and 1986, Kurds led [[1983–1986 Kurdish rebellions in |rebellion against the regime]]. In retaliation, the government-coordinated [[Anfal campaign]] led to the killing of 50,000–100,000 civilians. During the war, Saddam extensively used [[ chemical weapons program|chemical weapons]] against . The war, which ended in [[stalemate]] in 1988, killed between half a million and 1.5 million people.

's refusal to waive 's debt and reducing oil prices pushed Saddam to take military action against it. On 2 August 1990, the [[ invasion of | forces invaded]] and annexed  as its [[ Governorate|19th governorate]], starting the [[Gulf War]]. This led to military intervention by the [[Coalition of the Gulf War|US-led alliance]]. The coalition forces proceeded with a bombing campaign targeting military targets and then launched a 100-hour-long ground assault against  forces in southern  and .  also attempted to invade  and attacked . 's armed forces were devastated during the war. Sanctions were imposed on , following the invasion of , which resulted in economic decline. After the end of the war in 1991,  Kurds and Shi'ite Muslims in northern and southern  led several [[1991  uprisings|uprisings against Saddam's regime]], but these were repressed. It is estimated that as many as 100,000 people, including many civilians, were killed. During the uprisings, the US, UK,  and , claiming authority under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 688|UNSC Resolution 688]], established the [[ no-fly zones]] to protect Kurdish population from attacks and autonomy was given to Kurds.  was also affected by the [[ Kurdish Civil War]] from 1994 to 1997. Around 40,000 fighters and civilians were killed. Between 2001 and 2003, the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] and [[Ansar al-Islam in Kurdistan|Ansar al-Islam]] engaged in conflict, which would merge with the upcoming war.

=== Post-invasion  ===
{{Main|Occupation of  (2003–2011)| War|History of  (2011–present)}}
After the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]], [[George W. Bush]] began planning the overthrow of Saddam in what is now widely regarded as a [[Rationale for the  War|false pretense]]. Saddam's  was included in Bush's "[[axis of evil]]". The [[ Congress|US Congress]] passed [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against  Resolution of 2002|joint resolution]], which authorised the use of armed force against . In November 2002 the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441|resolution 1441]]. On 20 March 2003, the US-led coalition invaded , as part of [[global war on terror]]. Within weeks, coalition forces occupied much of , with the  Army adopting guerrilla tactics to confront coalition forces. Following the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|fall of Baghdad]] in the first week of April, Saddam's regime had completely lost control of . A [[Firdos Square statue destruction|statue of Saddam was toppled]] in Baghdad, symbolising the end of his rule.

====Insurgency and Civil war====
The [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] began disbanding the Ba'ath Army and expelling Ba'athists from the new government. The insurgents fought against the coalition forces and the newly installed government. Saddam was captured and executed. The Shia–Sunni civil war took place from 2006 to 2008. The coalition forces were accused of war crimes such as the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib torture]], the [[Fallujah killings of April 2003|Fallujah massacre]], the [[Mahmudiyah rape and killings]] and the [[Mukaradeeb wedding party massacre]]. Following the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from  (2007–2011)|withdrawal of US troops]] in 2011, the occupation ceased and war ended. The war in  has resulted in [[Casualties of the  War|between 151,000 and 1.2 million  being killed]].

The subsequent efforts to rebuild the country amidst sectarian violence was galvanised by continuing discontent over [[Nouri al-Maliki]]'s government, which led to [[2012–2013  protests|protests]]. In 2013, taking advantage of the ensuing chaos and popular discontent against the  government, Ba'athist and other Sunni militants ([[Al Qaida]] and [[Islamic State|ISIS]]) launched a number of attacks against the government during what is known as the [[Anbar campaign (2013–2014)|Anbar campaign]]. What followed, was a large scale [[Northern  offensive (June 2014)|offensive]] by ISIS in [[Mosul]], which marked the beginning of the rapid [[Territory of the Islamic State|territorial expansion]] of the group, initiating [[War in  (2013–2017)|full-scale war in ]]. Sunni insurgents belonging to the Islamic State group seized control of large swathes of land including several major cities, like [[Tikrit]], [[Fallujah]] and Mosul, creating hundreds of thousands of [[internally displaced persons]] amid reports of atrocities by ISIS fighters. An estimated 500,000 civilians fled from Mosul. Around 5,000 Yazidis were killed in the genocide by ISIS, as a part of the war. In June 2014, 's leading Shii Grand Ayatollah, [[Ali al-Sistani]] issued a [[Fatwa]] calling on able-bodied men to join the Armed Forces to fight against ISIS. Even though the Fatwa specifically instructed  to join the official Armed Forces of the country (such as the Army or the Police), it nevertheless resulted in the creation of the [[Popular Mobilisation Forces]]. During that time, the government of , headed by [[Haider al-Abadi]] requested the international community to assist  against ISIS, resulting in the creation of the [[-led intervention in  (2014–2021)|-led Coalition against ISIS]]. Meanwhile, in an attempt to counter US influence, [[Khomeinism|Khomeinist]] anti-US militias prompted [[ intervention in  (2014–present)| intervention]], which resulted in the latter expanding its influence. The  armed forces, supported by the US-led coalition, as well as the Popular Mobilisation Forces, [[Peshmerga]] and other allied anti-ISIS militias then initiated a counter-offensive to retake and liberate ISIS-held territory. In December 2017, when ISIS had lost all its territory in , the government declared victory.

====2019-2021 protests====
{{main|2019–2021  protests}}
One of the main causes for popular discontent in  is the lack of reliable electricity infrastructure and clean water. The electrical grid faces systemic pressures due to climate change, fuel shortages, and an increase in demand. Corruption remains endemic throughout  governance while the -endorsed sectarian political system has driven increased levels of violent terrorism and sectarian conflicts. Climate change is driving wide-scale droughts while water reserves are rapidly depleting. Nationwide protests erupted in  in October 2019, demanding systemic reform, and the end of the party-based quota system as well as the disarmament of non-state militias and end to foreign interference. Despite heavy repression, hundreds of deaths, and widespread injuries, the movement remained united around calls for institutional reform and increased accountability. In 2020, the sitting prime minister [[Adil Abdul Mahdi]] resigned in the face of popular demand. Succeeding him was prime minister [[Mustafa al-Kadhimi]], during whose tenure the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] erupted, causing a macroeconomic shock that plummeted oil prices, devastating the  economy which is dominated by the oil sector. The country has been in a [[Climate change in |prolonged drought]] since 2020 and experienced its second-driest season in the past four decades in 2021. Water flows in the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] were down 30-40% in 2023. Half the country's farmland is at risk of [[desertification]]. Nearly 40% of  "has been overtaken by blowing desert sands that claim tens of thousands of acres of arable land every year". In 2024,  experienced unprecedented rainfall that —according to the [[Ministry of Water Resources ()|Ministry of Water Resources]]— boosted 's strategic water reserves by 10%, significantly easing the drought crisis.

==== Period of stability (2022-present)====
In October 2022, the Council of Representatives elected [[Abdul Latif Rashid]] as [[President of |president]], and [[Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani|Mohammed Shia al-Sudani]] became [[Prime Minister of |Prime Minister]]. Since assuming office in October 2022, Prime Minister al-Sudani has overseen a period of relative political, security, and economic stabilisation. Government officials have cited increased regional diplomacy, improved international relations, and economic diversification initiatives such as the [[–Europe Development Road]] project as key indicators of recovery. In August 2023, al-Sudani established the [[Development Fund ()| Development Fund]] whose purpose is to strengthen the private sector and finance projects of crucial social and environmental value. In February 2025, the fund had gained $7bn in [[foreign direct investments]], and signed Memoranda of Understanding with a number of countries including [[]] and [[]]. In May 2025,  [[Ministry of Planning ()|Ministry of Planning]] announced that the unemployment rate in  had dropped from 17% in 2022 to 13% in 2025. A report published on 24 July 2025 and submitted to the [[United Nations Security Council]], assessed that ISIS "is at its weakest" in  since its emergence.

The [[Natufian culture]] was the first to become sedentary around the 11th millennium BC and became one of the centers of [[Neolithic]] culture (known as [[PPNA|Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]]), where agriculture and cattle breeding first began to appear. The site of [[Tell Qaramel]] has several round stone towers dated to 10650 BC, making them the oldest structures of this kind in the world. The Neolithic period ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]) is represented by rectangular houses of [[Mureybet]] culture. At the time, people used containers made of stone, gyps, and burnt lime ([[White Ware|Vaisselle blanche]]). The discovery of [[obsidian]] tools from [[]] are evidence of early trade. The ancient cities of [[Hamoukar]] and [[Emar]] played an important role during the late Neolithic and Bronze Age. Archaeologists have demonstrated that civilization in  was one of the most ancient on earth, perhaps preceded by only that of [[Mesopotamia]].

[[File:Ishqi-Mari (dark background).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ishqi-Mari]], king of the Second Kingdom of [[Mari, |Mari]], circa 2300 BC]]The earliest recorded indigenous civilization in the region was the Kingdom of [[Ebla]] near present-day [[Idlib]], northern . Ebla appears to have been founded around 3500 BC and gradually built its fortune through trade with the Mesopotamian states of [[Sumer]], [[Assyria]], and [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], as well as with the [[Hurrian]] and [[Hattians|Hattian]] peoples to the northwest, in [[Asia Minor]]. Gifts from [[Pharaoh]]s, found during excavations, confirm Ebla's contact with [[Ancient |]]. One of the earliest written texts from  is a trading agreement between Vizier [[Ibrium]] of Ebla and an ambiguous kingdom called [[Abarsal]] {{c.|2300 BC}}. This is known as the [[Treaty between Ebla and Abarsal]]. Scholars believe the [[Eblaite language|language of Ebla]] to be among the oldest known written [[Semitic languages]] after [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. Recent classifications of the Eblaite language have shown that it was an [[East Semitic language]], closely related to the [[Akkadian language]]. Ebla was weakened by a long war with [[Mari, |Mari]], and the whole of  became part of the Mesopotamian [[Akkadian Empire]] after [[Sargon of Akkad]] and his grandson [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]]'s conquests ended Eblan domination over  in the first half of the 23rd century BC.

By the 21st century BC, Hurrians settled in the northern east parts of  while the rest of the region was dominated by the [[Amorites]].  was called the Land of the Amurru (Amorites) by their Assyro-Babylonian neighbors. The Northwest Semitic [[Amorite language]] is the earliest attested of the [[Canaanite languages]]. [[Mari, |Mari]] reemerged during this period until conquered by [[Hammurabi]] of Babylon. [[Ugarit]] also arose during this time, circa 1800 BC, close to modern [[Latakia]]. [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] was a Semitic language loosely related to the Canaanite languages and developed the [[Ugaritic alphabet]], considered to be the world's earliest known alphabet. The Ugaritic kingdom survived until its destruction at the hands of the marauding Indo-European [[Sea Peoples]] in the 12th century BC in what was known as the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]].

[[Aleppo]] and Damascus are among the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world]]. [[Yamhad]] (modern Aleppo) dominated northern  for two centuries, although eastern  was occupied in the 19th and 18th centuries BC by the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] ruled by the Amorite dynasty of [[Shamshi-Adad I]], and by the [[Babylonian Empire]] which was founded by Amorites. Yamhad was described in the tablets of Mari as the mightiest state in the near east and as having more vassals than Hammurabi. Yamhad imposed its authority over [[Alalakh]], [[Qatna]], the Hurrians states, and the [[Euphrates]] valley down to the borders with Babylon. The army of Yamhad campaigned as far away as [[Der (Sumer)|Dēr]] on the border of [[Elam]] (modern ). Yamhad was conquered and destroyed, along with Ebla, by the [[Hittites]] from [[Asia Minor]] circa 1600 BC. From this time,  became a battle ground for various foreign empires, these being the [[Hittite Empire]], [[Mitanni]] Empire, [[ Empire]], [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], and to a lesser degree [[Babylonia]]. The  initially occupied much of the south, while the Hittites and the Mitanni occupied much of the north. However, Assyria eventually gained the upper hand, destroying the Mitanni Empire and annexing huge swathes of territory previously held by the Hittites and Babylon.

Around the 14th century BC, various [[Semitic people]] appeared in the area, such as the semi-nomadic [[Suteans]] who came into an unsuccessful conflict with Babylonia to the east, and the [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] speaking [[Arameans]] who subsumed the earlier Amorites. They too were subjugated by Assyria and the Hittites for centuries. The  fought the Hittites for control over western ; the fighting reached its zenith in 1274 BC with the [[Battle of Kadesh]]. The west remained part of the Hittite empire until its destruction {{c.|1200 BC}}, while eastern  largely became part of the Middle Assyrian Empire, who also annexed much of the west during the reign of [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] 1114–1076 BC. With the destruction of the Hittites and the decline of Assyria in the late 11th century BC, the Aramean tribes gained control of much of the interior, founding states such as [[Bit Bahiani]], [[Aram-Damascus]], [[Hamath]], [[Aram-Rehob]], [[Aram-Naharaim]], and [[Luhuti]]. From this point, the region became known as [[Aramea]] or [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]. There was also a synthesis between the Semitic Arameans and the remnants of the Indo-European Hittites, with the founding of a number of [[Syro-Hittite]] states centered in north central Aram () and south central Asia Minor (modern ), including [[Palistin]], [[Carchemish]] and [[Sam'al]].

[[File:Amrit01.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Amrit]] Phoenician Temple]]
A [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] group known as the [[Phoenicians]] came to dominate the coasts of , (and also  and northern [[ (region)|]]) from the 13th century BC, founding [[city states]] such as [[Amrit]], [[Simyra]], [[Arwad]], [[Arab al-Mulk|Paltos]], [[Latakia#Ancient settlement and founding|Ramitha]], and [[Tell Sukas|Shuksi]]. From these coastal regions, they eventually spread their influence throughout the [[Mediterranean]], including building colonies in [[]], Sicily, the [[Iberian peninsula]], and the coasts of North Africa and most significantly, founding the major city-state of [[Carthage]] in the 9th century BC, which was much later to become the center of a major empire, rivaling the [[Roman Republic]].

 and the western half of [[Near East]] then fell to the vast [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (911 BC – 605 BC). The Assyrians introduced [[Imperial Aramaic]] as the [[lingua franca]] of their empire. This language was to remain dominant in  and the entire [[Near East]] until after the [[Islamic]] conquest in the 7th and 8th centuries AD, and was to be a vehicle for the spread of Christianity. The Assyrians named their colonies of  and  [[Eber-Nari]]. Assyrian domination ended after the Assyrians greatly weakened themselves in a series of brutal internal civil wars, followed by attacks from: the [[Medes]], [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]]. During the fall of Assyria, the [[Scythians]] ravaged and plundered much of . The last stand of the Assyrian army was at [[Carchemish]] in northern  in 605 BC. The Assyrian Empire was followed by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (605 BC – 539 BC). During this period,  became a battle ground between Babylonia and another former Assyrian colony, that of . The Babylonians, like their Assyrian relations, were victorious over .

[[Palmyra]], a rich and sometimes powerful native Aramaic-speaking kingdom, arose in northern  in the 2nd century; the Palmyrene established a trade network that made the city one of the richest in the Roman Empire. In the late 3rd century the Palmyrene king [[Odaenathus]] defeated the Persian emperor [[Shapur I]] and controlled the entirety of the Roman East while his successor and widow [[Zenobia]] established the [[Palmyrene Empire]], which briefly conquered , , , much of Asia Minor, Judah and , before being finally brought under Roman control in 273.

The northern Mesopotamian [[Neo-Assyrian|Assyrian]] kingdom of [[Adiabene]] controlled areas of north east  between 10 and 117, before it was conquered by Rome. The Aramaic language has been found as far afield as [[Hadrian's Wall]] in [[Roman Britain]], with an inscription written by a Palmyrene emigrant at the site of Fort [[Arbeia]]. Control of  eventually passed from the Romans to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] with the split in the Roman Empire.

[[Muhammad]]'s first interaction with the people of  was during the [[invasion of Dumatul Jandal]] in July 626 where he ordered his followers to invade Duma, because Muhammad received intelligence that some tribes there were involved in highway robbery and were preparing to attack [[Medina]]. [[William Montgomery Watt]] claims that this was the most significant expedition Muhammad ordered at the time, even though it received little notice in the primary sources. [[Dumat Al-Jandal]] was {{convert|500|mi|km|order=flip}} from Medina, and Watt says that there was no immediate threat to Muhammad, other than the possibility that his communications to  and supplies to Medina would be interrupted. Watt says "It is tempting to suppose that Muhammad was already envisaging something of the expansion which took place after his death", and that the rapid march of his troops must have "impressed all those who heard of it". [[William Muir]] also believes that the expedition was important as Muhammad followed by 1,000 men reached the confines of , where distant tribes had learnt his name, while the political horizon of Muhammad was extended.

By 640,  [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|was conquered]] by the [[Rashidun army]] led by [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]]. In the mid-7th century, the [[Umayyad dynasty]] placed the capital of the empire in Damascus. The country's power declined during later Umayyad rule; this was mainly through totalitarianism, corruption and the resulting revolutions. The Umayyad dynasty was overthrown in 750 by the [[Abbasid dynasty]], which moved the capital of empire to [[Baghdad]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] – made official under Umayyad rule – became the dominant language, replacing [[ language|]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] of the Byzantine era. In 887, the -based [[Tulunids]] annexed  from the Abbasids and were later replaced by the -based [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshidids]] and then by the [[Hamdanid]]s originating in Aleppo founded by [[Sayf al-Dawla]].

Sections of  were held by , ,  and  overlords between 1098 and 1189 during the [[Crusades]] and were known collectively as the [[Crusader states]], among which the primary one in  was the [[Principality of Antioch]]. The coastal mountainous region was occupied in part by the [[Nizaris|Nizari Ismailis]], the so-called [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], who had intermittent confrontations and truces with the Crusader States. Later in history when "the Nizaris faced renewed Frankish hostilities, they received timely assistance from the Ayyubids." After a century of Seljuk rule,  was largely conquered (1175–1185) by the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] liberator [[Saladin|Salah ad-Din]], founder of the [[Ayyubid]] dynasty of . [[Siege of Aleppo (1260)|Aleppo fell]] to the [[Mongols]] of [[Hulegu]] in January 1260; Damascus fell in March, but then Hulegu was forced to break off his attack to return to  to deal with a succession dispute.

A few months later, the [[Mamluk]]s arrived with an army from  and defeated the Mongols in the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in [[Galilee]]. The Mamluk leader, [[Baibars]], made Damascus a provincial capital. When he died, power was taken by [[Qalawun]]. In the meantime, an emir named [[Sunqur al-Ashqar]] had tried to declare himself ruler of Damascus, but he was defeated by Qalawun on 21 June 1280 and fled to northern . Al-Ashqar, who had married a Mongol woman, appealed for help from the Mongols. The Mongols of the [[Ilkhanate]] took Aleppo in October 1280, but Qalawun persuaded Al-Ashqar to join him, and they fought against the Mongols on 29 October 1281 in the [[Second Battle of Homs]], which was won by the Mamluks. In 1400, the Muslim [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turco-Mongol]] conqueror [[Tamurlane]] invaded , in which he [[Sack of Aleppo (1400)|sacked Aleppo]] and [[Siege of Damascus (1400)|captured Damascus]] after defeating the Mamluk army. The city's inhabitants were massacred, except for the artisans who were deported to [[Samarkand]]. Tamurlane conducted massacres of the Assyrian Christian population, greatly reducing their numbers. By the end of the 15th century, the discovery of a sea route from Europe to the [[Far East]] ended the need for an [[Silk Road|overland trade route]] through .

In 1516, the [[Ottoman Empire]] invaded the [[Mamluk Sultanate|Mamluk Sultanate of ]], conquering  and incorporating it into its empire. The Ottoman system was not burdensome to  because the Turks respected Arabic as the language of the [[Quran]] and accepted the mantle of defenders of the faith. Damascus was made the major entrepot for [[Mecca]], and as such it acquired a holy character to Muslims, because of the beneficial results of the countless pilgrims who passed through on the [[hajj]].

Ottoman administration followed a system that led to peaceful coexistence. Each ethno-religious minority—Arab [[Shia Muslim]], Arab [[Sunni Muslim]], [[Syriac Orthodox]], [[ Orthodox]], [[Maronite Christians]], [[Assyrian Christians]], [[]], [[Kurds]] and [[Jews]]—constituted a [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]. The religious heads of each community administered all personal status laws and performed certain civil functions as well. In 1831, [[Ibrahim Pasha of ]] renounced his loyalty to the empire and overran [[Ottoman ]], capturing Damascus. His short-term rule over the domain attempted to change the demographics and social structure of the region: he brought thousands of  villagers to populate the plains of [[southern ]], rebuilt [[Jaffa]] and settled it with veteran  soldiers aiming to turn it into a regional capital, and he crushed peasant and Druze rebellions and deported non-loyal tribesmen. By 1840, however, he had to surrender the area back to the Ottomans. From 1864, [[Tanzimat]] reforms were applied on Ottoman , carving out the provinces (vilayets) of [[Aleppo Vilayet|Aleppo]], [[Sanjak of Zor|Zor]], [[Beirut Vilayet|Beirut]] and [[Damascus Vilayet]]; [[Mutasarrifate of Mount ]] was created, and soon after the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]] was given a separate status.

During [[World War I]], the Ottoman Empire entered the conflict as a [[Central Powers|Central Power]]. It ultimately suffered defeat and loss of control of the entire [[Near East]] to the [[ Empire]] and [[ colonial empire| Empire]]. During the conflict, genocide against indigenous Christian peoples was carried out by the Ottomans and their allies in the form of the [[ genocide]] and [[Sayfo|Assyrian genocide]], of which [[Deir ez-Zor]] in Ottoman  was the final destination of these death marches. In the midst of World War I, two [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] diplomats (Frenchman [[François Georges-Picot]] and [[ people|Briton]] [[Mark Sykes]]) secretly agreed on the post-war division of the Ottoman Empire into respective zones of influence in the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] of 1916. Initially, the two territories were separated by a border that ran in an almost straight line from  to . However, the discovery of oil in the region of [[Mosul]] just before the end of the war led to yet [[1918 Clemenceau–Lloyd George Agreement (Middle East)|another negotiation with  in 1918]] to cede this region to the  zone of influence, which was to become . The fate of the intermediate province of Zor was left unclear; its [[Occupation of Zor|occupation by Arab nationalists resulted in its attachment to ]]. This border was recognized internationally when  became a [[League of Nations]] mandate in 1920 and has not changed to date.

In 1920, a short-lived independent [[Arab Kingdom of |Kingdom of ]] was established under [[Faisal I of |Faisal I]] of the [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] family. However, his rule over  ended after only a few months, following the [[Battle of Maysalun]].  troops occupied  later that year after the [[San Remo conference]] proposed that the [[League of Nations]] put  under a  mandate. General Gouraud had according to his secretary de Caix two options: "Either build a  nation that does not exist... by smoothing the rifts which still divide it" or "cultivate and maintain all the phenomena, which require our arbitration that these divisions give". De Caix added "I must say only the second option interests me". This is what Gouraud did.

In 1925, [[Sultan al-Atrash]] led [[Great  Revolt|a revolt]] that broke out in the [[Jabal al-Druze|Druze Mountain]] and spread to engulf the whole of  and parts of . Al-Atrash won several battles against the , notably the [[Battle of al-Kafr]] on 21 July 1925, the [[Battle of al-Mazraa]] on 2–3 August 1925, and the battles of Salkhad, [[al-Musayfirah]] and Suwayda.  sent thousands of troops from  and , leading the  to regain many cities, although resistance lasted until the spring of 1927.

With the fall of  in 1940 during [[World War II]],  came under the control of [[Vichy ]] until the  and Free  occupied the country in the [[- campaign]] in July 1941. Continuing pressure from  nationalists and the  [[Levant Crisis|forced the ]] to evacuate their troops in April 1946, leaving the country in the hands of a republican government that had been formed during the mandate.

=== Independent  Republic ===
{{Main|Second  Republic|United Arab Republic|1963  coup d'état}}
Upheaval dominated  politics from independence through the late 1960s. In May 1948,  forces invaded [[ (region)|]], together with other Arab states, and immediately [[Battles of the Kinarot Valley|attacked Jewish settlements]]. President [[Shukri al-Quwatli|Shukri al-Quwwatli]] instructed his troops in the front, "to destroy the Zionists". The invasion purpose was to prevent the establishment of the state of . Toward this end, the  government engaged in an active process of recruiting former [[Nazism|Nazis]], including several former members of the [[Schutzstaffel]], to build up their armed forces and military intelligence capabilities. Defeat in this war was one of several trigger factors for the [[March 1949  coup d'état]] by Colonel [[Husni al-Za'im]], described as the first military overthrow of the [[Arab World]] since the start of the Second World War. This was soon followed by another overthrow, by Colonel [[Sami al-Hinnawi]], who was quickly deposed by Colonel [[Adib Shishakli]], all within the same year.[[File:Syrien 1961 Aleppol 1.jpg|thumb|Aleppo in 1961|left]]Shishakli eventually abolished multipartyism altogether but was overthrown in a [[1954  coup d'état|1954 coup]], and the parliamentary system was restored. However, by this time, power was increasingly concentrated in the military and security establishment. The weakness of Parliamentary institutions and the mismanagement of the economy led to unrest and the influence of [[Nasserism]] and other ideologies. There was fertile ground for various [[Arab nationalist]], [[ nationalism| nationalist]], and socialist movements, which represented disaffected elements of society. Notably included were religious minorities, who demanded radical reform.
In November 1956, as a direct result of the [[Suez Crisis]],  signed a pact with the [[Soviet Union]]. This gave a foothold for communist influence within the government in exchange for military equipment. [[]] then became worried about this increase in the strength of  military technology, as it seemed feasible that  might attempt to retake [[İskenderun]]. Only heated debates in the United Nations lessened the threat of war.

=== United Arab Republic ===
[[File:Nasser addresses Aleppo, 1960.jpg|thumb|[[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] at [[Aleppo]], 1960]]
On 1 February 1958,  President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] and 's Nasser announced the merging of  and , creating the [[United Arab Republic]], and all  political parties, as well as the communists therein, ceased overt activities. Meanwhile, a group of  Ba'athist officers, alarmed by the party's poor position and the increasing fragility of the union, decided to form a secret Military Committee; its initial members were Lieutenant-Colonel [[Muhammad Umran]], Major [[Salah Jadid]] and Captain Hafez al-Assad.  seceded from the union with  on 28 September 1961, after a [[1961  coup d'état|coup]] and terminated the political union.

==== Land reform ====
Agrarian reform measures were introduced which consisted of three interrelated programs: legislation regulating the relationship between agriculture laborers and landowners; legislation governing the ownership and use of private and state domain land and directing the economic organization of peasants; and measures reorganizing agricultural production under state control. Despite high levels of inequality in land ownership these reforms allowed for more progress in redistribution of land from 1958 to 1961 than any other reforms in 's history, since independence.

The first law passed (Law 134; passed 4 September 1958) was in response to concern about peasant mobilization and expanding peasants' rights. This was designed to strengthen the position of sharecroppers and agricultural laborers in relation to land owners. This law led to the creation of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, which announced the implementation of new laws that would allow the regulation of working condition especially for women and adolescents, set hours of work, and introduce the principle of minimum wage for paid laborers and an equitable division of harvest for sharecroppers. Furthermore, it obligated landlords to honor both written and oral contracts, established collective bargaining, contained provisions for workers' compensation, health, housing, and employment services. Law 134 was not designed strictly to protect workers. It also acknowledged the rights of landlords to form their own syndicates.

=== Ba'athist  ===
{{Main|Ba'athist }}
The instability which followed the [[1961  coup d'état|1961 coup]] culminated in the [[1963  coup d'état|8 March 1963 Ba'athist coup]]. The takeover was engineered by members of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party –  Region|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]], led by [[Michel Aflaq]] and [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]]. The new  cabinet was dominated by Ba'ath members. From the [[1963  coup d'état|1963 seizure of power]] by its [[Military Committee ()|Military Committee]] to the [[Fall of the Assad regime|fall of the regime]] in 2024, the Ba'ath party ruled  as a dictatorship which has been frequently described as [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]],{{Efn|Sources describing  as a totalitarian state:

Ba'athists took control over country's politics, education, culture, religion and surveilled all aspects of civil society through its powerful ''[[Military Intelligence Directorate ()|Mukhabarat]]'' (secret police). [[ Arab Armed Forces| Arab Armed forces]] and secret police were integrated with the Ba'ath party apparatus; after the purging of traditional civilian and military elites by the regime.

The 1963 Ba'athist coup marked a "radical break" in [[History of #Modern history|modern  history]], after which Ba'ath party monopolised power in the country to establish a [[one-party state]] and shaped a socio-political order by enforcing its [[neo-Ba'athism|state ideology]]. On 23 February 1966, the neo-Ba'athist Military Committee carried out an [[1966  coup d'état|intra-party rebellion]] against the Ba'athist Old Guard ([[Michel Aflaq|Aflaq]] and [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar|Bitar]]), imprisoned President [[Amin al-Hafiz]] and designated a [[Qutriyun|regionalist]], civilian Ba'ath government on 1 March. Although [[Nureddin al-Atassi]] became the formal head of state, [[Salah Jadid]] was 's effective ruler from 1966 until November 1970, when he was deposed by [[Hafez al-Assad]], who at the time was Minister of Defense.

The coup led to the schism within the original pan-Arab Ba'ath Party: one [[Ba'ath Party (-dominated faction)|-led ba'ath movement]] (ruled  from 1968 to 2003) and one [[Ba'ath Party (-dominated faction)|-led ba'ath movement]] was established. In the first half of 1967, a low-key state of war existed between  and . Conflict over  cultivation of land in the [[– Mixed Armistice Commission|Demilitarized Zone]] led to [[Origins of the Six-Day War# and |7 April pre-war aerial clashes]] between  and . When the [[Six-Day War]] broke out between  and ,  joined the war and attacked  as well. In the final days of the war,  turned its attention to , capturing two-thirds of the [[Golan Heights]] in under 48 hours. The defeat caused a split between Jadid and Assad over what steps to take next. Disagreement developed between Jadid, who controlled the party apparatus, and Assad, who controlled the military. The 1970 retreat of  forces sent to aid the [[ Liberation Organization]] led by [[Yasser Arafat]] during the "[[Black September]] (also known as the  Civil War of 1970)" hostilities with  reflected this disagreement.[[File:General Hafez al-Assad (1930-2000), the new president of  in November 1970.png|thumb|upright|[[Hafez al-Assad]], president of  (1970–2000)]]The power struggle culminated in the November [[Corrective Revolution ()|1970  Corrective movement]], a bloodless military coup that installed Hafez al-Assad as the strongman of the government. Assad transformed a Ba'athist party state into a dictatorship marked by his pervasive grip on the party, [[ Arab Armed Forces|armed forces]], [[Military Intelligence Directorate ()|secret police]], media, education sector, religious and cultural spheres and all aspects of civil society. He assigned [[Alawites|Alawite]] loyalists to key posts in the military forces, bureaucracy, [[Military Intelligence Directorate ()|intelligence]] and the ruling elite. A cult of personality revolving around Hafez and his family became a core tenet of [[Assadism|Ba'athist ideology]], which espoused that [[Assad family|Assad dynasty]] was destined to rule perennially. 

On 6 October 1973,  and  initiated the [[Yom Kippur War]] against . The [[ Defense Forces]] reversed the initial  gains and pushed deeper into  territory. The village of [[Quneitra]] was largely destroyed by the  army. 

In the late 1970s, an [[Islamist uprising in |Islamist uprising]] by the [[Muslim Brotherhood in |Muslim Brotherhood]] was aimed against the government. Islamists attacked civilians and off-duty military personnel, leading security forces to also kill civilians in retaliatory strikes. The uprising had reached its climax in the 1982 [[1982 Hama massacre|Hama massacre]], when more than 2,000 to 25,000{{sfnp|Carré|Michaud|1983|page=159}}-40,000 people (Islamist and civilians) were killed by [[ Armed Forces| military]] troops and Ba'athist paramilitaries. It has been described as the "single deadliest act" of violence perpetrated by any state upon its own population in [[Modern Middle East|modern Arab history]]

In a major shift in relations with both other [[Arab world|Arab states]] and the Western world,  participated in the -led [[Gulf War]] against [[Saddam Hussein]]. The country participated in the multilateral [[Madrid Conference of 1991]], and during the 1990s engaged in negotiations with  along with  and .

Public demonstrations across  began on 26 January 2011 and developed into a nationwide uprising. Protesters demanded the resignation of Assad, the overthrow of his government, and an end to nearly five decades of Ba'ath Party rule. Since spring 2011, the  government deployed the  Army to quell the uprising, and several cities were besieged, though the unrest continued. According to some witnesses, soldiers, who refused to open fire on civilians, were summarily executed by the  Army. The  government denied reports of defections, and blamed armed gangs for causing trouble. Since early autumn 2011, civilians and army defectors began forming fighting units, which began an [[ Civil War|insurgency campaign]] against the  Army. The insurgents unified under the banner of the [[Free  Army]] and fought in an increasingly organized fashion; however, the civilian component of the armed opposition lacked an organized leadership.

In December 2024, violence flared up once again. Rebel factions, led by the Islamist group [[Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham]] (HTS), [[Battle of Aleppo (2024)|took control of Aleppo]] in a lightning offensive, prompting a retaliatory airstrike campaign by  regime forces, supported by [[ Aerospace Forces| aviation assets]]. The strikes, which targeted population centers and several hospitals in [[Idlib insurgency|rebel-held]] city of [[Idlib]], resulted in at least 25 deaths according to the White Helmets rescue group. NATO issued a joint statement calling for the protection of civilians and critical infrastructure to prevent further displacement and ensure humanitarian access. They stressed the urgent need for a -led political solution, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2254, which advocates for dialogue between the  government and opposition forces.

The [[2024  opposition offensives|rebel offensive]], which had begun on 27 November, continued its [[2024 Hama offensive|advance into Hama province]] following their capture of Aleppo. On 30 November, Brigadier General [[Hossam Louka]], director of the [[General Intelligence Directorate ()|General Security Directorate]], attempted to stage a coup in Damascus while Bashar al-Assad was in Moscow, but would be foiled by Bashar's younger brother [[Maher al-Assad|Maher]]. On 4 December, fierce clashes erupted in Hama province as the  army engaged rebel forces in a bid to halt their advance on the key city of [[Hama]]. Government forces claimed to have launched a counteroffensive with air support, pushing back rebel factions, including HTS, around six miles from the city. However, despite reinforcements, the rebels captured the city on 5 December. The fighting led to widespread displacement, with nearly 50,000 people fleeing the area and over 600 casualties reported, including 104 civilians.

Rebel forces reached the outskirts of [[Homs]] on 5 December, beginning a [[2024 Homs offensive|three-day battle]] for the city. Simultaneously, an HTS-coordinated [[Southern  offensive (2024)|mass uprising]] led by a [[Southern Operations Room|coalition of Druze tribes and opposition forces]] captured the southern cities of [[Suwayda]] and [[Daraa insurgency|Daraa]] by 6 December, and rapidly advanced northwards to encircle Damascus over the following day. Homs was captured by rebel forces by the early morning of 8 December, leaving no major regime strongholds between the rebel advance and Damascus itself.

Cut off from the [[Alawites|Alawite]] heartland of [[Tartus Governorate|Tartus]] and [[Latakia Governorate|Latakia]] governorates, faced with a rebel pincer from both north and south bearing down on Damascus, and with no hope of foreign intervention from the regime's  and  benefactors, Assadist authority over remaining regime-held territories rapidly disintegrated. The [[ Arab Armed Forces]] melted away as its soldiers abandoned their weapons and uniforms, many [[Desertion|deserting]] across the border to [[]] and [[]]. Opposition forces [[Fall of Damascus (2024)|captured]] the capital Damascus on 8 December, toppling Bashar al-Assad's government and ending the Assad family's 53-year-long rule over the country. Assad fled to [[Moscow]] with his family, where he was granted asylum.

=== Interim Period ===

Following the [[fall of the Assad regime]], Assad's ninth prime minister [[Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali]], with support from the opposition and [[Ahmed al-Sharaa]], remained at his post in a caretaker capacity until a [[ caretaker government|caretaker government]] led by [[Mohammed al-Bashir]] was formed the following day. Al-Jalali called for fresh elections so that the  people may choose their new leaders.

Prior to the fall of the Assad regime, Mohammed al-Bashir headed the [[ Salvation Government]] (SSG) formed in the province of [[Idlib]] by [[Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham]] (HTS), the Islamist militant organization which led the overthrow of Assad in December 2024. In general, the formation of the Transitional Government was scaling of the SSG "to the whole of ", as the composition of the new government was almost the same as that of the SSG. According to a report by the  Network for Human Rights, critics and opponents of the HTS were subject to repression in forms of enforced disappearances and tortures. Shortly after the fall of the Assad regime, [[ invasion of  (2024–present)| commenced a ground invasion]] of the [[Purple Line (ceasefire line)|Purple Line]] buffer zone near the Golan Heights, as well as commencing a series of airstrikes against  military depots and naval bases. The [[ Defense Forces| Defense Forces]] claims that it is destroying Ba'athist military infrastructure, including chemical weapons plants, so that the rebels cannot use them.

Despite the collapse of the Assad regime, -backed [[ National Army]] fighters in northern  continued their [[Manbij offensive (2024)|offensive]] against U.S.-backed [[ Democratic Forces]] (SDF) forces until a ceasefire was reached on 11 December. In February 2025, the SDF, the [[Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East |Autonomous Administration]], and the [[ Democratic Council]] decided in a meeting that SDF would merge with the [[ Armed Forces]]. The [[Operation Inherent Resolve|International Coalition against ISIS]] voiced support for continued dialogue between the SDF and the new  government as well.

The prime minister of the transitional government, Mohammed al-Bashir, has promised to allow Christians and other minorities to continue practicing their religion without interference. However, this has been met with doubts as many rebel forces had previous connections to [[al-Qaeda]] and the [[Islamic State]]. The use of a variation of the [[Islamic flag|''Tawhid'' flag]] by the new government alongside [[Flag of |the opposition flag]] also raised worries, as it implies that the new state may be [[Islam and secularism|less secular]]. [[Aisha al-Dibs]] was appointed as the Minister of Women's Affairs on 22 December 2024.

On 12 December 2024, a spokesman of the transitional government speaking to [[Agence -Presse]] said that during the government's three-month term, the [[Constitution of |constitution]] and [[People's Assembly of |parliament]] would be suspended and that a 'judicial and human rights committee' would be established to review the constitution, prior to making amendments.

On 29 January 2025, during the [[ Revolution Victory Conference]] in [[People's Palace of |Presidential Palace]], the  General Command appointed [[Ahmed al-Sharaa]] as president for the transitional period after he had served as the ''[[de facto]]'' leader following the fall of the Assad regime. 

In March 2025, the UK-based [[ Observatory for Human Rights|SOHR]] reported that  security forces and pro-government fighters had committed a [[2025 massacres of  Alawites|massacre of more than 1500 Alawite civilians]] during [[March 2025 Western  clashes|clashes in western ]]. 

On 10 March 2025, the SDF agreed to merge with the  Armed Forces after SDF leader [[Mazloum Abdi]] met with al-Sharaa. Three days later al-Sharaa signed an [[2025 Interim Constitution of |interim constitution]] covering a five-year transitional period.

On 29 March 2025, the [[ transitional government]] was announced by  President [[Ahmed al-Sharaa]] at a ceremony at the [[People's Palace of |Presidential Palace]] in [[Damascus]], in which the new ministers were sworn in and delivered speeches outlining their agendas. The government replaced the [[ caretaker government]], which was formed following the fall of the Assad regime on 8 December 2024. Since then, a number of Western governments have lifted the [[International sanctions against |sanctions on ]], most notably the  and the .

===Pre-colonial period===
{{Main|Pre-Columbian }}
[[Archaic period (North America)|Archaic-period]] hunter-gatherers called the [[Ciboney]] were the first culture present in . [[Radiocarbon dating|Carbon dating]] has established the earliest settlements started around 3100 BC. They were succeeded by the ceramic age pre-Columbian [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]]-speaking [[Saladoid]] people who migrated from the lower [[Orinoco River]]. They introduced agriculture, raising, among other crops, the famous [[Antigua Black Pineapple]] (''[[Ananas comosus]]''), [[maize|corn]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[chili pepper|chillies]], [[guava]], tobacco, and cotton. Later on the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] settled the island.

===European arrival and slavery===
[[Christopher Columbus]] was the first European to sight the islands in 1493. The  did not colonise Antigua until after a combination of European and African diseases, malnutrition, and slavery eventually extirpated most of the native population; [[smallpox]] was probably the greatest killer.

The  settled on Antigua in 1632; Christopher Codrington settled on Barbuda in 1685. Tobacco and then sugar was grown, worked by a large population of slaves transported from West Africa, who soon came to vastly outnumber the European settlers.

===Colonial era===
The  maintained control of the islands, repulsing an attempted  attack in 1666. The brutal conditions endured by the slaves led to revolts in 1701 and 1729 and a planned revolt in 1736, the last led by [[Prince Klaas]], though it was discovered before it began and the ringleaders were executed. [[Slavery]] was abolished in the  Empire in 1833, affecting the economy. This was exacerbated by natural disasters such as the 1843 earthquake and the 1847 hurricane. Mining occurred on the isle of [[Redonda]], however, this ceased in 1929 and the island has since remained uninhabited.

Part of the Leeward Islands colony,  became part of the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]] from 1958 to 1962.  subsequently became an associated state of the  with full internal autonomy on 27 February 1967. The 1970s were dominated by discussions as to the islands' future and the rivalry between [[Vere Bird]] of the [[ Labour Party]] (ABLP) (Premier from 1967 to 1971 and 1976 to 1981) and the [[Progressive Labour Movement]] (PLM) of [[George Walter]] (Premier 1971–1976). Eventually,  gained full independence on 1 November 1981; Vere Bird became prime minister of the new country. The country opted to remain within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], retaining [[Elizabeth II]] ({{reign|1952|2022}}) as [[Monarchy of |head of state]], with the first [[List of colonial governors and administrators of Antigua#Governors of  (1967–1981)|governor]], [[Wilfred Jacobs|Sir Wilfred Jacobs]], as [[Governor-general of |governor-general]]. Succeeding [[Wilfred Jacobs]] were [[James Carlisle]] (1993–2007), [[Louise Lake-Tack]] (2007–2014), and the present since 2014 being [[Rodney Williams (governor-general)|Rodney Williams]].

===Independence era===
The first two decades of Antigua's independence were dominated politically by the Bird family and the ABLP, with [[Vere Bird]] ruling from 1981 to 1994, followed by his son [[Lester Bird]] from 1994 to 2004. Though providing a degree of political stability, and boosting tourism to the country, the Bird governments were frequently accused of corruption, cronyism and financial malfeasance. [[Vere Bird Jr.]], the elder son, was forced to leave the cabinet in 1990 following a [[Guns for Antigua|scandal]] in which he was accused of smuggling  weapons to  drug-traffickers. Another son, [[Ivor Bird]], was convicted of possessing [[cocaine]] in 1995.

In 1995, [[Hurricane Luis]] caused severe damage on Barbuda.

The ABLP's dominance of  politics ended with the [[2004  general election]], which was won by [[Winston Baldwin Spencer]]'s [[United Progressive Party ()|United Progressive Party]] (UPP). Winston Baldwin Spencer was [[Prime Minister of ]] from 2004 to 2014. However the UPP lost the [[2014  general election]], with the ABLP returning to power under [[Gaston Browne]]. ABLP won 15 of the 17 seats in the [[2018  general election|2018 snap election]] under the leadership of incumbent Prime Minister Gaston Browne.

In 2016, [[Nelson's Dockyard]] was designated as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

Most of Barbuda was devastated in early September 2017 by [[Hurricane Irma]], which brought winds with speeds reaching 295&nbsp;km/h (185&nbsp;mph). The storm damaged or destroyed 95% of the island's buildings and infrastructure, leaving Barbuda "barely habitable" according to Prime Minister Gaston Browne. Nearly everyone on the island was evacuated to Antigua.
Amidst the following rebuilding efforts on Barbuda that were estimated to cost at least $100&nbsp;million, the government announced plans to revoke a century-old law of [[communal land|communal land ownership]] by allowing residents to buy land; a move that has been criticised as promoting "[[disaster capitalism]]".

===First settlement===

Archaeological evidence indicates that modern humans first arrived in what became [[Sahul|New  and ]], as well as the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], around 42,000 to 45,000 years ago. Bougainville was settled by around 28,000 years ago, and the more distant [[Manus Island]] by around 20,000 years ago. These were part of the [[Early human migrations|earliest migrations of humans]] from Africa, and the resulting populations remained relatively isolated from the rest of the world throughout prehistory.{{rp|11}} [[Past sea level|Rising sea levels]] isolated New  from  about 10,000 years ago, although [[Aboriginal ]] and [[Indigenous people of New |New ]] had already diverged from each other from about 37,000 years ago.

Agriculture was independently developed in the New  highlands around 7000 BC, making it one of the few areas in the world [[Vavilov center|where people independently domesticated plants]]. Before the onset of full-scale agriculture, some plants had already been domesticated, including [[sago]], ''[[Canarium indicum]]'', and [[karuka]].{{rp|13}} Archaeological evidence shows that [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian-speaking]] peoples of the [[Lapita culture]] reached the Bismarck Archipelago by 3,300 years ago.{{rp|252}} It is unknown whether they also settled on the mainland at this time, but there is strong evidence of their presence in coastal areas from around 500&nbsp;BC.{{rp|256}} These communities interacted with larger trade networks. It is likely through these trading networks that [[banana]] and [[sugarcane]] moved from New  to other areas of the world.{{rp|<!--15-->52–53}}

Trade became rarer around 300&nbsp;AD, as demand for goods shifted to the [[Maluku Islands]] and [[]]. After European interest in the region grew in the 16th century,  influence grew over the [[Sultanate of Tidore]]. As  authorities become more interested in New , they confirmed and extended the sultanate's claims over western New .{{rp|16–17<!--more from 109–120-->}} Renewed trade began to spread to the eastern parts of New  in the late 17th century, driven by demand for goods such as [[dammar gum]], [[sea cucumber]]s, [[pearl]]s, [[copra]], shells, and [[bird-of-paradise]] feathers.{{rp|18}}

On New , communities were economically linked through trading networks. Despite this, aside from some political alliances, each community functioned largely independently, relying on [[subsistence agriculture]].{{rp|51}} Goods were often traded along established chains, and some villagers would be familiar with and sometimes know the languages of the immediately neighbouring villages (although language by itself was not a marker of political allegiance). Some wider trading networks existed in maritime areas.{{rp|132–133}} While people did not move far along these routes, goods moved long distances through local exchanges, and cultural practices likely diffused along them.{{rp|19–20}} Despite these links, the creation of larger political entities under European rule had no precedent, and in many cases brought together communities that historically had antagonistic relationships, or no relationship at all.{{rp|11}}

===European influence===
It is likely that some ships from  and Southeast Asia visited the island at times, and that there was some contact with New  communities.{{rp|10}} The  explorer [[António de Abreu]] was the first European to discover the island of New .{{rp|152}} [[ discoveries| traders]] introduced the South  [[sweet potato]] to the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]]. From there, it likely spread into what is today  sometime in the 17th or 18th century, initially from the southern coast. It soon spread inland to the highlands, and became a [[staple food]].{{rp|165, 282–283}} The introduction of the sweet potato, possibly alongside other agricultural changes, transformed traditional agriculture and societies. This likely led to the spread of the [[Big man (anthropology)|Big man]] social structure. Sweet potato largely supplanted the previous staple, [[taro]], and led to significant population growth in the highlands.

[[File:New  (1884-1919).png|thumb|left|alt=Flag map showing New  divided between the  (west),  (northeast), and the  (southeast)|New  from 1884 to 1919. [[ colonial empire|]] and [[ Empire|Britain]] controlled the eastern half of New .]]
By the 1800s, there was some trade with the [[ East Indies]]. Beginning in the 1860s, people from New  were effectively taken as slaves to [[Queensland]] and [[]] as part of the [[blackbirding]] trade. This was stopped in 1884. Most of those taken were from coastal Papua. Those who returned to New  brought their experiences with Western culture with them, but the largest impact was the development of a [[Melanesian Pidgin]] that would eventually become the [[Tok Pisin]] language.{{rp|9–10}}

Christianity was introduced to New  on 15 September 1847 when a group of [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marist missionaries]] went to [[Woodlark Island]]. Missions were the primary source of Western culture as well as religion.{{rp|9}} The western half of the island was [[ New |annexed by the ]] in 1848.{{rp|278}} The nearby [[Torres Strait Islands]] were annexed by Queensland in 1878,{{rp|280}} and Queensland attempted to annex some of New  in 1883.{{rp|152}}{{rp|227}} The eastern half of the island was divided between  in the north and the  in the south in 1884.{{rp|302}} The [[ New  Company]] had initially tried to develop plantations, but when this was not successful began to engage in barter trade.{{rp|219–221}} In the  area, gold was found near the [[Mambare River]] in 1895.

Dyer (5708761723).jpg|thumb|alt=Sepia photo of a large crowd around a two-story building, with two raised flags in front of the building|[[ Empire|]] [[annexation]] of southeast New  in 1884]]
In 1888, the  protectorate was annexed by [[|Britain]]. In 1902, Papua was effectively transferred to the authority of the [[Federation of |newly federated]]  [[dominion]] of [[]]. With the passage of the [[Papua Act 1905]], the area was officially renamed the [[Territory of Papua]],{{rp|227}} and the  administration became formal in 1906, with Papua becoming fully annexed as an  territory.{{rp|225}}

Under European rule, social relations amongst the New  population changed. Tribal fighting decreased, while in new urban areas there was greater mixing as people moved to partake in the [[cash crop]] economy. The large inequality between colonial administrators and locals led to the emergence of what colonial governments called [[cargo cult]]s.{{rp|52–53}} One of the most significant impacts was to changes in local travel. Colonial authorities outlawed tribal warfare, and it became normal to move for work, while roads increased the connectivity between inland areas.{{rp|20–22}}

Colonial authorities generally worked with individual village representatives, although neither  nor  authorities developed an effective system of indirect rule.{{rp|209–210}} In  New  [[Tok Pisin]] began to spread through local adoption, and was reluctantly used by  authorities.{{rp|135–137}} In areas under  and then  governance, [[Hiri Motu]], a pidgin version of the [[Motu language]], became established as a ''de facto'' official language.{{rp|137–139}}

Following the outbreak of [[World War I|World War&nbsp;I]] in 1914,  forces [[ occupation of  New |captured  New ]] and occupied it throughout the war. After the end of the war, the [[League of Nations]] authorised  to administer this area as a Class "C" [[League of Nations mandate]] territory from 9 May 1921, which became the [[Territory of New ]].{{rp|152}}{{rp|228}} The Territory of Papua and the new Mandate of New  were administered separately.{{rp|228}} Gold was discovered in [[Bulolo]] in the 1920s, and prospectors searched other areas of the island. The [[New  Highlands|highland valleys]] were explored by prospectors in the 1930s and were found to be inhabited by over a million people.

===World War II and  rule===
[[File:Buna (AWM 014008).jpg|thumb|left|alt=A tank and some infantry walking through knee-high grass dotted with palm trees| forces attack  positions during the [[Battle of Buna–Gona]], 7 January 1943.]]
During [[World War II]],  forces sought to capture Port Moresby, invading overland in mid-1942 and moving south in the [[Kokoda Track campaign]].  forces carried out a number of [[rearguard]] actions as they withdrew almost to Port Moresby. In September an  counter-offensive began, and  forces fought rearguard actions as they retreated north.  forces were supported during this campaign through significant contributions from local soldiers and helpers. While this campaign was ongoing, the  launched the [[Battle of Milne Bay]], where their attack was repulsed by  and  forces. These events, along with the nearby [[Guadalcanal campaign]], marked a turning point in the [[Pacific War]]. A [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] continued until 1944, when allied forces fully recaptured Papua and New . In total, the [[New  campaign]] resulted in the deaths of approximately 216,000 , , and U.S. servicemen on both the mainland and offshore islands.

During the war, the civil government of both territories was suspended and replaced by a joint military government.{{rp|228}} The Second World War punctured the myth of differences between locals and foreigners, and increased the exposure of the population to the wider world and modern social and economic ideas. It also led to significant population movements, beginning the establishment of a common identity shared by those in the two -ruled territories.{{rp|53}} Both Tok Pisin and Hiri Motu became more common to facilitate communication, and were used for radio broadcasts.{{rp|139}} The war was the first time Tok Pisin became widely spread in Papua.{{rp|149, 152}} The joint governance of both territories that was established during the war was continued after the war ended.{{rp|134}}{{rp|302}}

In 1946, New  was declared a [[United Nations trust territories|United Nations trust territory]] under  governance. In 1949 Papuans became  citizens,{{rp|223}} and  [[Papua and New  Act 1949|formally combined]] Papua and New  into the [[Territory of Papua and New ]]. The [[Legislative Council of Papua and New ]] was created in November 1951. Village councils were first created in both Papua and in New  starting 1949, with the number steadily increasing over the years.{{rp|174–175}} These created alternative power structures, which while sometimes filled by traditional leaders, saw the beginning of a shift towards leaders with administrative or business experience.{{rp|211}}

The political aims of  rule were uncertain, with independence and becoming an [[States and territories of | state]] both seen as possible futures.{{rp|303–305}} The 1960s and 1970s saw significant social changes as more of the population began to participate in the formal economy, leading to the development of a more local bureaucracy. Alongside this,  administrators promoted a shared national identity.{{rp|57}}  was introduced by  authorities as a potential unifying language, and many  viewed it as a [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige language]].{{rp|150}}

Aerial surveys in the 1950s found further inhabited valleys in the highlands. The re-establishment of  administration following the war was followed by an expansion of that control, including over the previously mostly uncontrolled highland areas.{{rp|134}}{{rp|303}} Some tribes remained [[Uncontacted peoples|uncontacted]] by Westerners until the 1960s and 1970s.{{rp|149}} The administration of the highlands led to a large expansion of coffee cultivation in the region.{{rp|303}} The [[1964  general election|1964 election]], and the subsequent [[1968  general election|1968 election]], took place alongside campaigns to introduce the political system.{{rp|107}} The leadup to the 1968 election saw the formation of [[Pangu Pati]], the first political party.{{rp|306}}

Mining exploration by [[Rio Tinto (corporation)|Rio Tinto]] in Bougainville began in 1964. In spite of resistance from some local landowners, the [[Bougainville Copper]] corporation was established and began to [[Panguna mine|operate a large mine]]. Resistance became interlinked with a desire for greater autonomy. Bougainville was geographically close to the [[ ]], and its people are more culturally linked to those of the  than to others in the territory. However, the mine was seen as crucial for diversifying the economic base of  from agriculture alone.{{rp|306}}

 Opposition Leader [[Gough Whitlam]] visited  in 1969. Whitlam made self-rule in the territory an election issue, and called for self-governance as early as 1972. In March 1971 [[House of Assembly of Papua and New |the House of Assembly]] recommended that the territory seek self-governance in the next parliament, which was agreed to by .{{rp|110–111}} In June 1971, the flag and emblem were adopted.{{rp|229}} In July, the "and" was removed and the territory was renamed to simply "".

[[File:Copper ore concentrator undergoing construction. Mill building. 2 c. 1971.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Large metal building in front of a mountain with large portions cut out|The [[Panguna mine]] on Bougainville Island in 1971]]
Following the time of Whitlam's first visit, political debate significantly intensified alongside significant social changes.{{rp|306}} At the [[1972  general election]] in July, [[Michael Somare]] was elected as [[Chief Minister of Papua and New |Chief Minister]].{{rp|17}} Somare sought a better relationship with regional movements, which increased the number of local groups, but also decreased their salience and encouraged them to join the national political system.{{rp|75–77}} In December, Whitlam was elected as Prime Minister at the [[1972  federal election]]. The [[Whitlam government]] then instituted self-governance in late 1973. The [[ kina|kina]] was introduced as a separate currency in April 1975.{{rp|377}}

The push for independence was driven by internal policies of the Whitlam government, rather than responding to particular calls from .{{rp|224}} The concept of a "country" remained foreign to many in the territory, and there was no strong shared national identity.{{rp|229}} In the early 1970s there were fears that independence would allow for large tribes to dominate others, and create more risk of foreign land acquisition. The subsequent creation of a local consensus for independence was due to the actions of local political leaders. On 1 September 1975, shortly before the scheduled date of  independence, the government of Bougainville itself [[Republic of the North Solomons|declared independence]].{{rp|72}}{{rp|45}} Payments to the province were suspended in response. Other regional movements emerged prior to independence. The [[Papua Besena]] party sought to separate the territory of Papua from New , while the [[Highlands Liberation Front]] sought to prevent dominance of highland areas by the coast. Smaller groups advocated for the creation of new provinces.{{rp|72–74}} Nonetheless, the [[ Independence Act 1975]] passed in September 1975, setting 16 September 1975 as the date of independence.{{rp|45}} Somare continued as the country's first Prime Minister.

===Independence===
[[File:Michael Somare 1973.jpg|thumb|alt=Michael Somare sitting at a desk speaking with an out of focus microphone in front of the shot|[[Michael Somare]] in 1973 alongside [[Bill Morrison (politician)|Bill Morrison]], Minister for External Territories of the [[Whitlam government]]]]
Upon independence, most  officials, including agricultural, economic, educational, and medicinal staff, left the territory. Very little training had been provided to their successors. This led to a restructuring and a loss of efficiency, particularly in serving rural areas.{{rp|18}} By the 1980s, the civil service, including the military, had become politicised, decreasing effectiveness and accountability.{{rp|13}}

The voting system was changed to [[first past the post]], as an unsuccessful attempt to encourage the development of a [[two-party system]] with clearly defined political parties.{{rp|3}} National governments changed through constitutional means. Somare retained the prime ministership following the [[1977  general election|1977 election]], and was ousted through a vote of no confidence in 1980 and was replaced by [[Julius Chan]]. Somare became prime minister again following the [[1982  general election|1982 election]], but lost another vote of no confidence in 1985.{{rp|18, 20}}

Although an August 1976 agreement with the national government resolved the initial declaration of independence,{{rp|45}} the issue of Bougainville persisted past independence. A secessionist movement in 1975–76 on [[Bougainville Island]] resulted in a modification of the [[Constitution of ]], with the [[Organic Law on Provincial Government]] legally devolving power to the 19 provinces.{{rp|179}}{{rp|26}} Following instances of provincial government mismanagement, Somare's proposal to reduce provincial government power brought further threats of secession from some of the country's [[Islands Region|island provinces]].{{rp|189}}{{rp|27}}{{rp|257}}

While warfare significantly decreased under  governance, tribal fighting in the highland areas increased in the 1970s. These areas had been under outside control for less time, meaning former tribal conflict was still remembered and restarted upon independence. The first state of emergency there was declared in 1979, although it and similar interventions did not quell the violence. Unemployment and imbalanced gender ratios in cities meant tribal fighting morphed into the [[Raskol gangs|emergence of gangs]]. Gang violence led to a state of emergency in Port Moresby in 1984, which led to the intervention of the [[ Defence Force]] (PNGDF). The effectiveness of this deployment led to further [[Royal  Constabulary|police]] and military interventions elsewhere. Both the police and military became more politicised, and less disciplined. Demand for private security increased as a response, and foreign investment was deterred.{{rp|29, 32}}{{rp|8–9}}{{rp|260–261, 264, 270}}{{rp|239–241}} In 1995, provincial governments were reformed, becoming made up of relevant national MPs and a number of appointed members. Some of their responsibilities were devolved towards local governments, a factor that caused significant controversy due to an expected lack of capacity at this level. This lack of capacity has meant that national MPs gained significant powers at the local level.{{rp|174}}{{rp|11}}

The employment needs of the Bougainville mine decreased after construction was completed, meaning younger individuals received little benefit from the presence of the mine. A renewed [[Bougainville conflict|uprising on Bougainville]] started in 1988, fighting against both the Bougainville government and the national government. After the mine closed in May 1989, the [[Bougainville Revolutionary Army]] (BRA) declared independence, and the national government pulled out in 1990 and blockaded the province, the conflict shifted into a complex internal civil war. National security forces re-entered the island at the end of 1990, and together with local allies slowly gained more control.{{rp|266–267}} An agreement between the government and some rebels was reached in October 1994, and in 1995 a transitional Bougainville government was established, although fighting continued with the BRA. In 1997, the [[Sandline affair]] over the hiring of mercenaries to intervene in Bougainville brought down the national government. Following -mediated peace talks, a ceasefire was reached in January 1998.{{rp|12}}

The first decade of independence saw slow but steady economic growth. The [[Ok Tedi Mine]] opened in 1982. While  contribution to the budget dropped from 40% of government revenue in 1975 to 17% in 1988, improved taxation allowed for government expenditure to be maintained.{{rp|312–313}} The closure of the Bougainville mine led to issues with government finances, however an expansion of exports of oil, minerals, and forestry products led to economic recovery in the early 1990s. This growth did not decrease inequality however, and government services declined.{{rp|263–264}} Increasing government expense and resulting rising debt led to [[1994  financial crisis|significant economic trouble]]. The [[ kina]] was devalued and put on a [[floating exchange rate]] in 1994, and the country obtained an emergency loan from the [[World Bank]] in 1995.{{rp|313–314}}

In the [[1997  general election|1997 election]], only 4 candidates won overall majorities, with 95 (87%) of winners receiving less than 30% of the vote. After government changed mid-parliament in 1999, a Constitutional Development Commission was established to bring about political reform. The resulting [[Organic Law on the Integrity of Political Parties and Candidates]] created public funding for registered parties, incentivised the selection of female candidates, and instituted punishments for [[Party switching|party hopping]]. It also barred independent MPs from voting for the prime minister, or from joining coalitions before a prime minister is elected.{{rp|3–7}} Another measure was to begin a shift from first past the post to a Limited Preferential Vote system (LPV), a version of the [[instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]].{{rp|17}}{{rp|2}}

The [[Bougainville Peace Agreement]] was signed in 2001, under which Bougainville would gain higher autonomy than other provinces, and an independence referendum would be held in the future. The [[2002  general election|2002 election]] saw an uptick in violence.  police were brought to PNG to help train PNG police in 2004. While most left the next year after a Supreme Court ruling, this began a long-term  police presence in the country. In 2009, Parliament approved the creation of two additional provinces: [[Hela Province]], consisting of part of the existing [[Southern Highlands Province]], and [[Jiwaka Province]], formed by dividing [[Western Highlands Province]].

In 2011, there was a [[2011–2012  constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] between the parliament-elect Prime Minister, [[Peter O'Neill]] (voted into office by a large majority of MPs), and Somare, who was deemed by the supreme court to retain office. The parliament voted to delay the upcoming elections, however they did not have the constitutional authority to do this, and the [[ Electoral Commission]] continued to prepare.{{rp|207–211}} The [[2012  general election|2012 national elections]] went ahead as scheduled, and O'Neill was once again elected as prime minister by a majority of parliament. Somare joined O'Neill's government, charges against the court judges and others who supported Somare were dropped, and legislation asserting control of the judiciary and that affecting the office of the prime minister was repealed.{{rp|207–211}}

[[Liquefied natural gas]] exports [[Natural gas in |began in 2014]], however falling prices as well as lower oil prices meant that government revenue was lower than expected. The debt-to-GDP ratio rose, and as of 2019, 's HDI rating was the lowest in the Pacific.{{rp|4}} In March 2015 the [[Bougainville Mining Act]] shifted control over mining from the national government to the Bougainville government. It also stated that minerals belonged to [[customary land]]owners rather than the state, giving landowners veto power over future extraction.

The 2012–2017 O'Neill government was dogged by corruption scandals. The [[2017  general election|2017 general election]] saw O'Neill return as prime minister, although initially with a smaller coalition. This election saw widespread voter intimidation in some regions, and delays in the reporting of seat results.{{rp|253–255}} Financial scandals, as well as criticism of the purchase of expensive cars for [[APEC  2018]] meeting, created pressure on O'Neill and led to defections from government.{{rp|255–258}} In May 2019, O'Neill resigned as prime minister and was replaced by [[James Marape]].

The government set 23 November 2019 as the voting date for [[2019 Bougainvillean independence referendum|a non-binding independence referendum]] in the [[Autonomous Region of Bougainville|Bougainville autonomous region]]. Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence (98.31%). Prime Minister James Marape's [[Pangu Pati|PANGU]] Party secured the most seats of any party in the [[2022  general election|2022 election]], enabling him to continue as PNG's Prime Minister.

{{Main|History of }}

The [[Nilotic]] people of —the [[Dinka people|Dinka]], [[Anuak people|Anyuak]], [[Bari people|Bari]], [[Acholi people|Acholi]], [[Nuer people|Nuer]], [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]], [[Kaligi people|Kaligi]] (Arabic Feroghe), and others—first entered  sometime before the tenth century, coinciding with the fall of [[medieval ]]. From the 15th to the 19th century, tribal migrations, largely from the area of [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of )|Bahr el Ghazal]], brought the Anyuak, Dinka, Nuer, and Shilluk to their modern locations in Bahr El Ghazal and the Upper Nile Region, while the Acholi and Bari settled in [[Equatoria]]. The [[Zande people|Zande]], [[Mundu people|Mundu]], [[Avukaya]] and [[Baka people ( and )|Baka]], who entered  in the 16th century, established the region's largest state of Equatoria Region.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

Of 's ethnic, groups the Dinka are the largest, the Nuer the second-largest, the Zande the third-largest, and the Bari the fourth-largest. They are found in the [[Maridi]], [[Yambio]], and Tombura districts in the [[tropical rainforest]] belt of [[Western Equatoria]], the Adio of Azande client in [[Yei]], [[Central Equatoria]], and [[Western Bahr el Ghazal]]. In the 18th century, the Avungara [[Sib (anthropology)|sib]] rose to power over the rest of Azande society, a domination that continued into the 20th century.  policies favouring Christian missionaries, such as the Closed District Ordinance of 1922 (see [[History of Anglo- ]]), and geographical barriers such as the swamplands along the [[White Nile]] curtailed the spread of Islam to the south, thus allowing the southern tribes to retain much of their political and religious institutions.

 colonial policy in  had a long history of emphasising the development of the Arabised north and largely ignoring the non-Arabised south, which lacked schools, hospitals, roads, bridges, and other basic infrastructure. After 's first independent elections in 1958, the continued neglect of the southern region by the [[Khartoum]] government led to uprisings, revolts, and the longest civil war on the continent. People affected by the violence included the Dinka, Nuer, Shilluk, Anyuak, [[Murle people|Murle]], Bari, [[Mundari people|Mundari]], Baka, [[Balanda Bviri]], [[Boya people|Boya]], [[Didinga]], [[Jiye people|Jiye]], [[Kakwa people|Kakwa]], Kaligi, [[Kuku people|Kuku]], [[Lotuka]], Nilotic, [[Toposa people|Toposa]], and Zande.

The Azande/Zande have had good relations with their neighbours, namely the [[Moru people|Moru]], Mundu, [[Pojulu people|Pöjulu]], Avukaya, Baka, and the small groups in Bahr el Ghazal, due to the expansionist policy of their king [[Gbudwe]], in the 18th century. In the 19th century, the Azande fought the , the [[|]] and the [[Muhammad Ahmed|Mahdists]] to maintain their independence. [[Ottoman ]], under the rule of [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail Pasha]], first attempted to control the region in the 1870s, establishing the province of [[Equatoria]] in the southern portion. 's first appointed governor was [[Samuel Baker]], commissioned in 1869, followed by [[Charles George Gordon]] in 1874, and by [[Emin Pasha]] in 1878.

The [[Muhammad Ahmed|Mahdist Revolt]] of the 1880s destabilised the nascent province, and Equatoria ceased to exist as an  outpost in 1889. Important settlements in Equatoria included [[Lado District|Lado]], [[Gondokoro]], [[Dufile]], and [[Wadelai]]. European colonial manoeuvrings in the region came to a head in 1898, when the [[Fashoda Incident]] occurred at present-day [[Kodok]]; Britain and  almost went to war over the region. Britain then treated  as a distinct entity with a different stage of development than the North. This policy was legalised in 1930 by the announcement of the Southern Policy. In 1946, without consulting Southern opinion, the  administration reversed its Southern Policy and began instead to implement a policy of uniting the North and the South.

The region has been negatively affected [[ wars of independence|by two civil wars]] since  independence: from 1955 to 1972, the  government fought the [[Anyanya]] rebel army (Anya-Nya is a term in the [[Madi language ( and )|Madi]] language which means "snake venom") during the [[First  Civil War]], followed by the [[ People's Liberation Army/Movement]] (SPLA/M) in the [[Second  Civil War]] for over twenty years, from 1983 to 2005. As a result, the country suffered serious neglect, a lack of infrastructure development, and major destruction and displacement. More than 2.5 million people have been killed, and millions more have become [[refugee]]s both within and outside the country.

 has an estimated population of 12.7 million people in 2024, but, given the lack of a census in several decades, this estimate may be severely distorted. The economy is predominantly rural and relies chiefly on [[subsistence farming]]. Around 2005, the economy began a transition from this rural dominance, and urban areas within  have seen extensive development.

===Independence (2011)===
[[File:A  girl at independence festivities (5926735716).jpg|thumb|upright|A  girl at independence festivities]]

Between 9 and 15 January 2011, as a consequence of the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]], the [[2011  independence referendum| independence referendum]] was held to determine whether  should become an independent country, separate from . Following that, 98.83% of those who took part in the referendum voted for separation or independence. And on 23 January 2011, members of a steering committee on post-independence governing told reporters that upon independence the land would be named the Republic of  "out of familiarity and convenience". Other names that had been considered were [[Azania]], Nile Republic, [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] Republic and even Juwama, a [[portmanteau]] for [[Juba (Southern )|Juba]], [[Wau, |Wau]] and [[Malakal]], three major cities.  formally became independent from  on 9 July, although certain disputes still remained, including the division of oil revenues, as 75% of all the former 's oil reserves are in . As of March 2025, the region of [[Abyei]] still remains disputed. A separate referendum was to be held in Abyei on whether they want to join  or ; however an official referendum was never held. The [[South Kordofan conflict]] broke out in June 2011 between the [[ People's Armed Forces|Army of ]] and the SPLA over the [[Nuba Mountains]].

On 9 July 2011,  became the 54th independent country in Africa (9 July is now celebrated as [[List of national independence days|Independence Day]], a national holiday) and since 14 July 2011,  is the 193rd member of the [[United Nations]]. On 27 July 2011,  became the 54th country to join the [[African Union]]. In September 2011, [[Google Maps]] recognised  as an independent country, after a massive crowdsourcing mapping initiative was launched.

In 2011 it was reported that  was at war with at least seven armed groups in 9 of its 10 states, with tens of thousands displaced. The fighters accuse the government of plotting to stay in power indefinitely, not fairly representing and supporting all tribal groups while neglecting development in rural areas. The [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA) also operates in a wide area that includes .

Inter-ethnic warfare in some cases predates the war of independence and is widespread. In December 2011, [[Ethnic violence in #Murle-Nuer fighting|tribal clashes]] intensified between the [[Nuer White Army]] of the [[Luo peoples|Lou]] [[Nuer people|Nuer]] and the [[Murle people|Murle]]. The White Army warned it would wipe out the Murle and would also fight  and [[United Nations Mission in |UN forces]] sent to the area around [[Pibor]].

In March 2012,  forces seized the [[Heglig]] oil fields in lands claimed by both  and  in the province of [[South Kordofan]] after [[2012 – border conflict|conflict with  forces]] in the  state of [[Unity (state)|Unity]].  withdrew on 20 March, and the  Army entered Heglig two days later.

On 5 September 2013, an article written by analyst Duop Chak Wuol was published by the US-based  News Agency (SSNA). The writer raised critical questions surrounding what he described as the rise of autocracy within the top leadership of the  People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) and warned of monumental repercussions unless the ruling elites restored the founding principles of the party. Duop also berated the ruling party, arguing that the party has replaced its founding principles with "forgotten promises and deceptions". In December 2013, a political power struggle broke out between President Kiir and his former deputy [[Riek Machar]], as the president accused Machar and ten others of attempting a [[2013  coup d'état attempt|coup d'état]]. Fighting broke out, igniting the [[ Civil War]].  troops were deployed to fight alongside  government forces against the rebels. The United Nations has peacekeepers in the country as part of the [[United Nations Mission in ]] (UNMISS). Numerous ceasefires were mediated by the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]] (IGAD) between the  People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) and [[SPLM-IO|SPLM – in opposition]] and were subsequently broken. A peace agreement was signed in  under threat of United Nations sanctions for both sides in August 2015. Machar returned to Juba in 2016 and was appointed vice-president. Following a second break-out of violence in Juba, Machar was replaced as vice-president and he fled the country as the conflict erupted again. Rebel in-fighting has become a major part of the conflict. Rivalry among Dinka factions led by the President and Malong Awan has also led to fighting. In August 2018, another power-sharing agreement came into effect.

About 400,000 people are estimated to have been killed in the war, including notable atrocities such as the [[2014 Bentiu massacre]]. Although both men have supporters from across 's ethnic divides, subsequent fighting has been communal, with rebels targeting members of Kiir's Dinka ethnic group and government soldiers attacking Nuers. More than 4 million people have been displaced, with about 1.8 million of those internally displaced, and about 2.5 million having fled to neighbouring countries, especially  and .

On 20 February 2020, [[Salva Kiir Mayardit]] and [[Riek Machar]] agreed to a peace deal; further, a [[Cabinet of |national unity government]] on 22 February 2020, as Machar was sworn in as the [[Vice President of |First Vice-President]] of the country.

Despite the official cessation of the civil war, violence between armed militia groups at the community level has continued in the country; according to [[Yasmin Sooka]], Chair of the Commission of Human Rights in , the level of violence "far exceeds the violence between 2013 and 2019".

=== Admission into the EAC and planned democratic elections (2016–present) ===
 acceded to the Treaty of the [[East African Community|East Africa Community]] on 15 April 2016 and became a full member on 15 August 2016. , [[|Democratic Republic of ]] and [[Federal Republic of ]] are the newest members of the [[East African Community]].

The [[2024  general election|first democratic elections in  since the start of the civil war]] were scheduled for 2023 by the peace agreement that ended the war officially, but the transitional government and opposition agreed in 2022 to move them to late 2024 instead. In September 2024, Kiir's office announced that the elections would be postponed an additional two years, to December 2026.

=== 2017 famine ===
{{Further|2017  famine}}
On 20 February 2017,  and the United Nations declared a [[famine]] in parts of former [[Unity State]], with the warning that it could spread rapidly without further action. Over 100,000 people were affected. The [[UN World Food Programme]] said that 40% of the population of , 4.9 million people, need food urgently. U.N. officials said that President [[Salva Kiir Mayardit]] was blocking food deliveries to some areas. Furthermore, UNICEF warned that more than 1 million children in  were subjected to malnutrition.

An outbreak of [[fall armyworm]] further threatened [[sorghum]] and maize production by July 2017.

===2025 tensions===
In early March, [[2025 Nasir clashes|clashes]] between the Army and the rebel [[Nuer White Army]] in the town of [[Nasir, |Nasir]] left dozens dead. On 26 March 2025, Vice-President Riek Machar was arrested on orders of President Salva Kiir claiming he had instigated and supported the White Army, despite the White Army denying any ties. The arrest was met by a response from the [[SPLM-IO]] stating such an act violates the ceasefire that ended the  civil war in 2020. Machar's arrest was accompanied by the mass sacking of his supporters, and the arrival of a unit from the [[ armed forces]] invited into the country by Kiir to help fight against the White Army.

UN Secretary-General [[Antonio Guterres]] stated that the "peace agreement is in shambles" and  is on "the edge of a collapse into civil war" while the [[African Union]] has sent a delegation to try to deescalate the conflict.
