[[African Pygmies|Pygmies]] likely once lived in the continental region that is now , but are today found only in isolated pockets in southern Río Muni. [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] migrations likely started around 2,000 BC from between south-east  and north-west  (the Grassfields). They must have settled continental  around 500 BC at the latest. The earliest settlements on Bioko Island are dated to AD 530. The [[Annobonese Creole|Annobón]] population, originally native to [[]], was introduced by the  via [[São Tomé island]].

=== First European contact and  rule (1472–1778) ===
[[File:1729 West Africa map ( & ).jpg|thumb|left|[[ Empire|]] rule in  lasted from the arrival of [[Fernão do Pó]] (Fernando Pó) in 1472 until the [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|1778 Treaty of El Pardo]]]]

The [[ Empire| explorer]] [[Fernão do Pó|Fernando Pó]], seeking a path to , is credited as being the first European to see the island of Bioko, in 1472. He called it ''Formosa'' ("Beautiful"), but it quickly took on the name of its European discoverer. [[Fernando Pó (island)|Fernando Pó]] and Annobón were colonized by  in 1474. The first factories were established on the islands around 1500 as the  quickly recognized the positives of the islands including volcanic soil and disease-resistant highlands. Despite natural advantages, initial  efforts in 1507 to establish a sugarcane plantation and town near what is now Concepción on Fernando Pó failed due to Bubi hostility and fever.

===Early  rule and lease to Britain (1778–1844)===
[[File:África Ecuatorial Española.svg|thumb|left|Evolution of  possessions and claims in the Gulf of , 1778–1968 (in )]]

In 1778,  and  signed the [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|Treaty of El Pardo]]. The treaty ceded [[Bioko]] and adjacent islets along with commercial rights to the [[Bight of Bonny|Bight of Biafra]] between the [[ River|]] and [[Ogoue River|Ogoue rivers]] to  in exchange for large areas of modern-day western [[]] being ceded to . [[Brigadier]] [[Felipe José, Count of Arjelejos]] of the [[ Navy]] formally took possession of Bioko from  on 21 October 1778. While sailing to Annobón to take possession of it, Arjelejos died from a tropical disease contracted on Bioko and his fever-ridden crew mutinied. The crew, after having lost over 80% of their men to sickness, instead landed on São Tomé where they were imprisoned by  colonial authorities. 

As a result of this disaster,  was subsequently hesitant to invest heavily in its new possession. However, despite such a setback,  merchants began to use the island as a base for engaging in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Between 1778 and 1810, the territory of what became  was administered by the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]], based in [[Buenos Aires]]. Unwilling to significantly invest in the development of Fernando Pó, from 1827 to 1843 the  leased a base in [[Bioko]] to the [[ of Great Britain and |]], which the  had sought as part of their efforts to suppress the slave trade. 

In the same year the  leased the base in Bioko, Britain unilaterally moved the headquarters of the [[Mixed Commission for the Suppression of Slave Traffic]] to Fernando Pó in 1827, before moving it back to [[]] under an agreement with  in 1843. 's decision to abolish its involvement in the slave trade under  pressure in 1817 damaged the colony's perceived value to the  and so leasing naval bases was an effective revenue earner from an otherwise unprofitable possession. Plans by  to sell its African colony to Britain was cancelled in 1841 due to opposition from  politicians and the public.

=== Late 19th century (1844–1900) ===
[[File:(1897) Golfo de .jpg|thumb|Map of the  possessions in 1897, before the [[Treaty of Paris (1900)]]]]

In 1844, the  returned the island to  control and the area became known as the "Territorios Españoles del Golfo de ". Due to epidemics,  did not invest much in the colony, and in 1862, an outbreak of [[yellow fever]] killed many of the whites that had settled on the island. Despite this, plantations continued to be established by private citizens through the second half of the 19th century.

The [[plantation]]s of [[Bioko|Fernando Pó]] were mostly run by a black [[Creole elite]], later known as [[Fernandino peoples|Fernandinos]]. The  settled some 2,000  and freed slaves there during their rule, and a trickle of immigration from West Africa and the West Indies continued after the  left. A number of freed  slaves, -African creoles and immigrants from , and  also began to be settled in the colony, where they quickly began to join the new group. To the local mix were added , , Jews and Spaniards of various colours, many of whom had been deported to Africa for political or other crimes, as well as some settlers backed by the government.

By 1870, the prognosis of whites that lived on the island was much improved after recommendations that they live in the highlands, and by 1884 much of the minimal administrative machinery and key plantations had moved to [[Pico Basilé|Basile]] hundreds of meters above sea level. [[Henry Morton Stanley]] had labeled Fernando Pó "a jewel which  did not " for refusing to enact such a policy. Despite the improved survival chances of Europeans living on the island, [[Mary Kingsley]], who was staying on the island, still described Fernando Pó as "a more uncomfortable form of execution" for Spaniards appointed there.

There was also a trickle of immigration from the neighboring  islands, escaped slaves, and prospective planters. Although a few of the [[Fernandino peoples|Fernandinos]] were Catholic and -speaking, about nine-tenths of them were Protestant and -speaking on the eve of the First World War, and [[pidgin ]] was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the island. The  were particularly well placed as planters while labor recruitment on the [[|Windward coast]] continued. The Fernandinos became traders and middlemen between the natives and Europeans. A freed slave from the West Indies by way of [[]] named William Pratt established the cocoa crop on Fernando Pó.

 had not occupied the large area in the [[Bight of Biafra]] to which it had right by [[treaty]], and the  had expanded their occupation at the expense of the territory claimed by . Madrid only partly backed the explorations of men like [[Manuel Iradier]] who had signed treaties in the interior as far as  and , leaving much of the land out of "effective occupation" as demanded by the terms of the 1885 [[Berlin Conference]]. Minimal government backing for mainland annexation came as a result of public opinion and a need for labour on Fernando Pó.

The eventual [[Treaty of Paris (1900)|treaty of Paris]] in 1900 left  with the continental [[enclave and exclave|enclave]] of Río Muni, only 26,000&nbsp;km{{sup|2}} out of the 300,000km{{sup|2}} stretching east to the [[Ubangi River|Ubangi river]] which the Spaniards had initially claimed. The humiliation of the Franco- negotiations, combined with the disaster in  led to the head of the  negotiating team, [[Pedro Gover y Tovar]], committing suicide on the voyage home on 21 October 1901. Iradier himself died in despair in 1911; decades later, the port of [[Cogo, |Cogo]] was renamed Puerto Iradier in his honour.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Land regulations issued in 1904–1905 favoured Spaniards, and most of the later big planters arrived from  after that.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} An agreement was made with  in 1914 to import cheap labor. Due to malpractice however, the  government eventually ended the treaty after revelations about the state of  workers on Fernando Pó in the Christy Report which brought down the country's president [[Charles D. B. King]] in 1930.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

[[File:Corisco-Saliendo de misa-1910.jpg|thumb|[[Corisco]] in 1910]]By the late nineteenth century, the Bubi were protected from the demands of the planters by  [[Claretians|Claretian]] missionaries, who were very influential in the colony and eventually organised the Bubi into little mission theocracies reminiscent of the famous [[Jesuit]] [[Reducciones|reductions]] in [[]]. Catholic penetration was furthered by two small insurrections in 1898 and 1910 protesting [[conscription]] of [[Forced labor|forced labour]] for the plantations. The Bubi were disarmed in 1917, and left dependent on the missionaries. Serious labour shortages were temporarily solved by a massive influx of refugees from  [[Kamerun]], along with thousands of white  soldiers who stayed on the island for several years.

Between 1926 and 1959, Bioko and Río Muni were united as the colony of [[ ]]. The economy was based on large [[cocoa bean|cacao]] and [[coffee]] plantations and [[logging]] concessions and the workforce was mostly immigrant [[contract labour]] from [[]], [[]], and [[Cameroun]]. Between 1914 and 1930, an estimated 10,000  went to Fernando Po under a labour treaty that was stopped altogether in 1930. With  workers no longer available, planters of Fernando Po turned to Río Muni. Campaigns were mounted to subdue the [[Fang people]] in the 1920s, at the time that  was beginning to cut back on recruitment. There were garrisons of the colonial guard throughout the enclave by 1926, and the whole colony was considered 'pacified' by 1929.

The [[ Civil War]] had a major impact on the colony. A group of 150  whites, including the Governor-General and Vice-Governor-General of Río Muni, created a socialist party called the Popular Front in the enclave which served to oppose the interests of the Fernando Pó plantation owners. When the War broke out [[Francisco Franco]] ordered Nationalist forces based in the Canaries to ensure control over . In September 1936, Nationalist forces backed by Falangists from Fernando Pó took control of Río Muni, which under Governor-General Luiz Sanchez Guerra Saez and his deputy Porcel had backed the Republican government. By November, the Popular Front and its supporters had been defeated and  secured for Franco. The commander in charge of the occupation, Juan Fontán Lobé, was appointed Governor-General by Franco and began to exert more  control over the enclave interior.

Río Muni officially had a little over 100,000 people in the 1930s; escape into [[Cameroun]] or [[]] was easy. Fernando Pó thus continued to suffer from labour shortages. The  only briefly permitted recruitment in Cameroun, and the main source of labour came to be [[Igbo people|Igbo]] smuggled in canoes from [[Calabar]] in [[]]. This resolution led to Fernando Pó becoming one of Africa's most productive agricultural areas after the [[Second World War]].

=== Final years of  rule (1945–1968) ===

Politically, post-war colonial history has three fairly distinct phases: up to 1959, when its status was raised from "colonial" to "provincial", following the approach of the [[ Empire]]; between 1960 and 1968, when Madrid attempted a partial [[decolonisation]] aimed at keeping the territory as part of the  system; and from 1968 on, after the territory became an independent [[republic]]. The first phase consisted of little more than a continuation of previous policies; these closely resembled the policies of  and , notably in dividing the population into a vast majority governed as 'natives' or non-citizens, and a very small minority (together with whites) admitted to civic status as ''[[emancipados]]'', [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] to the metropolitan culture being the only permissible means of advancement.

This "provincial" phase saw the beginnings of [[nationalism]], but chiefly among small groups who had taken refuge from the ''[[Caudillo]]''{{'}}s paternal hand in Cameroun and . They formed two bodies: the [[Atanasio Ndongo Miyone|Movimiento Nacional de Liberación de la ]] (MONALIGE), and the [[Idea Popular de  Ecuatorial]] (IPGE). By the late 1960s, much of the African continent had been granted independence. Aware of this trend, the  began to increase efforts to prepare the country for independence. The [[Gross national income|gross national product]] per capita in 1965 was $466, which was the highest in black Africa; the  constructed an international airport at Santa Isabel, a television station and increased the literacy rate to 89%. In 1967, the number of hospital beds per capita in  was higher than  itself, with 1637 beds in 16 hospitals. By the end of colonial rule, the number of Africans in higher education was in only the double digits.

A decision of 9 August 1963, approved by a referendum of 15 December 1963, gave the territory a measure of autonomy and the administrative promotion of a 'moderate' group, the {{Interlanguage link|Movimiento de Unión Nacional de  Ecuatorial|es}} (MUNGE). This was unsuccessful, and, with growing pressure for change from the UN, Madrid was gradually forced to give way to the currents of nationalism. Two General Assembly resolutions were passed in 1965 ordering  to grant independence to the colony, and in 1966, a UN Commission toured the country before recommending the same thing. In response, the  declared that they would hold a constitutional convention on 27 October 1967 to negotiate a new constitution for an independent . The conference was attended by 41 local delegates and 25 Spaniards. The Africans were principally divided between Fernandinos and Bubi on one side, who feared a loss of privileges and 'swamping' by the Fang majority, and the Río Muni Fang nationalists on the other. At the conference, the leading Fang figure, the later first president [[Francisco Macías Nguema]], gave a controversial speech in which he claimed that [[Adolf Hitler]] had "saved Africa". After nine sessions, the conference was suspended due to deadlock between the "unionists" and "separatists" who wanted a separate Fernando Pó. Macías resolved to travel to the UN to bolster international awareness of the issue, and his firebrand speeches in New York contributed to  naming a date for both independence and general elections. In July 1968 virtually all Bubi leaders went to the UN in New York to try and raise awareness for their cause, but the world community was uninterested in quibbling over the specifics of colonial independence. The 1960s were a time of great optimism over the future of the former African colonies, and groups that had been close to European rulers, like the Bubi, were not viewed positively.

=== Independence under Macías (1968–1979) ===
[[File:Don Francisco Macias.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francisco Macías Nguema]], first [[president of ]] in 1968, became a dictator until he was overthrown in a coup d'état in 1979.]]
Independence from  was gained on 12 October 1968, at noon in the capital, Malabo. The new country became the Republic of  (the date is celebrated as the country's [[List of national independence days|Independence Day]]). Macías became president in the country's [[1968   general election|only free and fair election to date]]. The  (ruled by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]) had backed Macías in the election; much of his campaigning involved visiting rural areas of Río Muni and promising that they would have the houses and wives of the  if they voted for him.{{cn|date=March 2025}} He had won in the second round of voting.

During the [[ Civil War]], Fernando Pó was inhabited by many Biafra-supporting Ibo migrant workers and many refugees from the breakaway state fled to the island. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] began running relief flights out of , but Macías quickly shut the flights down, refusing to allow them to fly diesel fuel for their trucks nor oxygen tanks for medical operations. The Biafran separatists were starved into submission without international backing.

After the Public Prosecutor complained about "excesses and maltreatment" by government officials, Macías had 150 alleged coup-plotters executed in a purge on Christmas Eve 1969, all of whom were political opponents. Macias Nguema further consolidated his [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian powers]] by [[One-party state|outlawing opposition political parties]] in July 1970 and making himself [[president for life]] in 1972. He broke off ties with  and the West. In spite of his condemnation of [[Marxism]], which he deemed "[[Neo-colonialism|neo-colonialist]]",  maintained special relations with [[communist state]]s, notably , , [[East ]] and the [[USSR]]. Macias Nguema signed a preferential [[trade agreement]] and a shipping treaty with the Soviet Union. The Soviets also made loans to . The shipping agreement gave the Soviets permission for a pilot [[fishery]] development project and also a naval base at [[Luba, |Luba]]. In return, the USSR was to supply fish to .  and  also gave different forms of financial, military, and technical assistance to , which got them a measure of influence there. For the USSR, there was an advantage to be gained in the [[ Civil War|war in ]] from access to Luba base and later on to [[Malabo International Airport]].

In 1974, the [[World Council of Churches]] affirmed that large numbers of people had been murdered since 1968 in an ongoing [[revolutionary terror|reign of terror]]. A quarter of the entire population had fled abroad, they said, while 'the prisons are overflowing and to all intents and purposes form one vast concentration camp'. Out of a population of 300,000, an estimated 80,000 were killed. Apart from allegedly committing [[genocide]] against the ethnic minority [[Bubi people]], Macias Nguema ordered the deaths of thousands of suspected opponents, closed down churches and presided over the economy's collapse as skilled citizens and foreigners fled the country.

=== Obiang (1979–present) ===
[[File:Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo with Obamas 2014.jpg|thumb|Obiang and U.S. president [[Barack Obama|Obama]] with their wives in 2014]]
The nephew of Macías Nguema, [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo|Teodoro Obiang]] deposed his uncle on 3 August 1979, in a bloody ''[[1979  coup d'état|coup d'état]]''; over two weeks of civil war ensued until Macías Nguema was captured. He was tried and executed soon afterward, with Obiang succeeding him as a less bloody, but still authoritarian president.

In 1995, [[Mobil]], an  oil company, discovered oil in . The country subsequently experienced rapid economic development, but earnings from the country's oil wealth have not reached the population and the country ranks low on the UN human development index. 7.9% of children die before the age of 5, and more than 50% of the population lacks access to clean [[drinking water]]. Obiang is widely suspected of using the country's oil wealth to enrich himself and his associates. In 2006, ''Forbes'' estimated his personal wealth at $600 million.

In 2011, the government announced it was planning a new capital for the country, named [[Ciudad de la Paz|Oyala]]. The city was renamed [[Ciudad de la Paz]] ("City of Peace") in 2017.

{{as of|2016|February|}}, Obiang was Africa's second-longest serving dictator.  was elected as a non-permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council]] 2018–2019. On 7 March 2021, there were [[2021 Bata explosions|munition explosions]] at a military base near the city of [[Bata, |Bata]], causing 107 deaths. In November 2022, Obiang was re-elected in the [[2022 Equatorial  general election]] with 99.7% of the vote amid accusations of fraud by the opposition.

In 2024 it was published that mercenaries from the [[Wagner Group]] (now called "Africa Corps") had entered  at the request of Teodoro Obiang. According to opponents, the objective of the mercenaries was to help consolidate a hypothetical succession of Obiang's power to his son "[[Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue|Teodorín]]".

On 19 May 2025 the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) granted  sovereignty over [[Mbanie Island]], Cocoteros Island, and Conga Island in response to territorial claims that neighboring [[]] had been making since 1972.

On 10 November 2025 it was reported that the [[second Trump administration]] had sent $7.5M to the government of  to accept non-citizen deportees from the , an amount far exceeding the total amount of U.S. aid sent to the country in the past eight years according to Sen. [[Jeanne Shaheen]] of New Hampshire.
