===Prehistory===
{{Main|Prehistory of }}

The oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now  date from approximately 1.8&nbsp;million years ago. [[Neanderthal]]s occupied the region into the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era but were slowly replaced by ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'' around 35,000 BC. This period witnessed the emergence of [[cave painting]] in the [[Dordogne]] and [[Pyrenees]], including at [[Lascaux]], dated to {{Circa|18,000}} BC. At the end of the [[Last Glacial Period]] (10,000 BC), the climate became milder; from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of Western Europe entered the [[Neolithic]] era, and its inhabitants became [[Sedentism|sedentary]].

After demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia BC, [[Three-age system|metallurgy appeared]], initially working gold, [[Chalcolithic|copper]] and [[Bronze Age|bronze]], then later [[Iron Age|iron]].  has numerous [[megalith]]ic sites from the Neolithic, including the [[Carnac stones]] site (approximately 3,300 BC).

===Antiquity (6th century BC – 5th century AD)===
In 600 BC, [[Ionia]]n [[ in pre-Roman Gaul|]] from [[Phocaea]] founded the colony of [[Massalia]] (present-day [[Marseille]]). Celtic tribes penetrated parts of eastern and northern , spreading through the rest of the country between the 5th and 3rd century BC. Around 390 BC, the Gallic chieftain [[Brennus (leader of the Senones)|Brennus]] and his troops made their way to [[Roman ]], defeated the Romans in the [[Battle of the Allia]], and besieged and ransomed Rome. This left Rome weakened, and the Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC when they entered into a peace treaty. But the Romans and the Gauls remained adversaries for centuries.

Around 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region {{Lang|la|[[Gallia Narbonensis|Provincia Nostra]]}} ("Our Province"), which evolved into [[Provence]] in . [[Julius Caesar]] conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt by Gallic chieftain [[Vercingetorix]] in 52 BC. Gaul was divided by [[Augustus]] into provinces, and many cities were founded during the [[Roman Gaul|Gallo-Roman period]], including [[Lugdunum]] (present-day [[Lyon]]), the capital of the Gauls. In 250–290 AD, Roman Gaul suffered a crisis with its [[Limes (Roman Empire)|fortified borders]] attacked by barbarians. The situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, a period of revival and prosperity. In 312, Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|converted to Christianity]]. Christians, who had been persecuted, increased. But from the 5th century, the [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]] resumed. [[Teutons|Teutonic]] tribes invaded the region, the [[Visigoths]] settling in the southwest, the [[Burgundians]] along the [[Rhine Valley]], and the Franks in the north.

===Early Middle Ages (5th–10th century)===
In [[late antiquity]], Gaul was divided into Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory. [[Celtic Britons]], fleeing the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]], settled in west [[Armorica]]; the Armorican peninsula was renamed [[Brittany]], and [[Celts|Celtic culture]] was revived.

The first leader to unite all Franks was [[Clovis I]], who began his reign as king of the [[Salian Franks]] in 481, routing the last forces of the Roman governors in 486. Clovis said he would be baptised a Christian in the event of victory against the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], which was said to have guaranteed the battle. Clovis [[Franco-Visigothic Wars|regained the southwest from the Visigoths]] and was baptised in 508. Clovis was the first [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] conqueror after the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]] to convert to Catholic Christianity; thus  was given the title "Eldest daughter of the Church" by the papacy, and  kings were called "the Most Christian Kings of ".

[[File:Chlodwigs taufe.jpg|thumb|alt=painting of Clovis I conversion to Catholicism in 498, a king being baptised in a tub in a cathedral surrounded by bishop and monks|With [[Clovis I|Clovis]]'s conversion to Catholicism in 498, the [[List of Frankish kings|Frankish monarchy]], [[Elective monarchy|elective]] and [[Secular state|secular]] until then, became [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary]] and of [[Divine right of kings|divine right]].]]
The Franks embraced the Christian [[Gallo-Roman culture]], and Gaul was renamed ''[[Francia]]'' ("Land of the Franks"). The Germanic Franks adopted [[Romance languages|Romanic languages]]. Clovis made [[Paris]] his capital and established the [[Merovingian dynasty]], but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from that of Clovis: Paris, [[Orléans]], [[Soissons]], and [[Reims|Rheims]]. The [[Roi fainéant|last Merovingian kings]] [[Power behind the throne|lost power]] to their [[Mayor of the palace|mayors of the palace]] (head of household). One mayor of the palace, [[Charles Martel]], defeated an [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] invasion at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732. His son, [[Pepin the Short]], seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Pepin's son [[Charlemagne]] reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built an empire across Western and [[Central Europe]].

Proclaimed [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Pope Leo III]] and thus establishing the  government's longtime [[History of the Catholic Church in |historical association]] with the [[Catholic Church]], Charlemagne tried to revive the [[Western Roman Empire]] and its cultural grandeur. Charlemagne's son [[Louis the Pious|Louis I]] kept the empire united, however in 843 it was divided between Louis' three sons into [[East Francia]], [[Middle Francia]] and [[West Francia]]. West Francia approximated the area occupied by modern  and was its precursor.

During the 9th and 10th centuries, threatened by [[Viking expansion|Viking invasions]],  became a decentralised state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and so was less effective and challenged by noblemen. Thus was established [[feudalism]] in . Some king's vassals grew so powerful they posed a threat to the king. After the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] added "King of England" to his titles, becoming vassal and the equal of the king of , creating recurring tensions.

The Carolingian dynasty ruled  until 987, when [[Hugh Capet]] was crowned [[List of  monarchs|king of the Franks]]. His descendants unified the country through wars and inheritance. From 1190, the [[Capetian dynasty|Capetian rulers]] began to be referred as "kings of " rather than "kings of the Franks". Later kings expanded their directly possessed [[Crown lands of |''domaine royal'']] to cover over half of modern  by the 15th century. Royal authority became more assertive, centred on a [[Estates of the realm|hierarchically conceived society]] distinguishing [[ nobility|nobility]], clergy, and [[Estates General ()|commoners]].

The nobility played a prominent role in [[Crusades]] to restore Christian access to the [[Holy Land]].  knights made up most reinforcements in the 200 years of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs referred to crusaders as ''Franj''.  Crusaders imported  into the [[Levant]], making [[Old ]] the base of the ''[[lingua franca]]'' ("Frankish language") of the [[Crusader states]]. The [[Albigensian Crusade]] was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical [[Catharism|Cathars]] in the southwest of modern-day .

From the 11th century, the [[House of Plantagenet]], rulers of the [[County of Anjou]], established its dominion over the surrounding provinces of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] and [[Touraine]], then built an "empire" from England to the [[Pyrenees]], covering half of modern . Tensions between  and the [[Angevin Empire|Plantagenet empire]] would last a hundred years, until [[Philip II of ]] conquered, between 1202 and 1214, most continental possessions of the empire, leaving England and [[Aquitaine]] to the Plantagenets.

[[Charles IV of |Charles IV the Fair]] died without an heir in 1328. The crown passed to [[Philip VI of |Philip of Valois]] rather than Edward of Plantagenet, who became [[Edward III of England]]. During the reign of Philip, the monarchy reached the height of its medieval power. However Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward in 1337, and England and  entered the off-and-on [[Hundred Years' War]]. Boundaries changed, but landholdings inside  by  kings remained extensive for decades. With charismatic leaders such as [[Joan of Arc]],  counterattacks won back most  continental territories.  was struck by the [[Black Death]], from which half of the 17&nbsp;million population died.

===Early modern period (15th century–1789)===
{{Main| in the early modern period}}

The [[ Renaissance]] saw cultural development and standardisation of , which became the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts|official language of ]] and Europe's aristocracy.  became rivals of the [[House of Habsburg]] during the [[ Wars]], which would dictate much of their later foreign policy until the mid-18th century.  explorers claimed lands in the Americas, paving expansion of the [[ colonial empire]]. The rise of Protestantism led  to a civil war known as the [[ Wars of Religion]]. This forced [[Huguenots]] to flee to Protestant regions such as the [[ Isles]] and [[]]. The wars were ended by [[Henry IV of |Henry IV]]'s [[Edict of Nantes]], which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots. [[Habsburg |]] troops assisted the Catholics from 1589 to 1594 and invaded  in 1597.  and  returned to all-out war between 1635 and 1659. The [[Franco- War (1635–1659)|Franco- War]] cost  300,000 casualties.

Under [[Louis XIII]], [[Cardinal Richelieu]] promoted centralisation of the state and reinforced royal power. He destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private armies. By the end of the 1620s, Richelieu established "the royal monopoly of force".  fought in the [[Thirty Years' War]], supporting the Protestant side against the Habsburgs. From the 16th to the 19th century,  was responsible for about 10% of the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]].

[[File:Louis XIV of .jpg|thumb|upright=.8|alt=Louis XIV of  standing in plate armour and blue sash facing left holding baton|[[Louis XIV]], the "Sun King", was the [[Absolute monarchy in |absolute monarch of ]] who made the country the [[leading power]] in Europe.]]

During [[Louis XIV]]'s minority, trouble known as [[The Fronde]] occurred. This rebellion was driven by feudal lords and [[Parliament|sovereign courts]] as a reaction to the [[Absolutism (European history)|royal absolute power]]. The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and reign of Louis XIV, during which  further increased its influence. By turning lords into [[courtier]]s at the [[Palace of Versailles]], his command of the military went unchallenged. The "Sun King" made  the leading European power.  became the [[Demographics of |most populous European country]] and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture.  became the most-used language in diplomacy, [[Languages of science|science]], and literature until the 20th century.  took control of territories in the Americas, Africa and Asia. In 1685, Louis XIV [[Edict of Fontainebleau|revoked the Edict of Nantes]], forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile and published the ''[[Code Noir]]'' providing the legal framework for slavery and expelling Jews from  colonies.

Under the wars of [[Louis XV]],  lost [[New ]] and most [[ | possessions]] after its defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763). Its [[Metropolitan |European territory]] kept growing, however, with acquisitions such as [[Lorraine]] and [[Corsica]]. Louis XV's weak rule, including the decadence of his court, discredited the monarchy, which in part paved the way for the [[ Revolution]].

[[Louis XVI]] [[ in the  Revolutionary War|supported America with money, fleets and armies]], helping them win [[ Revolutionary War|independence from Great Britain]].  gained revenge but verged on bankruptcy—a factor that contributed to the Revolution. Some of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] occurred in  intellectual circles, and scientific breakthroughs, such as the [[Antoine Lavoisier|naming of oxygen]] and the first [[Montgolfier brothers|hot air balloon carrying passengers]], were achieved by  scientists.  explorers took part in the [[European and  voyages of scientific exploration|voyages of scientific exploration]] through maritime expeditions. Enlightenment philosophy, in which [[Rationalism|reason]] is advocated as the primary source of [[Political legitimacy|legitimacy]], undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and was a factor in the Revolution.

===Revolutionary  (1789–1799)===
[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|alt=drawing of the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, smoke of gunfire enveloping stone castle|The [[Storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789 was the most emblematic event of the [[ Revolution]].]]
The  Revolution was a period of political and societal change that began with the [[Estates General of 1789]], and ended with the [[coup of 18 Brumaire]] in 1799 and the formation of the [[ Consulate]]. Many of its ideas are fundamental principles of [[liberal democracy]], while its values and institutions remain central to modern political discourse.

[[Causes of the  Revolution|Its causes]] were a combination of social, political and economic factors, which the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien Régime]]}} proved unable to manage. A financial crisis and social distress led in May 1789 to the [[convocation]] of the [[Estates General of 1789|Estates General]], which was converted into a [[National Assembly ( Revolution)|National Assembly]] in June. The [[Storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, among them the [[Abolition of feudalism in |abolition of feudalism]], state control over the [[Catholic Church in ]], and a [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|declaration of rights]].

The next three years were dominated by struggle for political control, exacerbated by [[economic depression]]. Military defeats following the outbreak of the [[ Revolutionary Wars]] in April 1792 resulted in the [[insurrection of 10 August 1792]]. The [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|monarchy was abolished]] and replaced by the [[ First Republic]] in September, while [[execution of Louis XVI|Louis XVI was executed]] in January 1793.

After another [[Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793|revolt in June 1793]], the constitution was suspended and power passed from the [[National Convention]] to the [[Committee of Public Safety]]. About 16,000 people were executed in a [[Reign of Terror]], which [[Thermidorian Reaction|ended in July 1794]]. Weakened by external threats and internal opposition, the Republic was replaced in 1795 by the [[ Directory|Directory]]. Four years later in 1799, the [[ Consulate|Consulate]] seized power in a [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|coup]] led by [[Napoleon]].

===Napoleonic  (1799–1815)===
{{Main| in the long nineteenth century}}

[[File:Jacques-Louis David - The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=painting of Napoleon in 1806 standing with hand in vest attended by staff and Imperial guard regiment|[[Napoleon]], [[Emperor of the ]], built [[First  Empire|a vast empire across Europe]].]]
[[Napoleon]] became [[ Consulate|First Consul]] in 1799 and later [[Constitution of the Year XII|Emperor]] of the [[First  Empire| Empire]]. Changing sets of [[ Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars|European coalitions]] declared [[Napoleonic Wars|wars on Napoleon's empire]]. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt|battles of Jena-Auerstadt]] and [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]]. Members of the [[House of Bonaparte|Bonaparte]] family were appointed monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.

These victories led to the worldwide expansion of  revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the [[metric system]], [[Napoleonic Code]] and [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|Declaration of the Rights of Man]]. In 1812 Napoleon [[ invasion of |attacked ]], reaching [[Moscow]]. Thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease,  attacks, and finally winter. After this catastrophic campaign and the ensuing [[War of the Sixth Coalition|uprising of European monarchies]] against his rule, Napoleon was defeated. About a million Frenchmen [[Napoleonic Wars casualties|died during the Napoleonic Wars]]. After his [[Hundred Days|brief return]] from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and the [[Bourbon Restoration in |Bourbon monarchy was restored]] with new constitutional limitations.

===Colonial empire===

The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the [[July Revolution]] of 1830, which established the constitutional [[July Monarchy]];  troops began the [[ conquest of |conquest of ]]. Unrest led to the [[ Revolution of 1848]] and the end of the July Monarchy. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of male universal suffrage was re-enacted in 1848. In 1852, president of the  Republic, [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]], Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the [[Second  Empire|Second Empire]], as Napoleon III. He multiplied  interventions abroad, especially in [[Crimean War|Crimea]], [[Second  intervention in |]] and [[Second  War of Independence|]]. Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, and his regime was replaced by the [[ Third Republic|Third Republic]]. By 1875, the  conquest of  was complete, with approximately 825,000  killed from famine, disease, and violence.

 had [[ colonial empire|colonial possessions]] since the beginning of the 17th century, but in the 19th and 20th centuries its empire extended greatly and became [[List of largest empires|the second-largest]] behind the [[ Empire]]. Including metropolitan , the total area reached almost 13&nbsp;million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s, 9% of the world's land. Known as the ''[[Belle Époque]]'', the turn of the century was characterised by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. In 1905, [[Secular state|state secularism]] was [[1905  law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|officially established]].

===Early to mid-20th century (1914–1946)===

 was [[ entry into World War I|invaded by  and defended by Great Britain]] at the start of [[World War I]] in August 1914. A rich industrial area in the north was occupied.  and the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] emerged victorious against the [[Central Powers]] at tremendous human cost. It left 1.4 million  soldiers dead, 4% of its population. Interwar was marked by [[Events preceding World War II in Europe|intense international tensions]] and social reforms introduced by the [[Popular Front ()|Popular Front government]] (e.g., [[annual leave]], [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour workdays]], [[women in government]]).

In 1940,  was [[Battle of |invaded and quickly defeated]] by [[Nazi ]].  was divided into a [[ military administration in occupied  during World War II| occupation zone]] in the north, an [[ occupation of | occupation zone]] and an unoccupied territory, the rest of , which consisted of southern  and the  empire. The [[Vichy |Vichy government]], an authoritarian regime collaborating with , ruled the unoccupied territory. [[Free ]], the government-in-exile led by&nbsp;[[Charles de Gaulle]], was set up in London.

From 1942 to 1944, about 160,000  citizens, including around [[The Holocaust in |75,000 Jews]], were deported to [[Extermination camp|death]] and [[Internment|concentration camps]]. On 6 June 1944, the Allies [[Operation Overlord|invaded Normandy]], and in August they [[Operation Dragoon|invaded Provence]]. The Allies and [[ Resistance]] emerged victorious, and  sovereignty was restored with the [[Provisional Government of the  Republic]] (GPRF). This interim government, established by de Gaulle, continued to [[Western Allied invasion of |wage war against ]] and to [[Épuration légale|purge collaborators from office]]. It made important reforms e.g. suffrage extended to women and the creation of a [[Social security in |social security]] system.

===1946–present===

A new constitution resulted in the [[ Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] (1946–1958), which saw strong economic growth (''les [[Trente Glorieuses]]'').  was a founding member of [[NATO]] and attempted to [[First Indochina War|regain control of  Indochina]], but was defeated by the [[Viet Minh]] in 1954.  faced another [[anti-colonialist]] [[ War|conflict in ]], then part of  and home to over one million European settlers ([[Pied-Noir]]). The  systematically used torture and repression, including extrajudicial killings to keep control. This conflict nearly led to a coup and civil war.

During the [[May 1958 crisis in |May 1958 crisis]], the weak Fourth Republic gave way to the [[ Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]], which included a strengthened presidency. The war concluded with the [[Évian Accords]] in 1962 which led to [[1962  independence referendum| independence]], at a high price: between half a million and one million deaths and over 2&nbsp;million internally-displaced . Around one million Pied-Noirs and [[Harki]]s fled from  to . A vestige of the empire is the [[Overseas | overseas departments and territories]].

During the [[Cold War]], de Gaulle pursued a policy of "national independence" towards the [[Western Bloc|Western]] and [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern blocs]]. He withdrew from NATO's military-integrated command (while remaining within the alliance), launched a [[Force de dissuasion|nuclear development programme]] and made  the [[ and weapons of mass destruction|fourth nuclear power]]. He [[Élysée Treaty|restored]] cordial [[– relations|Franco- relations]] to create a European counterweight between  and Soviet spheres of influence. However, he opposed any development of a [[Supranational union|supranational Europe]], favouring [[Sovereign state|sovereign nations]]. The revolt of [[May 68|May 1968]] had an enormous social impact; it was a watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted to a more liberal moral ideal (secularism, individualism, sexual revolution). Although the revolt was a political failure (the [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] party emerged stronger than before) it announced a split between the  and de Gaulle, who resigned.

In the post-Gaullist era,  remained one of the most developed [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|economies in the world]] but faced crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries,  has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational [[European Union]], notably by signing the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in 1992, establishing the [[eurozone]] in 1999 and signing the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] in 2007.  has fully reintegrated into NATO and since participated in most NATO-sponsored wars. Since the 19th century,  has [[Immigration to |received many immigrants]], often male [[foreign worker]]s from European Catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed. During the 1970s  faced an economic crisis and allowed new immigrants (mostly from the [[Maghreb]], in northwest Africa) to permanently [[Family reunification|settle in  with their families]] and acquire citizenship. It resulted in hundreds of thousands of Muslims living in subsidised public housing and suffering from high unemployment rates. The government had a policy of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of immigrants, where they were expected to adhere to  values and norms.

Since the [[1995  bombings|1995 public transport bombings]],  has been targeted by Islamist organisations, notably the [[January 2015 Île-de- attacks|''Charlie Hebdo'' attack]] in 2015 which provoked the [[Republican marches|largest public rallies]] in  history, gathering 4.4&nbsp;million people, the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]] which resulted in 130 deaths, the deadliest attack on  soil since World War II and the deadliest in the European Union since the [[2004 Madrid train bombings|Madrid train bombings in 2004]]. [[Opération Chammal]], 's military efforts to contain [[Islamic State of  and the Levant|ISIS]], killed over 1,000 ISIS troops between 2014 and 2015.
