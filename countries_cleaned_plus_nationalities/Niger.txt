Stone tools, some dating as far back as 280,000 BC, have been found in [[Adrar Bous]], [[Bilma]] and [[Djado]] in the northern [[Agadez Region]]. Some of these finds have been linked with the [[Aterian]] and [[Mousterian]] tool cultures of the [[Middle Paleolithic]] period, which flourished in northern Africa circa 90,000 BC–20,000 BC. It is thought that these humans lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. During the prehistoric [[African humid period]], the climate of the [[Sahara]] was wetter and more fertile, a phenomenon archaeologists refer to as the "Green Sahara", which provided "favourable" conditions for hunting and later agriculture and livestock herding.

The [[Neolithic]] era, beginning circa 10,000 BC, saw a number of changes such as the introduction of [[pottery]] (as evidenced at Tagalagal, Temet and Tin Ouffadene), the spread of cattle husbandry, and the burying of the dead in stone [[tumuli]]. As the climate changed in the period 4000–2800 BC the Sahara gradually began [[desertification|drying out]], forcing a change in settlement patterns to the south and east. Agriculture spread, including the planting of [[millet]] and [[sorghum]], and pottery production. Iron and copper items appear in this era, with finds including those at [[Azawagh]], [[Takedda]], [[Marendet]] and the [[Termit Massif]]. The [[Kiffian culture|Kiffian]] (circa 8000–6000 BC) and later [[Tenerian culture|Tenerian]] (circa 5000–2500 BC) cultures, centred on [[Adrar Bous]] and [[Gobero]] where skeletons have been uncovered, flourished during this period.

Societies continued to grow with regional differentiation in agricultural and funerary practices. A culture of this period is the [[Bura culture]] (circa 200–1300 AD) named for the [[Bura archaeological site]] where a burial replete with iron and ceramic statuettes were discovered. The Neolithic era saw the flourishing of Saharan rock art, including in the [[Aïr Mountains]], Termit Massif, Djado Plateau, Iwelene, Arakao, Tamakon, Tzerzait, [[Iferouane]], Mammanet and [[Dabous Giraffes|Dabous]]; the art spans the period from 10,000 BC to 100 AD and depicts a range of subjects, from the varied fauna of the landscape to depictions of spear-carrying figures dubbed ' warriors'.

=== Empires and kingdoms in pre-colonial  ===
By at least the 5th century BC the territory of what is now  had become an area of trans-Saharan trade. Led by [[Tuareg]] tribes from the north, camels were used as a means of transportation through what is later a desert. This mobility which would continue in waves for centuries was accompanied with further migration to the south and intermixing between sub-Saharan African and North African populations, and the spread of [[Islam]]. It was aided by the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]] in the 7th century, the result of three Arab invasions, which resulted in population movements to the south. Empires and kingdoms existed in the Sahel during this era.

====  Empire (1200s–1400s) ====
{{Main| Empire}}
The  Empire was a [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] empire founded by [[Sundiata Keita]] (r. 1230–1255) in {{circa|1230}} and existed until the 1600s. As detailed in the ''[[Epic of Sundiata]]'',  emerged as a breakaway region of the [[Sosso Empire]] which itself had split from the earlier [[ Empire]]. Thereafter  defeated the Sosso at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in 1235 and then  in 1240. From its heartland around the later - border region, the empire expanded under successive kings and came to dominate the Trans-Saharan trade routes, reaching its greatest extent during the rule of [[Mansa Musa]] (r. 1312–1337).{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} At this point parts of what are now 's [[Tillabéri Region]] fell under  rule. A Muslim, Mansa Musa performed the ''[[hajj]]'' in 1324–25 and encouraged the spread of [[Islam]] in the empire, and it "appears that most ordinary citizens continued to maintain their traditional animist beliefs instead of or alongside the new religion". The empire began "declining" in the 15th century due to a combination of internecine strife over the royal succession, weak kings, the shift of European trade routes to the coast, and rebellions in the empire's periphery by [[Mossi people|Mossi]], [[Wolof people|Wolof]], [[Tuareg]] and [[Songhai people|Songhai]] peoples. A rump  kingdom continued to exist until the 1600s.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

==== Songhai Empire (1000s–1591) ====
[[File:SONGHAI empire map.PNG|thumb|left|Map of the Songhai Empire, overlaid over modern boundaries]]
{{Main|Songhai Empire}}
The [[Songhai Empire]] was named for its main ethnic group, the [[Songhai people|Songhai or Sonrai]], and was centred on the bend of the [[ River]] in [[]]. Songhai began settling this region from the 7th to 9th centuries;{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} by the 11th century [[Gao]] (capital of the former [[Kingdom of Gao]]) had become the empire's capital. From 1000 to 1325, the Songhai Empire managed to maintain peace with the  Empire, its neighbour to the west. In 1325 Songhai was conquered by  until regaining its independence in 1375.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} Under king [[Sonni Ali]] (r. 1464–1492) Songhai adopted an expansionist policy which reached its apogee during the reign of [[Askia Mohammad I]] (r. 1493–1528); at this point the empire had expanded from its -bend heartland, including to the east where most of later western  fell under its rule, including [[Agadez]] which was conquered in 1496. The empire was unable to withstand repeated attacks from the [[Saadi dynasty]] of [[]] and was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Tondibi]] in 1591; it then collapsed into a number of smaller kingdoms.

==== Sultanate of Aïr (1400s–1906) ====
[[File:1997 277-9A Agadez mosque cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Agadez Mosque|The Grand Mosque of Agadez]]]]
{{Main|Sultanate of Aïr}}
In {{circa|1449}} in the north of what is now , the [[Sultanate of Aïr]] was founded by Sultan Ilisawan, based in [[Agadez]]. Formerly a trading post inhabited by a mixture of Hausa and Tuaregs, it grew as a strategic position on the Trans-Saharan trade routes. In 1515, Aïr was conquered by Songhai, remaining a part of that empire until its collapse in 1591. In the following centuries, it "seems that the sultanate entered a decline" marked by internecine wars and clan conflicts. When Europeans began exploring the region in the 19th century, most of Agadez lay in ruins and was taken over by the .

==== Kanem–Bornu Empire (700s–1700s) ====
{{Main|Kanem–Bornu Empire|Sultanate of Damagaram}}
To the east, the [[Kanem–Bornu Empire]] dominated the region around [[Lake ]] for a period. It was founded by the [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] around the 8th century and based in [[Njimi]], north-east of the lake. The kingdom gradually expanded, including during the rule of the [[Sayfawa dynasty]] which began in {{circa|1075}} under ''Mai'' (king) [[Hummay]]. The kingdom reached its greatest extent in the 1200s, partly due to the effort of ''Mai'' [[Dunama Dibbalemi]] (r. 1210–1259), and grew "richer" from its control of some Trans-Saharan trade routes; most of eastern and south-eastern , including [[Bilma]] and [[Kaouar]], was under Kanem's control in this period. Islam had been introduced to the kingdom by Arab traders from the 11th century, gaining more converts over the following centuries. Attacks by the [[Bulala]] people in the 14th century forced Kanem to shift westwards of Lake  where it became known as the Bornu Empire ruled from its capital [[Ngazargamu]] on what is later the [[- border]]. Bornu "prospered" during the rule of ''Mai'' [[Idris Alooma]] (r. circa 1575–1610) and re-conquered most of the "traditional lands" of Kanem, hence the designation 'Kanem–Bornu' for the empire. By the 17th century and into the 18th the Bornu kingdom had entered a "period of decline", shrinking back to its Lake  heartland.

Circa 1730–40 a group of [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] settlers led by Mallam Yunus left Kanem and founded the [[Sultanate of Damagaram]], centred on the town of [[Zinder]]. The sultanate remained nominally subject to the [[Borno Empire]] until the reign of Sultan Tanimoune Dan Souleymane in the 19th century, who declared independence and initiated a phase of expansion. The sultanate managed to resist the advance of the Sokoto Caliphate (''see below''), and was later captured by the  in 1899.

==== Hausa states and other smaller kingdoms (1400s–1800s) ====
[[File:Photo1906 Zinder overview.jpg|thumb|Overlooking the town of [[Zinder]] and the Sultan's Palace from the  fort (1906). The arrival of the  spelled an end for precolonial states like the [[Sultanate of Damagaram]] which carried on only as ceremonial "chiefs" appointed by the colonial government.]]
{{Main|Hausa Kingdoms|Dosso Kingdom|Dendi Kingdom}}
Between the  River and Lake  lay [[Hausa Kingdoms]], encompassing the cultural-linguistic area known as [[Hausaland]] which straddles what later became the [[- border]]. The Hausa are thought to be a mixture of autochthonous peoples and migrant peoples from the north and east, emerging as a distinct people sometime in the 900s–1400s when the kingdoms were founded. They gradually adopted Islam from the 14th century, and sometimes this existed alongside other religions, developing into syncretic forms; some Hausa groups such as the Azna resisted Islam altogether (the area of [[Dogondoutchi]] remains an animist stronghold). The Hausa kingdoms were not a compact entity but several federations of kingdoms more or less independent of one other. Their organisation was hierarchical and somewhat democratic: the Hausa kings were elected by the notables of the country and could be removed by them. The Hausa Kingdoms began as seven states founded, according to the [[Bayajidda]] legend, by the six sons of Bawo. Bawo was the only son of the Hausa queen [[Daurama]] and [[Bayajidda]] or ([[Abu Yazid]] according to certain historians) who came from [[Baghdad]]. The seven original Hausa states (also referred to as the 'Hausa bakwai') were: [[Daura Emirate|Daura]] (state of queen [[Daurama]]), [[Sultanate of Kano|Kano]], [[Rano]], [[Kingdom of Zazzau|Zaria]], [[Gobir]], [[Kingdom of Katsina|Katsina]] and [[Hadejia|Biram]]. An extension of the legend states that Bawo had a further seven sons with a concubine, who went on to found the so-called 'Banza (''illegitimate'') Bakwai': [[Zamfara]], [[Kebbi Emirate|Kebbi]], [[Nupe Kingdom|Nupe]], [[Gwari]], [[Yauri Emirate|Yauri]], [[Ilorin Emirate|Ilorin]] and [[Kwararafa]]. A smaller state not fitting into this scheme was [[Konni (Hausa state)|Konni]], centred on [[Birni-N'Konni]].
[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png|thumb|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]
The [[Fulani]], a pastoral people found throughout the Sahel, began migrating to Hausaland during the 1200s–1500s. During the later 18th century some Fulani were unhappy with the syncretic form of Islam practised there; exploiting also the populace's disdain with corruption amongst the Hausa elite, the Fulani scholar [[Usman Dan Fodio]] (from Gobir) declared a [[Fulani jihad|jihad]] in 1804. After conquering most of Hausaland (though not the Bornu Kingdom, which remained independent), he proclaimed the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] in 1809. Some of the Hausa states survived by fleeing south, such as the Katsina who moved to [[Maradi, |Maradi]] in the south of what later became . Some of these surviving states harassed the Caliphate and a period of wars and skirmishes commenced, with some states (such as Katsina and Gobir) maintaining independence whereas elsewhere newer ones were formed (such as the [[Sultanate of Tessaoua]]). The Caliphate managed to survive until, "fatally weakened" by the invasions of -based warlord [[Rabih az-Zubayr]], it finally fell to the British in 1903, with its lands later being partitioned between Britain and .

Other smaller kingdoms of the period include the [[Dosso Kingdom]], a [[Zarma people|Zarma]] polity founded in 1750, which resisted the rule of Hausa and Sokoto states.

=== Colonial (1900–1958) ===
[[File: West Africa - DPLA - 53944da3422ceec80ca02617ad7fb2e0.jpg|thumb|[[ West Africa]] in 1949]]
{{Main|Senegambia and |Upper  and | West Africa|Colony of }}
In the 19th century, some European explorers travelled in the area that would become known as , such as [[Mungo Park (explorer)|Mungo Park]] (in 1805–1806), the [[Walter Oudney|Oudney]]-[[Dixon Denham|Denham]]-[[Hugh Clapperton|Clapperton]] expedition (1822–25), [[Heinrich Barth]] (1850–55 with [[James Richardson (explorer)|James Richardson]] and [[Adolf Overweg]]), [[Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs]] (1865–1867), [[Gustav Nachtigal]] (1869–1874) and [[Parfait-Louis Monteil]] (1890–1892).

Some European countries already possessed coastal colonies in Africa, and in the latter half of the century they began to turn their eyes towards the interior of the continent. This process, known as the '[[Scramble for Africa]]', culminated in the [[Berlin Conference|1885 Berlin conference]] in which the colonial powers outlined the division of Africa into spheres of influence. As a result of this, [[]] gained control of the upper valley of the [[ River]] (roughly equivalent to the present territory of [[]] and ).  then set about making a reality of their rule on the ground. In 1897, the  officer [[Marius Gabriel Cazemajou]] was sent to . He reached the [[Sultanate of Damagaram]] in 1898, and stayed in [[Zinder]] at the court of Sultan Amadou Kouran Daga. He was later killed, as Daga feared he would ally with the -based warlord Rabih az-Zubayr. In 1899–1900,  coordinated three expeditions—the [[Émile Gentil|Gentil Mission]] from [[ Congo]], the [[Amédée-François Lamy|Foureau-Lamy Mission]] from [[]] and the [[Voulet–Chanoine Mission]] from [[Timbuktu]]—with the aim of linking 's African possessions. The three eventually met at [[Kousséri]] (in the far north of [[]]) and defeated Rabih az-Zubayr's forces at the [[Battle of Kousséri]]. The Voulet-Chanoine Mission was "marred by atrocities", and "became notorious" for pillaging, looting, raping and killing local civilians on its passage throughout southern . On 8 May 1899, in retaliation for the resistance of queen [[Sarraounia]], captain Voulet and his men murdered all the inhabitants of the village of [[Birni-N'Konni]] in what is regarded as "one of the worst massacres in  colonial history". The "brutal" methods of Voulet and Chanoine caused a "scandal" and Paris was forced to intervene; when Lieutenant-Colonel [[Jean-François Klobb]] caught up with the mission near [[Tessaoua]] to relieve them of command he was killed. Lt. [[Paul Joalland]], Klobb's former officer, and Lt. [[Octave Meynier]] eventually took over the mission following a mutiny in which Voulet and Chanoine were killed.
The Military Territory of  was subsequently created within the [[Upper  and ]] colony (later ,  and ) in December 1904 with its capital at [[Niamey]]. The [[- border|border]] with Britain's colony of  to the south was finalised in 1910, a rough delimitation having already been agreed by the two powers via treaties during the period 1898–1906. The capital of the territory was moved to Zinder in 1912 when the  Military Territory was split off from Upper  and , before being moved back to Niamey in 1922 when  became a fully fledged colony within [[ West Africa]]. The borders of  were drawn up in stages and had been fixed at their later position by the 1930s. Territorial adjustments took place in this period: the areas west of the  river were [[– border|attached]] to  in 1926–1927, and during the dissolution of Upper Volta (modern ) in 1932–1947 most of the east of that territory was added to ; and in the east the [[Tibesti Mountains]] were [[- border|transferred]] to  in 1931.

The  generally adopted a form of indirect rule, allowing existing native structures to continue to exist within the colonial framework of governance providing that they acknowledged  supremacy. The Zarma of the Dosso Kingdom in particular proved amenable to  rule, using them as allies against the encroachments of Hausa and other nearby states; over time the Zarma thus became one of the "more educated and westernised" groups in . Perceived threats to  rule, such as the Kobkitanda rebellion in [[Dosso Region]] (1905–1906), led by the blind cleric Alfa Saibou, and the Karma revolt in the  valley (December 1905 – March 1906) led by Oumarou Karma were suppressed with force, as were the latter [[Hamallayya]] and [[Hauka]] religious movements. While "largely successful" in subduing the "sedentary" populations of the south, the  faced "considerably more difficulty" with the Tuareg in the north (centered on the Sultanate of Aïr in Agadez), and  was unable to occupy Agadez until 1906. Tuareg resistance continued, culminating in the [[Kaocen revolt]] of 1916–1917, led by [[Ag Mohammed Wau Teguidda Kaocen]], with backing from the [[Senussi]] in [[Fezzan]]; the revolt was violently suppressed and Kaocen fled to Fezzan where he was later killed. A puppet sultan was set up by the  and the "decline and marginalisation" of the north of the colony continued, exacerbated by a series of droughts. While it remained "something of a backwater", some limited economic development took place in  during the colonial years, such as the introduction of [[Hausa groundnut|groundnut]] cultivation. Measures to improve food security following a series of devastating famines in 1913, 1920, and 1931 were introduced.

During the [[Second World War]], during which time mainland  was occupied by [[Nazi ]], [[Charles de Gaulle]] issued the Brazzaville Declaration, declaring that the  colonial empire would be replaced post-war with a less centralised [[ Union]]. The  Union, which lasted from 1946 to 1958, conferred a limited form of  citizenship on the inhabitants of the colonies, with some decentralisation of power and limited participation in political life for local advisory assemblies. It was during this period that the [[ Progressive Party – African Democratic Rally| Progressive Party]] (''Parti Progressiste Nigérien'', or PPN, originally a branch of the African Democratic Rally, or ''[[Rassemblement Démocratique Africain]]'' – RDA) was formed under the leadership of former teacher [[Hamani Diori]], as was the left-wing [[Mouvement Socialiste Africain-Sawaba]] (MSA), led by [[Djibo Bakary]]. Following the Overseas Reform Act (''Loi Cadre'') of 23 July 1956 and the establishment of the [[Fifth  Republic]] on 4 December 1958,  became an autonomous state within the [[ Community]]. On 18 December 1958, an autonomous Republic of  was officially created under the leadership of Hamani Diori. MSA was banned in 1959 for its perceived excessive anti- stance. On 11 July 1960,  decided to leave the  Community and acquired full independence at midnight, local time, on 3 August 1960; Diori thus became the first [[List of Presidents of |president]] of the country.

=== Post-colonial (1960–) ===
==== Diori years (1960–1974) ====
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F028554-0009, , Staatsbesuch Bundespräsident Lübke.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|President [[Hamani Diori]] and visiting [[ President]] [[Heinrich Lübke]] greet crowds on a state visit to Niamey, 1969. Diori's single party rule was characterised by "good" relations with the West and a preoccupation with foreign affairs.]]
For its first 14 years as an independent state,  was run by a single-party civilian regime under the presidency of Hamani Diori. The 1960s saw an expansion of the education system and some limited economic development and industrialisation. Links with  remained, with Diori allowing the development of -led [[uranium]] mining in [[Arlit]] and supporting  in the [[ War]]. Relations with other African states were mostly "positive", with the exception of [[Dahomey]] (), owing to a [[- border|border]] dispute.  remained a one-party state throughout this period, with Diori surviving a planned coup in 1963 and an assassination attempt in 1965; most of this activity was masterminded by Djibo Bakary's MSA-Sawaba group which had launched an abortive rebellion in 1964. In the 1970s, a combination of economic difficulties, [[drought]]s and accusations of rampant corruption and mismanagement of food supplies resulted in a [[1974  coup d'état|coup d'état]] that overthrew the Diori regime.

==== First military regime (1974–1991) ====
The coup had been masterminded by Col. [[Seyni Kountché]] and a military group under the name of the ''Conseil Militaire Supreme'', with Kountché going on to rule the country until his death in 1987. The first action of the military government was to address the food crisis. Whilst political prisoners of the Diori regime were released after the coup, political and individual freedoms in general deteriorated during this period. There were attempted coups (in 1975, 1976 and 1984) which were thwarted, their instigators being punished.

[[File:Seyni Kountche 1983.jpg|thumb|President [[Seyni Kountché]] during the state visit of West  President [[Karl Carstens]] to  in 1983]]
Kountché sought to create a 'development society', funded mostly by the uranium mines in [[Agadez Region]]. [[Parastatal]] companies were created, infrastructure (building and new roads, schools, health centres) constructed, and there was corruption in government agencies, which Kountché did not hesitate to punish. In the 1980s, Kountché began cautiously loosening the grip of the military, with some relaxation of state censorship and attempts made to 'civilianise' the regime. The economic boom ended following the collapse in uranium prices, and [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]-led austerity and privatisation measures provoked opposition by some Nigeriens. In 1985, a Tuareg revolt in [[Tchintabaraden]] was suppressed. Kountché died in November 1987 from a brain tumour, and was succeeded by his chief of staff, Col. [[Ali Saibou]] who was confirmed as Chief of the Supreme Military Council four days later.

Saibou curtailed the most repressive aspects of the Kountché era (such as the secret police and media censorship), and set about introducing a process of political reform under the overall direction of a single party (the ''Mouvement National pour la Société du Développement'', or MNSD). A Second Republic was declared and a new constitution was drawn up, which was adopted following a [[1989  constitutional referendum|referendum]] in 1989. General Saibou became the first president of the Second Republic after winning the [[1989  general election|presidential election]] on 10 December 1989.

President Saibou's efforts to control political reforms failed in the face of trade union and student demands to institute a [[multi-party democracy|multi-party democratic system]]. On 9 February 1990, a violently repressed student march in Niamey led to the death of three students, which led to increased national and international pressure for further democratic reform. The Saibou regime acquiesced to these demands by the end of 1990. Meanwhile, trouble re-emerged in Agadez Region when a group of armed Tuaregs attacked the town of Tchintabaraden (seen by some as the start of the first [[Tuareg rebellion (1990–1995)|Tuareg Rebellion]]), prompting a military crackdown which led to deaths (the precise numbers are disputed, with estimates ranging from 70 to up to 1,000).

[[File:Ali Saibou cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Ali Saibou]], President 1987–93, helped oversee the transition from military to civilian rule.]]

==== National Conference and Third Republic (1991–1996) ====
The National Sovereign Conference of 1991 brought about multi-party democracy. From 29 July to 3 November, a national conference gathered together all elements of society to make recommendations for the future direction of the country. The conference was presided over by Prof. [[André Salifou]] and developed a plan for a [[transitional government]]; this was then installed in November 1991 to manage the affairs of state until the institutions of the Third Republic were put into place in April 1993. After the National Sovereign Conference, the transitional government drafted a constitution that eliminated the previous single-party system of the 1989 Constitution and guaranteed more freedoms. The new constitution was adopted by a [[1992  constitutional referendum|referendum]] on 26 December 1992. Following this, presidential [[1993  parliamentary election|elections]] were held and [[Mahamane Ousmane]] became the first president of the Third Republic on 27 March 1993. Ousmane's presidency saw four government changes and legislative [[1995  parliamentary election|elections]] in 1995, and an economic slump.

The violence in Agadez Region continued during this period, prompting the  government to sign a truce with Tuareg rebels in 1992 which was ineffective owing to internal dissension within the Tuareg ranks. Another rebellion, led by dissatisfied [[Toubou]] peoples claiming that, like the Tuareg, the  government had neglected their region, broke out in the east of the country. In April 1995 a peace deal with a Tuareg rebel group was signed, with the government agreeing to absorb some former rebels into the military and, with  assistance, help others return to a productive civilian life.

==== Second and third military regimes (1996–1999) ====
The governmental paralysis prompted the military to intervene; on 27 January 1996, Col. [[Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara]] led a [[1996  coup d'état|coup]] that deposed President Ousmane and ended the Third Republic. Maïnassara headed a ''Conseil de Salut National'' (National Salvation Council) composed of military officials which carried out a six-month transition period, during which a constitution was drafted and adopted on 12 May 1996.

Presidential campaigns were organised in the months that followed. Maïnassara entered the campaign as an independent candidate and won the [[1996  parliamentary election|election]] on 8 July 1996, the elections were viewed nationally and internationally by some as irregular, as the electoral commission was replaced during the campaign. Meanwhile, Maïnassara instigated an [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[World Bank]]-approved privatisation programme which enriched some of his supporters and were opposed by the trade unions. Following fraudulent local elections in 1999 the opposition ceased any cooperation with the Maïnassara regime. In unknown circumstances (possibly attempting to flee the country), Maïnassara was assassinated at [[Niamey Airport]] on 9 April 1999.

Maj. [[Daouda Malam Wanké]] then took over, establishing a transitional National Reconciliation Council to oversee the drafting of a constitution with a -style [[semi-presidential system]]. This was adopted on 9 August 1999 and was followed by presidential and legislative [[1999  general election|elections]] in October and November of the same year. The elections were generally found to be free and fair by international observers. Wanké then withdrew from governmental affairs.

==== Fifth Republic (1999–2009) ====
[[File: MNJ fighter technical gun.JPG|thumb|A [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] rebel fighter in northern  during the Second Tuareg Rebellion, 2008]]
After winning the election in November 1999, President [[Tandja Mamadou]] was sworn into office on 22 December 1999 as the first president of the Fifth Republic. Mamadou brought about administrative and economic reforms that had been halted due to the military coups since the Third Republic, and helped peacefully resolve a decades-long boundary dispute with . In August 2002, unrest within military camps occurred in [[Niamey]], [[Diffa]], and [[Nguigmi]], and the government was able to restore order within days. On 24 July 2004, municipal elections were held to elect local representatives, previously appointed by the government. These elections were followed by presidential elections, in which Mamadou was re-elected for a second term, thus becoming the first president of the republic to win consecutive elections without being deposed by military coups. The legislative and executive configuration remained somewhat similar to that of the first term of the president: [[Hama Amadou]] was reappointed as prime minister and [[Mahamane Ousmane]], the head of the CDS party, was re-elected as the president of the National Assembly (parliament) by his peers.

By 2007, the relationship between President Tandja Mamadou and his prime minister had "deteriorated", leading to the replacement of the latter in June 2007 by [[Seyni Oumarou]] following a successful vote of no confidence at the Assembly. President Tandja Mamadou sought to extend his presidency by modifying the constitution which limited presidential terms. Proponents of the extended presidency, who rallied behind the 'Tazartche' (Hausa for 'overstay') movement, were countered by opponents ('anti-Tazartche') composed of opposition party militants and civil society activists.

The north saw the outbreak of a [[Second Tuareg Rebellion]] in 2007 led by the ''[[ Movement for Justice|Mouvement des Nigériens pour la justice]]'' (MNJ). With a number of kidnappings the rebellion had "largely fizzled out inconclusively" by 2009. The "poor" security situation in the region is thought to have allowed elements of [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] (AQIM) to gain a foothold in the country.

==== Sixth republic and fourth military regime (2009–2010) ====
In 2009, President Tandja Mamadou decided to organize a constitutional referendum seeking to [[2009–2010  constitutional crisis|extend his presidency]], which was opposed by other political parties, and went against the decision of the Constitutional Court which had ruled that the referendum would be unconstitutional. Mamadou then modified and adopted a new constitution by referendum, which was declared illegal by the Constitutional Court, prompting Mamadou to dissolve the Court and assume emergency powers. The opposition boycotted the referendum and the constitution was adopted with 92.5% of voters and a 68% turnout, according to official results. The adoption of the constitution created a Sixth Republic, with a [[presidential system]], the suspension of the 1999 Constitution, and a three-year interim government with Tandja Mamadou as president. The events generated political and social unrest.

In a [[2010  coup d'état|coup d'état]] in February 2010, a military junta led by [[Salou Djibo]] was established in response to Tandja's attempted extension of his political term.

Following the adoption of a constitution in 2010 and [[2011  general election|presidential elections]] a year later, [[Mahamadou Issoufou]] was elected as the first president of the Seventh Republic; he was then [[2016  general election|re-elected]] in 2016. The constitution restored the semi-presidential system which had been abolished a year earlier. An attempted coup against him in 2011 was thwarted and its ringleaders arrested. Issoufou's time in office was marked by threats to the country's security, stemming from the fallout from the [[ Civil War]] and [[Northern  conflict]], [[jihadist insurgency in |an insurgency in western ]] by [[al-Qaeda]] and [[Islamic State]], the spillover of 's [[Boko Haram insurgency]] into south-eastern , and the use of  as a transit country for migrants (often organised by [[people-smuggling]] [[gang]]s).  and  forces assisted  in countering these threats.

On 10 December 2019, a large group of fighters belonging to the [[Islamic State in the Greater Sahara]] (IS-GS) [[Battle of Inates|attacked]] a military post in [[Inates]], killing over seventy [[ Armed Forces|soldiers]] and kidnapping others.

No candidate won an absolute majority in the vote: [[Mohamed Bazoum]] came closest with 39.33%. Per the constitution, a run-off election was held on 20 February 2021, with Bazoum taking 55.75% of the vote and opposition candidate (and former president) [[Mahamane Ousmane]] taking 44.25%, according to the electoral commission.

At the start of 2021 with the [[Tchoma Bangou and Zaroumdareye massacres]], IS-GS began killing civilians en masse. On 21 March 2021, the IS-GS militants [[Tillia massacres|attacked]] several villages around [[Tillia]], killing 141 people, mostly civilians.

Late on 26 July 2023, a [[2023  coup d'état|coup by the military]] overthrew Bazoum, putting an end to the Seventh Republic and the [[Ouhoumoudou Mahamadou's government|government]] of Prime Minister [[Ouhoumoudou Mahamadou]]. On 28 July, General [[Abdourahamane Tchiani]] was proclaimed as the ''de facto'' head of state of the country.

The coup was condemned by ECOWAS, which in the [[2023  crisis]] threatened to use military intervention to reinstate the government of Bazoum if the coup leaders did not by 6 August. The deadline passed without military intervention, though ECOWAS imposed sanctions, including cuts of  energy exports to  which had previously provided 70–90% of 's power. In November 2023 the coup-led governments of , , and  formed the [[Alliance of Sahel States]] in opposition to potential military intervention. On 24 February 2024 several ECOWAS sanctions against  were dropped, reportedly for humanitarian and diplomatic reasons, and  agreed to resume electricity exports to .

In the buildup to the August ECOWAS deadline, the junta requested help from the  [[Wagner Group]], though Wagner mercenaries were not known to have entered the country as a result.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}} In October the junta expelled  troops from the country, presenting the move as a step towards sovereignty from the former colonial power, and in December it suspended cooperation with the [[Francophonie]] alleging its promotion of  interests. UN resident coordinator [[Louise Aubin]] was also expelled in October after the junta alleged "underhanded maneuvers" by UN secretary-general António Guterres to prevent the country's participation in the UN General Assembly. In October the U.S. officially designated the takeover as a coup, suspending most –U.S. military cooperation as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign assistance programs.
