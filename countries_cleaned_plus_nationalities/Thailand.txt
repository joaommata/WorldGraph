Iron appeared around 500 BCE.{{rp|5}}

The [[Kingdom of Funan]] was the first and most powerful Southeast Asian kingdom at the time (2nd century BCE).{{rp|5}} The [[Mon people]] established the principalities of [[Dvaravati]] and Kingdom of [[Hariphunchai]] in the 6th century. The [[Khmer people]] established the [[Khmer empire]], centred in [[Angkor]], in the 9th century.{{rp|7}} [[Tambralinga]], a Malay state controlling trade through the [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]], rose in the 10th century.{{rp|5}} The Indochina peninsula was heavily influenced by the [[Indianized kingdom|culture and religions of ]] from the time of the Kingdom of Funan to that of the Khmer Empire.

The [[ people]] are of the [[Tai peoples|Tai ethnic group]], characterised by common linguistic roots.{{rp|2}}  chronicles first mention the Tai peoples in the 6th century BCE. While there are many assumptions regarding the origin of Tai peoples, [[David K. Wyatt]], a historian of , argued that their ancestors who at present inhabit , , , , and  came from the [[Điện Biên Phủ]] area between the 5th and the 8th century.{{rp|6}}

 people began migrating into present-day  gradually from the 6th to 11th century, which Mon and Khmer people occupied at the time. Thus  culture was influenced by , Mon, and Khmer cultures.{{rp|203}} Tai people intermixed with various ethnic and cultural groups in the region, resulting in many groups of present-day  people.{{efn-lr|See ''{{section link|#Ethnic groups}}''.}} Genetic evidences suggested that ethnolinguistics could not accurately predict the origins of the . [[Sujit Wongthes]] argued that  is not a race or ethnicity but a culture group.

According to  historian [[George Cœdès]], "The  first enter history of [[Farther ]] in the eleventh century with the mention of ''Syam'' slaves or prisoners of war in [[Champa]] epigraphy", and "in the twelfth century, the [[bas-relief]]s of [[Angkor Wat]]" where "a group of warriors" are described as ''Syam'',{{rp|190–191, 194–195}} though Cham accounts do not indicate the origins of ''Syam'' or what ethnic group they belonged to. The origins and ethnicity of the ''Syam'' remain unclear, with some literature suggesting that ''Syam'' refers to the [[Shan people]], the [[Bru people]], or the [[Brau people]]. However, mainland Southeast Asian sources from before the fourteenth century primarily used the word ''Syam'' as an [[ethnonym]], referring to those who belonged to a separate cultural category different from the Khmer, Cham, Bagan, or Mon. This contrasts with the  sources, where ''Xian'' was used as a [[toponym]].

Theoretically, [[Tai-Kadai]]-speaking people formed as early as the 12th century BCE in the middle of the [[Yangtze basin]]. Some groups later migrated south to [[Guangxi]]. However, after several bloody centuries against [[|]] influence in [[Guangxi]] between 333 BCE and the 11th century, hundreds of thousands of Tais were killed,{{rp|5}}{{rp|193, 239–249}} thus, [[Tai people]] began to move southwestward along the rivers and over the lower passes into the mountain north of [[Southeast Asia]] and river valleys in present-day [[Assam]] of [[]].{{sfn|Baker|Phongpaichit|2017|p= 26}} Some evidence indicates that the ancestors of Tai people migrated en masse southwestwards out of Yunnan only after the 1253 [[Uriyangkhadai#Invasion of Yunnan and Tibet|Mongol invasion of Dali]]; however, it is not generally accepted.{{rp|38}}

Tais defeated [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous tribes]] and emerged as the new power in the new region. As a result, several Tai city-states were established, scattered from [[Điện Biên Phủ]] in present-day northwestern [[]] and highland [[Southeast Asia]] to [[northeastern ]].

According to the ''Simhanavati legend'' given in several chronicles, the first Tai city-state in northern , [[Singhanavati]], was founded around the 7th century.{{rp|5, 9}} However, several modern [[geology]] and [[archaeology]] studies found that its centre, Yonok Nahaphan, dates from 691 BCE–545 CE;{{rp|7}} this roughly coincides with the establishment of [[Shan people#History|Shan States]], another Tai's federated principalities in the present-day northeast [[]]. as well as [[Muang Sua]] ([[Luang Prabang]]) in the east.

After Singhanavati was submerged below [[Chiang Saen Lake]] due to an [[earthquake]] in 545, the survivors then founded a new seat at {{ill|Wieng–Prueksha|th|เวียงปรึกษา}}. The kingdom lasted for another 93 years.

In addition to [[Singhanavati]], another northern principality probably related to the Tai people, [[Ngoenyang]], was established as the successor of Singhanavati in 638 by {{ill|Lavachakkaraj|th|ปู่เจ้าลาวจก}}, also centred in {{ill|Wieng–Prueksha|th|เวียงปรึกษา}} (present-day [[Mae Sai District]], [[Chiang Rai province|Chiang Rai]]).{{rp|8}} Its seat was moved to [[Chiang Mai]] in 1262 by King [[Mangrai]], which considered the foundation of the [[Lan Na]] kingdom. Mangrai unified the surrounding area and also created a network of states through political alliances to the east and north of the [[Mekong]]. His dynasty would rule the kingdom continuously for the next two centuries.{{rp|8}} [[Lan Na]] expanded its territory southward and annexed the [[Mon people|Mon]] [[Hariphunchai]] of [[Dvaravati]] in 1292.{{rp|208}}

In the late tenth century, Tai people began to migrate further south to the present-day upper [[central ]].{{rp|46–9, 83–6}} Around the 1100s period, several cities in this area, such as Songkwae, Sawankhalok, and Chakangrao, were ruled by the Tai people, eventually launching several battles against the pre-existing [[Mon people|Mon]] of [[Lavo Kingdom|Lavo]], who had been falling under [[Chenla]] and [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] influences since the 7th century, thus bringing the establishment of the Tai people's independent state, [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], in the upper [[Chao Phraya River]] valley in 1238.{{rp|52–3}}

The earliest conflict between [[Tai people]] and the preexisting ethnics was recorded in the mid-4th century when the ruler of [[Singhanavati]], {{ill|Pangkharat|th|พระเจ้าพังคราช}}, forcibly lost the seat at Yonok to King Khom from Umongasela (present-day [[Fang district|Fang]]). He then fled to Vieng Si Tuang ({{lang|th|เวียงศรีทวง}}; present-day Wiang Phang Kham, [[Mae Sai district]]) but had to send tributes to Yonok annually until his son, [[Phrom]], took back Yonok and expelled King Khom from Umongasela. [[Phrom]] also marched the troops south to occupy [[Kamphaeng Phet province|Chakangrao]] from the enemy as well as founding the city of [[Phitsanulok|Songkwae]]. Some historians suggest that [[Lavo Kingdom|Lavo]]'s capital, [[Lopburi]], was once seized by [[Phrom]]. In contrast, [[Tai people]] instead established relationships with Mon via [[royal intermarriage]]s.{{rp|46–9, 83–6}}

[[File:DvaravatiMapThailand.png|thumb|Map of settlements of Dvaravati culture from the 6th to 9th centuries|240px]]
The [[Chao Phraya River]] in what is now [[central ]] had once been the home of the [[Mon people|Mon]] [[Dvaravati]] culture, which prevailed from the seventh century to the tenth century. Samuel Beal discovered the polity among the  writings on Southeast Asia as "Duoluobodi". During the early 20th century, archaeological excavations led by [[George Coedès]] found [[Nakhon Pathom Province]] to be a centre of Dvaravati culture. The two most important sites were Nakorn Pathom and U Thong (in modern [[Suphan Buri Province]]). The inscriptions of Dvaravati were in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Mon language|Mon]] using the script derived from the [[Pallava alphabet]] of the [[South ]]n Pallava dynasty.

It is believed that the Dvaravati borrowed [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] through its contacts with , while the ruling class participated in [[Hindu]] rites. [[Dvaravati art]], including the Buddha sculptures and [[stupa]]s, showed strong similarities to those of the [[Gupta Empire]] of . The eastern parts of the Chao Phraya valley were subjected to a more Khmer and Hindu influence as the inscriptions are found in Khmer and Sanskrit.

Dvaravati was a network of city-states paying tribute to more powerful ones according to the [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala political model]]. Dvaravati culture expanded into [[Isan]] as well as south as far as the [[Kra Isthmus]]. Dvaravati culture lost its influence around the tenth century when they submitted to the more unified Lavo-Khmer polity.

Around the tenth century, the city-states of Dvaravati merged into the mandalas of: [[Lavo]] (modern [[Lopburi]]) and [[Suvarnabhumi]] (modern [[Suphan Buri]]). According to a legend in the Northern Chronicles, in 903, a king of [[Tambralinga]] invaded and took Lavo and installed a Malay prince on the Lavo throne. The Malay prince was married to a Khmer princess who had fled an Angkorian dynastic bloodbath. The son of the couple contested the Khmer throne and became [[Suryavarman I]] (1006–1050), thus bringing Lavo under Khmer domination through marital union. Suryavarman I also expanded into the [[Khorat Plateau]] (later styled "Isan"), constructing many temples.

[[File:ปราสาทปรางค์สามยอด2.jpg|thumb|240px|Wat [[Phra Prang Sam Yod]], a 13th-century Angkorian temple in [[Lopburi]].]]
After the [[Angkor]] lost Lavo to [[Suphannabhum]] princes in 1052, the younger prince [[Chandrachota]] claimed the throne. His son, [[Narai I]], moved Lavo's seat to [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya (city)|Ayodhya]] in the 1080s. This resulted in the throne of Lavo's Lavaburi being vacant from 1087 to 1106 (or ruled by unknown kings), [[Si Satchanalai]] king, [[Kesariraja]] who is of [[Mon people|Mon]]'s [[Mueang Chaliang|Chaliang]] and [[Tai people|Tai]]'s [[Chiang Saen]] lineages, took over the seat. An attempt to re-expand influence to Lavo by the Angkor occurred in 1181 when [[Jayavarman VII]] appointed his lineage Narupatidnavarman to govern Lavapura. Due to this political pressure, a Tai ruler Sri Thammasokkarat
({{lang|th|ศรีธรรมโศกราช}}), who was also from Si Satchanalai, fled to [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom|Nakhon Si Thammarat]].{{rp|38–39}} Sri Thammasokkarat married to princess of Dhanyapura (Dong Mae Nang Mueang in the present-day [[Nakhon Sawan province]]), and their descendants ruled [[Tambralinga]] until the late 13th century.{{rp|290–2}} The [[The Customs of ]] of [[Zhou Daguan]], as an official delegation sent by the [[Yuan dynasty]] to [[Angkor]] from 1296 to 1297, says the Siamese people exerted significant influence over Lavo's [[Lopburi|Lavapura]] and appeared in huge numbers in the Angkorian capital of [[Yaśodharapura]].

[[Phra Prang Sam Yot|Prang Sam Yot]] was built during this period.{{rp|170}} However, Lavapura was probably taken back by a Tai royal from Phraek Si Racha ({{lang|th|แพรกศรีราชา}}; present-day [[Sankhaburi district|Sankhaburi]]) in the 13th century.{{rp|109}} During this era, Angkor's power waned due to the weak rule and feuding began in the Angkor.{{rp|120}}

All of the turmoil, as mentioned earlier, also led to the independence declaration of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] in 1238.

==== The earliest evidence mentioning the Siamese ====
The earliest evidence to mention the Siam people are stone inscriptions found in [[Angkor Borei]] of [[Funan]] (K.557 and K.600), dated 661 CE, the slave's name is mentioned as "Ku Sayam" meaning "Sayam female slaves" (Ku is a prefix used to refer to female slaves in the pre-Angkorian era), and the Takéo inscriptions (K.79) written in 682 during the reign of [[Bhavavarman II]] of [[Chenla]] also mention Siam Nobel: ''Sāraṇnoya Poña Sayam'', which was transcribed into  as: ''the rice field that was given to the poña (noble rank) who was called Sayam (Siam)''.

The [[Song Huiyao Jigao]] (960–1279) indicate Siamese people settled in the west [[central ]] and their state was called ''Xiān guó'' ({{lang-zh|暹國}}), while the eastern plain belonged to the Mon of [[Lavo Kingdom|Lavo]] ({{lang-zh|羅渦國}}), who later fell under the [[Chenla]] and [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] hegemony around the 7th–9th centuries. Those Mon political entities, which also included [[Haripuñjaya]] in the north and several city-states in the [[northeastern |northeast]], are collectively called [[Dvaravati]].

However, the states of Siamese and Lavo were later merged via the [[royal intermarriage]] and became [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] in the mid-14th century, while the southwestern [[Isan]] principalities, centred in [[Phanom Rung Historical Park|Phanom Rung]] and [[Phimai]], later pledged allegiance to Siamese's Ayutthaya during the reign of [[Borommarachathirat II]] ({{tooltip|r.|reign}} 1424–1448). The remaining principal city-states in [[Isan]] region became [[Lan Xang]] around 1353 after the twin cities of [[Muang Sua]] ([[Luang Prabang]]) and ''Vieng Chan Vieng Kham'' ([[Vientiane]]) became independent following the death of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] king [[Ram Khamhaeng]].{{rp|51}}

According to the Wat Kud Tae inscription (K.1105), dated c. 7th century, during the period that the eastern Mon entity, [[Lavo Kingdom|Lavo]], was strongly influenced by the [[Chenla]], the Siamese in the west also established a [[royal intermarriage]] with [[Chenla]] as Sri Chakatham, prince of Sambhuka (ศามภูกะ, in the present-day [[Ratchaburi province]]), married to a princess of [[Isanavarman I]], and two [[Mandala (political model)|mandala]]s then became an ally. After [[Chenla]] sieged [[Funan]] and moved the centre to [[Angkor]], both Siamese and the Angkorian eventually marched the troops to attack [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]] of [[Champa]] in 1201 during the reign of [[Jayavarman VII]], as recorded in the Cho-Dinh inscription (C.3).

After the decline of the Khmer Empire and [[Pagan Kingdom|Kingdom of Pagan]] in the early 13th century, various states thrived in their place. The domains of Tai people existed from the northeast of present-day  to the north of present-day  and to the [[Malay Peninsula]].{{rp|38–9}} During the 13th century, Tai people had already settled in the core land of [[Dvaravati]] and [[Lavo Kingdom]] to [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom|Nakhon Si Thammarat]] in the south. There are, however, no records detailing the arrival of the Tais.{{rp|50–1}}

Around 1240, [[Si Inthrathit|Pho Khun Bang Klang Hao]], a local Tai ruler, rallied the people to rebel against the Khmer. He later crowned himself the first king of [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] in 1238.{{rp|52–3}} Mainstream  historians count Sukhothai as the first kingdom of  people. Sukhothai expanded furthest during the reign of [[Ram Khamhaeng]] ({{Reign|1279|1298}}). However, it was mostly a network of local lords who swore fealty to Sukhothai, not directly controlled by it.{{rp|pages=55–56}} He is believed have invented [[ script]] and  ceramics were an important export in his era. Sukhothai embraced [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] in the reign of [[Maha Thammaracha I]] (1347–1368).

According to the most widely accepted version of its origin, the Ayutthaya Kingdom rose from the earlier, nearby [[Lavo Kingdom]] and Suvarnabhumi with [[Uthong]] as its first king. Ayutthaya was a patchwork of self-governing principalities and tributary provinces owing allegiance to the King of Ayutthaya under the [[Mandala (political model)|mandala system]].{{rp|355}} Its initial expansion was through conquest and political marriage.

Before the end of the 15th century, Ayutthaya invaded the Khmer Empire three times and sacked its capital [[Angkor]].{{rp|26}} Ayutthaya then became a regional power in place of the Khmer. Constant interference of Sukhothai effectively made it a vassal state of Ayutthaya and it was finally incorporated into the kingdom. [[Borommatrailokkanat]] brought about bureaucratic reforms which lasted into the 20th century and created a system of social hierarchy called ''[[sakdina]]'', where male commoners were conscripted as [[corvée]] labourers for six months a year.{{rp|107}} Ayutthaya was interested in the [[Malay Peninsula]] but failed to conquer the [[Malacca Sultanate]], which was supported by the  [[Ming dynasty]].{{rp|11, 13}}

European contact and trade started in the early-16th century, with the [[Duarte Fernandes|envoy]] of [[ people|]] duke [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1511.  became an ally and ceded some soldiers to King Rama Thibodi II. The  were followed in the 17th century by the , , and . Rivalry for supremacy over Chiang Mai and the Mon people pitted Ayutthaya against the  Kingdom. Several wars with its ruling [[Taungoo dynasty]] starting in the 1540s in the reign of [[Tabinshwehti]] and [[Bayinnaung]] were ultimately ended with the [[–Siamese War (1568–70)|capture of the capital in 1570]].{{rp|146–7}} Then a brief period of vassalage to  until [[Naresuan]] proclaimed independence in 1584 followed.{{rp|11}}

Ayutthaya sought to improve relations with European powers for many successive reigns. The kingdom especially prospered during cosmopolitan [[Narai]]'s reign (1656–1688), when some European travellers regarded Ayutthaya as an Asian great power, alongside  and .{{rp|ix}} However, growing  influence later in his reign was met with nationalist sentiment and eventually led to the [[Siamese revolution of 1688]].{{rp|185–6}} Despite the revolution, overall relations remained stable, with  missionaries still actively preaching Christianity.{{rp|186}}

After a bloody period of dynastic struggle, Ayutthaya entered what has been called the Siamese "[[golden age]]", a relatively peaceful episode in the second quarter of the 18th century where [[ art|art]], [[ literature|literature]], and learning flourished. There were seldom foreign wars, apart from conflict with the [[Nguyễn lords]] for control of [[]] starting around 1715. The last fifty years of the kingdom witnessed bloody succession crises, where there were purges of court officials and able generals for many consecutive reigns. In 1765, a combined 40,000-strong force of  armies [[–Siamese War (1759–60)|invaded it]] from the north and west.{{rp|250}} The  under the new [[Alaungpaya]] dynasty quickly rose to become a new local power by 1759.

{{main|Thonburi Kingdom}}
[[File:KingTaksin's coronation.jpg|thumb|right|[[Taksin the Great]] enthroned himself as a  king in 1767.]]
The capital and many of its territories lay in chaos after the war. The former capital was occupied by the [[|]] garrison army and five local leaders declared themselves overlords, including the lords of Sakwangburi, [[Phitsanulok]], [[Pimai]], [[Chanthaburi]], and [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]]. [[Taksin|Chao Tak]], a capable military leader, proceeded to make himself a lord by [[right of conquest]], beginning with the legendary sack of [[Chanthaburi]]. Based at Chanthaburi, Chao Tak raised troops and resources, and sent a fleet up the [[Chao Phraya]] to take the fort of [[Thonburi]]. In the same year, Chao Tak was able to retake Ayutthaya from the  only seven months after the fall of the city.

Chao Tak then crowned himself as [[Taksin]] and proclaimed [[Thonburi]] as temporary capital in the same year. He also quickly subdued the other warlords. His forces engaged in wars with , , and , which successfully [[–Siamese War (1774–1775)|drove the  out of Lan Na]] in 1775,{{rp|225}} [[–Siamese War (1778–1779)|captured Vientiane]] in 1778{{rp|227–8}} and [[Siamese– War (1769–1773)|tried to install a pro- king in ]] in the 1770s. In his final years there was a coup, supposedly caused by his "insanity", and eventually Taksin and his sons were executed by his longtime companion General [[Rama I|Chao Phraya Chakri]] (the future Rama I). He was the first king of the ruling [[Chakri dynasty]] and founder of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] on 6 April 1782.

In 1821, Briton [[John Crawfurd]] was sent to negotiate a new trade agreement with Siam – the first sign of an issue which was to dominate 19th century Siamese politics. Bangkok signed the [[Burney Treaty]] in 1826, after the  victory in the [[First Anglo- War]].{{rp|281}}

A period of wasteful spending by [[Vajiravudh|King Vajiravudh]] followed by the [[Great Depression]] brought economic hardships on , with sharply falling rice prices, a significant reduction in public spending, eroded confidence in the monarchy, and discontent among aristocratic supporters all contributing to the destabilization of the [[Chakri dynasty]]. These conditions spurred on the bloodless [[Siamese revolution of 1932]], in which the [[Khana Ratsadon]] movement forced [[Prajadhipok|King Prajadhipok]] to sign the country's first constitution, thereby ending centuries of feudal and [[absolute monarchy]].{{rp|25}} Power was partially ceded to a [[Democracy|democratic]] government, but it would not last a year before the rise of significant military influence in  political affairs.

In 1933, [[Prime Minister of |Prime Minister]] [[Phraya Manopakorn Nitithada|Phraya Mano]] led a [[Boworadet rebellion|counter-revolutionary rebellion]] to reinstate an absolute monarchy under Prajadhipok.{{rp|446–8}} This was soon followed by a military coup that installed [[Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena|Phraya Phahon]] - a leader of the 1932 revolution - as Prime Minister. Prajadhipok's conflict with the government eventually led to his abdication, and the new military-led government selected [[]]-raised [[Ananda Mahidol]] to be the new king.{{rp|448–9}}

The armed wing of Khana Ratsadon gradually came to dominate Siamese politics. Military strongman [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]], often known as "Phibun", became premier in 1938 and launched a [[Songsuradet rebellion|campaign of political repression]] that saw the execution of both Monarchists and pro-democracy [[Liberalism|Liberals]].{{rp|457}} His government adopted [[ nationalism| nationalist]], pro-[[Westernisation]], anti-royalist, [[Irredentism|Irredentist]], [[Sinophobia|anti-]] and anti- policies.{{rp|28}}

In 1939, Phibun changed the country's name from "Siam" to "". This coincided with the rise of [[Fascism|fascist ideology]] in , with the name change reflecting policies that prioritized the needs of [[Tai peoples|ethnic ]] over those of minorities like the [[ ]]. Phibun was an admirer of [[Benito Mussolini]], and he imposed twelve [[ cultural mandates]] requiring citizens to obey nationalist norms such as saluting the flag, knowing the national anthem, speaking only , and wearing Western clothing.

In October 1940, months after [[Battle of |fall of ]] to [[Nazi ]], Phibun launched an opportunistic [[Franco- War|invasion]] of [[ Indochina| Indochinese]] territories [[Territorial losses of |lost]] to the [[| Empire]] during the reign of [[Chulalongkorn|King Chulalongkorn]]. The invasion was a success, with  additionally gaining some [[|]] and [[]]n territories.{{rp|462}}, which had also been invading  Indochinese territories, brokered a ceasefire that forced  to give up several territories to .

On 8 December 1941, [[ invasion of |the  Empire launched an invasion of ]], and fierce fighting broke out in Southern  before Phibun ordered an [[armistice]] and joined the [[Axis powers]] just five hours later.  was granted free passage through  territory, and on 21 December  and  signed a military alliance, with a secret protocol wherein the  government agreed to help  gain further territories throughout southeast Asia.

The  government then declared war on the  and the .{{rp|465}} The , whose colony [[ Malaya|Malaya]] was under immediate threat from  forces, responded in kind, but the  refused to declare war and ignored 's declaration.{{rp|66}} The [[Free  Movement]] was launched both in  and abroad to oppose the  government and  occupation.{{rp|465–6}} After the war ended in 1945, Phibun was ousted and  signed formal agreements to end the state of war with [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]]. In June 1946, King Ananda was found dead under mysterious circumstances, and his younger brother [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] ascended to the throne.

This period of Liberal rule was brief, with Phibun launching another military coup to take power in 1947. In his second term as Prime Minister, Phibun pursued an alliance with the  by undertaking a campaign of domestic [[anti-communism]], aiding the [[ War|US invasion of ]], and helping to establish the US-aligned [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO) in 1954.{{rp|493}} Following a tour of Europe and the US in 1955 where he was impressed by democratic practices like [[Freedom of speech in the |freedom of speech]], Phibun began to democratize  politics by allowing new political parties and trade unions to form, opening public forums, granting amnesty to former political opponents, and preparing  for its first [[Election|free elections]]. However, these practices likely aroused opposition to Phibun's dictatorial legacy, and the US supported his final ouster in 1957.

Field Marshal [[Sarit Thanarat]] took power by coup in 1957, and he proceeded to reverse Phibun's democratic reforms and ban the Khana Ratsadon party from politics. His rule from 1959 to 1963 was autocratic; he built his legitimacy around the god-like status of the monarch and by channelling the government and public's loyalty to the king.{{rp|511}} Though Phibun had been criticized for his close relationship to the , Sarit also aligned himself with them and militarily supported the [[ War| invasion of ]] in 1961, leading a simultaneous campaign of [[Anti-communist mass killings#|anti-communist mass killings]] in  that continued under his successor [[Thanom Kittikachorn]].{{rp|523}}

The Sarit and Thanom periods coincided with significant [[modernisation]] and [[Westernisation]] of  society. Rapid [[urbanisation]] occurred as the rural populace sought work in growing cities like [[Bangkok]]. Economic development and public education enabled the rise of an urban middle class.{{rp|534}} The growth of this economy based on [[wage labour]] rather than [[subsistence agriculture]] resulted in increased [[class consciousness]] and sympathies to the [[Communist Party of ]],{{rp|528}} while university-educated students formed movements against the military dictatorship.

=== Transition toward democracy (1973–2001) ===
{{main|History of  (1973–2001)|}}
In October 1973, a [[1973  popular uprising|popular democratic uprising]] against the Thanom government began to bring about an end to 's military regime.{{rp|541–3}} In response to mass killings of protesters, King Adulyadej installed [[Sanya Dharmasakti]] as Prime Minister, marking the first time that the king had intervened in  politics directly since 1932. The aftermath of the event marked a short-lived parliamentary democracy, often called the "era when democracy blossomed" (ยุคประชาธิปไตยเบ่งบาน).{{Citation needed|date=June 2024}}

With new democratic institutions limited in their capability to solidify power and pass reforms, the three years after the uprising were marked by political and economic instability. Right-wing fears of a Communist takeover of  grew following the captures of South ,  and  by Communist insurgents. These factors culminated in the [[6 October 1976 massacre|Thammasat University massacre]] in October 1976, in which police and right-wing mobs massacred students protesting the return of Thanom Kittikachorn to  politics.{{rp|548–9}} A military coup d'état on that day brought  a new ultra-[[Right-wing politics|right wing]] military government which cracked down on media outlets, government officials, and intellectuals, engendering a [[Communist insurgency in |communist insurgency]].  Another military coup the following year installed a more moderate military government, which offered amnesty to some communist fighters in 1978.

Military figure [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] was appointed Prime Minister from in 1980. He oversaw the beginning of a period of significant economic growth and democratization throughout the 1980s. Prem's premiership was often referred to as "premocracy" because it involved [[Semi-democracy|semi-democratic]] practices such as a Parliament composed of an all-elected House and an all-appointed Senate. Prem's [[Constitutionalism|constitutionalist]] political approach aided with a transition away from military rule and a negotiated end to the Communist insurgency by 1983. He maintained political stability via a close relationship with [[Bhumibol Adulyadej|King Bhumibol]], who helped to foil two military coups in attempts against Prem in [[1981  military rebellion|1981]] and in [[1985  coup d'état attempt|1985]].

In 1988,  saw its first freely-elected prime minister since the 1976 coup. [[Chatichai Choonhavan]] ruled for 3 years before being overthrown in a coup that ushered in two years of military rule under the [[National Peace Keeping Council]]. One of the coup leaders, [[Suchinda Kraprayoon]], was nominated as prime minister for the majority coalition government after the [[March 1992  general election|March 1992 general election]]. This caused a popular demonstration in Bangkok, which ended with a bloody military crackdown known as [[Black May (1992)|Black May]]. The King intervened in the event, granting amnesty to the belligerents and forcing the resignation of Suchinda.

Free elections were once again held in September 1992, bringing the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] [[Democrat Party ()|Democrat Party]] to power. Power passed between various neoliberal parties throughout the decade, who all had a hand in drafting the [[1997 constitution of |1997 "People's Constitution."]] Spurred on by the events of Black May, the constitution explicitly acknowledged several [[human rights]] and established several government and electoral accountability measures, including the creation of a fully-elected [[bicameral legislature]].

=== Shinawatra Era (2001–present) ===
{{Main|History of  (2001–present)}}
The neoliberal government's attempt to [[Currency peg|peg]] the [[ baht]] to the [[ dollar]] induced the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], crashing regional economies and ending nearly 40 years of uninterrupted economic growth in .{{rp|3}} To cover a shortage of foreign currency and investments, which had come primarily from , [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]]'s government took out a $17 billion [[International Monetary Fund]] loan in US dollars. To satisfy the conditions of the loan,  underwent a series of [[Austerity|austerity measures]] until the loan was repaid in 2003.

The crisis brought on the ascendancy of the populist [[ Rak  party]], whose base consisted primarily of indebted rural workers. Its prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] governed from 2001 until 2006. His policies were successful in reducing rural poverty and providing [[universal healthcare]]. However, Thaksin was viewed by opponents among the  upper and upper middle classes as a corrupt populist who was destroying the middle class in order to favour himself and the rural poor. Additionally, his rural poverty policies directly conflicted with King Bhumibol's recommendations, drawing the ire of royalists, a powerful faction in . Thaksin also faced crises in the form of the [[South  insurgency]], which escalated starting from 2004, and the [[2004  Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] which claimed around 8,000 lives in .

Massive protests against Thaksin led by the [[reactionary]] [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] (PAD) started in his second term as prime minister, and the monarchy and the military eventually agreed to oust him. The [[2005–2006  political crisis|crisis]] peaked in 2005 with a series of controversies surrounding Buddhist and monarchic institutions, and the army dissolved Thaksin's party with [[2006  coup d'état|a coup d'état in 2006]] and banned over a hundred of its executives from politics. After the coup, a military government was installed for one year.''''''

The military government faced significant resistance, with protesters frequently storming government buildings and elements within the military threatening yet another coup.'''''' In 2007, a civilian government led by the Thaksin-aligned [[People's Power Party ()|People's Power Party]] (PPP) was [[2007  general election|elected]]. [[2008  political crisis|Another protest led by PAD]] ended with the dissolution of PPP, and the [[Democrat Party ()|Democrat Party]] led a coalition government in its place. The pro-Thaksin [[United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship]] (UDD) protested both [[2009  political unrest|in 2009]] and [[2010  political protests|in 2010]], the latter of which ended with [[2010  military crackdown|a violent military crackdown]] causing more than 70 civilian deaths.

After [[2011  general election|the general election of 2011]], the [[Populism|populist]] [[Pheu  Party]] won a majority. [[Yingluck Shinawatra]], Thaksin's younger sister, became prime minister. The [[People's Democratic Reform Committee]] organised another anti-Shinawatra protest after the ruling party proposed an amnesty bill which would benefit Thaksin. Yingluck dissolved parliament and [[2014  general election|a general election]] was scheduled, but her decision was invalidated by the [[Constitutional Court of |Constitutional Court]]. The [[2013–2014  political crisis|crisis]] ended with [[2014  coup d'état|another coup d'état in 2014]].

The ensuing [[National Council for Peace and Order]], a military junta led by General [[Prayut Chan-o-cha]], led the country until 2019. Civil and political rights were restricted, and the country saw a surge in ''[[Lèse-majesté in |lèse-majesté]]'' cases. Political opponents and dissenters were sent to "attitude adjustment" camps; this was described by academics as indicating the return of fascism to . Bhumibol, the longest-reigning  king, [[Death and funeral of Bhumibol Adulyadej|died in 2016]], and his son [[Vajiralongkorn]] ascended to the throne. The referendum and adoption of 's current constitution happened under the junta's rule.{{efn-lr|The [[2016  constitutional referendum]] was held on 7 August 2016. Its ratification was held on 6 April 2017.}} The junta bound future governments to a 20-year national strategy 'road map' it laid down, effectively locking the country into [[Guided democracy|military-guided democracy]].

In 2019, the junta agreed to schedule [[2019  general election|a general election]]. General Prayut continued his premiership with the support of an elected [[Palang Pracharath Party]] coalition in the House and junta-appointed Senate, despite allegations of election fraud. An extended two-year period of [[2020–2021  protests|pro-democracy protests]] were subsequently triggered by distrust in the election as well as increasing [[royal prerogative]], democratic and economic regression under monarchy-supported military rule, retaliatory dissolution of the pro-democracy [[Future Forward Party]], regressive policies on political issues like women's and labour rights, forced disappearances and deaths of political activists like [[Wanchalearm Satsaksit]], and various political corruption scandals including [[1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal|1MDB]]. The protests brought forward unprecedented demands to reform the monarchy and the highest sense of [[republicanism]] in the country's history.

In May 2023, 's reformist opposition - the progressive [[Move Forward Party]] (MFP) and Thaksin's populist Pheu  Party - won the [[2023  general election|general election]], ending 9 years of royalist-military rule under Prayut. On 22 August 2023, [[Srettha Thavisin]] of the Pheu  party became 's new prime minister, while the ex-PM and party figurehead Thaksin Shinawatra returned to  after years in self-imposed exile from the military regime. Thavisin was later dismissed from his prime ministerial role on 14 August 2024 by the [[Constitutional Court of |Constitutional Court]] for "gross ethics violations". He was succeeded by Thaksin's daughter [[Paetongtarn Shinawatra]], who spent a year in office before the Constitutional Court ordered her removal over a controversial phone call with 's president. The Court then ordered the arrest of Thaksin in September 2025.
