=== Early history ===
[[File:Reception of the Manila Galleon by the Chamorro in the Ladrones Islands, ca. 1590.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Manila galleon]] in the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] and [[Caroline Islands|Carolinas]], c. 1590 [[Boxer Codex]] | alt=]]
 was originally settled between the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE by [[Austronesian peoples]], most likely from what is now the  or . [[Sonsorol]] was sighted by the [[ Empire|]] as early as 1521, when the [[ missions in the Carolinas| mission]] of the ''[[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'', the flagship of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s voyage of circumnavigation, sighted two small islands around the [[5th parallel north]], naming them "San Juan".

In December 1696, a group of sailors from the [[Caroline Islands]] were stranded on [[Samar]], near [[Guiuan]], when they met European missionary [[Pablo Clain|Paul Klein]]. Using pebbles, the sailors attempted to show Klein the approximate location and size of the islands. He used this information to produce the first European map of the  area. Klein sent the map to [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit Superior General]], along with a letter detailing the names of the islands, the culture of the people, and his experiences with them.

The Klein map and letter caused a vast interest in the new islands. Another letter written by Fr. Andrés Serrano was sent to Europe in 1705, essentially copying the information given by Klein. The letters resulted in three unsuccessful Jesuit attempts to travel to  from [[Captaincy General of the | ]] in 1700, 1708, and 1709. The islands were first visited by the Jesuit expedition led by Francisco Padilla on 30 November 1710. The expedition ended with the stranding of the two priests, Jacques Du Beron and Joseph Cortyl, on the coast of Sonsorol, because the mother ship ''[[Trinity|Santísima Trinidad]]'' was driven to [[Mindanao]] by a storm. Another ship was sent from [[Guam]] in 1711 to save them only to capsize, causing the death of three more Jesuit priests. The failure of these missions gave  the original  name ''Islas Encantadas'' (Enchanted Islands).
