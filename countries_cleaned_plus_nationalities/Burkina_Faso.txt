===Early history===
The northwestern part of present-day  was populated by [[hunter-gatherer]]s from 14,000 BC to 5,000 BC. Their tools, including [[scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], [[chisel]]s and [[arrowhead]]s, were discovered in 1973 through [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavations]]. Agricultural settlements were established between 3600 and 2600&nbsp;BC. The [[Bura culture]] was an [[Iron Age|Iron-Age]] [[civilization]] centred in the southwest portion of modern-day  and in the southeast part of contemporary . [[Iron industry]], in [[smelting]] and [[forging]] for tools and weapons, had developed in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] by 1200&nbsp;BC. To date, the oldest evidence of iron smelting found in  dates from 800 to 700 BC and forms part of the [[Ancient Ferrous Metallurgy Sites of |Ancient Ferrous Metallurgy]] World Heritage Site. From the 3rd to the 13th centuries AD, the [[Iron Age]] [[Bura culture]] existed in the territory of present-day southeastern  and southwestern . Various ethnic groups of present-day , such as the [[Mossi people|Mossi]], [[Fula people|Fula]] and [[Dyula people|Dioula]], arrived in successive waves between the 8th and 15th centuries. From the 11th century, the Mossi people established [[Mossi Kingdoms|several separate kingdoms]].

===8th to 18th centuries===
There is debate about the exact dates when 's many ethnic groups arrived to the area. The proto-[[Mossi people|Mossi]] arrived in the far eastern part of what is today  sometime between the 8th and 11th centuries, and accepted [[Islam]] as their religion in the 11th century. The [[Samo language (Burkina)|Samo]] arrived around the 15th century. The [[Dogon people|Dogon]] lived in 's north and northwest regions until sometime in the 15th or 16th centuries, and many of the other ethnic groups that make up the country's population arrived in the region during this time.

[[File:Pg381 Des hommes sur les toits s'opposent.jpg|thumb|Armed men prevent the  explorer [[Louis-Gustave Binger]] from entering Sia (Bobo-Dioulasso) during his stay in April 1892.]]

During the [[Middle Ages]], the Mossi established several separate kingdoms including those of Tenkodogo, Yatenga, Zandoma, and Ouagadougou. Sometime between 1328 and 1338, Mossi warriors raided [[Timbuktu]] but the Mossi were defeated by [[Sonni Ali]] of [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] at the Battle of Kobi in  in 1483.

During the early 16th century, the Songhai conducted many slave raids into what is today . During the 18th century, the [[Gwiriko|Gwiriko Empire]] was established at [[Bobo Dioulasso]] and ethnic groups such as the Dyan, Lobi, and Birifor settled along the [[Black Volta]].

Starting in the early 1890s during the European [[Scramble for Africa]], a series of European military officers made attempts to claim parts of what is today . At times these [[Colonialism|colonialists]] and their armies fought the local peoples; at times they forged alliances with them and made treaties. The colonialist officers and their home governments also made treaties among themselves. The territory of  was invaded by [[ Third Republic|]], becoming a [[ colonial empire| protectorate]] in 1896.

[[File:Carte de l'Afrique-Occidentale française, 1914.svg|thumb|[[ West Africa]] c. 1913]]

The eastern and western regions, where a standoff against the forces of the powerful ruler [[Samori Ture]] complicated the situation, came under  occupation in 1897. By 1898, the majority of the territory corresponding to  was nominally conquered; however,  control of many parts remained uncertain.

The [[Anglo- Convention of 1898|Franco-British Convention of 14 June 1898]] created the country's modern borders. In the  territory, a war of conquest against local communities and political powers continued for about five years. In 1904, the largely pacified territories of the [[Volta River|Volta basin]] were integrated into the [[Upper  and ]] colony of [[ West Africa]] as part of the reorganization of the  West African colonial empire. The colony had its capital in [[Bamako]].

The language of colonial administration and schooling became . The public education system started from humble origins. Advanced education was provided for many years during the colonial period in Dakar.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

The indigenous population was highly discriminated against. For example, African children were not allowed to ride bicycles or pick fruit from trees, "privileges" reserved for the children of colonists. Violating these regulations could land parents in jail.

[[Conscription|Draftees]] from the territory participated in the European fronts of [[World War I]] in the battalions of the [[Tirailleurs sénégalais| Rifles]]. Between 1915 and 1916, the districts in the western part of what is now  and the bordering eastern fringe of  became the stage of one of the most important armed oppositions to colonial government: the [[Volta-Bani War]].

The  government finally suppressed the movement but only after suffering defeats. {{Verify source|date=May 2025}} It also had to organize its largest expeditionary force of its colonial history to send into the country to suppress the insurrection. Armed opposition wracked the Sahelian north when the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and allied groups of the Dori region ended their truce with the government.

[[File:Mittelholzer-ouagadougou.jpg|thumb|The capital, [[Ouagadougou]], in 1930]]

[[ Upper Volta]] was established on 1 March 1919. The  feared a recurrence of armed uprising and had related economic considerations. To bolster its administration, the colonial government separated the present territory of  from Upper  and .

The new colony was named ''Haute Volta'' for its location on the upper courses of the [[Volta River]] (the [[Black Volta|Black]], [[Red Volta|Red]] and [[White Volta]]), and François Charles Alexis Édouard Hesling became its first [[List of governors of Upper Volta|governor]]. Hesling initiated an ambitious road-making program to improve infrastructure and promoted the growth of cotton for export. The cotton policy – based on [[coercion]] – failed, and revenue generated by the colony stagnated. The colony was dismantled on 5 September 1932, being split between the  colonies of [[]], [[ ]] and [[]].  received the largest share, which contained most of the population as well as the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

 reversed this change during the period of intense anti-colonial agitation that followed the end of [[World War II]]. On 4 September 1947, it revived the colony of Upper Volta, with its previous boundaries, as a part of the [[ Union]]. The  designated its colonies as departments of [[metropolitan ]] on the European continent.

On 11 December 1958, the colony achieved [[Self-governance|self-government]] as the [[Republic of Upper Volta]]; it joined the Franco-African Community. A revision in the organization of  Overseas Territories had begun with the passage of the Basic Law (Loi Cadre) of 23 July 1956. This act was followed by reorganization measures approved by the  parliament early in 1957 to ensure a large degree of self-government for individual territories. Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the  community on 11 December 1958. Full independence from  was received in 1960.

===Upper Volta (1958–1984)===
{{main|Republic of Upper Volta}}
[[File:Maurice Yaméogo and Louis Jacquinot exchanging instruments of ratification for the independence of the Upper Volta.jpg|thumb|[[Maurice Yaméogo]], the first president of Upper Volta, examines documents pertaining to the ratification of the country's independence in 1960.]]

The Republic of Upper Volta ({{langx|fr|link=no|République de Haute-Volta}}) was established on 11 December 1958 as a [[self-governing colony]] within the [[ Community]]. The name ''Upper Volta'' related to the nation's location along the upper reaches of the [[Volta River]]. The river's three [[Tributary|tributaries]], the [[Black Volta|Black]], [[White Volta|White]] and [[Red Volta]], were expressed in the three colors of the [[Flag of Upper Volta|former national flag]].

Before attaining autonomy, it had been  Upper Volta and part of the  Union. On 5 August 1960, it attained full independence from [[ Fourth Republic|]]. The first president, [[Maurice Yaméogo]], was the leader of the [[Voltaic Democratic Union]] (UDV). The 1960 constitution provided for election by [[universal suffrage]] of a president and a national assembly. Soon after coming to power, Yaméogo banned all political parties other than the UDV. The government lasted until 1966. After much unrest, including mass demonstrations and strikes by students, labor unions, and civil servants, the military intervened.

==== Lamizana's rule and multiple coups ====

The [[1966 Upper Voltan coup d'état|1966 military coup]] deposed Yaméogo, suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lt. Col. [[Sangoulé Lamizana]] at the head of a government of senior army officers. The army remained in power for four years. On 14 June 1976, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a four-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. Lamizana's rule coincided with the beginning of the [[Sahel drought]] and famine which had a devastating impact on Upper Volta and neighboring countries. After conflict over the 1976 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977. Lamizana was re-elected by open elections in 1978.

Lamizana's government faced problems with the country's traditionally powerful trade unions, and on 25 November 1980, Col. [[Saye Zerbo]] overthrew President Lamizana in a [[1980 Upper Voltan coup d'état|bloodless coup]]. Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority, thus eradicating the 1977 constitution.

Colonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later by Maj. Dr. [[Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo]] and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP) in the [[1982 Upper Voltan coup d'état]]. The CSP continued to ban political parties and organizations, yet promised a transition to civilian rule and a new constitution.

====1983 coup d'état====

Infighting developed between the right and left factions of the CSP. The leader of the leftists, Capt. [[Thomas Sankara]], was appointed prime minister in January 1983, but was subsequently arrested. Efforts to free him, directed by Capt. [[Blaise Compaoré]], resulted in a military coup d'état on 4 August 1983.

The coup brought Sankara to power and his government began to implement a series of revolutionary programs which included mass-vaccinations, infrastructure improvements, the expansion of women's rights, encouragement of domestic agricultural consumption, and anti-desertification projects.

===  (since 1984) ===
On 2 August 1984, on Sankara's initiative, the country's name changed from "Upper Volta" to "", or ''land of the honest men''; (the literal translation is ''land of the upright men'').{{request quotation|date=March 2020}} The presidential decree was confirmed by the National Assembly on 4 August 1984.

Sankara's government comprised the National Council for the Revolution (CNR – {{langx|fr|Conseil national révolutionnaire}}), with Sankara as its president, and established popular [[Committees for the Defense of the Revolution ()|Committees for the Defense of the Revolution]] (CDRs). The [[Pioneers of the Revolution]] youth programme was also established.

Sankara launched an ambitious socioeconomic programme for change, one of the largest ever undertaken on the African continent. His foreign policies centred on [[anti-imperialism]], with his government rejecting all [[foreign aid]], pushing for [[odious debt]] reduction, nationalising all land and mineral wealth and averting the power and influence of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[World Bank]]. His domestic policies included a nationwide literacy campaign, land redistribution to peasants, railway and road construction and the outlawing of [[female genital mutilation]], [[forced marriage]]s and [[polygamy]].

Sankara pushed for agrarian self-sufficiency and promoted public health by vaccinating 2,500,000 children against [[meningitis]], [[yellow fever]], and [[measles]]. His national agenda also included planting more than 10,000,000 trees to halt the growing [[desertification]] of the [[Sahel]]. Sankara called on every village to build a medical dispensary and had more than 350 communities build schools with their own labour.

In the 1980s, when ecological awareness was still very low, Sankara was one of the few African leaders to consider environmental protection a priority. He engaged in three major battles: against bush fires "which will be considered as crimes and will be punished as such"; against cattle roaming "which infringes on the rights of peoples because unattended animals destroy nature"; and against the illegitimate cutting of firewood "whose profession will have to be organized and regulated". As part of a development program involving a large part of the population, ten million trees were planted in  in fifteen months during the revolution. To face the advancing desert and recurrent droughts, Sankara also proposed the planting of wooded strips about fifty kilometers wide, crossing the country from east to west. Cereal production, close to 1.1 billion tons before 1983, was predicted to rise to 1.6 billion tons in 1987. Jean Ziegler, former UN special rapporteur for the right to food, said that the country "had become food self-sufficient."

==== Compaoré presidency ====
[[File:Blaise Compaore with George Bush July 16, 2008.jpg|thumb|[[Blaise Compaoré]] (left), President 1987–2014, shaking hands with [[George W. Bush]]]]
On 15 October 1987, Sankara and twelve other government officials were assassinated in a coup d'état organized by Blaise Compaoré, Sankara's former colleague, who took over as 's president. He held the position until October 2014. After the coup and although Sankara was known to be dead, some CDRs mounted an armed resistance to the [[Army of |army]] for several days. A majority{{quantify|date=March 2020}} of Burkinabè citizens hold that [[Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs ()|'s foreign ministry]], the [[Quai d'Orsay]], was behind Compaoré in organizing the coup. There is some evidence for 's support of the coup.

Compaoré gave the deterioration in relations with neighbouring countries as one of the reasons for the coup. He argued that Sankara had jeopardised foreign relations with the former colonial power ([[]]) and with neighbouring [[]]. Following the coup, Compaoré immediately reversed the nationalizations, overturned nearly all of Sankara's policies, returned the country back into the IMF fold, and ultimately spurned most of Sankara's legacy. Following an alleged [[1989  coup attempt|coup-attempt in 1989]], Compaoré introduced limited democratic reforms in 1990. Under the new (1991) [[Constitution of |constitution]], Compaoré was [[1991 Burkinabé presidential election|re-elected]] without opposition in December 1991. In 1998 Compaoré won [[1998 Burkinabé presidential election|election]] in a landslide. In 2004, 13 people were tried for plotting a coup against President Compaoré and the coup's alleged mastermind was sentenced to life imprisonment.

In 2000, the constitution was amended to reduce the presidential term to five years and set term limits to two, preventing successive re-election. The amendment took effect during the 2005 elections. If passed beforehand, it would have prevented Compaoré from being reelected. Other presidential candidates challenged the election results. But in October 2005, the constitutional council ruled that the amendment would not apply until the end of his second term in office. This cleared the way for his candidacy in [[2005 Burkinabé presidential election|the 2005 election]]. On 13 November 2005, he was reelected in a landslide.

In the [[2010 Burkinabé presidential election|2010 presidential election]], Compaoré was re-elected. Only 1.6 million Burkinabè voted, out of a total population 10 times that size. In February 2011, the death of a schoolboy provoked the [[2011 Burkinabè protests]], a series of popular protests, coupled with a military mutiny and a magistrates' strike, that called for Compaoré's resignation, democratic reforms, higher wages for troops and public servants and economic freedom. As a result, governors were replaced and wages for public servants were raised. In April 2011, there was an [[2011  mutiny|army mutiny]]; the president named new chiefs of staff, and a curfew was imposed in [[Ouagadougou]].

Compaoré's government played the role of negotiator in several West-African disputes, including the [[2010–2011 Ivorian crisis]], the Inter- Dialogue (2007), and the [[2012  coup d'état|2012  Crisis]]. {{As of|2014}},  remained one of the [[Least developed country|least-developed countries]] in the world.

==== Kafando presidency ====
{{Main|2014 Burkinabè uprising}}
[[File: Protests.png|thumb|Thousands of protesters march through Ouagadougou]]

Starting on 28 October 2014 protesters began to march and demonstrate in Ouagadougou against President Compaoré, who appeared{{request quotation|date=March 2020}} ready to amend the constitution and extend his rule. On 30 October protesters set fire to the parliament building and took over the national TV headquarters. [[Ouagadougou Airport|Ouagadougou International Airport]] closed and MPs suspended the vote on changing the constitution (the change would have allowed Compaoré to stand for re-election in 2015). Later in the day, the military dissolved all government institutions and imposed a [[curfew]].

On 31 October 2014, Compaoré resigned. [[Yacouba Isaac Zida|Lt. Col. Isaac Zida]] said that he would lead the country during its transitional period before the planned [[2015 Burkinabè general election|2015 presidential election]], but there were concerns{{by whom|date=March 2020}} over his close ties to the former president. In November 2014 opposition parties, [[civil society|civil-society]] groups and religious leaders adopted a plan for a transitional authority to guide  to elections. Under the plan [[Michel Kafando]] became the transitional president and Lt. Col. Zida became the acting Prime Minister and Defense Minister.

On 16 September 2015, the [[Regiment of Presidential Security]] (RSP) carried out a [[2015  coup d'état|coup d'état]], seizing the president and prime minister and then declaring the [[National Council for Democracy]] the new national government. However, on 22 September 2015, the coup leader, [[Gilbert Diendéré]], apologized and promised to restore civilian government. On 23 September 2015 the prime minister and interim president were restored to power.

==== Kaboré presidency and Jihadist insurgency (2015–2023) ====
{{main|Jihadist insurgency in |Terrorism in }}

[[2015 Burkinabè general election|General elections]] took place on 29 November 2015. [[Roch Marc Christian Kaboré]] won the election in the first round with 53.5% of the vote, defeating businessman [[Zéphirin Diabré]], who took 29.7%. Kaboré was sworn in as president on 29 December 2015. Kaboré was re-elected in the [[2020 Burkinabè general election|general election of 22 November 2020]], but his party Mouvement du Peuple pour le Progrès (MPP), failed to reach absolute parliamentary majority. It secured 56 seats out of a total of 127. The Congress for Democracy and Progress (CDP), the party of former President Blaise Compaoré, was distant second with 20 seats.

[[File:Smoke rises from Embassy of  in , March 2, 2018.jpg|thumb|Smoke rising from  Embassy in Ouagadougou, 2 March 2018, during the [[2018 Ouagadougou attacks]]]]

A [[Jihadist insurgency in |Jihadist insurgency]] began in August 2015, part of the [[Islamist insurgency in the Sahel]]. Between August 2015 and October 2016, seven different posts were attacked across the country. On 15 January 2016, terrorists [[2016 Ouagadougou attacks|attacked the capital city]] of [[Ouagadougou]], killing 30 people. [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] and [[Al-Mourabitoun (militant group)|Al-Mourabitoune]], which until then had mostly operated in neighbouring [[]], claimed responsibility for the attack.

In 2016, attacks increased after a new group [[Ansar ul Islam (Western Africa)|Ansarul Islam]], led by imam [[Ibrahim Malam Dicko]], was founded. Its attacks focused particularly on [[Soum Province|Soum province]] and it killed dozens of people in the [[Nassoumbou attack|attack on Nassoumbou]] on 16 December.

Between 27 March and 10 April 2017, the governments of [[]], , and  launched a joint operation named "Operation Panga", which involved 1,300 soldiers from the three countries, in the Fhero Forest, near the [[- border]], considered a sanctuary for Ansarul Islam. The head of Ansarul Islam, Ibrahim Malam Dicko, was killed in June 2017 and [[Jafar Dicko]] became leader.

On 2 March 2018, [[Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin]] [[2018 Ouagadougou attacks|attacked the  embassy]] in [[Ouagadougou]] as well as the general staff of the Burkinabè army. Eight soldiers and eight attackers were killed, and a further 61 soldiers and 24 civilians were injured. The insurgency expanded to the east of the country and, in early October, the Armed Forces of  launched a major military operation in the country's East, supported by  forces. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], between mid-2018 to February 2019, at least 42 people were murdered by jihadists and a minimum of 116 mostly Fulani civilians were killed by military forces without trial. The attacks [[2019 attacks in |increased significantly in 2019]]. According to the [[Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project|ACLED]], armed violence in  jumped by 174% in 2019, with nearly 1,300 civilians dead and 860,000 displaced. Jihadist groups also began to specifically target [[Christianity in |Christians]].
[[File:Des déplacés peuls sur le site de Barsalogho au petit matin, au , le 15 janvier 2019.png|thumb|Displaced Fulani civilians in the aftermath of the [[Yirgou massacre]]]]
On 8 July 2020, the  raised concerns after a [[Human Rights Watch]] report revealed mass graves with at least 180 bodies, which were found in northern  where soldiers were fighting jihadists. On 4 June 2021, the Associated Press reported that according to the government of , gunmen killed at least 100 people in Solhan village in northern  near the  border. A local market and several homes were also burned down. A government spokesman blamed jihadists. Heni Nsaibia, senior researcher at the [[Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project]] said it was the deadliest attack recorded in  since the beginning of the jihadist insurgency.{{fcn|date=July 2025}}

From 4–5 June 2021, unknown militants [[Solhan and Tadaryat massacres|massacred more than 170 people in the villages of Solhan and Tadaryat]]. Jihadists killed 80 people in [[Gorgadji Department|Gorgadji]] on 20 August. On 14 November, the [[Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin]] attacked a gendarmerie in [[Inata, |Inata]], killing 53 soldiers, the heaviest loss of life by the  military during the insurgency, and a major [[morale]] loss in the country. In December Islamists killed 41 people in an ambush, including the popular vigilante leader Ladji Yoro. Yoro was a central figure in the [[Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland]] (VDP) a pro-government militia that had taken a leading role in the struggle against Islamists.

In 2023, shortly after the murder of a Catholic priest by insurgents, the bishop of Dori, Laurent Dabiré, claimed in an interview with Catholic charity [[Aid to the Church in Need]] that around 50% of the country was in the hands of Islamists.

[[File:Alliance of Sahel States.svg|thumb|upright|The [[Alliance of Sahel States]] between ,  and ]]
In a successful coup on 24 January 2022, mutinying soldiers arrested and deposed President [[Roch Marc Christian Kaboré]] following gunfire. The [[Patriotic Movement for Safeguard and Restoration]] (MPSR) supported by the military declared itself to be in power, led by Lieutenant Colonel [[Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba]]. On 31 January, the military junta restored the constitution and appointed Damiba interim president. In the aftermath of the coup, [[Economic Community of West African States|ECOWAS]] and the [[African Union]] suspended 's membership. On 10 February, the Constitutional Council declared Damiba president. He was sworn in as president on 16 February. On 1 March 2022, the junta approved a charter allowing a military-led transition of 3 years. The charter provides for the transition process to be followed by the holding of elections. [[Roch Marc Christian Kaboré|President Kaboré]], who had been detained since the military junta took power, was released on 6 April 2022.

The insurgency continued following the coup, with about 60% of the country under government control. The [[Siege of Djibo]] began in February 2022 and continued as of June 2023. Between 100 and 165 people [[2022 Seytenga massacre|were killed]] in [[Seytenga Department]], [[Séno Province]] on 12–13 June and around 16,000 people fled their homes. In June 2022, the Government announced the creation of "military zones", which civilians were required to vacate so that the country's Armed and Security Forces could fight insurgents without any "hindrances".

On 30 September 2022, Damiba was ousted in a military coup led by Capt. [[Ibrahim Traoré]]. This came eight months after Damiba had seized power. The rationale given by Traoré for the coup d'état was the purported inability of Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba to deal with an Islamist insurgency. Damiba resigned and left the country. On 6 October 2022, Captain Ibrahim Traoré was officially appointed as president. [[Apollinaire Joachim Kyélem de Tambèla]] was appointed interim Prime Minister on 21 October 2022.

On 13 April 2023, authorities in  declared a mobilisation in order to give the nation all means necessary to combat terrorism and create a "legal framework for all the actions to be taken" against the insurgents in recapturing 40% of the national territory from Islamist insurgents. On 20 April, the Rapid Intervention Brigade committed the [[Karma massacre]], rounding up and executing civilians ''en masse''. Between 60 and 156 civilians were killed.

On 25 August 2024, [[Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin|JNIM]] again launched [[2024 Barsalogho attack|a major attack]] in the region of [[Barsalogho Department|Barsalogho]], killing at least 400 people.

In 2025, the armed forces foiled an attempted coup which they said had been planned by plotters based in the [[]]. Thousands rallied in Ouagadougou in support of the military government after the foiled coup plot. In May, reports of a digital [[cult]] around Traoré began to surface.
