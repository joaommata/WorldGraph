Areas comprising what is now  participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archaeological research. The trading network existed for 3,000 years, between 2000 BC to 1000 AD. The settlement known as Vijayapura was a vassal-state to the Buddhist [[Srivijaya]] empire and was thought to be located in Borneo's Northwest which flourished in the 7th Century. Vijayapura itself upon earlier in its history, was a rump state of the fallen multi-ethnic: Austronesian, Austroasiatic and , [[kingdom of Funan|Funan Civilization]]; previously located in what is now .{{rp|36}} This alternative Srivijaya known as Vijayapura referring to , was known to Arabic sources as "Sribuza".

One of the earliest  records of an independent kingdom in Borneo is the 977 AD letter to the  emperor from the ruler of Boni, which some scholars believe to refer to Borneo. The  regained their independence from Srivijaya due to the onset of a Javanese-Sumatran war. In 1225, the  official [[Zhao Rukuo]] reported that Boni had 100 warships to protect its trade, and that there was great wealth in the kingdom.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=43}} Marco Polo suggested in his memoirs that the Great Khan or the ruler of the Mongol Empire, attempted and failed many times in invading "Great Java" which was the European name for  controlled Borneo.{{Additional citation needed|date=December 2021}}

According to Wang Zhenping, in the 1300s, the ''Yuan Dade nanhai zhi'' or "Yuan dynasty Dade period southern sea records" reported that  conquered or administered [[Sarawak]] and [[Sabah]] as well as the  kingdoms of [[Rajahnate of Butuan|Butuan]], [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sulu]], [[Ma-i]] (Mindoro), Malilu 麻裏蘆 ([[Maynila (historical polity)|Manila]]), [[Sanmalan|Shahuchong]] 沙胡重 (Siocon or [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]]), Yachen 啞陳 [[Oton]], and 文杜陵 Wenduling ([[Sultanate of Maguindanao|Mindanao]]), which would regain their independence at a later date.

In the 14th century, the [[Java]]nese manuscript ''[[Nagarakretagama]]'', written by [[Mpu Prapanca|Prapanca]] in 1365, mentioned ''Barune'' as the constituent state of Hindu [[Majapahit]], which had to make an annual [[tribute]] of 40 [[catty|katis]] of [[camphor]]. In 1369, Sulu which was also formerly part of Majapahit, had successfully rebelled and then attacked Boni, and had invaded the Northeast Coast of Borneo and afterwards had looted the capital of its treasure and gold including sacking two sacred pearls. A fleet from Majapahit succeeded in driving away the Sulus, but Boni was left weaker after the attack.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=44}} A  report from 1371 described Boni as poor and totally controlled by Majapahit.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=45}} When the  admiral [[Zheng He]] visited the  in the early 15th century, he founded a major trading port which included  people who were actively trading with .

During the 15th century, Boni had seceded from Majapahit and then converted to Islam. Thus transforming into the independent Sultanate of .  became a [[Hashemite]] state when she allowed the Arab Emir of Mecca, [[Sharif Ali]], to become her third sultan.

As customary for close affiliation and alliances in Southeast Asia, the royal family of Luzon intermarried with the ruling houses of the [[ Empire|Sultanate of ]]. Intermarriage was a common strategy for Southeast Asian states to extend their influence.  However, Islamic 's power was not uncontested in Borneo since it had a Hindu rival in a state founded by  called [[Kutai]] in the south which they overpowered but didn't destroy.

Nevertheless, by the 16th century, Islam was firmly rooted in , and the country had built one of its biggest mosques. In 1578, Alonso Beltrán, a  traveller, described it as being five stories tall and built on the water.

=== War with  and decline ===
[[File: territorial lose (1400–1890).gif|thumb|left| territorial losses from 1400 to 1890]]  briefly rose to prominence in Southeast Asia when the  occupied [[Malacca]] and thereby forced the wealthy and powerful but displaced Muslim refugees there to relocate to nearby Sultanates such as . The  Sultan then intervened in a territorial conflict between [[Kingdom of Tondo|Hindu Tondo]] and [[Kingdom of Maynila|Muslim Manila]] in the  by appointing the  descended [[Rajah Matanda|Rajah Ache]] of Manila as admiral of the  navy in a rivalry against Tondo and as the enforcer of  interests in the . He subsequently encountered the Magellan expedition wherein [[Antonio Pigafetta]] noted that under orders from his grandfather the Sultan of , Ache had previously sacked the Buddhist city of Loue in Southwest Borneo for being faithful to the old religion and rebelling against the authority of Sultanate. However, [[Colonialism|European influence]] gradually brought an end to 's [[regional power]], as  entered a period of decline compounded by internal strife over royal succession. In the face of these invasions by European Christian powers, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Caliphate]] aided the beleaguered Southeast Asian Sultanates by making [[Ottoman expedition to Aceh|Aceh]] a [[protectorate]] and sending expeditions to reinforce, train and equip the local [[mujahideen]]. Turks were routinely migrating to  as evidenced by the complaints of Manila Oidor Melchor Davalos who in his 1585 report, say that Turks were coming to Sumatra, Borneo and Ternate every year, including defeated veterans from the [[Battle of Lepanto]].

 [[Castille War|declared war]] in 1578, planning to attack and capture [[Kota Batu, -Muara|Kota Batu]], 's capital at the time. This was based in part on the assistance of two  [[Pengiran#|noblemen]], Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The former had travelled to [[Manila]], then the centre of the  colony. Manila itself was captured from , Christianised and made a territory of the [[Viceroyalty of New ]] which was centered in  City. Pengiran Seri Lela came to offer  as a [[tributary state|tributary]] to  for help to recover the throne usurped by his brother, Saiful Rijal. The  agreed that if they succeeded in conquering , Pengiran Seri Lela would be appointed as the sultan, while Pengiran Seri Ratna would be the new [[Bendahara]].

In March 1578, a fresh  fleet had arrived from  and settled at the . They were led by [[Francisco de Sande|De Sande]], acting as [[Capitán-General]]. He organised an expedition from Manila for , consisting of 400 Spaniards and , 1,500 [[ people|]] natives, and 300 Borneans. The campaign was one of many, which also included action in [[Mindanao]] and [[Sulu Archipelago|Sulu]]. The racial make-up of the Christian side was diverse since it were usually made up of [[Mestizos]], [[Mulattoes]] and Amerindians ([[Aztecs]], [[Maya peoples|Mayans]] and [[Incans]]) who were gathered and sent from  and were led by  officers who had worked together with native  in military campaigns across the Southeast Asia. The Muslim side was also equally racially diverse. In addition to the native Malay warriors, the Ottomans had repeatedly sent military expeditions to nearby [[Ottoman expedition to Aceh|Aceh]]. The expeditions were composed mainly of [[Turkic people|Turks]], [[]], [[Swahili people|Swahilis]], [[]], [[Sindhis]], [[Gujaratis]] and [[Malabars]]. These expeditionary forces had also spread to other nearby Sultanates such as  and had taught new fighting tactics and techniques on how to forge cannons.

Eventually, the  captured the capital on 16 April 1578, with the help of Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The Sultan Saiful Rijal and Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Abdul Kahar were forced to flee to Meragang then to [[Jerudong]]. In Jerudong, they made plans to chase the conquering army away from . Suffering high fatalities due to a [[cholera]] or [[dysentery]] outbreak, the  decided to abandon  and returned to Manila on 26 June 1578, after 72 days.

Pengiran Seri Lela died in August or September 1578, probably from the same illness suffered by his  allies.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} There was suspicion that the legitimist sultan could have been poisoned by the ruling sultan.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} Seri Lela's daughter, a  princess, "Putri", had left with the , she abandoned her claim to the crown and then she married a Christian [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], named Agustín de Legazpi de Tondo. [[Agustin de Legaspi]] along with his family and associates were soon implicated in the [[Conspiracy of the Maharlikas]], an attempt by  to link up with the  Sultanate and  Shogunate to expel the Spaniards from the . However, upon the  suppression of the conspiracy, the  descended aristocracy of precolonial Manila were exiled to [[Guerrero, ]] which consequently later became a center of the [[Isidoro Montes de Oca| war of independence against ]].

The local  accounts{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=41}} of the Castilian War differ greatly from the generally accepted view of events. What was called the Castilian War was seen as a heroic episode, with the Spaniards being driven out by [[Bendahara Sakam]], purportedly a brother of the ruling sultan, and a thousand native warriors. Most historians consider this to be a [[folk-hero]] account, which probably developed decades or centuries after.

 eventually descended into anarchy. The country suffered a [[ Civil War of 1660|civil war]] from 1660 to 1673.

In the 1880s, the decline of the [[ Empire]] continued. The sultan granted land (now Sarawak) to [[James Brooke]], who had helped him quell a rebellion, and allowed him to establish the [[Raj of Sarawak]]. Over time, Brooke and his nephews (who succeeded him) leased or annexed more land.  lost much of its territory to him and his dynasty, known as the [[White Rajahs]].

The treaty said that the sultan "could not cede or lease any territory to foreign powers without  consent"; it provided Britain effective control over 's external affairs, making it a [[ protected state]] (which continued until 1984). But, when the Raj of Sarawak annexed 's [[Limbang Division|Pandaruan District]] in 1890, the  did not take any action to stop it. They did not regard either  or the Raj of Sarawak as 'foreign' (per the Treaty of Protection). This final annexation by Sarawak left  with its current small land mass and separation into two parts.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=58}}

After six days' fighting, they occupied the entire country. The only Allied troops in the area were the 2nd Battalion of the [[15th Punjab Regiment]] based at [[Kuching]], Sarawak.

Once the  occupied , they made an agreement with [[Ahmad Tajuddin|Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin]] over governing the country. Inche Ibrahim (known later as Pehin Datu Perdana Menteri Dato Laila Utama Awang Haji Ibrahim), a former Secretary to the  Resident, Ernest Edgar Pengilly, was appointed [[chief administrative officer]] under the  Governor. The  had proposed that Pengilly retain his position under their administration, but he declined. Both he and other  nationals still in  were interned by the  at [[Batu Lintang camp]] in Sarawak. While the  officials were under  guard, Ibrahim made a point of personally shaking each one by the hand and wishing him well.

The Sultan retained his throne and was given a pension and honours by the . During the later part of the occupation, he resided at Tantuya, [[Limbang]] and had little to do with the . Most of the Malay government officers were retained by the . 's administration was reorganised into five prefectures, which included  [[North Borneo]]. The Prefectures included [[Miri Division|Baram]], Labuan, [[Lawas]], and [[Limbang]]. Ibrahim hid numerous significant government documents from the  during the occupation. Pengiran Yusuf (later YAM Pengiran Setia Negara Pengiran [[Haji Mohd Yusuf]]), along with other , was sent to  for training. Although in the area the day of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], Yusuf survived.

The  had anticipated a  attack, but lacked the resources to defend the area because of their engagement in the war in Europe. The troops from the Punjab Regiment filled in the [[Seria]] oilfield oilwells with concrete in September 1941 to deny the  their use. The remaining equipment and installations were destroyed when the [[ invasion of Malaya| invaded Malaya]]. By the end of the war, 16 wells at [[Miri, |Miri]] and Seria had been restarted, with production reaching about half the pre-war level. Coal production at [[Muara, |Muara]] was also recommenced, but with little success.

During the occupation, the  had their language taught in schools, and Government officers were required to learn . The local currency was replaced by what was to become known as [[Banana money|''duit pisang'' (banana money)]]. From 1943 hyper-inflation destroyed the currency's value and, at the end of the war, this currency was worthless. Allied attacks on shipping eventually caused trade to cease. Food and medicine fell into short supply, and the population suffered from famine and disease.

The [[ International Airport|airport]] runway was constructed by the  during the occupation, and in 1943  naval units were based in [[ Bay]] and Labuan. The naval base was destroyed by Allied bombing, but the airport runway survived. The facility was developed as a public airport. In 1944 the Allies began a bombing campaign against the occupying , which destroyed much of the town and Kuala Belait, but missed [[Kampong Ayer]].

They also had to put out the fires on the wells of Seria, which had been set by the  prior to their defeat.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=80}}

Before 1941, the Governor of the Straits Settlements, based in , was responsible for the duties of  High Commissioner for , [[Kingdom of Sarawak|Sarawak]], and [[North Borneo]] (now [[Sabah]]).{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=81}} The first [[ High Commissioner]] for  was the Governor of Sarawak, Sir Charles Ardon Clarke.

The party intended to "preserve the sovereignty of the Sultan and the country, and to defend the rights of the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]]". BARIP also contributed to the composition of the country's national anthem. The party was dissolved in 1948 due to inactivity.

In 1959, a new constitution was written declaring  a self-governing state, while its foreign affairs, security, and defence remained the responsibility of the . A small [[rebellion]] erupted against the monarchy in 1962, which was suppressed with help of the UK. Known as the [[ Revolt]], the rebellion contributed to the Sultan's decision to opt out of joining the emerging state now called  under the umbrella of [[North Borneo Federation]].

=== Writing of the Constitution ===
[[File:Omar Ali Saifuddien III.jpg|thumb|Sultan [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]]]]
In July 1953, Sultan [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]] formed a seven-member committee named ''Tujuh Serangkai'', to determine the citizens' views regarding a written constitution for . In May 1954, the Sultan, Resident and High Commissioner met to discuss the findings of the committee. They agreed to authorise the drafting of a constitution. In March 1959, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III led a delegation to London to discuss the proposed Constitution.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=98}} The  delegation was led by Sir [[Alan Lennox-Boyd]], Secretary of State for the Colonies. The  Government later accepted the draft constitution.

On 29 September 1959, the Constitution Agreement was signed in [[Bandar Seri Begawan| Town]]. The agreement was signed by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III and Sir Robert Scott, the Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia.
It included the following provisions:{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=59}}
* The Sultan was made the Supreme Head of State.
*  was responsible for its internal administration.
* The  Government was responsible for foreign and defence affairs only.

* The Council of Succession
* The State Religious Council

=== National development plans ===
A series of National Development Plans was initiated by the 28th Sultan of , [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]].

The first was introduced in 1953.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=92}} A total sum of B$100&nbsp;million was approved by the  State Council for the plan. E.R. Bevington, from the Colonial Office in [[]], was appointed to implement it.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=129}} A US$14&nbsp;million Gas Plant was built under the plan. In 1954, survey and exploration work were undertaken by the  Shell Petroleum on both offshore and onshore fields. By 1956, production reached 114,700 [[barrels per day|bpd]].

[[File:THE  ARMY IN , JANUARY 1963.jpg|thumb| soldiers in the [[ protectorate]] of  on guard in the [[Seria Field|Seria oilfield]], January 1963]]
The plan also aided the development of public education. By 1958, expenditure on education totalled at $4&nbsp;million.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=129}} Communications were improved, as new roads were built and reconstruction at [[Old Airport, |Berakas Airport]] was completed in 1954.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=21}}

The second National Development Plan was launched in 1962.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=21}} A major oil and gas field was discovered in 1963. Developments in the oil and gas sector have continued, and oil production has steadily increased since then.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=96}} The plan also promoted the production of meat and eggs for consumption by citizens. The fishing industry increased its output by 25% throughout the course of the plan. The [[List of Panamax ports|deepwater port]] at [[Muara, |Muara]] was also constructed during this period. Power requirements were met, and studies were made to provide electricity to rural areas.{{sfn|History for  Darussalam|2009|p=96}} Efforts were made to eradicate [[malaria]], an endemic disease in the region, with the help of the [[World Health Organization]]. Malaria cases were reduced from 300 cases in 1953 to only 66 cases in 1959. The death rate was reduced from 20 per thousand in 1947 to 11.3 per thousand in 1953. Infectious disease has been prevented by public sanitation and improvement of drainage, and the provision of piped pure water to the population.

=== Independence ===
On 14 November 1971, Sultan [[Hassanal Bolkiah]] left for London to discuss matters regarding the amendments to the 1959 constitution. A new agreement was signed on 23 November 1971 with the  representative being [[Anthony Royle, Baron Fanshawe of Richmond|Anthony Royle]].

Under this agreement, the following terms were agreed upon:
*  was granted full internal self-government
* The UK would still be responsible for external affairs and defence.
*  and the UK agreed to share the responsibility for security and defence.

This agreement also caused [[ Military Garrison |Gurkha units]] to be deployed in , where they remain up to this day.

[[File:Sultan of  with Janin Erih.jpg|thumb|Sultan [[Hassanal Bolkiah]] (right), handing his credentials to ambassador [[Janin Erih]] in 2004]]
On 7 January 1979, another treaty was signed between  and the . It was signed with Lord Goronwy-Roberts being the representative of the UK. This agreement granted  to take over international responsibilities as an independent nation. Britain agreed to assist  in diplomatic matters. In May 1983, it was announced by the UK that the date of independence of  would be 1 January 1984.

On 31 December 1983, a mass gathering was held on main mosques on all four of the districts of the country and at midnight, on 1 January 1984, the Proclamation of Independence was read by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. The sultan subsequently assumed the title "[[Majesty|His Majesty]]", rather than the previous "[[His Royal Highness]]".  was [[Member states of the United Nations|admitted to the United Nations]] on 22 September 1984, becoming the organisation's 159th member.

=== 21st century ===
In October 2013, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah announced his intention to impose [[Penal Code]] from [[Sharia]] on the country's Muslims, which make up roughly two-thirds of the country's population. This would be implemented in three phases, culminating in 2016, and making  the first and only country in East Asia to introduce Sharia into its penal code, excluding the subnational  special territory of [[Aceh]]. The move attracted international criticism, the United Nations expressing "deep concern".
