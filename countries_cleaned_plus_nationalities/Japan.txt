Modern humans arrived in  around 38,000 years ago (~36,000 BC), marking the beginning of the [[ Paleolithic]]. Around 14,500&nbsp;BC (the start of the [[Jōmon period]]), a [[Mesolithic]] to [[Neolithic]] semi-sedentary [[hunter-gatherer]] culture characterized by [[pit dwelling]] and rudimentary agriculture emerged. [[Jōmon pottery|Clay vessels]] from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery. The [[Japonic]]-speaking [[Yayoi people]] later entered the archipelago from the  Peninsula, intermingling with the [[Jōmon people]]. The [[Yayoi period]] saw the introduction of innovative practices including [[Paddy field|wet-rice farming]], a new [[Yayoi pottery|style of pottery]], and metallurgy from  and Korea. According to legend, [[Emperor Jimmu]] (descendant of [[Amaterasu]]) founded a kingdom in central  in 660 BC, beginning [[Imperial House of |a continuous imperial line]].

 first appears in written history in the  ''[[Book of Han]]'', completed in 111 AD, where it is described as having a hundred small kingdoms. A century later, the ''[[Book of Wei]]'' records that the kingdom of [[Yamatai]] (which may refer to [[Yamato Kingship|Yamato]]) unified most of these kingdoms. [[Buddhism]] was introduced to  from [[Baekje]] (a  kingdom) in 552, but the development of [[ Buddhism]] was primarily influenced by . Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like [[Prince Shōtoku]], and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the [[Asuka period]] (592–710).

In 645, the government led by [[Prince Naka no Ōe]] and [[Fujiwara no Kamatari]] devised and implemented the far-reaching [[Taika Reform]]s. The Reform began with land reform, based on Confucian ideas and [[ philosophy|philosophies]] from [[]]. It nationalized all land in , to be [[Equal-field system|distributed equally]] among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation. The true aim of the reforms was to bring about greater centralization and to enhance the power of the imperial court, which was also based on the governmental structure of . Envoys and students were dispatched to  to learn about  writing, politics, art, and religion. 

The [[Jinshin War]] of 672, a bloody conflict between [[Prince Ōama]] and his nephew [[Prince Ōtomo]], became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms. These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the [[Taihō Code]], which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments. These legal reforms created the {{transliteration|ja|[[ritsuryō]]}} state, a system of -style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.

The [[Nara period]] (710–784) marked the emergence of a  state centered on the Imperial Court in [[Heijō Palace|Heijō-kyō]] (modern [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent [[ literature|literary culture]] with the completion of the {{transliteration|ja|[[Kojiki]]}} (712) and {{transliteration|ja|[[Nihon Shoki]]}} (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and [[Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara|architecture]]. A [[735–737  smallpox epidemic|smallpox epidemic in 735–737]] is believed to have killed as much as one-third of 's population. In 784, [[Emperor Kanmu]] moved the capital, settling on [[Heian-kyō]] (modern-day [[Kyoto]]) in 794. This marked the beginning of the [[Heian period]] (794–1185), during which a distinctly indigenous  culture emerged. [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' and the lyrics of 's national anthem {{transliteration|ja|"[[Kimigayo]]"}} were written during this time.

===Feudal era===

's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the [[samurai]]. In 1185, following the defeat of the [[Taira clan]] by the [[Minamoto clan]] in the [[Genpei War]], samurai [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] established a [[military government]] at [[Kamakura]]. After Yoritomo's death, the [[Hōjō clan]] came to power as regents for the {{transliteration|ja|shōgun}}. The [[Zen]] school of Buddhism was introduced from  in the [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class. 

The [[Kamakura shogunate]] repelled [[Mongol invasions of |Mongol invasions]] in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually [[Kenmu Restoration|overthrown]] by [[Emperor Go-Daigo]]. Go-Daigo was defeated by [[Ashikaga Takauji]] in 1336, beginning the [[Muromachi period]] (1336–1573). The succeeding [[Ashikaga shogunate]] failed to control the feudal warlords ({{transliteration|ja|daimyō}}) and [[Ōnin War|a civil war]] began in 1467, opening the century-long [[Sengoku period]] ("Warring States").

During the 16th century,  traders and [[Jesuit]] missionaries reached  for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between  and the West (see [[Nanban trade]] and [[Nanban art]]). [[Oda Nobunaga]] used European technology and firearms to conquer many other {{transliteration|ja|daimyō}}; his consolidation of power began what was known as the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]]. After [[Honnō-ji Incident|the death of Nobunaga]] in 1582, his successor, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], unified the nation in the early 1590s and launched [[ invasions of Korea (1592–98)|two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597]].

[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] served as regent for Hideyoshi's son [[Toyotomi Hideyori]] within the [[Council of Five Elders]] and used his position to gain political and military support. When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600. He was appointed {{transliteration|ja|shōgun}} by [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]] in 1603 and established the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] at [[Edo]] (modern Tokyo). The shogunate enacted measures including {{transliteration|ja|[[buke shohatto]]}}, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous {{transliteration|ja|daimyō}}, and in 1639 the isolationist {{transliteration|ja|[[sakoku]]}} ("closed country") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the [[Edo period]] (1603–1868). Modern 's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads ([[Kaidō]]) and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as [[futures contract]]s, banking and insurance of the [[Osaka rice brokers]]. The study of Western sciences ({{transliteration|ja|[[rangaku]]}}) continued through contact with the  enclave in [[Nagasaki]]. The Edo period gave rise to {{transliteration|ja|[[kokugaku]]}} ("national studies"), the study of  by the .

The [[ Navy]] sent Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] to force the opening of  to the outside world. Arriving at [[Uraga, Kanagawa|Uraga]] with four "[[Black Ships]]" in July 1853, the [[Perry Expedition]] resulted in the March 1854 [[Convention of Kanagawa]]. Subsequent similar treaties with other Western countries brought economic and political crises. The resignation of the {{transliteration|ja|shōgun}} led to the [[Boshin War]] and the establishment of a [[Abolition of the han system|centralized state]] nominally unified under the emperor (the [[Meiji Restoration]]). Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the [[Cabinet of |Cabinet]] organized the [[Privy Council ()|Privy Council]], introduced the [[Meiji Constitution]] (November 29, 1890), and assembled the [[National Diet|Imperial Diet]]. 

During the [[Meiji period]] (1868–1912), the [[Empire of ]] emerged as the most developed state in [[Asia]] and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence. After victories in the [[First Sino- War]] (1894–1895) and the [[Russo- War]] (1904–1905),  gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of [[Sakhalin]], and annexed Korea in 1910. The  population doubled from 35&nbsp;million in 1873 to 70&nbsp;million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization.

The early 20th century saw a period of [[Taishō period|Taishō democracy]] (1912–1926) overshadowed by increasing [[expansionism]] and [[ militarism|militarization]]. [[ during World War I|World War I]] allowed , which joined the side of the victorious [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], to capture [[ colonial empire| possessions]] in the [[Pacific]] and  in [[Treaty of Versailles|1920]]. The 1920s saw a political shift towards [[Statism in Shōwa |statism]], a period of lawlessness following the 1923 [[Great Tokyo Earthquake]], the passing of [[Peace Preservation Law|laws against political dissent]], and a series of [[May 15 Incident|attempted coups]]. 

This process accelerated in the 1930s, spawning several radical nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931,  [[ invasion of Manchuria|invaded  and occupied Manchuria]], which led to the establishment of [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932; following [[Lytton Report|international condemnation of the occupation]], it resigned from the [[League of Nations]] in 1933. In 1936,  signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] with [[Nazi ]]; the 1940 [[Tripartite Pact]] made it one of the [[Axis powers]].

The Empire of  invaded other parts of  in 1937, precipitating the [[Second Sino- War]] (1937–1945). In 1940, the Empire [[ invasion of  Indochina|invaded  Indochina]], after which the  placed an oil embargo on . On December 7–8, 1941,  forces carried out surprise [[attacks on Pearl Harbor]], as well as on British forces in [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Bombing of  (1941)|]], and [[Battle of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], among others, beginning [[World War II in the Pacific]]. Throughout areas occupied by  during the war, [[ war crimes|numerous abuses]] were committed against local inhabitants. Many women were forced into [[Comfort women|sexual slavery]].   

After [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victories during the next four years, which culminated in the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945,  agreed to [[Surrender of |an unconditional surrender]]. The war cost  millions of lives and many of its [[Territorial conquests of the Empire of |conquered territories]], including ''[[de jure]]'' parts of  such as [[Korea under  rule|Korea]], [[Taiwan under  rule|Taiwan]], [[Karafuto]], and the [[Kurils]]. The Allies, led by the , repatriated millions of [[ diaspora| settlers]] from their former colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the [[Empire of ]] and its influence over the territories it conquered. The Allies convened the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] to prosecute  leaders except [[Hirohito|the Emperor]] for [[ war crimes]].

In 1947,  adopted [[Constitution of |a new constitution]] emphasizing liberal democratic practices. The [[Occupation of |Allied occupation]] ended with the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] in 1952, and  was granted membership in the [[United Nations]] in 1956. [[ economic miracle|A period of record growth]] propelled  to become the world's [[List of countries by largest historical GDP|second-largest economy at that time]]; this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of [[ asset price bubble|an asset price bubble]], beginning the "[[Lost Decade ()|Lost Decade]]" characterized by economic stagnation and low inflation. In 2011,  suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history—the [[Tōhoku earthquake]]—triggering the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]. On May 1, 2019, after the historic [[abdication of Emperor Akihito]], his son [[Naruhito]] became Emperor, beginning the {{Lang|ja-latn|[[Reiwa]]}} era (2019-).
