===Early history===

[[File:Mayamap.png|thumb|The extent of the Maya civilization]]
The [[Maya civilization]] emerged at least three millennia ago in the lowland area of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] and the highlands to the south, in the area of present-day southeastern , , [[]], and western [[]]. Many aspects of this culture persist in the area, despite nearly 500 years of European domination. Prior to about 2500 BCE, some [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and foraging]] bands settled in small farming villages; they domesticated crops such as corn, beans, [[Cucurbita|squash]], and chili peppers.

A profusion of languages and subcultures developed within the Maya core culture. Between about 2500 BCE and 250 CE, the basic institutions of Maya civilization emerged.

{{Main|Pre-Columbian }}
The [[Maya civilization]] spread across the territory of present-day  around 1500{{nbsp}}BCE, and flourished until around 900 CE. The recorded history of the middle and southern regions focuses on [[Caracol]], an urban political centre that may have supported over 140,000 people. North of the [[Maya Mountains]], the most important political centre was [[Lamanai]]. In the late [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Era]] of Maya Civilization (600–1000{{nbsp}}CE), an estimated 400,000 to 1,000,000 people inhabited the area of present-day .

When  explorers arrived in the 16th century, the area of present-day  included at least three distinct Maya territories:

* [[Chetumal Province|Chetumal province]], which encompassed the area around [[Corozal Bay]]
* [[Dzuluinicob]] province, which encompassed the area between the lower [[New River ()|New River]] and the [[Sibun River]], west to [[Tipu, |Tipu]]
* a southern territory controlled by the [[Manche Ch'ol]] Maya, encompassing the area between the [[Monkey River]] and the [[Sarstoon River]].

 [[conquistador]]s explored the land and declared it part of the [[ Empire]], but they failed to settle the territory because of its lack of resources and the tribes of the Yucatán defending their land.

 pirates, known as buccaneers, sporadically visited the coast of what is now , seeking a sheltered region from which they could attack  ships ''(see [[ settlement in ]])'' and cut [[logwood]] (''Haematoxylum campechianum'') trees. The first  permanent settlement was founded around 1716, in what became the [[ District]], and during the 18th century, established a system using [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved Africans]] to cut logwood trees. This yielded a valuable fixing agent for clothing dyes, and was one of the first ways to achieve a [[Natural dye#The rise of formal black|fast black]] before the advent of artificial dyes. The  granted the  settlers the right to occupy the area and cut logwood in exchange for their help suppressing piracy.

The  government did not recognize the settlement as a colony for fear of provoking a [[ Empire|]] attack. This delay in government oversight enabled the settlers to establish their own laws and forms of government. During this period, a few settlers gained control of the local legislature, known as the Public Meeting, as well as of most of the settlement's land and timber. The  did not appoint their first superintendent over the  area until 1786.

Throughout the 18th century, the [[ language|]] attacked  every time war broke out with Britain. The [[Battle of St. George's Caye]] was the last of such military engagements, in 1798, between a  fleet and a force of [[Baymen]] and their slaves. From 3 to 5 September, the Spaniards tried to force their way through Montego Caye shoal, but were blocked by defenders. 's last attempt occurred on 10 September, when the Baymen repelled the  fleet in a short engagement with no known casualties on either side. The anniversary of the battle has been declared [[Battle of St. George's Caye Day|a national holiday]] in  and is celebrated to commemorate the "first " and the defence of their territory taken from the  empire.

===As part of the  Empire (1862–1981)===

In the early 19th century, the  sought to reform the settlers, threatening to suspend the Public Meeting unless it observed the government's instructions to eliminate slavery outright. After a generation of wrangling, slavery was [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|abolished]] in the [[ Empire]] in 1833. As a result of their enslaved Africans' abilities in the work of [[mahogany]] extraction, owners in [[ ]] were compensated at £53.69 per enslaved African on average, the highest amount paid in any  territory. This was a form of reparation that was not given to the enslaved Africans at the time, nor since.

The end of slavery did little to change the formerly enslaved Africans' working conditions if they stayed at their trade. A series of institutions restricted the ability of emancipated African individuals to buy land, in a debt-peonage system. Former "extra special" mahogany or logwood cutters undergirded the early ascription of the capacities (and consequently the limitations) of people of African descent in the colony. Because a small elite controlled the settlement's land and commerce, formerly enslaved Africans had little choice but to continue to work in timber cutting.

In 1836, after the [[  wars of independence|emancipation of Central America from  rule]], the  claimed the right to administer the region. In 1862, the  formally declared it a [[ Crown Colony]], subordinate to , and named it  . Since 1854, the richest inhabitants elected an assembly of notables by censal vote, which was replaced by a legislative council appointed by the  government.

As a colony,  began to attract  investors. Among the  firms that dominated the colony in the late 19th century was the  Estate and Produce Company, which eventually acquired half of all privately held land and eventually eliminated [[peonage]].  Estate's influence accounts in part for the colony's reliance on the mahogany trade throughout the rest of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century.

The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s caused a near-collapse of the colony's economy as  demand for timber plummeted. The effects of widespread unemployment were worsened by a [[1931  hurricane|devastating hurricane]] that struck the colony in 1931. Perceptions of the government's relief effort as inadequate were aggravated by its refusal to legalize labour unions or introduce a minimum wage. Economic conditions improved during [[World War II]], as many  men entered the armed forces or otherwise contributed to the war effort.

Following the war, the colony's economy stagnated. Britain's decision to [[Devaluation|devalue]] the   dollar in 1949 worsened economic conditions and led to the creation of the People's Committee, which demanded independence. The People's Committee's successor, the [[People's United Party]] (PUP), sought constitutional reforms that expanded voting rights to all adults. The first election under [[universal suffrage]] was held [[  general election, 1954|in 1954]] and was decisively won by the PUP, beginning a three-decade period in which the PUP dominated the country's politics. Pro-independence activist [[George Cadle Price]] became PUP's leader in 1956 and the effective head of government in 1961, a post he would hold under various titles until 1984.

Progress toward independence was hampered by a [[– territorial dispute| claim to sovereignty over  territory]]. In 1964 Britain granted   self-government under a new constitution. On 1 June 1973,   was officially renamed .

===Independent  (since 1981)===

 was granted independence on 21 September 1981. [[]] refused to recognize the new nation because of its longstanding territorial dispute, claiming that  belonged to . After independence about 1,500  troops remained in  to deter any possible  incursions.

On 9 March 1983, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited . On his visit, he celebrated Mass and met with approximately 30,000 people at the [[ International Airport]]. He also prayed with people of other Christian denominations, emphasizing unity among Christians.

With [[George Cadle Price]] at the helm, the PUP won all national elections [[ general election, 1984|until 1984]]. In that election, the first national election after independence, the PUP was defeated by the [[United Democratic Party ()|United Democratic Party]] (UDP). UDP leader [[Manuel Esquivel]] replaced Price as prime minister, with Price himself unexpectedly losing his own [[House of Representatives ()|House]] seat to a UDP challenger. The PUP under Price returned to power after elections [[ general election, 1989|in 1989]]. The following year the  announced that it would end its military involvement in , and the RAF Harrier detachment was withdrawn the same year, having remained stationed in the country continuously since its deployment had become permanent there in 1980.  soldiers were withdrawn in 1994, but the  left behind a military training unit to assist with the newly created [[ Defence Force]].

The UDP regained power in the [[ general election, 1993|1993 national election]], and Esquivel became prime minister for a second time. Soon afterwards, Esquivel announced the suspension of a pact reached with  during Price's tenure, claiming Price had made too many concessions to gain  recognition. The pact may have curtailed the 130-year-old border dispute between the two countries. Border tensions continued into the early 2000s, although the two countries cooperated in other areas.

In 1996, the [[ Barrier Reef]], one of the Western Hemisphere's most pristine ecosystems, was designated as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

The PUP won a landslide victory in the 1998 national elections, and PUP leader [[Said Musa]] was sworn in as prime minister. In the 2003 elections the PUP maintained its majority, and Musa continued as prime minister. He pledged to improve conditions in the underdeveloped and largely inaccessible southern part of .

In 2005,  was the site of [[2005  unrest|unrest]] caused by discontent with the PUP government, including tax increases in the national budget. On 8 February 2008, [[Dean Barrow]] was sworn in as prime minister after his [[United Democratic Party ()|UDP]] won [[ general election, 2008|a landslide victory]] in general elections. Barrow and the UDP were re-elected [[ general and local elections, 2012|in 2012]] with a considerably smaller majority. Barrow led the UDP to a third consecutive general election victory in November 2015, increasing the party's number of seats from 17 to 19. He said the election would be his last as party leader and preparations are under way for the party to elect his successor.

On 11 November 2020, the [[People's United Party]] (PUP), led by [[Johnny Briceño]], defeated the [[United Democratic Party ()|United Democratic Party]] (UDP) for the first time since 2003, having won 26 seats out of 31 to form the new government of . Briceño took office as prime minister on 12 November.

In 2023,  became the second Central  country to be awarded certification for the elimination of [[malaria]] by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]].
