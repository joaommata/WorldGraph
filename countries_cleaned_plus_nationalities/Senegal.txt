Archaeological findings throughout the area indicate that  was inhabited in prehistoric times and has been continuously occupied by various ethnic groups. Some kingdoms were created between the 6th and 14th centuries, such as [[Takrur]] in the 6th century, Namandiru, and the [[Jolof Empire]] in the 13th and 14th centuries. Eastern  was once part of the [[ Empire]].

Islam was introduced by the [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] and [[Soninke people|Soninke]] through their contact with the [[Almoravid dynasty]] of the [[Maghreb]], who helped spread it with their Toucouleur allies. This movement faced resistance from ethnicities of traditional religions, the Serers in particular.

In the 13th and 14th centuries, the area came under the influence of empires to the east; the Jolof Empire was also founded during this time. In the Senegambia region, between 1300 and 1900, close to one-third of the population was [[Slavery in Africa|enslaved]], typically as a result of being taken captive in warfare.

In the 14th century, the Jolof Empire grew more powerful, having united [[Cayor]] and the kingdoms of [[Baol]], [[Kingdom of Sine|Siné]], [[Saloum]], [[Waalo]], [[Futa Tooro]] and [[Bambouk]], covering much of what is now  and part of present-day West Africa. The empire was a voluntary confederacy of various states rather than a state built on military conquest. The empire was founded by Ndiadiane Ndiaye, a part [[Serer people|Serer]] and part Toucouleur, who was able to form a coalition with many ethnicities, but collapsed around 1549 following the defeat and death of Lele Fouli Fak at the hands of Amari Ngone Sobel Fall.
