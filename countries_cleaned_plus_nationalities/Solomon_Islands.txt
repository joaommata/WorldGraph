[[File:El viajero ilustrado, 1878 602320 (3810561161).jpg|thumb|Solomon Islanders]]

The Solomons were first settled by people coming from the [[Bismarck Islands]] and [[New ]] during the [[Pleistocene]] era {{Circa}} 30,000–28,000 BC, based on archaeological evidence found at [[Kilu Cave]] on [[Buka Island]] in the [[Autonomous Region of Bougainville]], [[]]. At this point sea levels were lower and Buka and Bougainville were physically joined to the southern Solomons in one landmass ("Greater Bougainville"), though it is unclear precisely how far south these early settlers spread as no other archaeological sites from this period have been found. As sea levels rose as the [[Last Glacial Period|Ice Age]] ended {{Circa}} 4000–3500 BC, the Greater Bougainville landmass split into the numerous islands that exist today. Evidence of later human settlements dating to {{Circa}} 4500–2500 BC have been found at Poha Cave and Vatuluma Posovi Cave on [[Guadalcanal]]. The ethnic identity of these early peoples is unclear, though it is thought that the speakers of the [[Central Solomon languages]] (a self-contained language family unrelated to other languages spoken in the Solomons) likely represent the descendants of these earlier settlers.

From {{Circa}} 1200–800 BC, [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] [[Lapita culture|Lapita]] people began arriving from the Bismarcks with their characteristic [[ceramic]]s. Evidence for their presence has been found across the Solomon archipelago, as well at the [[Santa Cruz Islands]] in the south-east, with different islands being settled at different times. Linguistic and genetic evidence suggests that the Lapita people "leap-frogged" the already inhabited main  and settled first on the Santa Cruz group, with later back-migrations bringing their culture to the main group.  These peoples mixed with the native Solomon Islanders and over time their languages became dominant, with most of the 60–70 languages spoken there belonging to the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] branch of the [[Austronesian language family]]. Then, as now, communities tended to exist in small villages practising subsistence agriculture, though extensive inter-island trade networks existed. Numerous ancient burial sites and other evidence of permanent settlements have been found from the period AD 1000–1500 throughout the islands, one of the most prominent examples being the Roviana cultural complex centred on the islands off the southern coast of [[New ]], where a large number of megalithic shrines and other structures were constructed in the 13th century. The people of  were notorious for [[headhunting]] and [[Human cannibalism|cannibalism]] before the arrival of the Europeans.

===Arrival of Europeans (1568–1886)===
[[File:Alvaro de Mendaña de Neyra.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira]] (1542–1595), the first European to sight the Solomons]]

The first European to visit the islands was the  navigator [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira]], sailing from [[Viceroyalty of |]] in 1568. Landing on [[Santa Isabel Island|Santa Isabel]] on 7 February, Mendaña explored several of the other islands including [[Makira]], Guadalcanal and [[Malaita]]. Relations with the native Solomon Islanders were initially cordial, although they often soured as time went by. As a result, Mendaña returned to  in August 1568. He returned to the Solomons with a larger crew on a second voyage in 1595, aiming to colonise the islands. They landed on [[Nendö]] in the Santa Cruz Islands and established a small settlement at Gracioso Bay. However, the settlement failed due to poor relations with the native peoples and epidemics of disease amongst the  which caused numerous deaths, with Mendaña himself dying in October. The new commander [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]] thus decided to abandon the settlement and they sailed north to the  territory of the [[]]. Queirós later returned to the area in 1606, where he sighted [[Tikopia]] and [[Taumako]], though this voyage was primarily to  in the search of [[Terra Australis]].

Save for [[Abel Tasman]]'s sighting of the remote [[Ontong Java Atoll]] in 1648, no European sailed to the Solomons again until 1767, when the British explorer [[Philip Carteret]] sailed by the Santa Cruz Islands, Malaita, and, continuing further north, Bougainville and the Bismarck Islands.  explorers also reached the Solomons, with [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] naming [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]] in 1768 and [[Jean-François de Surville]] exploring the islands in 1769. In 1788 [[John Shortland (Royal Navy officer)|John Shortland]], captaining a supply ship for Britain's new [[]]n colony at [[Botany Bay]], sighted the [[Treasury Islands|Treasury]] and [[Shortland Islands]]. That same year the  explorer [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse|Jean-François de La Pérouse]] was wrecked on [[Vanikoro]]; a rescue expedition led by [[Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] sailed to Vanikoro but found no trace of La Pérouse. The fate of La Pérouse was not confirmed until 1826, when the  merchant [[Peter Dillon]] visited Tikopia and discovered items belonging to La Pérouse in the possession of the local people, confirmed by the subsequent voyage of [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] in 1828.

Some of the earliest regular foreign visitors to the islands were [[whaling]] vessels from Britain, the  and . They came for food, wood and water from late in the 18th century, establishing a trading relationship with the Solomon Islanders and later taking aboard islanders to serve as crewmen on their ships. Relations between the islanders and visiting seamen were not always good and sometimes there was bloodshed. A knock-on effect of the greater European contact was the spread of diseases to which local peoples had no immunity, as well as a shift in the balance of power between coastal groups, who had access to European weapons and technology, and inland groups who did not. In the second half of the 1800s more traders arrived seeking turtleshells, [[sea cucumbers]], [[copra]] and [[sandalwood]], occasionally establishing semi-permanent trading stations. However, initial attempts at more long-term settlement, such as [[Benjamin Boyd]]'s colony on Guadalcanal in 1851, were unsuccessful.

Beginning in the 1840s, and accelerating in the 1860s, islanders began to be recruited (or often kidnapped) as labourers for the colonies in ,  and  in a process known as "[[blackbirding]]". Conditions for workers were often poor and exploitative, and local islanders often [[List of massacres in the |violently]] attacked any Europeans who appeared on their island. The blackbird trade was chronicled by prominent Western writers, such as [[Joe Melvin]] and [[Jack London]]. Christian missionaries also began visiting the Solomons from the 1840s, beginning with an attempt by  Catholics under Jean-Baptiste Epalle to establish a mission on Santa Isabel, which was abandoned after Epalle was killed by islanders in 1845. Anglican missionaries began arriving from the 1850s, followed by other denominations, over time gaining a large number of converts.

===Colonial period (1886–1978)===
{{Main|British |British Western Pacific Territories| New }}

====Establishment of colonial rule====
In 1884, [[ Empire|]] annexed northeast New  and the Bismarck Archipelago and, in 1886, extended its rule over the [[North ]], covering Bougainville, Buka, Choiseul, Santa Isabel, the Shortlands and Ontong Java atoll. In 1886  and Britain confirmed this arrangement, with the British gaining a "sphere of influence" over the southern Solomons.  paid little attention to the islands, with  authorities based in New  not even visiting the area until 1888. The  presence, along with pressure from the missionaries to rein in the excesses of the coercive labour recruitment practices, known as [[blackbirding]], prompted the British to declare a protectorate over the southern Solomons in March 1893, initially encompassing New , Malaita, Guadalcanal, Makira, Mono Island and the central Nggela Islands.

In April 1896, colonial official [[Charles Morris Woodford]] was appointed as the British Acting Deputy Commissioner, and he was confirmed in his position in the following year. The Colonial Office appointed Woodford as the Resident Commissioner in the  on 17 February 1897. He was directed to control the coercive labour recruitment practices, known as [[blackbirding]], operating in the Solomon Island waters and to stop the illegal trade in firearms. Woodford set up an administrative headquarters on the small island of [[Tulagi]], having proclaimed it the protectorate capital in 1896. and in 1898 and 1899 the [[Rennell and Bellona Province|Rennell and Bellona Islands]], [[Sikaiana]], the Santa Cruz Islands and outlying islands such as Anuta, Fataka, Temotu and Tikopia were added to the protectorate. In 1900, under the terms of the [[Tripartite Convention|Tripartite Convention of 1899]],  ceded the Northern Solomon to Britain, minus Buka and Bougainville, the latter becoming part of [[ New ]] despite geographically belonging to the Solomons archipelago. This was when the Shortlands, Choiseul, Santa Isabel and Ontong Java became part of the Solomons.

Woodford's underfunded administration struggled to maintain law and order on the remote colony. From the late 1890s until the early 1900s, there were numerous instances of European merchants and colonists being killed by islanders; the British response was to deploy [[Royal Navy]] warships to launch [[punitive expedition]]s against the villages which were responsible for the murders. [[Arthur William Mahaffy|Arthur Mahaffy]] was appointed at the Deputy Commissioner in January 1898. He was based in [[Gizo, |Gizo]], his duties included suppressing [[Headhunting#Melanesia|headhunting]] in [[New ]] and neighbouring islands.

The British colonial government attempted to encourage the establishment of [[plantation]]s by colonists; however, by 1902, there were only about 80 European colonists residing on the islands. Attempts at economic development met with mixed results, though [[Levers Pacific Plantations]] Ltd., a subsidiary of [[Lever Brothers]], managed to establish a profitable copra plantation industry which employed many islanders. Small scale mining and logging industries were also developed. However, the colony remained something of a backwater, with education, medical and other social services being under the administration of the missionaries. Violence also continued, most notably with the [[Malaita massacre|murder]] of colonial administrator [[William R. Bell]] by [[Basiana]] of the [[Kwaio people]] on Malaita in 1927, as Bell attempted to enforce an unpopular head tax. Several Kwaio were killed in a retaliatory raid, and Basiana and his accomplices executed.

====World War II====
{{main| campaign| occupation of the }}

With the outbreak of the Second World War most planters and traders were evacuated to  and most cultivation ceased. Some of the most intense fighting of the war occurred in the Solomons.

From 1942 until the end of 1943, the  were the scene of several major land, sea, and air battles between the Allies and the [[Empire of ]]'s armed forces. Following the  [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, war was declared between  and the Allied Powers, and the , seeking to protect their southern flank, invaded South-East Asia and New . In May 1942, the  launched [[Operation Mo]], [[Invasion of Tulagi (May 1942)|occupying Tulagi]] and most of the western , including Guadalcanal where they began work on an airstrip. The British administration had already relocated to [[Auki]], Malaita, and most of the European population had been evacuated to . The Allies [[Guadalcanal campaign|counter-invaded Guadalcanal]] in August 1942, followed by the [[New  campaign]] in 1943, both of which were turning points in the [[Pacific War]], stopping and then countering the  advance. The conflict resulted in thousands of Allied,  and civilian deaths, and extensive destruction across the islands.  The  Campaign cost the Allies approximately 7,100 men, 29 ships, and 615 aircraft. The  lost 31,000 men, 38 ships, and 683 aircraft.

[[Coastwatchers]] from the  played a major role in providing intelligence and rescuing other Allied servicemen. U.S. Admiral [[William Halsey]], the commander of Allied forces during the Battle for Guadalcanal, recognised the coastwatchers' contributions by stating "The coastwatchers saved Guadalcanal and Guadalcanal saved the South Pacific." In addition, around 3,200 men served in the [[ Labour Corps]] and some 6,000 enlisted in the [[British  Protectorate Defence Force]], with their exposure to the Americans leading to several social and political transformations. For example, the Americans had extensively developed [[Honiara]], with the capital shifting there from Tulagi in 1952, and the [[Pijin language]] was heavily influenced by the communication between Americans and the Islands inhabitants.

{{main| campaign|Guadalcanal campaign}}

The most significant of the Allied Forces' operations against the [[ Imperial]] Forces was launched on 7 August 1942, with simultaneous naval bombardments and amphibious landings on the [[Florida Islands]] at [[Tulagi]] and Red Beach on [[Guadalcanal]].
	
The [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] became an important and bloody campaign fought in the Pacific War as the Allies began to repulse the  expansion. Of strategic importance during the war were the [[coastwatchers]] operating in remote locations, often on  held islands, providing early warning and intelligence of  naval, army and aircraft movements during the campaign.

Islanders [[Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana]] were the first to find the shipwrecked [[John F. Kennedy]] and his crew of the [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]]. They suggested writing a rescue message on a coconut, and delivered the coconut by paddling a dugout canoe. The coconut was later kept on Kennedy's desk when he became [[President of the ]].

====Post-war period and the lead-up to independence====
In 1943–44 the Malaita-based chief Aliki Nono'ohimae had founded the [[Maasina Ruru|Maasina Rule]] movement (aka the Native Council Movement, literally "Brotherhood Rule"), and was later joined by another chief, Hoasihau. Their aims were to improve the economic well-being of native Solomon Islanders, gain greater autonomy and to act as a liaison between Islanders and the colonial administration. The movement was especially popular with ex-Labour Corp members and after the war its numbers swelled, with the movement spreading to other islands. Alarmed at the growth of the movement, the British launched "Operation De-Louse" in 1947–8 and arrested most of the Maasina leaders. Malaitans then organised a campaign of civil disobedience, prompting mass arrests. In 1950 a new Resident Commissioner, Henry Gregory-Smith, arrived and released the leaders of the movement, though the disobedience campaign continued. In 1952 new High Commissioner (later Governor) [[Robert Christopher Stafford Stanley|Robert Stanley]] met with leaders of the movement and agreed to the creation of an island council. In late 1952 Stanley formally moved the capital of the territory to Honiara. In the early 1950s the possibility of transferring sovereignty of the islands to  was discussed by the British and  governments; however, the Australians were reluctant to accept the financial burden of administering the territory and the idea was shelved.

With decolonisation sweeping the colonial world, and Britain no longer willing (or able) to bear the financial burdens of the Empire, the colonial authorities sought to prepare the Solomons for self-governance. Appointed Executive and [[Legislative Council of the |Legislative Councils]] were established in 1960, with a degree of elected Solomon Islander representation introduced in 1964 and then extended in 1967. A new constitution was drawn up in 1970 which merged the two Councils into one [[Governing Council of the |Governing Council]], though the British Governor still retained extensive powers. Discontent with this prompted the creation of a new constitution in 1974 which reduced much of the Governor's remaining powers and created the post of Chief Minister, first held by [[Solomon Mamaloni]]. Full self-government for the territory was achieved in 1976, a year after the independence of neighbouring  from . Meanwhile, discontent grew in the Western islands, with many fearing marginalisation in a future Honiara- or Malaita-dominated state, prompting the formation of the Western Breakaway Movement. A conference held in London in 1977 agreed that the Solomons would gain full independence the following year. Under the terms of the [[ Act 1978]] the country was annexed to [[dominion|Her Majesty's dominions]] and granted independence on 7 July 1978. The first prime minister was Sir [[Peter Kenilorea]] of the [[ United Party]] (SIUP), with [[Elizabeth II]] becoming [[Monarchy of |Queen of ]], represented locally by a [[Governor-General of |Governor General]].

===Independence era (1978–present)===
====Early post-independence years====
Peter Kenilorea went on to win the [[1980  general election]], serving as PM until 1981, when he was replaced by [[Solomon Mamaloni]] of the [[People's Alliance Party ()|People's Alliance Party]] (PAP) after a no confidence vote. Mamaloni created the Central Bank and national airline, and pushed for greater autonomy for individual islands of the country. Kenilorea returned to power after winning the [[1984  general election|1984 election]], though his second term lasted only two years before he was replaced by [[Ezekiel Alebua]] following allegations of misuse of  aid money. In 1986 the Solomons helped found the [[Melanesian Spearhead Group]], aimed at fostering cooperation and trade in the region. After winning the [[1989 election]] Mamaloni and the PAP returned to power, with Mamaloni dominating  politics from the early to mid 1990s (save for the one year Premiership of [[Francis Billy Hilly]]). Mamaloni made efforts to make the Solomons a republic; however, these were unsuccessful. He also had to deal with the effects of the [[Bougainville Civil War|conflict]] in neighbouring Bougainville which broke out in 1988, causing many refugees to flee to the Solomons. Tensions arose with  as PNG forces frequently entered Solomons territory in the pursuit of rebels. The situation calmed down and relations improved following the end of the conflict in 1998. Meanwhile, the country's financial situation continued to deteriorate, with much of the budget coming from the logging industry, often conducted at an unsustainable rate, not helped by Mamaloni's creation of a 'discretionary fund' for use by politicians, which fostered fraud and corruption. Discontent with his rule led to a split in the PAP, and Mamaloni lost the [[1993  general election|1993 election]] to Billy Hilly, though Hilly was later sacked by the Governor-General after a number of defections caused him to lose his majority, allowing Mamaloni to return to power in 1994, where he remained until 1997. Excessive logging, government corruption and unsustainable levels of public spending continued to grow, and public discontent caused Mamaloni to lose the [[1997  general election|1997 election]]. The new prime minister, [[Bartholomew Ulufa'alu]] of the [[ Liberal Party]], attempted to enact economic reforms; however, his premiership soon became engulfed in a serious ethnic conflict known as "The Tensions".

====Ethnic violence (1998–2003)====

Commonly referred to as ''the tensions'' or ''the ethnic tension'', the initial civil unrest was mainly characterised by fighting between the [[Isatabu Freedom Movement]] (IFM, also known as the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army and the Isatabu Freedom Fighters) and the [[Malaita Eagle Force]] (as well as the Marau Eagle Force). For many years people from the island of Malaita had been migrating to Honiara and Guadalcanal, attracted primarily by the greater economic opportunities available there. The large influx caused tensions with native Guadalcanal islanders (known as Guales), and in late 1998 the IFM was formed and began a campaign of intimidation and violence towards Malaitan settlers. Thousands of Malaitans subsequently fled back to Malaita or to Honiara, and in mid-1999 the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) was established to protect Malaitans on Guadalcanal. In late 1999, after several failed attempts at brokering a peace deal, Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu declared a four-month state of emergency, and also requested assistance from  and , but his appeal was rejected. Meanwhile, law and order on Guadalcanal collapsed, with an ethnically divided police unable to assert authority and many of their weapons depots being raided by the militias; by this point the MEF controlled Honiara with the IFM controlling the rest of Guadalacanal.

In April 2003, seven Christians of the [[Melanesian Brotherhood]] – Brother Robin Lindsay and his companions – were killed on the Weather Coast of Guadalcanal by the rebel leader [[Harold Keke]]. Six had gone in search of their Brother Nathaniel, who it turns out had already been tortured and killed. During the tensions Nathaniel had befriended the militant group but Harold Keke accused him of being a government spy and he was beaten to death; it was reported that he died singing hymns. They are commemorated by the Anglican church on 24 April.

On 5 June 2000, Ulufa'alu was kidnapped by the MEF who felt that, although he was a Malaitan, he was not doing enough to protect their interests. Ulufa'alu subsequently resigned in exchange for his release. [[Manasseh Sogavare]], who had earlier been Finance Minister in Ulufa'alu's government but had subsequently joined the opposition, was elected as prime minister by 23–21 over the Rev. [[Leslie Boseto]]. However, Sogavare's election was immediately shrouded in controversy because six MPs (thought to be supporters of Boseto) were unable to attend parliament for the crucial vote. On 15 October 2000, the [[Townsville Peace Agreement]] was signed by the MEF, elements of the IFM, and the  Government. This was closely followed by the Marau Peace agreement in February 2001, signed by the Marau Eagle Force, the IFM, the Guadalcanal Provincial Government, and the  Government. However, a key Guale militant leader, [[Harold Keke]], refused to sign the agreement, causing a split with the Guale groups. Subsequently, Guale signatories to the agreement led by Andrew Te'e joined with the Malaitan-dominated police to form the 'Joint Operations Force'. During the next two years the conflict moved to the remote Weathercoast region of southern Guadalcanal as the Joint Operations unsuccessfully attempted to capture Keke and his group.

[[File:New beginning for  (10709848893).jpg|thumb|right|Solomon Islanders at a peace protest in 2003]]
By early 2001, the economy had collapsed and the government was bankrupt. New [[2001  general election|elections]] in December 2001 brought [[Allan Kemakeza]] into the Prime Minister's chair, with the support of his People's Alliance Party and the Association of Independent Members. Law and order deteriorated as the nature of the conflict shifted: there was continuing violence on the Weathercoast, whilst militants in Honiara increasingly turned their attention to crime, extortion and banditry. The Department of Finance would often be surrounded by armed men when funding was due to arrive. In December 2002, Finance Minister [[Laurie Chan]] resigned after being forced at gunpoint to sign a cheque made out to some of the militants. Conflict also broke out in Western Province between locals and Malaitan settlers. The atmosphere of lawlessness, widespread extortion, and ineffective police prompted a formal request by the  Government for outside help; the request was unanimously supported in Parliament.

In July 2003,  and Pacific Islands police and troops arrived in  under the auspices of the -led [[Regional Assistance Mission to ]] (RAMSI). A sizeable international security contingent of 2,200 police and troops, led by  and , and with representatives from about 15 other Pacific nations, began arriving the next month under Operation Helpem Fren. The situation improved dramatically, with violence ending and Harold Keke surrendering to the force. Some 200 people had been killed in the conflict. Since this time, some commentators have considered the country a [[failed state]], with the nation having failed to build an inclusive national identity capable of overriding local island and ethnic loyalties. However, other academics argue that, rather than being a 'failed state', it is an unformed state: a state that never consolidated even after decades of independence. Furthermore, some scholars, such as Kabutaulaka (2001) and Dinnen (2002) argue that the 'ethnic conflict' label is an oversimplification.

====Post-conflict era====

Kemakeza remained in office until April 2006, when he lost the [[2006  general election]] and [[Snyder Rini]] became PM. However, allegations that Rini had used bribes from  businessmen to buy the votes of members of Parliament led to mass rioting in the capital [[Honiara]], concentrated on the city's Chinatown area. Resentment against the minority [[Han |]] business community led to much of [[Chinatown]] in the city being destroyed.  sent chartered aircraft to evacuate  out of the riots. Evacuation of  and British citizens was on a much smaller scale. Additional , , and  police and troops were dispatched to try to quell the unrest. Rini eventually resigned before facing a motion of no-confidence in Parliament, and Parliament elected [[Manasseh Sogavare]] as prime minister.

Sogavare struggled to assert his authority and was also hostile to the  presence in the country; after one failed attempt, he was removed in a no confidence vote in 2007 and replaced by [[Derek Sikua]] of the  Liberal Party. In 2008, a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission ()|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] was established to examine and help heal the wounds of the 'tension' years. Sikua lost the [[2010  general election]] to [[Danny Philip]], though after a vote of no-confidence in him following allegations of corruption, Philip was ousted and replaced by [[Gordon Darcy Lilo]]. Sogavare returned to power after the [[2014  general election|2014 election]], and oversaw the withdrawal of RAMSI forces from the country in 2017. Sogavare was ousted in a no-confidence vote in 2017, which saw [[Rick Houenipwela]] come to power; however, Sogavare returned to the prime ministership after winning the [[2019  general election|2019 election]], sparking rioting in Honiara. In 2019, Sogavare announced that the Solomons would be switching recognition from Taiwan to .

On 25 November 2019,  launched a national [[Ocean governance|ocean policy]] to achieve the sustainable development and use of the ocean for the benefit of the people of the island nation.

In [[2021  unrest|November 2021, there was mass rioting and unrest]]. The  Government requested assistance from  under the 2017 Bilateral Security Treaty and  provided a deployment of [[ Federal Police]] and [[ Defence Force|Defence Forces]].

In March 2022,  signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] (MOU) on policing cooperation with  and was also reported to be in the process of concluding a security agreement with . The agreement with  could allow an ongoing  military and naval presence in the Solomons. A spokesperson for 's [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ()|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] said that, while "Pacific Island nations have the right to make sovereign decisions",  "would be concerned by any actions that destabilise the security of our region". There are similar concerns in  and the .  donated a shipment of replica firearms to the  police for training.  and  signed a security co-operation agreement in April to promote social stability and long-term peace and security in . The BBC reported that, according to a leaked draft of the agreement verified by the  government, Beijing could deploy forces to  "to assist in maintaining social order". Prime Minister [[Manasseh Sogavare]] said the pact would not "undermine peace and harmony" in the region and was aimed at protecting the Solomon's internal security situation.  confirmed that the social-order clause had been maintained in the final agreement.

In February 2023, [[2023  protests|further protests broke out]] after the Premier of [[Malaita Province]] [[Daniel Suidani]] was removed from office after a vote of no confidence from the provincial legislature. In May 2024, [[Jeremiah Manele]] was elected as  new prime minister to succeed Manasseh Sogavare.
