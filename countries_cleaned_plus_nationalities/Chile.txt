Stone tool evidence indicates humans sporadically frequented the [[Monte Verde]] valley area as long as 18,500 years ago. About 10,000 years ago, migrating [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous peoples]] settled in fertile valleys and coastal areas of what is present-day . Settlement sites from very early human habitation include Monte Verde, [[Cueva del Milodón]] and the [[Pali-Aike Crater]]'s [[lava tube]].

The Incas briefly extended their empire into what is now northern , but the [[Mapuche]] (or Araucanians as they were known by the Spaniards) successfully resisted many attempts by the [[Inca Empire]] to subjugate them, despite their lack of state organization. They fought against the Sapa Inca Tupac Yupanqui and his army. The result of the bloody three-day confrontation known as the [[Battle of the Maule]] was that the Inca conquest of the territories of  ended at the [[Maule river]].

The next year the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] was created and the territories of the cities of [[Mendoza, |Mendoza]] and [[San Juan, |San Juan]] got transferred from  to the new entity.]]

In 1520, while attempting to circumnavigate the globe, [[Ferdinand Magellan]] discovered the southern passage now named after him (the [[Strait of Magellan]]) thus becoming the first European to set foot on what is now . The next Europeans to reach  were Diego de Almagro and his band of [[Conquistador| conquistadors]], who came from [[]] in 1535 seeking gold. The  encountered various cultures that supported themselves principally through [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture and hunting.

The conquest of  began in earnest in 1540 and was carried out by [[Pedro de Valdivia]], one of [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s lieutenants, who founded the city of Santiago on 12 February 1541. Although the  did not find the extensive gold and silver they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential of 's central valley, and  became part of the [[ Empire]].

Conquest took place gradually, and the Europeans suffered repeated setbacks. A massive [[Mapuche]] insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia's death and the destruction of many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of [[slavery]] by the  crown in 1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the Mapuche intensified resistance rather than cowing them into submission. Despite royal prohibitions, relations remained strained from continual colonialist interference.{{verify source|date=August 2024|reason="page 66" was deleted from this citation by a user of the ReFill script at one point, but page 66 of this source does not seem to support this claim. the reference previously pointed to a djvu of the source, so pagination may have differed, but the djvu is no longer available via archive.org}}

Cut off to the north by desert, to the south by the Mapuche, to the east by the Andes Mountains, and to the west by the ocean,  became one of the most centralized, homogeneous territories in  America. Serving as a sort of frontier [[garrison]], the colony found itself with the mission of forestalling encroachment by both the Mapuche and 's European enemies, especially the [[Kingdom of England|]] and the [[ Republic|]]. [[Buccaneer]]s and [[Piracy|pirates]] menaced the colony in addition to the Mapuche, as was shown by [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]]'s 1578 raid on Valparaíso, the colony's principal port.  hosted one of the largest standing armies in the Americas, making it one of the most militarized of the  possessions, as well as a [[Real Situado|drain on the treasury of the Viceroyalty of ]].

The first general census was conducted by the government of [[Agustín de Jáuregui]] between 1777 and 1778; it indicated that the population consisted of 259,646 inhabitants: 73.5% of [[White Latin |European descent]], 7.9% [[mestizo]]s, 8.6% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and 9.8% blacks. Francisco Hurtado, Governor of the province of [[Chiloé Province|Chiloé]], conducted a census in 1784 and found the population consisted of 26,703 inhabitants, 64.4% of whom were whites and 33.5% of whom were natives. The Diocese of [[Concepción, |Concepción]] conducted a census in areas south of the [[Maule river]] in 1812, but did not include the indigenous population or the inhabitants of the province of Chiloé. The population was estimated at 210,567, 86.1% of whom were [[ |]] or of European descent, 10% of whom were indigenous and 3.7% of whom were mestizos, blacks and [[mulatto]]s.

A 2021 study by [[Jörg Baten|Baten]] and Llorca-Jaña shows that regions with a relatively high share of North European migrants developed faster in terms of [[numeracy]], even if the overall number of migrants was small. This effect might be related to [[Externality|externalities]]: the surrounding population adopted a similar behavior as the small non-European immigrant group, and new schools were created. Ironically, there might have been positive [[spillover effects]] from the educational investment made by migrants, at the same time numeracy might have been reduced by the greater inequality in these regions. However, the positive effects of immigration were apparently stronger.

===Independence and nation building===

In 1808, [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]]'s enthronement of his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] as the [[ monarchy| King]] precipitated the drive by  for [[ War of Independence|independence from ]]. A national [[Junta (governing body)|junta]] in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of |Ferdinand]] – heir to the deposed king – was formed on 18 September 1810. The [[Government Junta of  (1810)|Government Junta of ]] proclaimed an autonomous government for  within the  monarchy (in memory of this day,  celebrates its [[Fiestas Patrias ()|National Day]] on 18 September each year).

After these events, a movement for total independence, under the command of [[José Miguel Carrera]] (one of the most renowned patriots) and his two brothers Juan José and [[Luis Carrera]], soon gained a wider following.  attempts to re-impose arbitrary rule during what was called the [[Reconquista ( America)|Reconquista]] led to a prolonged struggle, including infighting from [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], who challenged Carrera's leadership.

Intermittent warfare continued until 1817. With Carrera in prison in , O'Higgins and anti-Carrera cohort [[José de San Martín]], hero of the [[ War of Independence]], led [[Army of the Andes|an army]] that [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes]] into  and defeated the royalists. On 12 February 1818, [[ Declaration of Independence| was proclaimed an independent republic]]. The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th-century  society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful. Bernardo O'Higgins once planned to expand  by liberating the [[]] from  and incorporating the islands. In this regard he tasked the  naval officer, Lord Thomas Cochrane, in a letter dated 12 November 1821, expressing his plan to conquer [[Guayaquil]], the [[Galapagos Islands]], and the [[– relations|]]. There were preparations, but the plan did not push through because O'Higgins was exiled.

 slowly started to expand its influence and to establish its borders. By the Tantauco Treaty, the archipelago of [[Chiloé]] was incorporated in 1826. The economy began to boom due to the discovery of silver ore in Chañarcillo, and the growing trade of the port of Valparaíso, which led to conflict with  over maritime supremacy in the Pacific. At the same time, attempts were made to strengthen sovereignty in southern  intensifying [[Occupation of Araucanía|penetration into Araucanía]] and [[ colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|colonizing Llanquihue with  immigrants]] in 1848. Through the founding of [[Fort Bulnes]] by the [[Schooner Ancud]] under the command of [[John Williams Wilson]], the [[Magallanes Region]] [[ colonization of the Strait of Magellan|started to be controlled by country in 1843]], while the [[Antofagasta Region]], at the time in [[Atacama Desert border dispute|dispute with ]], began to fill with people.

After the [[ Civil War of 1829–1830]] in which the conservatives won, under the [[Joaquín Prieto]] Administration, the [[ Constitution of 1833]] was written and put into effect with high influence from the triple minister [[Diego Portales]]. Two other civil wars happened in  in the 1850s, one in [[1851  revolution|1851]] and the other one in [[1859  revolution|1859]].

[[File:Territorial losses of the Republic of  de jure.svg|300px|thumb|Territorial losses of the Republic of  de jure (by law) according to  historiography]]
Toward the end of the 19th century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by the [[Occupation of Araucanía]]. The [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between  and ]] confirmed  sovereignty over the [[Strait of Magellan]] but also made the country renounce its claims in the rest of East Patagonia after a [[East Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego and Strait of Magellan Dispute|dispute that started in 1842]]. As a result of the [[War of the Pacific]] with  and  (1879–83),  expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating 's access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable [[Caliche (mineral)# caliche|nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence.  had joined the stand as one of the high-income countries in South America by 1870.

On 9 September 1888,  took possession of [[Easter Island]] by the signing of a mutual will agreement with the local king, thanks to the efforts of the Bishop of Tahiti, Monsignor José María Verdier since the island was constantly attacked by slave merchants. The naval officer [[Policarpo Toro]] represented the  Government and [[Atamu Tekena]] was the head of the Council of Rapanui. The Rapa Nui elders ceded sovereignty, without renouncing their titles as chiefs, the ownership of their lands, the validity of their culture and traditions on equal terms. The Rapa Nui sold nothing and were integrated in equal conditions into .

The [[1891  Civil War]] brought about a redistribution of power between the President and Congress, and  established a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] style democracy. However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful  banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards which had strong ties to foreign investors. Soon after, the country engaged in a [[– naval arms race|vastly expensive naval arms race]] with [[]] amid escalating geopolitical competition and the [[Puna de Atacama dispute]].

The [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1883) against  and  resulted in  annexing resource-rich territory from both countries and further consolidating its status as a regional power. It subsequently emerged as a leading naval power in the Americas, even sending a ship to protest  involvement in the [[ crisis of 1885]].  potentially threatened U.S. hegemony in the Western Hemisphere, with the two countries almost going to war during the [[Baltimore crisis]] in 1891.

===20th century===

The early 20th century saw  fully consolidate its territory and resolve long-running diplomatic and territorial disputes. Its current borders with  were finalized [[1902 Arbitral award of the Andes between  and |through British arbitration]] in 1902 and a bilateral settlement of the [[Puna de Atacama dispute]] the following year. In 1904,  and  signed a [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship (1904)|Treaty of Peace and Friendship]] which clarified the border between both countries.

The  economy partially degenerated into a system protecting the interests of a ruling [[oligarchy]]. By the 1920s, the emerging middle and working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, [[Arturo Alessandri]], whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress. In the 1920s, [[Marxism|Marxist]] groups with strong popular support arose.

A military coup led by General [[Luis Altamirano]] in 1924 set off a period of political instability that lasted until 1932. Of the ten governments that held power in that period, the longest lasting was that of General [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]], who briefly ruled as [[de facto]] dictator in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931. These authoritarian governments were comparatively less harsh and corrupt than counterparts elsewhere in Latin America.

By relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor, Ibáñez del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years, in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his ideology. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. During the period of [[Radical Party ()|Radical Party]] dominance (1932–52), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ibáñez del Campo to office for another six years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded Ibáñez del Campo in 1958, bringing  conservatism back into power democratically for another term.

The [[1964  presidential election|1964 presidential election]] of [[Christian Democrat Party of |Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] by an [[Majority|absolute majority]] initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan "Revolution in Liberty", the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and [[agrarian reform]], including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.
[[File:Salvador Allende Gossens-.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Salvador Allende]]]]

In the 1970 election, Senator [[Salvador Allende]] of the [[Socialist Party of ]] (then part of the "[[Popular Unity ()|Popular Unity]]" coalition which included the Communists, Radicals, Social-Democrats, dissident Christian Democrats, the Popular Unitary Action Movement, and the Independent Popular Action), achieved a partial majority in a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in a three-way contest, followed by candidates Radomiro Tomic for the Christian Democrat Party and Jorge Alessandri for the Conservative Party. Allende was not elected with an absolute majority, receiving fewer than 35% of the votes.

The [[National Congress of | Congress]] conducted a runoff vote between the leading candidates, Allende and former president Jorge Alessandri, and, keeping with tradition, chose Allende by a vote of 153 to 35. Frei refused to form an alliance with Alessandri to oppose Allende, on the grounds that the Christian Democrats were a workers' party and could not make common cause with the right wing.

An [[economic depression]] that began in 1972 was exacerbated by [[capital flight]], plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and unemployment rose. Allende adopted measures including price freezes, wage increases, and tax reforms, to increase consumer spending and redistribute income downward. Joint public-private [[public works]] projects helped reduce unemployment.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Much of the banking sector was [[nationalization|nationalized]]. Many enterprises within the [[Copper#Production|copper]], coal, iron, [[Caliche (mineral)# caliche|nitrate]], and steel industries were [[Nationalization#Expropriation|expropriated]], nationalized, or subjected to state intervention. Industrial output increased sharply and unemployment fell during the Allende administration's first year.

Allende's program included advancement of workers' interests, replacing the judicial system with "socialist legality", nationalization of banks and forcing others to bankruptcy, and strengthening "popular militias" known as MIR. Started under former President Frei, the Popular Unity platform also called for nationalization of 's major copper mines in the form of a constitutional amendment. The measure was passed unanimously by Congress. As a result, the [[Richard Nixon]] administration [[ intervention in |organized and inserted secret operatives]] in , in order to swiftly destabilize Allende's government. In addition, US financial pressure restricted international economic credit to .

The economic problems were also exacerbated by Allende's public spending, financed mostly through printing money, and by poor credit ratings given by commercial banks. Simultaneously, opposition media, politicians, business guilds and other organizations helped to accelerate a campaign of domestic political and economical destabilization, some of which was backed by the . By early 1973, inflation was out of control. On 26 May 1973, 's Supreme Court, which was opposed to Allende's government, unanimously denounced Allende's ''disruption of the legality of the nation''. Although illegal under the  constitution, the court supported and strengthened Pinochet's soon-to-be seizure of power.

====Pinochet era (1973–1990)====
{{Main|Military government of  (1973–1990)|Miracle of |Beagle conflict}}

[[File:Golpe de Estado 1973.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fighter aircraft|Fighter jets]] bombing the Presidential Palace of ''La Moneda'' during the [[ coup of 1973]]]]
On 11 September 1973, a [[ coup of 1973|military coup]] overthrew Allende, who apparently committed suicide as the armed forces bombarded the [[La Moneda Palace|presidential palace]]. The degree to which [[U.S. intervention in #1973 coup|the  was involved in the coup]] remains debated; after Allende was overthrown, U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] told [[President of the |U.S. president]] [[Richard Nixon]] that the  had "helped" the coup indirectly. Historian Sebastián Hurtado contends there is no documentary evidence to support that the U.S. government was actively involved in the coordination and execution the coup; however, upon Allende's election in 1970, Kissinger had stated "I don't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go Communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people", while Nixon had expressed that the Allende government should not be consolidated and acted decisively to destabilize his government.

A military junta, led by General [[Augusto Pinochet]], took control of the country. His regime was marked by widespread [[Human rights violations in Pinochet's |human rights violation]]s.  initiated and actively participated in [[Operation Condor]], a U.S.-backed campaign to suppress leftists and their sympathizers. In October 1973, at least 72 people were murdered by the [[Caravan of Death]]. According to the [[Rettig Report]] and [[Valech Commission]], during the Pinochet regime's 15-year rule, at least 2,115 were killed, and at least 27,265 were tortured (including 88 children younger than 12 years old); many were detained, tortured, and executed at the national stadium. In 2011,  recognized an additional 9,800 victims, bringing the total number killed, tortured or imprisoned for political reasons to 40,018. Among the victims was internationally known poet-singer [[Víctor Jara]].

A new Constitution was approved by a controversial [[plebiscite]] on 11 September 1980, and General Pinochet became president of the republic for an eight-year term. After Pinochet obtained rule of the country, several hundred committed  revolutionaries joined the [[Sandinista]] army in [[]], guerrilla forces in [[]] or training camps in [[]], Eastern Europe and Northern Africa.

In the late 1980s, largely as a result of events such as the 1982 economic collapse and mass [[civil resistance]] in 1983–1988, the government gradually permitted greater freedom of assembly, [[Freedom of speech|speech]], and association, to include trade union and political activity. The government launched market-oriented reforms with [[Hernán Büchi]] as Minister of Finance.  moved toward a [[free market economy]] that saw an increase in domestic and foreign private investment, although the [[Copper#Production|copper]] industry and other important mineral resources were not opened to competition. In a [[1988  national plebiscite|plebiscite]] on 5 October 1988, Pinochet was denied a second eight-year term as president (56% against 44%). Chileans elected a new president and the majority of members of a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] congress on 14 December 1989. Christian Democrat [[Patricio Aylwin]], the candidate of a coalition of 17 political parties called the ''[[Concertación]]'', received an absolute majority of votes (55%). President Aylwin served from 1990 to 1994, in what was considered a transition period.

In December 1993, Christian Democrat [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]], the son of previous president Eduardo Frei Montalva, led the Concertación coalition to victory with an absolute majority of votes (58%). Frei Ruiz-Tagle was succeeded in 2000 by Socialist [[Ricardo Lagos]], who won the presidency in an unprecedented [[1999–2000  presidential election|runoff election]] against [[Joaquín Lavín]] of the rightist [[Alliance for ]]. In January 2006, Chileans elected their first female president, [[Michelle Bachelet Jeria]], of the Socialist Party, defeating [[Sebastián Piñera]], of the [[National Renewal ()|National Renewal]] party, extending the ''Concertación'' governance for another four years. In January 2010, Chileans [[2009–10  presidential election|elected]] [[Sebastián Piñera]] as the first rightist President in 20 years, defeating former President [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]] of the ''Concertación'', for a four-year term succeeding Bachelet. Due to term limits, [[Sebastián Piñera]] did not stand for re-election in 2013, and his term expired in March 2014 resulting in [[Michelle Bachelet]] returning to office. Sebastián Piñera succeeded Bachelet again in 2018 as the [[President of ]] after winning the December 2017 presidential [[2017  general election|election]].

On 15 November, most of the political parties represented in the National Congress signed an agreement to call a [[2020  national referendum|national referendum]] in April 2020 regarding the creation of a new Constitution, later postponed to October due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in |COVID-19 pandemic]]. On 25 October 2020, Chileans voted 78.28 percent in favor of a new constitution, while 21.72 percent rejected the change; voter turnout was 51 percent. An [[2021  Constitutional Convention election|election]] for the members of the [[Constitutional Convention ()|Constitutional Convention]] was held in  between 15 and 16 May 2021; the results saw a complete rearrangement of the political system established since the end of [[Military dictatorship of  (1973–1990)|Pinochet's dictatorship]] in 1990, with various independent and leftist candidates performing strongly relative to conventional center-right and center-left parties.

On 19 December 2021, a leftist candidate, the 35-year-old former student protest leader [[Gabriel Boric]], won 's presidential [[2021  general election|election]] to become the country's youngest leader. On 11 March 2022, Boric was sworn in as president to succeed outgoing President Sebastian Piñera. The majority of Boric's Cabinet—14 out of 24—are women, which is a first in the Western Hemisphere.
