There is [[Archaeology of the |evidence]] of early [[hominins]] living in what is now the  as early as 709,000 years ago. Bones from [[Callao Cave]] potentially represent an otherwise unknown species, ''[[Homo luzonensis]]'', who lived 50,000 to 67,000 years ago. The oldest [[modern human]] remains on the islands are from the [[Tabon Caves]] of [[Palawan]], [[U/Th-dated]] to 47,000 ± 11–10,000 years ago. [[Tabon Man]] is presumably a [[Negrito]], among the archipelago's earliest inhabitants descended from the first human migrations out of Africa via the coastal route along [[South Asia|southern Asia]] to the now-sunken landmasses of [[Sundaland]] and [[Sahul]].

The first Austronesians reached the  from Taiwan around 2200 BC, settling the [[Batanes]] Islands (where they built stone fortresses known as ''[[ijang]]s'') and northern [[Luzon]]. Jade artifacts have been dated to 2000 BC, with [[lingling-o]] jade items made in Luzon with raw materials from Taiwan. By 1000 BC, the inhabitants of the archipelago had developed into four societies: [[hunter-gatherer]] tribes, warrior societies, highland [[plutocracies]], and port principalities.

Revolutionary sentiment grew in 1872 after 200 locally recruited [[colonial troops]] and laborers alongside [[Gomburza|three activist Catholic priests]] were executed on [[1872 Cavite mutiny|questionable grounds]]. This inspired the [[Propaganda Movement]], organized by [[Marcelo H. del Pilar]], [[José Rizal]], [[Graciano López Jaena]], and [[Mariano Ponce]], which advocated political reform in the .

With his wife, [[Imelda Marcos|Imelda]], Marcos was accused of corruption and [[Unexplained wealth of the Marcos family|embezzling billions of dollars]] of public funds. Marcos's heavy borrowing [[1969  balance of payments crisis|early in his presidency]] resulted in [[Economic history of the  (1965–1986)|economic crashes]], exacerbated by an [[early 1980s recession]] where the economy contracted by 7.3 percent annually in 1984 and 1985.{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DmkPEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA212|name=212}}}}

Marcos called a snap [[1986  presidential election|presidential election in 1986]] which proclaimed him the winner, but the results were widely regarded as fraudulent. The resulting protests led to the [[People Power Revolution]], which forced Marcos and his allies to flee to [[Hawaii]]. Aquino's widow, [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon]], was installed as president and a new constitution was promulgated.

The return of democracy and government reforms which began in 1986 were hampered by [[National debt of the |national debt]], government corruption, and [[Coup attempts against Corazon Aquino|coup attempts]].{{rp|pages=xii, xiii}} A [[Communist rebellion in the |communist insurgency]] and military conflict with [[Moro conflict|Moro separatists]] persisted; the administration also faced a series of disasters, including the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in June 1991. Aquino was succeeded by [[Fidel V. Ramos]], who [[Economic liberalization|liberalized]] the national economy with [[privatization]] and [[deregulation]]. Ramos's economic gains were overshadowed by the onset of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. His successor, [[Joseph Estrada]], prioritized public housing but faced corruption allegations which led to his overthrow by the [[Second EDSA Revolution|2001 EDSA Revolution]] and the succession of Vice President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] on January 20, 2001.

Arroyo's [[Presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo|nine-year administration]] was marked by economic growth, but was tainted by corruption and political scandals, including [[Hello Garci scandal|electoral fraud allegations]] during the [[2004  presidential election|2004 presidential election]]. Economic growth continued during [[Benigno Aquino III]]'s administration, which advocated good governance and transparency.{{rp|pages=1, 3}} Aquino III signed [[Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro|a peace agreement]] with the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF) resulting in the [[Bangsamoro Organic Law]] establishing an autonomous [[Bangsamoro]] region, but a [[Mamasapano clash|shootout with MILF rebels in Mamasapano]] delayed passage of the law.

Growing public frustration with post-[[People Power Revolution|EDSA]] governance led to the [[2016  presidential election|2016 election]] of populist [[Rodrigo Duterte]], whose [[Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte|presidency]] saw the decline of [[liberalism in the |liberalism in the country]] albeit largely retaining liberal economic policies. Among Duterte's priorities was [[Build! Build! Build!|aggressively increasing infrastructure spending]] to spur economic growth; the enactment of the Bangsamoro Organic Law; an intensified crackdown on crime and communist insurgencies; and [[ drug war|an anti-drug campaign]] that reduced drug proliferation but that has also led to [[extrajudicial killing]]s. In early 2020, the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the |COVID-19 pandemic]] reached the , necessitating [[COVID-19 community quarantines in the |nationwide lockdowns]] that caused a brief but severe [[COVID-19 recession|economic recession]]. Under a promise of continuing Duterte's policies, Marcos's son, [[Bongbong Marcos]], ran with Duterte's daughter, [[Sara Duterte|Sara]], and won the [[2022  presidential election|2022 election]]. Marcos's renewal of a pro-US foreign policy, however, has been viewed as a reversal of Duterte's cordiality with , and [[territorial disputes in the South  Sea]] have since escalated. The Marcos administration also [[Arrest of Rodrigo Duterte|arrested]] his predecessor Duterte, who was sent to the [[International Criminal Court]] in [[The ]] for trial of [[crimes against humanity]], which led to the collapse of the Marcos-Duterte alliance. Later on, a series of [[Flood control projects controversy in the |corruption, mismanagement and irregularities in government-funded flood management projects]] occurred under his administration, resulting in [[September 2025  protests|numerous protests nationwide]].
