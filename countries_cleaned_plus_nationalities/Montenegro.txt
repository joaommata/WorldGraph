Modern-day  was part of [[Illyria]] and populated by the Indo-European-speaking [[Illyrians]]. The [[Illyrian kingdom]] was conquered by the [[Roman Republic]] in the [[Illyro-Roman Wars]] and the region was incorporated into the [[Illyricum (Roman province)|province of Illyricum]] (later [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and [[Praevalitana]]).

{{Main|Duklja|Principality of Zeta|Tribes of }}

Three principalities were located on the territory: [[Duklja]], roughly corresponding to the southern half, [[Travunia]], the west, and [[Principality of  (early medieval)|Raška]], the north. Duklja gained its independence from the Byzantine Roman Empire in 1042. Over the next few decades, it expanded its territory to neighbouring Rascia and , and also became recognised as a kingdom. Its power started declining at the beginning of the 12th century. After King Bodin's death (in 1101 or 1108), civil wars ensued. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav's son, [[Mihailo I of Duklja|Mihailo]] (1046–1081), and his grandson [[Constantine Bodin]] (1081–1101).

As the nobility fought for the throne, the kingdom was weakened, and by 1186, the territory of modern-day  became part of the state ruled by [[Stefan Nemanja]] and was a part of various state formations ruled by the [[Nemanjić dynasty]] for the next two centuries. After the [[ Empire]] collapsed in the second half of the 14th century, the most powerful Zetan family, the [[Balšić]]s, became sovereigns of Zeta.

By the 13th century, ''Zeta'' had replaced ''Duklja'' when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern  ([[Lordship of Zeta|Zeta]]) came under the rule of the [[Balšić noble family]], then the [[Crnojević noble family]], and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as ''Crna Gora''.

In 1421, Zeta was annexed to the [[ Despotate]], but after 1455, another noble family from Zeta, the [[Crnojević]]s, became sovereign rulers of the country, making it the last free monarchy of the Balkans before it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1496, and got annexed to the ''[[sanjak]]'' of [[Shkodër]]. For a short time,  existed as a separate autonomous ''sanjak'' in 1514–1528 ([[Sanjak of ]]). Also, [[Old ]] region was part of [[Sanjak of ]].{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

From 1392, numerous parts of the territory were controlled by [[Republic of Venice]], including the city of [[Budva]], in that time known as "Budua". 
The Venetian territory was centred on the [[Bay of Kotor]], and the Republic introduced governors who meddled in  politics. Venice controlled territories in present-day  until [[Fall of the Republic of Venice|its fall]] in 1797.
Large portions fell under the control of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1496 to 1878. In the 16th century,  developed a unique form of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire that permitted  clans freedom from certain restrictions. Nevertheless, the  were disgruntled with Ottoman rule, and in the 17th century, repeatedly rebelled, which culminated in the defeat of the Ottomans in the [[Great  War]] at the end of that century.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

The political skills of Abdul Hamid II and Nicholas I played a major role in the mutually amicable relations. Modernization of the state followed, culminating with the draft of a Constitution in 1905. However, political rifts emerged between the reigning [[People's Party (, 1906)|People's Party]], who supported the process of democratisation and union with , and those of the [[True People's Party]], who were monarchist.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

In May, the  branch of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia started preparations for an uprising planned for mid-July. The Communist Party and its Youth League organised 6,000 of its members into detachments prepared for [[guerrilla warfare]]. According to some historians, the first armed uprising in [[Nazi |Nazi]]-occupied Europe happened on 13 July 1941 in .

Unexpectedly, the uprising took hold, and by 20 July, 32,000 men and women had joined the fight. Except for the coast and major towns (Podgorica, Cetinje, Pljevlja, and Nikšić), which were besieged,  was mostly liberated. In a month of fighting, the  army suffered 5,000 dead, wounded, and captured. The uprising lasted until mid-August, when it was suppressed by a counter-offensive of 67,000  troops brought in from . Faced with new and overwhelming  forces, many of the fighters laid down their arms and returned home. Nevertheless, intense guerrilla fighting lasted until December.

Fighters who remained under arms fractured into two groups. Most of them went on to join the Yugoslav Partisans, consisting of communists and those inclined towards active resistance; these included [[Arso Jovanović]], [[Sava Kovačević]], [[Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo]], [[Milovan Đilas]], [[Peko Dapčević]], [[Vlado Dapčević]], [[Veljko Vlahović]], and [[Blažo Jovanović]]. Those loyal to the [[Karađorđević dynasty]] and opposing communism went on to become [[Chetniks]], and turned to collaboration with  against the Partisans.

War broke out between Partisans and Chetniks during the first half of 1942. Pressured by  and Chetniks, the core of the  Partisans went to  and , where they joined with other Yugoslav Partisans. Fighting between Partisans and Chetniks continued through the war. Chetniks with  backing controlled most of the country from mid-1942 to April 1943.  Chetniks received the status of "anti-communist militia" and received weapons, ammunition, food rations, and money from . Most of them were moved to [[Mostar]], where they fought in the [[Battle of Neretva]] against the Partisans, but were dealt a heavy defeat.

The massive privatizations of the Đukanović era lead to the enrichment of him and oligarchs close to him. His brother Aleksandar, owner of 's first private bank, oversaw the privatizations, while his sister, Ana Kolarevic, has long controlled the judiciary. The clientelist networks of the ruling party dominated all segments of social life. A party card was required to start a business or obtain a position in the administration.
