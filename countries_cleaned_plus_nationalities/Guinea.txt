What is now  sat on the fringes of various West African empires. The earliest, the [[ Empire]], grew on trade and ultimately fell after repeated incursions of the [[Almoravids]]. It was in this period that Islam first arrived in the region by way of North African traders. The [[Sosso Empire]] came and stayed from 12th to 13th centuries; later, the [[ Empire]] came when [[Sundiata Keita|Soundiata Kéïta]] defeated the Sosso ruler [[Soumaoro Kanté|Soumangourou Kanté]] at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in {{circa|1235}}. The  Empire was ruled by [[Mansa (title)|Mansa]] (Emperors), including [[Musa I of |Kankou Moussa]], who made a [[hajj]] to Mecca in 1324. After his reign, the  Empire began to decline and was ultimately supplanted by its [[vassal]] states in the 15th century.

The [[Songhai Empire]] expanded its power in about 1460. It continued to prosper until a civil war, over succession, followed the death of [[Askia Daoud]] in 1582. The empire [[ invasion of the Songhai Empire|fell to invaders]] from [[]] in 1591, but the kingdom later split into smaller kingdoms. After the fall of some of the West African empires, various kingdoms existed in what is now . [[Fulani]] Muslims migrated to [[Futa Jallon]] in Central , and established an Islamic state from 1727 to 1896 with a written constitution and alternate rulers. The [[Wassoulou Empire|Wassoulou or Wassulu Empire]] (1878–1898) was led by [[Samori Ture|Samori Toure]] in the predominantly [[Mandinka people|Malinké]] area of what is now upper  and southwestern [[]] (Wassoulou). It moved to [[]] before being conquered by the .

=== Colony ===
European traders competed for the cape trade from the 17th century onward and made inroads earlier. 's colonial period began with  military penetration into the area, and its establishment as a colony on 17 December 1891. As a result of various troubles,  occupied Timbo, the capital of Fouta, in 1896, and a definitive treaty was signed in 1897. The defeat of the armies of [[Samori Touré]], Mansa (or Emperor) of the [[Ouassoulou]] state and leader of Malinké descent, in 1898 gave  control of what today is  and adjacent areas. The boundaries of the South Rivers were fixed in 1899.

In 1958, the [[ Fourth Republic]] collapsed due to political instability and its failures in dealing with its colonies, especially [[Indochina]] and [[]]. The [[ Fifth Republic]] gave the colonies the choice of [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]] in a new [[ Community]] or immediate independence in the [[1958  constitutional referendum|referendum]] of 28 September 1958.  voted overwhelmingly for independence. It was led by [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]], whose [[Democratic Party of -African Democratic Rally]] (PDG) had won 56 of 60 seats in the 1957 territorial elections.

The  later withdrew, and on 2 October 1958,  proclaimed itself a sovereign and independent republic, with Sékou Touré as president. Later, [[Opération Persil]] was planned by [[Jacques Foccart]]; they planned to create large quantities of forged [[ franc]]s to [[Hyperinflation|hyperinflate]] 's economy and to arm Touré's opposition figures. However, the operation was leaked, and soon, the  was issuing a number of official complaints.

=== Post-colonial ===

==== Under Touré's rule ====
In 1960, Touré declared the [[Democratic Party of  – African Democratic Rally|Democratic Party of ]] the country's only legal political party, and for the next 24 years, the government and PDG were one. Touré was re-elected unopposed to four 7-year terms as president, and every 5 years voters were presented with a single list of PDG candidates for the National Assembly.

On 22 November 1970,  forces from neighbouring [[ ]] staged [[Operation Green Sea]], a raid on Conakry by several hundred exiled  opposition forces. Among their goals, the  military wanted to kill or capture Sekou Touré due to his support of [[PAIGC]], an independence movement and rebel group that had carried out attacks inside   from their bases in . After some fighting, the -backed forces retreated.  was elected as a non-permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] 1972–73.

In 1977, a declining economy and a ban on all private economic transactions led to the [[ Market Women's Revolt|Market Women's Revolt]], a series of anti-government riots started by women working in Conakry's [[Marché Madina (Conakry)|Madina Market]]. Touré vacillated from supporting the Soviet Union to supporting the . The late 1970s and early 1980s saw some economic reforms. After the election of [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] as  president, trade increased and the two countries exchanged diplomatic visits.

==== Under Conté's rule ====
Sékou Touré died on 26 March 1984 after a heart operation in the , and was replaced by Prime Minister [[Louis Lansana Beavogui]], who was to serve as interim president, pending new elections. PDG was due to elect a new leader on 3 April 1984. Under the constitution, that person would have been the only candidate for president. Hours before that meeting, Colonels [[Lansana Conté]] and [[Diarra Traoré]] seized power in a [[1984  coup d'état|bloodless coup]]. Conté assumed the role of president, with Traoré serving as prime minister, until December.

Conté denounced the previous regime's record on human rights, releasing 250 political prisoners and encouraging approximately 200,000 more to return from exile. He made explicit the turn away from socialism. In 1992, Conté announced a return to civilian rule, with a presidential poll in 1993, followed by elections to parliament in 1995 (in which his party—the [[Unity and Progress Party|Party of Unity and Progress]]—won 71 of 114 seats). In September 2001, the opposition leader [[Alpha Condé]] was imprisoned for endangering state security and pardoned 8 months later. Subsequently, he spent time in exile in .

In 2001, Conté organized and won a referendum to lengthen the presidential term, and in 2003, began his third term after elections were boycotted by the opposition. In January 2005, Conté survived a suspected assassination attempt while making a public appearance in Conakry. His opponents claimed that he was a "tired dictator", whose departure was inevitable, whereas his supporters believed that he was winning a battle with dissidents. According to ''[[Foreign Policy]]'',  was in danger of becoming a [[failed state]].

In 2000,  suffered as rebels crossed the borders from [[]] and [[]]. Some thought that the country was headed towards a civil war. Conté blamed neighbouring leaders for coveting 's natural resources, and these claims were denied. In 2003,  agreed to plans with her neighbours to tackle the insurgents. The [[2007  general strike]] resulted in the appointment of a new prime minister.

==== Political violence and Ebola outbreak ====
Conté remained in power until his death on 23 December 2008. Several hours after his death, [[Moussa Dadis Camara]] seized control in a [[2008  coup d'état|coup]], declaring himself head of a [[military junta]]. Protests against the coup became violent, and 157 people were killed when, on 28 September 2009, the junta ordered its soldiers to attack people gathered to protest Camara's attempt to become president. The soldiers went on a rampage of rape, mutilation, and murder, which caused some foreign governments to withdraw their support for the new regime.

On 3 December 2009, an aide shot Camara during a dispute over the rampage in September. Camara went to  for medical care. Vice-president (and defense minister) [[Sékouba Konaté]] flew from [[]] to run the country. After meeting in [[Ouagadougou]] on 13 and 14 January 2010, Camara, Konaté and [[Blaise Compaoré]], President of [[]], produced a formal statement of 12 principles promising a return of  to civilian rule within six months. The presidential election of 27 June brought allegations of fraud, and a second election was held on 7 November. Voter turnout was "high", and the elections went "relatively smoothly". [[Alpha Condé]], leader of the opposition party [[Rally of the  People]] (RGP), won the election, promising to reform the security sector and review mining contracts.

In February 2013, [[2013  clashes|political violence erupted]] after street protests over the transparency of the upcoming [[2013  parliamentary election|May elections]]. The protests were fueled by the opposition coalition's decision to step down from the elections in protest of the lack of transparency in the preparations for elections. Nine people were killed during the protests, and around 220 were injured. Some deaths and injuries were caused by security forces using live ammunition on protesters. The violence led to ethnic clashes between the [[Malinke]] and [[Fula people|Fula]], who supported and opposed President Condé, respectively. On 26 March 2013, the opposition party backed out of negotiations with the government over the election, saying that the government had not respected them, and had broken all agreements.[[File:Acte2 FNDC.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[2019–2020  protests]] against the rule of [[Alpha Condé]]]]
On 25 March 2014, the [[World Health Organization]] stated that [[Ministry of Health ()|'s Ministry of Health]] had reported [[Ebola virus epidemic in |an outbreak]] of [[Ebola virus disease]] in . This initial outbreak had 86 cases, including 59 deaths. By 28 May, there were 281 cases, with 186 deaths. It is believed that the first case was Emile Ouamouno, a two-year-old boy in the village of [[Meliandou]]. He fell ill on 2 December 2013 and died on 6 December. On 18 September 2014, eight members of an Ebola education health care team [[Womey Massacre|were murdered]] by villagers in the town of [[Womey]]. As of 1 November 2015, there had been 3,810 cases and 2,536 deaths in .

[[2019–2020  protests|Mass civil unrest and violent protests broke out]] against the rule of Alpha Conde on 14 October 2019, against constitutional changes. More than 800 were killed in clashes. After the [[2020  presidential election]], Alpha Condé's election to a third term was challenged by the opposition, who accused him of fraud. Condé claimed a [[2020  constitutional referendum|constitutional referendum from March 2020]] allowed him to run despite the 2-term limit.

==== Under military rule ====
On 5 September 2021, after hours of gunfire near the presidential palace, Lieutenant Colonel [[Mamady Doumbouya]] seized control of state television and declared that President [[Alpha Condé|Alpha Conde]]'s government had been dissolved and the nation's borders closed. By the evening, the putschists had declared control of all of Conakry and the country's armed forces. According to ''Guinée Matin'', by 6 September, the military fully controlled the state administration and started to replace the civil administration with its military counterpart. The [[United Nations]], [[European Union]], [[African Union]], [[ECOWAS]] (which suspended 's membership), and [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|La Francophonie]] denounced the coup, and called for President Condé's unconditional release. Similar responses came from some neighboring and Western countries (including the [[]]), and from [[]] (which relies on  for half of its aluminum ore, facilitated by its connections to President Condé). Despite these, on 1 October 2021, Mamady Doumbouya was sworn in as interim president.

On 11 May 2023, at least seven people were shot dead in anti-government demonstrations in cities across . The anti-government movement became involved in peaceful protests and called on rulers to end military rule in  and transition the country to democracy. On 18 December 2023, an [[Conakry oil depot explosion|explosion occurred]] at the country's main oil depot in Conakry, killing 24 people and causing extensive fuel shortages in the country in the following weeks. Existing civil and economic unrest in the country temporarily worsened as a result, with several confrontations between protestors and police in Conakry, increased fuel and travel costs, and general price inflation throughout the country.

Doumbouya initially set 31 December 2024 as the deadline to launch a democratic transition. But he missed the deadline, leading to protests and criticism from activists and the opposition. Under pressure, he promised in his New Year’s message that a decree for the constitutional referendum would be signed. Authorities have further added that all elections would be held in 2025, without committing to a particular date. A [[2025  constitutional referendum|constitutional referendum]] was held on 21 September 2025, which established a new constitution replacing the one approved in [[2020  constitutional referendum|2020]] and marked the first step towards civilian rule.
