Cultural remains at [[Jerimalai]] on the eastern tip of  have been dated to 42,000 years ago. The first known inhabitants are those who arrived during the [[Australo-Melanesian]] migration through the region, likely bringing the precursors to today's [[Papuan languages]]. A later migration of [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]]-speakers is suspected, although no such languages remain. The arrival of [[Austronesian peoples]] brought [[Austronesian languages|new languages]], and merged with existing cultures on the island. Timorese origin myths recount settlers sailing around the eastern end of the island before landing in the south. These people are sometimes noted as being from the [[Malay Peninsula]] or the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] highlands of [[Sumatra]]. [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] migration to  may be associated with the development of agriculture on the island.

While information is limited about the political system of  during this period, the island had developed an interconnected series of polities governed by customary law. Small communities, centred around a particular sacred house, were part of wider ''sucos'' (or principalities), which were themselves part of larger kingdoms led by a ''liurai''. Authority within these kingdoms was held by [[Dyad (sociology)|two individuals]], with the worldly power of the ''liurai'' balanced by the spiritual power of a ''rai nain'', who was generally associated with the primary sacred house of the kingdom. These polities were numerous and saw shifting alliances and relations, but many were stable enough that they survived from initial European documentation in the 16th century until the end of  rule.{{rp|11–15}}

From perhaps the thirteenth century, the island exported [[sandalwood]],{{rp|267}} which was valued both for its use in crafting and as a source of perfume.  was included in Southeast Asian, , and  trading networks by the fourteenth century, exporting sandalwood, honey, and wax. The island was recorded by the [[Majapahit]] Empire as a source of tribute.{{rp|89}} It was sandalwood that attracted European explorers to the island in the early sixteenth century. Early European presence was limited to trade, with the first  settlement being on the nearby island of [[Solor]].{{rp|90}}

Early  presence on  was very limited; trade was directed through  settlements on nearby islands. Only in the 17th century did they establish a more direct presence on the island, a consequence of being driven out of other islands by the .{{rp|267}} After Solor was lost in 1613, the  moved to [[Flores]]. In 1646, the capital moved to [[Kupang]] on 's west, before Kupang too was lost to the  in 1652. The  then moved to [[Lifau]], in what is now 's [[Oecusse]] exclave.{{rp|90}} Effective European occupation in the east of the island only began in 1769, when the city of [[Dili]] was founded, although actual control remained highly limited. A definitive [[– border|border]] between the  and  parts of the island was established by the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in 1914 and remains the international boundary between the successor states  and , respectively.

For the , East  remained little more than a neglected trading post, with minimal investment in infrastructure and education, until the late nineteenth century. Even when  established actual control over the interior of its colony, investment remained minimal.{{rp|269, 273}} Sandalwood continued to be the main export crop and coffee exports became significant in the mid-nineteenth century.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, a faltering domestic economy prompted the  to extract greater wealth from its colonies, which was met with  resistance. The colony was seen as an economic burden during the [[Great Depression]] and received little support or management from .{{rp|269}}

During World War II, Dili was occupied by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1941, and later by the [[Empire of |]] beginning in 1942. The mountainous interior of the colony became the scene of a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla campaign]], known as the [[Battle of  (1942–43)|Battle of ]]. Waged by  volunteers and Allied forces against the , the struggle killed between 40,000 and 70,000  civilians. The  eventually drove the last of the  and Allied forces out in early 1943.  control resumed, however, after  surrender at the end of World War II.

 began investment in the colony in the 1950s, funding education and promoting coffee exports, but the economy did not improve substantially and infrastructure improvements were limited.{{rp|269}} Yearly growth rates remained low, near 2%. Following the [[Carnation Revolution|1974  revolution]],  effectively abandoned its colony in , and civil war between  political parties broke out in 1975.

The [[Revolutionary Front for an Independent East ]] (Fretilin) resisted a [[Timorese Democratic Union]] (UDT) coup attempt in August 1975, and [[ declaration of independence|unilaterally declared independence]] on 28 November 1975. Fearing a communist state within the  Archipelago, the  military launched an [[ invasion of East |invasion of East ]] on 7 December 1975.  declared [[East  (province)|East  its 27th province]] on 17 July 1976. The [[United Nations Security Council]] opposed the invasion, and the territory's nominal status in the UN remained as "non-self-governing territory under  administration".

[[Fretilin]] resisted the invasion, initially as an army, holding territory until November 1978, and then as a guerrilla resistance. The [[ occupation of East | occupation]] of  was marked by violence and brutality. A detailed statistical report prepared for the [[Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East ]] cited a minimum of 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period between 1974 and 1999, including approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 [[excess death]]s from hunger and illness. The total number of conflict-related deaths during this period is difficult to determine due to a lack of data. One estimate based on , , and Catholic Church data suggests it may have been as high as 200,000. Repression and restrictions counteracted improvements in health and education infrastructure and services, meaning there was little overall improvement in living standards; economic growth mostly benefited immigrants from elsewhere in .{{rp|271}} A huge expansion of education was intended to increase  language use and internal security as much as it was for development.

The [[Santa Cruz massacre|1991 massacre]] of more than 200 demonstrators by the  military was a turning point for the independence cause, and brought increased international pressure on . Following the [[Fall of Suharto|resignation of  President Suharto]], the new President [[B. J. Habibie|BJ Habibie]], prompted by a letter from  [[Prime Minister John Howard]], decided to hold a referendum on independence. A UN-sponsored agreement between  and  allowed for a UN-supervised popular [[ independence referendum, 1999|referendum]] in August 1999. A clear vote for independence was met with [[1999  crisis|a punitive campaign of violence]] by  [[pro- militia|pro-integration militias]] supported by elements of the  military. In response, the  government allowed a multinational peacekeeping force, [[International Force East |INTERFET]], to restore order and aid  refugees and internally displaced persons. On 25 October 1999, the administration of East  was taken over by the UN through the [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East ]] (UNTAET). INTERFET deployment ended in February 2000 with the transfer of military command to the UN.

In 2006, [[2006  crisis|a crisis of unrest and factional fighting]] forced 155,000 people to flee their homes; the United Nations sent in security forces to restore order. The following year, Gusmão declined to run for another term. While there were minor incidents in the build-up to the [[ presidential election, 2007|mid-year presidential elections]], the process was peaceful overall and [[José Ramos-Horta]] was elected president. In June 2007, Gusmão ran in the [[ parliamentary election, 2007|parliamentary elections]] and became prime minister at the head of the [[National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction]] (CNRT) party. In February 2008, Ramos-Horta was critically injured in [[2008  assassination attempts|an attempted assassination]]; Prime Minister Gusmão also faced gunfire separately but escaped unharmed.  reinforcements were immediately sent to help keep order. In March 2011, the UN handed over operational control of the police force to the  authorities. The United Nations ended its peacekeeping mission on 31 December 2012.

[[Francisco Guterres]] of the centre-left Fretilin party became president in May 2017. The leader of Fretilin, [[Mari Alkatiri]], formed a coalition government after the July 2017 parliamentary election. This government soon fell, leading to a second general election in May 2018. In June 2018, former president and independence fighter, [[Taur Matan Ruak]], became the new prime minister. [[José Ramos-Horta]] again became president on 20 May 2022 after winning the April 2022 [[2022  presidential election|presidential election]] runoff against Francisco Guterres. Following ratification by the National Parliament, the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]] came into force for  on 22 September, making the use of nuclear weapons in the country illegal.{{Citation needed|date=October 2025}}
