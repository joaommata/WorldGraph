===Geological history===
The islands that make up modern-day  lie at the southern end of the [[Lesser Antilles]] group. The islands lie close to the continent of South America, separated by the [[Gulf of Paria]].

===Indigenous peoples===
 were originally settled by [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] peoples migrating from [[South America]]. The earliest known settlement is at [[Banwari Trace]] in [[Trinidad|southwestern Trinidad]], dating back to approximately 5000 BCE, making it the oldest [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] archaeological site in the [[Caribbean]].{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}} The site has yielded artifacts and the remains of "Banwari Man," the oldest human skeleton found in the region.

At the time of European contact, Trinidad was inhabited by various Indigenous groups, including [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]]-speaking peoples such as the [[Arawakan languages|Nepoya]] and [[Shebaya]], and [[Cariban languages|Cariban]]-speaking groups like the Yao. [[Tobago]] was primarily occupied by the [[Kalinago|Island Caribs]]

===European colonization===
{{Main|Columbian Viceroyalty|New |Captaincy General of }}

Christopher Columbus was the first European to see Trinidad, on his third voyage to the Americas in 1498.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}}{{sfnp|Williams|1964|pp=7–8}} He also reported seeing Tobago on the distant horizon, naming it ''Bellaforma'', but did not land on the island.{{sfnp|Carmichael|1961|p=14}}

[[File:Raleigh at Trinidad.jpg|thumb|left| pirate [[Walter Raleigh]] raiding  settlement in Trinidad in 1595]]

In the 1530s [[Antonio Sedeño|Antonio de Sedeño]], a  soldier intent on conquering the island of Trinidad, landed on its southwest coast with a small army of men, intending to subdue the Indigenous population of the island. Sedeño and his men fought the native peoples on many occasions, and subsequently built a fort. The next few decades were generally spent in warfare with the native peoples, until in 1592, the "Cacique" (native chief) Wannawanare (also known as Guanaguanare) granted the area around modern [[Saint Joseph, |Saint Joseph]] to Domingo de Vera e Ibargüen, and withdrew to another part of the island. The settlement of San José de Oruña was later established by [[Antonio de Berrío]] on this land in 1592.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}} Shortly thereafter the  pirate [[Walter Raleigh]] arrived in Trinidad on 22 March 1595 [[Raleigh's El Dorado Expedition|in search]] of the long-rumoured "[[El Dorado]]" ("City of Gold") supposedly located in South America.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}} He attacked San José, captured and interrogated Antonio de Berrío, and obtained much information from him and from the Cacique Topiawari; Raleigh then went on his way, and  authority was restored.{{sfnp|Williams|1964|pp=11, 18}}

Meanwhile, there were numerous attempts by European powers to settle Tobago during the 1620–40s, with the ,  and Couronians (people from the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]], now part of [[]]) all attempting to colonise the island with little success.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=196}} From 1654 the  and Courlanders managed to gain a more secure foothold, later joined by several hundred  settlers. A plantation economy developed based on the production of sugar, indigo and rum, worked by large numbers of African slaves who soon came to vastly outnumber the European colonists.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=196}} Large numbers of forts were constructed as Tobago became a source of contention between ,  and Britain, with the island changing hands some 31 times prior to 1814, a situation exacerbated by widespread piracy.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=196}} The British managed to hold Tobago from 1762 to 1781, whereupon it was captured by the , who ruled until 1793 when Britain re-captured the island.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=196}}

The 17th century on Trinidad passed largely without major incident, but sustained attempts by the Spaniards to control and rule over the Indigenous population was often fiercely resisted.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}} In 1687 the [[Catholic]] [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[Capuchin friars]] were given responsibility for [[religious conversion|the conversions]] of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] of [[Trinidad]] and the [[Guianas]].{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}} They founded several missions in Trinidad, supported and richly funded by the state, which also granted ''[[encomienda]]'' right to them over the native peoples, in which the native peoples were forced to provide labour for the .{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}} One such mission was ''Santa Rosa de Arima,'' established in 1689, when Indigenous people from the former ''encomiendas'' of [[Tacarigua]] and ''Arauca'' ([[Arouca, |Arouca]]) were relocated further west.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Escalating tensions between the Spaniards and Indigenous people culminated in violence in 1689, when Indigenous people in the San Rafael encomienda rebelled and killed several priests, attacked a church, and killed the  governor [[José de León y Echales]]. Among those killed in the governor's party was Juan Mazien de Sotomayor, missionary priest to the Nepuyo villages of Caura, Tacarigua and Arauca. The  retaliated severely, slaughtering hundreds of native peoples in an event that became known as the [[Arena massacre]].{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}} As a result of continuing  slave-raiding, and the devastating impact of introduced disease to which they had no immunity, the native population was virtually wiped out by the end of the following century.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=249}}

During this period Trinidad was an island province belonging to the [[Viceroyalty of New ]], together with Central America, present-day [[]] and what would later become the southwestern [[]]. In 1757 the capital was moved from San José de Oruña to Puerto de España (modern [[Port of ]]) following several pirate attacks.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=55}} However the  never made any concerted effort to colonise the islands; Trinidad in this period was still mostly forest, populated by a few Spaniards with a handful of slaves and a few thousand Indigenous people. Indeed, the population in 1777 was only 1,400, and  colonisation in Trinidad remained tenuous.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

====Influx of  settlers====
{{Main| West Indies}}

In 1777, the captain general [[Luis de Unzaga]] 'le Conciliateur', married to a  Creole, allowed free trade in Trinidad, attracting  settlers and its economy improved notably.
Since Trinidad was considered underpopulated, Roume de St. Laurent, a Frenchman living in [[]], was able to obtain a [[Cedula of Population|''Cédula de Población'']] from the  king [[Charles III of |Charles III]] on 4 November 1783.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=250}} A ''Cédula de Población'' had previously been granted in 1776 by the king, but had not shown results, and therefore the new Cédula was more generous. It granted free land and tax exemption for 10 years to Roman Catholic foreign settlers who were willing to swear allegiance to the King of . The land grant was 30 fanegas (13 hectares/32 acres) for each free man, woman and child and half of that for each slave that they brought with them. The  sent a new governor, [[José María Chacón]], to implement the terms of the new ''cédula''.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=250}}

The Cédula was issued only a few years before the [[ Revolution]]. During that period of upheaval,  planters with their slaves, free [[coloureds]] and [[mulattos]] from the neighbouring islands of [[Martinique]], [[]], , [[Guadeloupe]] and [[]] migrated to Trinidad, where they established an agriculture-based economy (sugar and cocoa). These new immigrants established local communities in [[Blanchisseuse]], Champs Fleurs, [[Paramin]], Cascade, [[Carenage]] and [[Laventille]].

As a result, Trinidad's population jumped to over 15,000 by the end of 1789, and by 1797 the population of [[Port of ]] had increased from under 3,000 to 10,422 in just five years, with a varied population of mixed race individuals, Spaniards, Africans,  republican soldiers, retired pirates and  nobility. The total population of Trinidad was 17,718, of which 2,151 were of European ancestry, 4,476 were "free blacks and people of colour", 10,009 were enslaved people and 1,082 Indigenous people.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} The sparse settlement and slow rate of population-increase during  rule (and even later during British rule) made Trinidad one of the less populated colonies of the West Indies, with the least developed plantation infrastructure.

===British rule===
{{Main|British West Indies|British Windward Islands}}

[[File:Trinidad Ralph Abercromby (cropped).JPG|left|thumb|upright|A medallion showing the capture of  by the [[British Empire|British]] in 1797.]]

The British had begun to take a keen interest in Trinidad, and in 1797 a British force led by General [[Ralph Abercromby|Sir Ralph Abercromby]] launched an [[Invasion of Trinidad (1797)|invasion of Trinidad]].{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=251}} His squadron sailed through the Bocas and anchored off the coast of [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]]. Seriously outnumbered, Chacón decided to capitulate to the British without fighting.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=251}} Trinidad thus became a British [[crown colony]], with a largely -speaking population and  laws. British rule was later formalised under the [[Treaty of Amiens]] (1802).{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=251}} The colony's first British governor was [[Thomas Picton]], however his heavy-handed approach to enforcing British authority, including the use of torture and [[arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]], led to his being recalled.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=251}}{{Better source needed|date=March 2025}}
[[File:Plan of the Isle of Trinidad from actual surveys made in the year 1797. RMG K1077.jpg|thumb|Survey map from 1797 of Trinidad]]
British rule led to an influx of settlers from the  and the British colonies of the Eastern Caribbean. , Scots, ,  and  families arrived, as well as some free blacks known as "[[Merikins]]" who had fought for Britain in the [[War of 1812]] and were granted land in southern Trinidad.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=252}} Under British rule, new states were created and the importation of slaves increased, however by this time support for [[abolitionism]] had vastly increased and in England the slave trade was under attack.{{sfnp|Williams|1964}}

Slavery was [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|abolished in 1833]], after which former slaves served an "[[Slavery Abolition Act 1833#The Act|apprenticeship]]" period. In 1837, [[Daaga]], a West African slave trader who had been captured by  slavers and later rescued by the British navy, was conscripted into the local regiment. Daaga and a group of his compatriots [[St. Joseph Mutiny|mutinied at the barracks in St Joseph]] and set out eastward in an attempt to return to their homeland. The mutineers were ambushed by a militia unit just outside the town of Arima. The revolt was crushed at the cost of some 40 dead, and Daaga and two others were later executed at St Joseph.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=126}} The apprenticeship system ended on 1 August 1838 with full emancipation.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=252}} An overview of the population statistics in 1838, however, clearly reveals the contrast between Trinidad and its neighbouring islands: upon emancipation of the slaves in 1838, Trinidad had only 17,439 slaves, with 80% of slave owners having enslaved fewer than 10 people each.{{sfnp|Williams|1964|pp=84–85}} In contrast, at twice the size of Trinidad,  had roughly 360,000 slaves.

====Arrival of  indentured labourers====
[[File:Newly arrived coolies in Trinidad.jpg|thumb|left|Newly arrived [[ indenture system|indentured  labourers]] in .]]

After the African slaves were emancipated many refused to continue working on the plantations, often moving out to urban areas such as Laventille and [[Belmont, Port of |Belmont]] to the east of Port of .{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=252}} As a result, a severe agricultural labour shortage emerged. The British filled this gap by instituting a system of [[indentureship]]. Various nationalities were contracted under this system, including Indians, , and .{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=253}} Of these, the East Indians were imported in the largest numbers, starting from 1 May 1845, when 225 Indians were brought in the first ship to Trinidad on the ''[[Fatel Razack]]'', a Muslim-owned vessel.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=252}} Indentureship of the Indians lasted from 1845 to 1917, during which time more than 147,000 Indians came to Trinidad to work on sugarcane plantations.

Indentureship contracts were sometimes exploitative, to such an extent that historians such as [[Hugh Tinker]] were to call it "a new system of slavery". Despite these descriptions, it was not truly a new form of slavery, as workers were paid, contracts were finite, and the idea of an individual being another's property had been eliminated when slavery was abolished. In addition, employers of indentured labour had no legal right to flog or whip their workers; the main legal sanction for the enforcement of the indenture laws was prosecution in the courts, followed by fines or (more likely) jail sentences. People were contracted for a period of five years, with a daily wage as low as 25 cents in the early 20th century, and they were guaranteed return passage to  at the end of their contract period. However, [[Coercion|coercive means]] were often used to retain labourers, and the [[Indentured servant|indentureship contracts]] were soon extended to 10 years from 1854 after the planters complained that they were losing their labour too early.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=252}} In lieu of the return passage, the British authorities soon began offering portions of land to encourage settlement, and by 1902, more than half of the sugar cane in Trinidad was being produced by independent cane farmers; the majority of which were Indians. Despite the trying conditions experienced under the indenture system, about 90% of the  immigrants chose, at the end of their contracted periods of indenture, to make Trinidad their permanent home. Indians entering the colony were also subject to certain crown laws which [[Racial segregation|segregated]] them from the rest of 's population, such as the requirement that they carry a pass with them if they left the plantations, and that if freed, they carry their "Free Papers" or certificate indicating completion of the indenture period.

Few Indians settled on Tobago however, and the descendants of African slaves continued to form the majority of the island's population. An ongoing economic slump in the middle-to-late 19th century caused widespread poverty.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=239}} Discontent erupted into rioting on the [[Roxborough, |Roxborough]] plantation in 1876, in an event known as the Belmanna Uprising after a policeman who was killed.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=239}} The British eventually managed to restore control; however, as a result of the disturbances Tobago's Legislative Assembly voted to dissolve itself and the island became a Crown colony in 1877.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=239}} With the sugar industry in a state of near-collapse and the island no longer profitable, the British attached Tobago to their Trinidad colony in 1889.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=255}}{{sfnp|Williams|1964|p=149}}

====Early 20th century====
[[File:Stamps of .jpg|thumb|left|The Queen on 1953 stamps of ]]
In 1903, [[1903 Water Riots|a protest]] against the introduction of new water rates in Port of  erupted into rioting; 18 people were shot dead, and the [[Red House ()|Red House]] (the government headquarters) was damaged by fire.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=255}} A local elected assembly with some limited powers was introduced in 1913.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=255}} Economically  remained a predominantly agricultural colony; alongside sugarcane, the cacao ([[cocoa bean|cocoa]]) crop also contributed greatly to economic earnings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In November 1919, the dockworkers went on strike over bad management practices, low wages compared to a higher cost of living.{{sfn|Kiely|1996|p=66}} Strikebreakers were brought in to keep a minimum of goods moving through the ports. On 1 December 1919, the striking dockworkers rushed the harbour and chased off the strikebreakers.{{sfn|Kiely|1996|p=66}} They then proceeded to march on the government buildings in Port of . Other unions and workers, many with the same grievances, joined the dock worker's strike making it a General Strike.{{sfn|Kiely|1996|p=66}} Violence broke out and was only put down with help from the sailors of British Naval ship {{ship|HMS|Calcutta|D82|6}}. The unity brought upon by the strike was the first time of cooperation between the various ethnic groups of the time.{{sfn|Kiely|1996|p=67}} Historian Brinsley Samaroo says that the 1919 strikes "seem to indicate that there was a growing class consciousness after the war and this transcended racial feelings at times."{{sfn|Kiely|1996|p=67}}

However, in the 1920s, the collapse of the sugarcane industry, concomitant with the failure of the cocoa industry, resulted in widespread depression among the rural and agricultural workers in Trinidad, and encouraged the rise of a labour movement. Conditions on the islands worsened in the 1930s with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], with an outbreak of [[British West  labour unrest of 1934–39|labour riots]] occurring in 1937 which resulted in several deaths.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=185}} The labour movement aimed to unite the urban working class and agricultural labour class; the key figures being [[Arthur Andrew Cipriani|Arthur Cipriani]], who led the [[Trinidad Labour Party]] (TLP), [[Tubal Uriah Butler|Tubal Uriah "Buzz" Butler]] of the [[Butler Party|British Empire Citizens' and Workers' Home Rule Party]], and [[Adrian Cola Rienzi]], who led the Trinidad Citizens League (TCL), [[Oilfields Workers' Trade Union]], and [[All Trinidad Sugar Estates and Factory Workers Union]].{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=185}} As the movement developed calls for greater autonomy from British colonial rule became widespread; this effort was severely undermined by the British Home Office and by the British-educated  elite, many of whom were descended from the plantocracy class.

Petroleum had been discovered in 1857, but became economically significant only in the 1930s and afterwards as a result of the collapse of sugarcane and cocoa, and increasing industrialization. By the 1950s petroleum had become a staple in Trinidad's export market, and was responsible for a growing middle class among all sections of the Trinidad population. The collapse of Trinidad's major agricultural commodities, followed by the Depression, and the rise of the oil economy, led to major changes in the country's social structure.

The presence of  [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement|military bases]] in Chaguaramas and [[Cumuto]] in Trinidad during [[World War II]] had a profound effect on society. The Americans vastly improved the infrastructure on Trinidad and provided many locals with well-paying jobs. The Americans left in 1961.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=96}}

In the post-war period the British began a process of decolonisation across the British Empire. In 1945 universal suffrage was introduced to .{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=255}} Political parties emerged on the island, however these were largely divided along racial lines: Afro–Trinidadians and Tobagonians primarily supported the [[People's National Movement]] (PNM), formed in 1956 by [[Eric Williams]], with Indo-Trinidadians and Tobagonians mostly supporting the [[People's Democratic Party ()|People's Democratic Party]] (PDP), formed in 1953 by [[Bhadase Sagan Maraj]], which later merged into the [[Democratic Labour Party ()|Democratic Labour Party]] (DLP) in 1957.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=256}} Britain's Caribbean colonies formed the [[West Indies Federation]] in 1958 as a vehicle for independence, however the Federation dissolved after  withdrew following a [[ Federation of the West Indies membership referendum, 1961|membership referendum]] in 1961. The government of  subsequently chose to seek independence from the  on its own.

 gained its [[ Independence Act 1962|independence]] from the [[]] on 31 August 1962. However, [[Elizabeth II]] remained head of state, represented locally by [[List of heads of state of #Governor-General|Governor-General]] [[Solomon Hochoy]], until the passage of the 1976 Republican Constitution.

[[Eric Williams]] of the [[People's National Movement]] became the first [[List of Prime Ministers of |prime minister]], serving in that capacity uninterrupted until 1981. The dominant figure in the opposition in the early independence years was [[Leader of the Opposition ()|Opposition leader]] [[Rudranath Capildeo]] of the [[Democratic Labour Party ()|Democratic Labour Party]]. The first [[List of speakers of the House of Representatives of |speaker of the House of Representatives]] was [[Clytus Arnold Thomasos]] and the first [[President of the Senate of |president of the Senate]] was J. Hamilton Maurice. The 1960s saw the rise of a [[Black Power Revolution|Black Power movement]], inspired in part by the [[civil rights movement]] in the . Protests and strikes became common, with events coming to head in April 1970 when police shot dead a protester named Basil Davis.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=256}} Fearing a breakdown of law and order, Prime Minister Williams declared a state of emergency and ordered that many of the Black Power leaders be arrested. Some army leaders who were sympathetic to the Black Power movement, notably [[Raffique Shah]] and [[Rex Lassalle]], attempted to mutiny; however, this was quashed by the [[ Coast Guard]].{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=256}} Williams and the PNM retained power, largely due to divisions in the opposition.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=256}}

Amidst the backdrop of the rising Black Power movement in 1960s , and following protests, strikes, and a mutiny attempt in April 1970, a more radical opposition emerged in the form of the [[National Union of Freedom Fighters]] (NUFF).  Dissatisfied with the perceived slow progress of change, and inspired by guerrilla warfare tactics, NUFF members launched attacks on banks, police stations, and other infrastructure, aiming to ignite a full-scale revolution against Prime Minister Eric Williams' government.  However, the group faced increasing pressure from police and security forces, leading to the deaths of many members and the eventual suppression of the insurgency by 1974.

In 1963 Tobago was struck by [[Hurricane Flora]], which killed 30 people and resulted in enormous destruction across the island.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=236}} Partly as a result of this, tourism came to replace agriculture as the island's primary source of income in the subsequent decades.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=236}} On 1 May 1968,  joined the [[Caribbean Free Trade Association]] (CARIFTA), which provided a continued economic, rather than political, linkage between the former [[British West Indies]] [[Commonwealth Caribbean|-speaking countries]] after the [[West Indies Federation]] failed. On 1 August 1973, the country became a founding member state of CARIFTA's successor, the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), which is a [[Political union|political]] and [[economic union]] between several [[Caribbean]] countries and territories.

Between 1972 and 1983, the country profited greatly from the rising [[price of oil]] and the discovery of vast new oil deposits in its territorial waters, resulting in an economic boom that substantially increased living standards.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=256}} In 1976 the country became a republic within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], though it retained the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] as its final appellate court. The position of governor-general was replaced with that of [[President of |President]]; [[Ellis Clarke]] was the first to hold this largely ceremonial role. Tobago was granted limited self-rule with the creation of the [[Tobago House of Assembly]] in 1980.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=239}}
[[File:Port of  Trinidad.jpg|thumb|left|Port of , the capital, in 2008]]

Williams died in 1981, being replaced by [[George Chambers]] who led the country until 1986. By this time a fall in the price of oil had resulted in a recession, causing rising inflation and unemployment.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=257}} The main opposition parties united under the banner of [[National Alliance for Reconstruction]] (NAR) and won the [[1986  general election]], with NAR leader [[A. N. R. Robinson]] becoming the new prime minister.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=256}} Robinson was unable to hold together the fragile NAR coalition, and his economic reforms, such as the implementation of an [[International Monetary Fund]] [[Structural Adjustment Program]] and devaluation of currency led to social unrest. In 1990, 114 members of the [[Jamaat al Muslimeen]], led by [[Yasin Abu Bakr]] (formerly known as Lennox Phillip) stormed the [[The Red House ()|Red House]] (the seat of [[Parliament of |Parliament]]), and [[ Television]], the only television station in the country at the time, [[Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt|holding Robinson and country's government hostage]] for six days before surrendering. The coup leaders were promised amnesty, but upon their surrender they were arrested, ultimately being released after protracted legal wrangling.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=253}}
[[File:Steelpan Instruments at  Carnival.jpg|thumb|Steelpan band at Carnival]]
The PNM under [[Patrick Manning]] returned to power following the [[1991  general election]]. Hoping to capitalise on an improvement in the economy, Manning called [[1995  general election|an early election]] in 1995, however, this resulted in a [[hung parliament]]. Two NAR representatives backed the opposition [[United National Congress]] (UNC), which had split off from the NAR in 1989, and they thus took power under [[Basdeo Panday]], who became the country's first Indo- Prime Minister.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=257}} After a period of political confusion caused by a series of inconclusive election results, Patrick Manning returned to power in 2001, retaining that position until 2010.

In 2003 the country entered a second oil boom, and petroleum, petrochemicals and natural gas continue to be the backbone of the economy. Tourism and the public service are the mainstay of the economy of Tobago, though authorities have attempted to diversify the island's economy. A partnership resulted in Manning's defeat by the newly formed [[People's Partnership]] (PP) coalition in 2010, with [[Kamla Persad-Bissessar]] becoming the country's first female prime minister.{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=258}} Under the PP, a state of emergency (SOE) was declared because of a spike in killings, and curfews were declared in so called "hotspots" around the country. The SOE lasted from 21 August 2011 to 5 December  2011. However, the PP were defeated in 2015 by the PNM under [[Keith Rowley]].{{sfnp|Rough Guides|2018|p=259}} In August 2020, the governing People's National Movement won general [[2020  general election|election]], earning the incumbent prime minister Keith Rowley a second term in office. During the second term of [[Doctor (title)|Dr.]] Keith Rowley there were two declarations of states of emergency (SOE). The first, which came into effect on 15 May 2021, was to deal with the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. It involved curfews and restrictions on activities and public events. The second SOE came into effect on 30 December, 2024. The PM announced that it was to "address individuals who pose a threat to public safety, particularly those involved in criminal activities and the illegal use of firearms"''.''
