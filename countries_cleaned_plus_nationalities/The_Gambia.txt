In 1618, King [[James I of England]] granted a charter to an  company for trade with  and the [[Gold Coast ( colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[]]). Between 1651 and 1661, some parts of  – St. Andrew's Island in  River, including Fort Jakob, and St. Mary Island (modern day Banjul) and [[Fort Jillifree]] – came under the rule of the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]], a vassal state of [[- Commonwealth]] in what is now [[]], having been bought by Prince [[Jacob Kettler]]. The colonies were formally ceded to England in 1664.

Slavery was abolished in 1906 and following a brief conflict between the  colonial forces and indigenous ,  colonial authority was firmly established.

Shortly thereafter, the national government held a [[1965  republic referendum|referendum]] proposing that the country become a [[republic]]. This referendum failed to receive the two-thirds majority required to amend the constitution, but the results won widespread attention abroad as testimony to 's observance of secret balloting, honest elections, civil rights, and liberties.

On 24 April 1970,  became a [[Republic within the Commonwealth]], following a second [[1970  Republic referendum|referendum]]. Prime Minister Sir [[Dawda Kairaba Jawara]] assumed the office of [[President of |President]], an [[Executive Presidency|Executive Post]], combining the offices of [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] which he held since 1962. President Sir Dawda Jawara was re-elected five times.

[[1981  coup attempt|An attempted coup]] on 29 July 1981 followed a weakening of the economy and allegations of corruption against leading politicians. The coup attempt occurred while President Jawara was attending the Royal Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana in London and was carried out by a rogue group of leftists calling themselves the National Revolutionary Council, composed of [[Kukoi Samba Sanyang]]'s Socialist and Revolutionary Labour Party (SRLP) and elements of the Field Force, a paramilitary force which constituted the bulk of the country's armed forces.

President Jawara requested military aid from [[]], which deployed 400 troops to  on 31 July. By 6 August, some 2,700  troops had been deployed, defeating the rebel force. Between 500 and 800 people were killed during the coup and the ensuing violence.

In 1982, in the aftermath of the 1981 attempted coup,  and  signed a treaty of confederation. The [[Senegambia Confederation]] aimed to combine the armed forces of the two states and to unify their economies and currencies.  permanently withdrew from the confederation in 1989.

In the [[1992  general election|general election of April 1992]], Dawda Jawara once again won a fifth term as president of .

The Provisional Independent Electoral Commission (PIEC) was established in December 1995 to conduct national elections and it supervised a referendum on a revised Constitution, the elections for president and the National Assembly by early January 1997. In 1997 the {{Official website|url=https://iec.gm/|name=Independent Electoral Commission - IEC- }} was established to replace the PIEC, responsible for the registration of voters and for the conduct of elections and referendums.

The IEC organized the next 5-year elections for late 2001 and early 2002, and  completed a full cycle of [[ presidential election, 2001|presidential]], [[ parliamentary election, 2002|legislative]], and local elections, which foreign observers deemed free, fair, and transparent. President Yahya Jammeh, who was elected to continue in the position he had assumed during the coup, took the oath of office again on 21 December 2001. Jammeh's [[Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction]] (APRC) maintained its strong majority in the National Assembly, particularly after the main opposition [[United Democratic Party ()|United Democratic Party]] (UDP) boycotted the legislative elections.

On 2 October 2013, The  Interior Minister announced that  would leave [[Commonwealth of Nations|the Commonwealth]] with immediate effect, ending 48 years of membership of the organisation. The  government said it had "decided that  will never be a member of any Neo-Colonial institution and will never be a party to any institution that represents an extension of colonialism".

On 11 December 2015, President Jammeh (without any legal authority) unilaterally declared  an [[Islamic Republic]], calling it a break from the country's colonial past, although the constitution remained secular.

The months leading up to the [[2016  presidential election|2016 presidential election]] were tense. The youth leader of the main opposition [[United Democratic Party ()|UDP]], Solo Sandeng, died in detention at the notorious [[State Intelligence Services ()|National Intelligence Agency]]. [[Ousainou Darboe]], the leader of the UDP, and many senior members of his party were sent to jail for demanding the release of Solo Sandeng dead or alive. President Jammeh faced opposition leaders Adama Barrow from the Independent Coalition of parties and Mamma Kandeh from  Democratic Congress party.  The high court of  sentenced main opposition leader and human rights advocate [[Ousainou Darboe]] to 3 years in prison in July 2016, disqualifying him from running in the presidential election. This gave Adama Barrow to contest under the UDP ticket.

Following the 1 December 2016 elections, the elections commission declared [[Adama Barrow]] the winner. Jammeh, who had ruled for 22 years, first announced he would step down after losing the 2016 election before declaring the results void and calling for a new vote, sparking a [[ presidential election, 2016|constitutional crisis]] and leading to an [[Invasion of |invasion]] by an [[Economic Community of West African States|ECOWAS]] coalition. On 20 January 2017, Jammeh announced that he had agreed to step down and would leave the country.

In January 2017, President Barrow removed the "Islamic" title from 's name. On 14 February 2017,  began the process of returning to its membership of the Commonwealth and formally presented its application to re-join to Secretary-General [[Patricia Scotland]] on 22 January 2018. [[Boris Johnson]], who became the first  [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|foreign secretary]] to visit  since the country gained independence in 1965, announced that the  government welcomed 's return to the Commonwealth.  officially rejoined the Commonwealth on 8 February 2018. On 28 February 2018, [[Jaha Dukureh]], a women's rights activist was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for her work in combating [[female genital mutilation]].

On 4 December 2021, Adama Barrow won re-election in the [[2021  presidential election|presidential election]]. On 20 December 2022, a supposed [[2022  coup attempt|coup attempt by the  army was foiled]], with four soldiers arrested. The  [[Gambia Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] have denied that any attempt at a coup was made. Barrow's use of foreign troops for his security and for protection of some infrastructure has hurt his popularity.
