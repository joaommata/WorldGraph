The  archipelago has been inhabited since the time of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' or "[[Java Man]]," with fossils dating back 2 million to 500,000 BCE. Fossils of ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'', found on Flores, date around 700,000 to 60,000 BCE, while ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' arrived around 50,000 BCE. Sulawesi and Borneo are home to the world's oldest known [[cave painting]]s, dating back 40,000 to 60,000 years, and megalithic sites such as western Java's ''[[Gunung Padang]]'', Sulawesi's ''[[Lore Lindu National Park|Lore Lindu]]'', as well as Sumatra's Nias and Sumba reflect early human settlements and ceremonial practices.

Around 2,000 BCE, [[Austronesian peoples]] began arriving in Southeast Asia from the island of [[Taiwan]], gradually displacing native [[Melanesians]] to the far eastern part of the archipelago as they spread east,{{sfn|Taylor|2003|pp=5–7}} and would eventually form the majority of 's modern population. Favourable agricultural conditions and advancements like [[Paddy field|wet-field rice cultivation]] by the 8th century BCE{{sfn|Taylor|2003|pp=8–9}} enabled the growth of villages and kingdoms by the first century CE. The archipelago's strategic location fostered inter-island and international exchange with civilisations from the  subcontinent and mainland , profoundly influencing  history and culture through trade.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|pp=3, 9–11, 13–15, 18–20, 22–23}}{{sfn|Vickers|2005|pp=18–20, 60, 133–134}}{{sfn|Taylor|2003|pp=15–18}}

By the 7th century CE, the [[Srivijaya]] naval kingdom thrived on trade, adopting Hindu and Buddhist influences. The 8th to 10th centuries saw the rise and decline of the Buddhist [[Sailendra]] and Hindu [[Mataram Kingdom|Mataram]] dynasties, leaving monumental legacies like the [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]] temples. After the failed [[Mongol invasion of Java]] in the late 13th century, the Hindu [[Majapahit]] kingdom rose to dominate much of the archipelago under [[Gajah Mada]]'s leadership—a period often called the "Golden Age" of  history. Islam [[Spread of Islam in |arrived]] in the 13th century in northern Sumatra,{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=3–14}} and following gradual adoption in other islands, it became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the 16th century, blending with pre-existing traditions to form a distinct Islamic culture, particularly in Java.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=12–14}}

In 1512, Europeans began arriving in the archipelago, led by  traders under [[Francisco Serrão]], to [[ Empire in the  Archipelago|seek a monopoly]] of the lucrative [[spice trade]] in the [[Maluku Islands]].{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=22–24}}  and  traders soon followed, with the former establishing the [[ East  Company]] (''Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', VOC) in 1602, which eventually became the dominant European power for almost two centuries. After the VOC's dissolution in 1799 during the [[ Revolutionary Wars]], the [[ East Indies]] was established as a nationalised colony,{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=24}} marking the beginning of formal colonial rule by the [[Batavian Republic|]].

Over the next century and a half,  control over the archipelago was tenuous, as they faced continuous rebellions from local leaders like Prince [[Diponegoro]] in central Java, [[Imam Bonjol]] in central Sumatra, [[Pattimura]] in Maluku, and [[Aceh War|fighters in Aceh]].{{sfn|Schwarz|1994|pp=3–4}}{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=142}}{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=21}}  dominance only extended to 's modern boundaries in the early 20th century,{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=21}}{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=61–147}}{{sfn|Taylor|2003|pp=209–278}}{{sfn|Vickers|2005|pp=10–14}} with the establishment of  posts in [[New ]].

During [[World War II]], the [[ East Indies campaign| invasion]] and [[ occupation of the  East Indies|occupation of the Indies]] ended  rule and encouraged 's independence movement. Only two days after [[Surrender of |'s surrender]] in August 1945, [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta]] issued the [[Proclamation of  Independence]], and they became the country's first president and vice-president, along with [[Sutan Sjahrir]] as Prime Minister.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=325}}{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=325}} The  attempted to re-establish their rule, prompting the start of [[ National Revolution|'s war of independence against the ]]. The conflict lasted until 1949, when the  recognised  independence in the [[– Round Table Conference]] following international pressure.{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=35}} Despite political, social, and sectarian divisions,  found unity in their fight for independence.{{sfn|Friend|2003|pp=21, 23}}{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=211–213}}

Sukarno shifted  from [[Liberal democracy period in |democracy]] to [[Guided Democracy in |authoritarianism]] and maintained power by balancing the opposing forces of political Islam, [[ National Armed Forces|the military]], and the [[Communist Party of ]] (PKI).{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=237–280}} Tensions between the latter two culminated in [[30 September Movement|an attempted coup]] in 1965, leading to a [[ mass killings of 1965–66|violent anti-communist purge]] led by the Army's Major General [[Suharto]] that killed at least 500,000 people and imprisoned around a million more.{{sfn|Melvin|2018|p=1}}{{sfn|Robinson|2018|p=3}}{{sfn|Bevins|2020|pp=168, 185}} The PKI was blamed for the coup and destroyed,{{sfn|Friend|2003|pp=107–109}}{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=280–283, 284, 287–290}} weakening Sukarno's power.

In 1975, 's [[ invasion of East Timor|invasion]] and subsequent [[ occupation of East Timor|occupation]] of former  colony [[Democratic Republic of East Timor (1975)|East Timor]] drew international condemnation.  was the country worst affected by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], which brought out [[May 1998 riots of #Background|widespread discontent]] with the New Order's corruption and political suppression and ultimately [[Fall of Suharto|ended Suharto's rule]].{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p={{page needed|date=October 2020}}}}{{sfn|Vickers|2005|p={{page needed|date=October 2020}}}}{{sfn|Schwarz|1994|p={{page needed|date=October 2020}}}} In 1999, East Timor [[1999  independence referendum|seceded]] after a 24-year military occupation that some scholars classified as [[East Timor genocide|genocide]].

In the [[Post-Suharto era in |post-Suharto era since 1998]], the country has strengthened its democracy by granting regional autonomy and holding the [[2004  presidential election|first direct presidential election in 2004]]. Political, economic and social instability and [[Terrorism in |terrorism]] were persistent in the 2000s. The economy has performed strongly since 2007, although [[Corruption in |corruption]] remains a chronic issue. Relations among the diverse population are mostly harmonious, but sectarian discontent and violence remain problematic in some areas. A political settlement to a separatist [[insurgency in Aceh]] was achieved in 2005.
