The [[Northern Mariana Islands]] were the first islands in [[Oceania]] colonized by the [[Austronesian peoples]]. They were settled by the voyagers who sailed eastwards from the [[]] in approximately 1500 BCE. These populations gradually moved southwards until they reached the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] and the [[]] by 1300 BCE and reconnected with the [[Lapita culture]] of the southeast migration branch of Austronesians moving through coastal [[New ]] and [[Island Melanesia]]. By 1200 BCE, they again began crossing open seas beyond inter-island visibility, reaching [[]], [[]], and [[New Caledonia]]; before continuing eastwards to become the ancestors of the [[Polynesian people]].

Further migrations by other Austronesians also followed, likely from [[Sulawesi]], settling [[]] and [[Yap]] by around 1000 BCE. The details of this colonization, however, are not very well known.{{sfn|Morgan|1988|p=30}} In 200 BCE, a loosely connected group of Lapita colonists from [[Island Melanesia]] also migrated back northwards, settling the islands of eastern  almost simultaneously. This region became the center of another wave of migrations radiating outwards, reconnecting them with other settled islands in western .

Around 800 CE, a second wave of migrants from Southeast Asia arrived in the Marianas, beginning what is now known as the [[Latte period]]. These new settlers built large structures with distinctive capped stone pillars known as ''haligi''. They also reintroduced [[rice]] (which did not survive earlier voyages), making the Northern Marianas the only islands in [[Oceania]] where rice was grown prior to European contact. However, it was considered a high-status crop and only used in rituals. It did not become a staple until after [[ East Indies| colonization]].

Construction of [[Nan Madol]], a [[megalith]]ic complex made from [[Columnar basalt|basalt lava logs]] in Pohnpei, began in around 1180 CE. This was followed by the construction of the [[Leluh archaeological site|Leluh complex]] in [[Kosrae]] in around 1200.

===Early European contact===

The earliest known contact with Europeans occurred in 1521, when a  expedition under [[Ferdinand Magellan]] reached the Marianas. This contact is recorded in [[Antonio Pigafetta]]'s chronicle of Magellan's voyage, in which he recounts that the Chamorro people had no apparent knowledge of people outside of their island group. A  account of the same voyage suggests that the Chamorro people who greeted the travellers did so "without any shyness as if they were good acquaintances".{{sfn|Rainbird|2004|p=13–14}}

Further contact was made during the sixteenth century, although often initial encounters were very brief. Documents relating to the 1525 voyage of [[Diogo da Rocha]] suggest that he made the first European contact with inhabitants of the Caroline Islands, possibly staying on the [[Ulithi]] atoll for four months and encountering [[Yap]]. Marshall Islanders were encountered by the expedition of  navigator [[Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón]] in 1529. Other contact with the Yap islands occurred in 1625.{{sfn|Rainbird|2004|p=14}}

===Colonisation and conversion===

In the early 17th century [[]] colonized [[Guam]], the [[Northern Marianas]] and the [[Caroline Islands]] (what would later become the Federated States of  and the Republic of ), creating the [[ East Indies]], which was governed from the [[ ]].

When  explorer [[Otto von Kotzebue]] visited the [[]] in 1817, he noted that  families practiced [[infanticide]] after the birth of a third child as a form of population planning due to frequent [[famine]]s.

In 1819, the [[ Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]]—a Protestant group—brought their Puritan ways to Polynesia. Soon after, the Hawaiian Missionary Society was founded and sent missionaries into . Conversion was not met with as much opposition, as the local religions were less developed (at least according to Western ethnographic accounts). In contrast, it took until the end of the 19th to the beginning of the 20th centuries for missionaries to fully convert the inhabitants of Melanesia; however, a comparison of the cultural contrast must take into account the fact that Melanesia has always had deadly strains of [[malaria]] present in various degrees and distributions throughout its history (see [[De Rays Expedition]]) and up to the present; conversely,  does not have—and never seems to have had—any malarial mosquitos nor pathogens on any of its islands in the past.

===– Treaty of 1899===
{{main|– Treaty (1899)}}
[[File: new  1888 1899.png|thumb|[[ New ]] before and after the - treaty of 1899]]
In the [[– War]],  lost many of its remaining colonies. In the Pacific, the  took possession of the [[ ]] and Guam. On 17 January 1899, the  also took possession of unclaimed and uninhabited Wake Island. This left  with the remainder of the  East Indies, about 6,000 tiny islands that were sparsely populated and not very productive. These islands were ungovernable after the loss of the administrative center of Manila and indefensible after the loss of two  fleets in the war. The  government therefore decided to sell the remaining islands to a new colonial power: the [[ Empire]].

The treaty, which was signed by  Prime Minister [[Francisco Silvela]] on 12 February 1899, transferred the Caroline Islands (Kosrae in the east to  in the west), the Mariana Islands, and other possessions to . Under  control, the islands became a protectorate and were administered from [[ New ]].  had already been annexed and claimed as a colony by  in 1888.

===20th century===

In the early 20th century, the islands of  were divided between three foreign powers:
* the [[]], which took control of Guam following the – War of 1898 and claimed [[Wake Island]];
* [[ Empire|]], which took  and bought the Marshall, Caroline and Northern Mariana Islands from ; and
* the [[British Empire]], which took the [[Gilbert Islands]] ().

During [[World War I]], 's Pacific island territories were seized and became [[League of Nations mandate]]s in 1923.  became an [[]]n mandate, while 's other territories in  were given as a mandate to [[]] and were named the [[South Seas Mandate]]. During [[World War&nbsp;II]],  and [[Banaba|Ocean Island]] were occupied by [[Empire of |]] troops, with also an [[ occupation of the Gilbert Islands|occupation of some of the Gilbert Islands]] and were bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific. Following 's defeat in [[World War II]] its mandate became a [[United Nations Trusteeship]] administered by the  as the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]].  became independent in 1968.

===21st century===
Today, most of  are independent states, except for the [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|U.S. Commonwealth of the]] [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Guam]] and [[Wake Island]], which are U.S. territories.
