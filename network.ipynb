On 22 September 1992, [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 47/1|United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/47/1]] was adopted, by which it considered that \"the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations,\" and therefore decided that \"the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should apply for membership in the United Nations and that it shall not participate in the work of the General Assembly\".

During the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]], and in response to the election of [[Malaysia]] as a [[List of members of the United Nations Security Council|non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council]], in a letter dated 20 January 1965, [[Indonesia]] informed the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] that it had decided \"at this stage and under the present circumstances\" to withdraw from the UN. However, following the overthrow of [[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Sukarno]], in a telegram dated 19 September 1966, Indonesia notified the Secretary-General of its decision \"to resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities starting with the twenty-first session of the General Assembly\".
