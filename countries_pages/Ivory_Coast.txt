===Land migration===

The first human presence in Ivory Coast has been difficult to determine because human remains have not been well preserved in the country's humid climate. However, newly found weapon and tool fragments (specifically, polished axes cut through [[shale]] and remnants of cooking and fishing) have been interpreted as a possible indication of a large human presence during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period (15,000 to 10,000 BC), or at the minimum, the [[Neolithic]] period.

The earliest known inhabitants of Ivory Coast have left traces scattered throughout the territory. Historians believe that they were all either displaced or absorbed by the ancestors of the present indigenous inhabitants, who migrated south into the area before the 16th century. Such groups included the Ehotilé ([[Aboisso]]), Kotrowou (Fresco), Zéhiri ([[Grand-Lahou]]), Ega and Diès ([[Divo, Ivory Coast|Divo]]).

===Pre-Islamic and Islamic periods===
The first recorded history appears in the chronicles of North African ([[Berbers|Berber]]) traders, who, from early [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]], conducted a [[caravan (travellers)|caravan]] trade across the [[Sahara]] in salt, slaves, gold, and other goods. The southern termini of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes were located on the edge of the desert, and from there supplemental trade extended as far south as the edge of the rainforest. The most important terminals—[[Djenné]], [[Gao]], and [[Timbuktu|Timbuctu]]—grew into major commercial centres around which the great Sudanic empires developed.

By controlling the trade routes with their powerful military forces, these empires were able to dominate neighbouring states. The Sudanic empires also became centres of [[Islamic studies|Islamic education]]. Islam had been introduced in the [[Sudan (region)|western Sudan]] by Muslim Berbers; it spread rapidly after the conversion of many important rulers. From the 11th century, by which time the rulers of the Sudanic empires had embraced Islam, it spread south into the northern areas of contemporary Ivory Coast.

The [[Ghana Empire]], the earliest of the Sudanic empires, flourished in the region encompassing present-day southeast [[Mauritania]] and southern [[Mali]] between the 4th and 13th centuries. At the peak of its power in the 11th century, its realms extended from the Atlantic Ocean to Timbuktu. After the decline of Ghana, the [[Mali Empire]] grew into a powerful Muslim state, which reached its apogee in the early part of the 14th century. The territory of the Mali Empire in Ivory Coast was limited to the northwest corner around [[Odienné]].

Its slow decline starting at the end of the 14th century followed internal discord and revolts by vassal states, one of which, [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]], flourished as an empire between the 14th and 16th centuries. Songhai was also weakened by internal discord, which led to factional warfare. This discord spurred most of the migrations southward toward the forest belt. The dense rainforest covering the southern half of the country created barriers to the large-scale political organisations that had arisen in the north. Inhabitants lived in villages or clusters of villages; their contacts with the outside world were filtered through long-distance traders. Villagers [[subsistence agriculture|subsisted on agriculture]] and hunting.

===Pre-European modern period===
[[File:Royaumes ci.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Pre-European kingdoms]]
Five important states flourished in Ivory Coast during the pre-European [[early modern period]]. The Muslim [[Kong Empire]] was established by the [[Dyula people|Dyula]] in the early 18th century in the north-central region inhabited by the [[Senufo people|Sénoufo]], who had fled [[Islamization|Islamisation]] under the Mali Empire. Although Kong became a prosperous centre of agriculture, trade, and crafts, ethnic diversity and religious discord gradually weakened the kingdom. In 1895 the city of Kong was sacked and conquered by [[Samori Ture]] of the [[Wassoulou Empire]].

The [[Abron tribe|Abron]] kingdom of [[Gyaman|Gyaaman]] was established in the 17th century by an Akan group, the Abron, who had fled the developing [[Asante people|Ashanti]] confederation of Asanteman in what is present-day Ghana. From their settlement south of [[Bondoukou]], the Abron gradually extended their hegemony over the [[Dyula people]] in Bondoukou, who were recent arrivals from the market city of [[Begho]]. Bondoukou developed into a major centre of commerce and Islam. The kingdom's [[Quran]]ic scholars attracted students from all parts of West Africa. In the mid-17th century in east-central Ivory Coast, other Akan groups fleeing the Asante established a [[Baoulé people|Baoulé]] kingdom at [[Sakassou|Sakasso]] and two [[Anyi people|Agni]] kingdoms, Indénié and [[Kingdom of Sanwi|Sanwi]].

The Baoulé, like the Ashanti, developed a highly centralised political and administrative structure under three successive rulers. It finally split into smaller chiefdoms. Despite the breakup of their kingdom, the Baoulé strongly resisted French subjugation. The descendants of the rulers of the Agni kingdoms tried to retain their separate identity long after Ivory Coast's independence; as late as 1969, the Sanwi attempted to break away from Ivory Coast and form an independent kingdom.

===Establishment of French rule===
Compared to neighbouring Ghana, Ivory Coast, though practising slavery and slave raiding, suffered little from the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]]. European slave and merchant ships preferred other areas along the coast. The earliest recorded European voyage to West Africa was made by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in 1482.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}} The first West African French settlement, [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], was founded in the mid-17th century in Senegal, while at about the same time, the Dutch ceded to the French a settlement at [[Gorée|Gorée Island]], off [[Dakar]]. A French [[Mission (station)|mission]] was established in 1687 at [[Assinie-Mafia|Assinie]] near the border with the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now Ghana). The Europeans suppressed the local practice of slavery at this time and forbade the trade to their merchants.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Assinie's survival was precarious, however; the French were not firmly established in Ivory Coast until the mid-19th century. In 1843–44, French Admiral [[Édouard Bouët-Willaumez|Louis Édouard Bouët-Willaumez]] signed treaties with the kings of the [[Grand-Bassam]] and Assinie regions, making their territories a French protectorate. French explorers, missionaries, trading companies, and soldiers gradually extended the area under French control inland from the lagoon region. Pacification was not accomplished until 1915.

Activity along the coast stimulated European interest in the interior, especially along the two great rivers, the [[Senegal River|Senegal]] and the [[Niger River|Niger]]. Concerted French exploration of West Africa began in the mid-19th century but moved slowly, based more on individual initiative than on government policy. In the 1840s, the French concluded a series of treaties with local West African chiefs that enabled the French to build fortified posts along the Gulf of Guinea to serve as permanent trading centres. The first posts in Ivory Coast included one at Assinie and another at Grand-Bassam, which became the colony's first capital. The treaties provided for French sovereignty within the posts and for trading privileges in exchange for fees or ''[[coutume]]s'' paid annually to the local chiefs for the use of the land. The arrangement was not entirely satisfactory to the French, because trade was limited and misunderstandings over treaty obligations often arose. Nevertheless, the French government maintained the treaties, hoping to expand trade. France also wanted to maintain a presence in the region to stem the increasing influence of the British along the Gulf of Guinea coast.
[[File:Aouabou-Traité-1892.jpg|thumb|[[Louis-Gustave Binger]] of French West Africa in 1892 treaty signing with [[Famienkro]] leaders, in present-day N'zi-Comoé Region, Ivory Coast]]
The defeat of France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871 and the subsequent annexation by Germany of the French province of [[Alsace–Lorraine]] initially caused the French government to abandon its colonial ambitions and withdraw its military garrisons from its West African trading posts, leaving them in the care of resident merchants. The trading post at Grand-Bassam was left in the care of a shipper from [[Marseille]], [[Arthur Verdier]], who in 1878 was named [[Resident minister|Resident]] of the Establishment of Ivory Coast.

In 1886, to support its claims of effective occupation, France again assumed direct control of its West African coastal trading posts and embarked on an accelerated program of exploration in the interior. In 1887, Lieutenant [[Louis-Gustave Binger]] began a two-year journey that traversed parts of Ivory Coast's interior. By the end of the journey, he had concluded four treaties establishing French protectorates in Ivory Coast. Also in 1887, Verdier's agent, [[Marcel Treich-Laplène]], negotiated five additional agreements that extended French influence from the headwaters of the Niger River Basin through Ivory Coast.

===French colonial era===
[[File:Arrivée à Kong-1892.jpg|thumb|Arrival in [[Kong, Côte d'Ivoire|Kong]] of [[Louis-Gustave Binger]] in 1892]]
By the end of the 1880s, France had established control over the coastal regions, and in 1889 Britain recognised French sovereignty in the area. That same year, France named Treich-Laplène the titular governor of the territory. In 1893, Ivory Coast became a French colony, with its capital in Grand-Bassam, and Captain Binger was appointed governor. Agreements with Liberia in 1892 and with Britain in 1893 determined the eastern and western boundaries of the colony, but the northern boundary was not fixed until 1947 because of efforts by the French government to attach parts of Upper Volta (present-day [[Burkina Faso]]) and [[French Sudan]] (present-day Mali) to Ivory Coast for economic and administrative reasons.

France's main goal was to stimulate the production of exports. Coffee, cocoa, and palm oil crops were soon planted along the coast. Ivory Coast stood out as the only West African country with a sizeable population of European settlers; elsewhere in West and Central Africa, Europeans who emigrated to the colonies were largely bureaucrats. As a result, French citizens owned one-third of the cocoa, coffee, and banana [[plantation]]s and adopted the local forced-labour system.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

[[File:French West Africa 1913 map.png|thumb|left|Colonies of [[French West Africa]] {{Circa|1913}}]]
Throughout the early years of French rule, French military contingents were sent inland to establish new posts. The African population resisted French penetration and settlement, even in areas where treaties of protection had been in force. Among those offering the greatest resistance was [[Samori Ture]], who in the 1880s and 1890s was establishing the [[Wassoulou Empire]], which extended over large parts of present-day Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Ivory Coast. Ture's large, well-equipped army, which could manufacture and repair its own firearms, attracted strong support throughout the region. The French responded to Ture's expansion and conquest with military pressure. French campaigns against Ture, which were met with fierce resistance, intensified in the mid-1890s until he was captured in 1898 and his empire dissolved.

France's imposition of a [[Poll tax|head tax]] in 1900 to support the colony's [[public works]] program provoked protests. Many Ivorians saw the tax as a violation of the protectorate treaties because they felt that France was demanding the equivalent of a ''coutume'' from the local kings, rather than the reverse. Many, especially in the interior, also considered the tax a humiliating symbol of submission. In 1905, the French officially abolished [[Slavery in Africa|slavery]] in most of French West Africa. From 1904 to 1958, Ivory Coast was part of the Federation of [[French West Africa]]. It was a colony and an overseas territory under the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. In [[World War I]], France organized regiments from Ivory Coast to fight in France, and colony resources were rationed from 1917 to 1919.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}} Until the period following [[World War II]], governmental affairs in French West Africa were administered from Paris. France's policy in West Africa was reflected mainly in its philosophy of "association", meaning that all Africans in Ivory Coast were officially French "subjects" but without rights to representation in Africa or France.

[[French colonial empires#Second French colonial empire|French colonial policy]] incorporated concepts of [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and association. Based on the assumed superiority of French culture, in practice the assimilation policy meant the extension of the French language, institutions, laws, and customs to the colonies. The policy of association also affirmed the superiority of the French in the colonies, but it entailed different institutions and systems of laws for the coloniser and the colonised. Under this policy, the Africans in Ivory Coast were allowed to preserve their own customs insofar as they were compatible with French interests.

An indigenous elite trained in French administrative practice formed an intermediary group between French and Africans. After 1930, a small number of Westernized Ivorians were granted the right to apply for French citizenship. Most Ivorians, however, were classified as French subjects and were governed under the principle of association. As subjects of France, natives outside the civilised elite had no political rights. They were drafted for work in mines, on plantations, as porters, and on public projects as part of their tax responsibility. They were expected to serve in the military and were subject to the ''[[indigénat]]'', a separate system of law.

During World War II, the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] remained in control until 1943, when members of General [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s provisional government assumed control of all French West Africa. The [[Brazzaville Conference]] of 1944, the first Constituent Assembly of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in 1946, and France's gratitude for African loyalty during World War II, led to far-reaching governmental reforms in 1946. French citizenship was granted to all African "subjects", the right to organise politically was recognised, and various forms of forced labour were abolished. Between 1944 and 1946, many national conferences and constituent assemblies took place between France's government and provisional governments in Ivory Coast.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}} Governmental reforms were established by late 1946, which granted French citizenship to all African "subjects" under the colonial control of the French.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Until 1958, governors appointed in Paris administered the colony of Ivory Coast, using a system of direct, centralised administration that left little room for Ivorian participation in policy-making. The French colonial administration also adopted divide-and-rule policies, applying ideas of assimilation only to the educated elite. The French were also interested in ensuring that the small but influential Ivorian elite was sufficiently satisfied with the ''status quo'' to refrain from developing [[anti-French sentiment]]s and calls for independence. Although strongly opposed to the practices of association, educated Ivorians believed that they would achieve equality in the French colonial system through assimilation rather than through complete independence from France. After the assimilation doctrine was implemented through the postwar reforms, though, Ivorian leaders realised that even assimilation implied the superiority of the French over the Ivorians and that discrimination and inequality would end only with independence.

===Independence===
[[File:Houphouet-Boigny Kennedy.jpg|thumb|President [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] and First Lady [[Marie-Thérèse Houphouët-Boigny]] in the [[White House]] [[Entrance Hall]] with President [[John F. Kennedy]] and First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] in 1962]]
[[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]], the son of a [[Baoulé people|Baoulé chief]], became Ivory Coast's father of independence. In 1944, he formed the country's first agricultural trade union for African cocoa farmers like himself. Angered that colonial policy favoured French plantation owners, the union members united to recruit migrant workers for their own farms. Houphouët-Boigny soon rose to prominence and was elected to the French Parliament in Paris within a year. A year later, the French abolished [[forced labour]]. Houphouët-Boigny established a strong relationship with the French government, expressing a belief that Ivory Coast would benefit from the relationship, which it did for many years. France appointed him as a minister, the first African to become a minister in a European government.

A turning point in relations with France was reached with the 1956 Overseas Reform Act (''[[Loi-cadre Defferre|Loi Cadre]]''), which transferred several powers from Paris to elected territorial governments in French West Africa and also removed the remaining voting inequities. On 4 December 1958, Ivory Coast became an autonomous member of the French Community, which had replaced the [[French Union]].

By 1960, the country was easily French West Africa's most prosperous, contributing over 40% of the region's total exports. When Houphouët-Boigny became the first president, his government gave farmers good prices for their products to further stimulate production, which was further boosted by a significant immigration of workers from surrounding countries. Coffee production increased significantly, catapulting Ivory Coast into third place in world output, behind Brazil and Colombia. By 1979, the country was the world's leading producer of cocoa. It also became Africa's leading exporter of pineapples and palm oil. French technicians contributed to the "Ivorian miracle". In other African nations, the people drove out the Europeans following independence, but in Ivory Coast, they poured in. The French community grew from only 30,000 before independence to 60,000 in 1980, most of them teachers, managers, and advisors. For 20 years, the economy maintained an annual growth rate of nearly 10%—the highest of Africa's non-oil-exporting countries.

===Houphouët-Boigny administration===
Houphouët-Boigny's one-party rule was not amenable to political competition. [[Laurent Gbagbo]], (who eventually became the president of Ivory Coast in 2000) had to flee the country in the 1980s after he incurred the ire of Houphouët-Boigny by founding the [[Ivorian Popular Front]]. Houphouët-Boigny banked on his broad appeal to the population, who continued to elect him. He was criticised for his emphasis on developing large-scale projects.

Many felt the millions of dollars spent transforming his home village, [[Yamoussoukro]], into the new political capital were wasted; others supported his vision to develop a centre for peace, education, and religion in the heart of the country. In the early 1980s, the world recession and a local drought sent shock waves through the Ivorian economy. The overcutting of timber and collapsing sugar prices caused the country's external debt to increase three-fold. Crime rose dramatically in [[Abidjan]] as an influx of villagers exacerbated unemployment caused by the recession. In 1990, hundreds of civil servants went on strike, joined by students protesting [[institutional corruption]]. The unrest forced the government to support multi-party democracy. Houphouët-Boigny became increasingly feeble and died in 1993. He favoured [[Henri Konan Bédié]] as his successor.

===Bédié administration===
In October 1995, Bédié overwhelmingly won re-election against a fragmented and disorganised opposition. He tightened his hold over political life, jailing several hundred opposition supporters. In contrast, the economic outlook improved, at least superficially, with decreasing inflation and an attempt to remove foreign debt. Unlike Houphouët-Boigny, who was very careful to avoid any ethnic conflict and left access to administrative positions open to immigrants from neighbouring countries, Bedié emphasised the concept of ''[[Ivoirité]]'' to exclude his rival [[Alassane Ouattara]], who had two northern Ivorian parents, from running for the future presidential election. As people originating from foreign countries are a large part of the Ivorian population, this policy excluded many people of Ivorian nationality. The relationship between various ethnic groups became strained, resulting in two civil wars in the following decades.

Similarly, Bedié excluded many potential opponents from the army. In late 1999, a group of dissatisfied officers [[1999 Ivorian coup d'état|staged a military coup]], putting General [[Robert Guéï]] in power. Bedié fled into exile in France. The new leadership reduced crime and corruption, and the generals pressed for [[austerity]] and campaigned in the streets for a less wasteful society.

===First civil war===
{{Main|First Ivorian Civil War}}
A [[2000 Ivorian presidential election|presidential election was held in October 2000]] in which Laurent Gbagbo vied with Guéï, but it was not peaceful. The lead-up to the election was marked by military and civil unrest. Following a public uprising that resulted in around 180 deaths, Guéï was swiftly replaced by Gbagbo. Ouattara was disqualified by the country's Supreme Court because of his alleged [[Burkina Faso|Burkinabé]] nationality. The constitution did not allow noncitizens to run for the presidency. This sparked violent protests in which his supporters, mainly from the country's north, battled riot police in the capital, Yamoussoukro.

In the early hours of 19 September 2002, while Gbagbo was in Italy, an armed uprising occurred. Troops who were to be demobilised mutinied, launching attacks in several cities. The battle for the main [[gendarmerie]] barracks in Abidjan lasted until mid-morning, but by lunchtime the government forces had secured Abidjan. They had lost control of the north of the country, and rebel forces made their stronghold in the northern city of [[Bouaké]]. The rebels threatened to move on to Abidjan again, and France deployed troops from its base in the country to stop their advance. The French said they were protecting their citizens from danger, but their deployment also helped government forces. That the French were helping either side was not established as a fact, but each side accused the French of supporting the opposite side. Whether French actions improved or worsened the situation in the long term is disputed. What exactly happened that night is also disputed. [[File:059 French Foreign Legion.JPG|thumb|Armed Ivorians next to a [[French Foreign Legion]] armoured car, 2004]]The government claimed that former president Robert Guéï led a coup attempt, and state TV showed pictures of his dead body in the street; counter-claims stated that he and 15 others had been murdered at his home, and his body had been moved to the streets to incriminate him. Ouattara took refuge in the German embassy; his home had been burned down. President Gbagbo cut short his trip to Italy and on his return stated, in a television address, that some of the rebels were hiding in the shanty towns where foreign migrant workers lived. Gendarmes and vigilantes bulldozed and burned homes by the thousands, attacking residents. An early ceasefire with the rebels, which had the backing of much of the northern populace, proved short-lived and fighting over the prime cocoa-growing areas resumed. France sent in troops to maintain the cease-fire boundaries, and militias, including warlords and fighters from [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]], took advantage of the crisis to seize parts of the west.

In January 2003, Gbagbo and rebel leaders signed accords creating a "government of national unity". Curfews were lifted, and French troops patrolled the country's western border. The unity government was unstable, and central problems remained with neither side achieving its goals. In March 2004, 120 people were killed at an opposition rally, and subsequent mob violence led to the evacuation of foreign nationals. A report concluded the killings were planned. Though UN peacekeepers were deployed to maintain a "Zone of Confidence", relations between Gbagbo and the opposition continued to deteriorate.

Early in November 2004, after the peace agreement had effectively collapsed because the rebels refused to disarm, Gbagbo ordered airstrikes against the rebels. During [[2004 French–Ivorian clashes|one of these airstrikes]] in Bouaké, on 6 November 2004, French soldiers were hit, and nine were killed; the Ivorian government said it was a mistake, but the French claimed it was deliberate. They responded by destroying most Ivorian military aircraft (two Su-25 planes and five helicopters), and violent retaliatory riots against the French broke out in Abidjan.

Gbagbo's original term as president expired on 30 October 2005, but a peaceful election was deemed impossible, so his term in office was extended for a maximum of one year, according to a plan worked out by the [[African Union]] and endorsed by the [[United Nations Security Council]]. With the late-October deadline approaching in 2006, the election was regarded as very unlikely to be held by that point, and the opposition and the rebels rejected the possibility of another term extension for Gbagbo. The UN Security Council endorsed another one-year extension of Gbagbo's term on 1 November 2006; however, the resolution provided for strengthening of Prime Minister [[Charles Konan Banny]]'s powers. Gbagbo said the next day that elements of the resolution deemed to be constitutional violations would not be applied.

A peace accord between the government and the rebels, or [[Forces Nouvelles de Côte d'Ivoire|New Forces]], was signed on 4 March 2007, and subsequently [[Guillaume Soro]], leader of the New Forces, became prime minister. These events were seen by some observers as substantially strengthening Gbagbo's position. According to UNICEF, at the end of the civil war, water and sanitation infrastructure had been greatly damaged. Communities across the country required repairs to their water supply.

===Second civil war===

The presidential elections that should have been organised in 2005 were postponed until November 2010. The preliminary results showed a loss for Gbagbo in favour of former Prime Minister Ouattara. The ruling FPI contested the results before the [[Constitutional Council (Ivory Coast)|Constitutional Council]], charging massive fraud in the northern departments controlled by the rebels of the New Forces. These charges were contradicted by United Nations observers (unlike African Union observers).{{Citation needed|date=February 2025}} The report of the results led to severe tension and violent incidents. The Constitutional Council, which consisted of Gbagbo supporters, declared the results of seven northern departments unlawful and that Gbagbo had won the elections with 51% of the vote – instead of Ouattara winning with 54%, as reported by the Electoral Commission. After the inauguration of Gbagbo, Ouattara—who was recognised as the winner by most countries and the United Nations—organised an alternative inauguration. These events raised fears of a resurgence of the civil war; thousands of refugees fled the country. The African Union sent [[Thabo Mbeki]], former president of South Africa, to mediate the conflict. The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution recognising Ouattara as the winner of the elections, based on the position of the [[Economic Community of West African States]], which suspended Ivory Coast from all its decision-making bodies while the African Union also suspended the country's membership.

In 2010, a colonel of Ivory Coast armed forces, Nguessan Yao, was arrested in New York in a year-long [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] operation charged with procuring and illegal export of weapons and munitions: 4,000 handguns, 200,000 rounds of ammunition, and 50,000 tear-gas grenades, in violation of a UN embargo. Several other Ivory Coast officers were released because they had diplomatic passports. His accomplice, Michael Barry Shor, an international trader, was located in Virginia.[[File:Internally Displaced Persons Duekoue 2011 Cote dIvoire.jpg|thumb|A shelter for internally displaced persons during the 2011 civil war]]
The 2010 presidential election led to the [[2010–2011 Ivorian crisis]] and the Second Ivorian Civil War. International organisations reported numerous human-rights violations by both sides. In [[Duékoué]], hundreds of people were killed. In nearby [[Bloléquin]], dozens were killed. UN and French forces took military action against Gbagbo. Gbagbo was taken into custody after a raid into his residence on 11 April 2011. The country was severely damaged by the war, and it was observed that Ouattara had inherited a formidable challenge to rebuild the economy and [[Refugees from Ivory Coast|reunite Ivorians]]. Gbagbo was taken to the [[International Criminal Court]] in January 2016. He was declared acquitted by the court but given a conditional release in January 2019. Belgium has been designated as a host country.

===Ouattara administration===
Ouattara has ruled the country since 2010. President Ouattara was re-elected in the [[2015 Ivorian presidential election|2015 presidential election]]. [[2020 Ivorian presidential election|In November 2020]], he won a third term in office in elections boycotted by the opposition. His opponents argued it was illegal for Ouattara to run for a third term. Ivory Coast's Constitutional Council formally ratified President Ouattara's re-election to a third term in November 2020.

In December 2022, Ivory Coast's electric production company, {{ill|Compagnie ivoirienne d'électricité|fr}} launched a commission to establish the country's first [[Boundiali Solar Power Station|solar plant]] in [[Boundiali]], with an installation of 37.5 MW, backed by a 10-MW lithium [[battery energy storage system]].

On 6 October 2023, Ouattara dissolved the government and removed Prime Minister [[Patrick Achi]] from his position.
