{{Main|Prehistory of Iran}}

The earliest known presence of hominins in Iran dates to around 800,000 [[Before Present|BP]], in the [[Middle Paleolithic]]. Many [[Middle Paleolithic]] sites have been discovered, mainly in the [[Zagros Mountains]] in western Iran and some sites associated with [[Neanderthal]]s. The [[Zarzian culture]] is documented in Iran during the [[Epipaleolithic]] (25,000–11,500 BP). Agriculture first appeared in Iran some 12,000 years ago alongside better-documented settlements in the [[Fertile Crescent]]. The [[Chogha Golan]] site featured early domestication of [[emmer]] wheat, The contemporary site of [[Ganj Dareh]] also features the earliest known domestication of [[goat]]s around 10,000 years ago.

The ancient city of [[Susa]], which would become the capital of [[Elam]] and later a capital city of the [[Achaemenid empire]], was first settled in 4400–4200 BC, adjacent to the modern site of [[Shush, Iran]].{{rp|46–47}} The [[Kura–Araxes culture]] ({{circa|3400|2000 BC}}) existed in northwestern Iran and the [[Caucasus]].

=== Antiquity ===

[[File:Choqa Zanbil Darafsh 1 (36).JPG|thumb|[[Chogha Zanbil]] is one of the few extant [[ziggurat]]s outside of [[Mesopotamia]] and considered the best-preserved example in the world.]]
Iran is home to one of the world's oldest continuous major civilizations, with historical and urban settlements dating back to 4000 BC, including the [[Jiroft culture]] in southeastern Iran. Inscriptions in the [[Proto-Elamite script]], which predates [[cuneiform]], have been found from during the early third millennium BC. The western part of the Iranian plateau participated in the traditional [[ancient Near East]] with [[Elam]] (3200–539 BC), and later with other peoples such as the [[Kassites]], [[Mannaea]]ns, and [[Gutians]]. The earliest Iranian peoples began to arrive from Central Asia in the 2nd millennium BCE.

==== Achaemenid Empire ====
{{Main|Achaemenid Empire}}

[[File:Achaemenid Empire at its greatest extent according to Oxford Atlas of World History 2002.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Achaemenid Empire]], or the First Persian Empire, at its greatest extent]]

The [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenids]] united all [[Persians|Persian]] tribes under [[Cambyses I]]. Under his son, [[Cyrus the Great]], the Achaemenids defeated the Medes and established the [[Achaemenid Empire]],{{Sfn|Middleton|2015|p=148}} the largest-ever Iranian state.{{Sfn|Shenkar|2014|p=5}} Cyrus conquered the [[Lydia]]n and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] empires, creating an empire far larger than Assyria. His son, [[Cambyses II]] ({{Reign}}530–522 BC), conquered the last major power of the region, [[ancient Egypt]], causing the collapse of its [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|twenty-sixth dynasty]].

After the death of Cambyses II, [[Darius the Great]] ({{Reign}}522–486) ascended the throne by overthrowing the Achaemenid monarch [[Bardiya]]. Darius' first capital was at Susa, and he started the building program at [[Persepolis]]. He improved the extensive road system, and during his reign the first recorded mentions are made of the [[Royal Road]], a highway from Susa to [[Sardis]].

In 499 BC, [[Classical Athens|Athens]] supported a revolt in [[Miletus]], resulting in the sacking of Sardis. This led to the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], which lasted the first half of the 5th century BC. In the [[First Persian invasion of Greece]], Persian general [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] re-subjugated Thrace and made Macedon a full part of Persia.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|p=345}} Darius' successor [[Xerxes I]] ({{Reign}}486–465) launched the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]]. At a crucial moment in the war, about half of mainland Greece was overrun by the Persians, including territories to the north of the Isthmus of [[Corinth]].{{Sfn|Aeschylus|2009|p=18}} This was reversed by a Greek victory following the battles of [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]] and [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], during which Persia lost its footholds in Europe, and withdrew from it.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|pp=135–138, 342–345}}

The empire entered a period of decline. From 334 BC to 331 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] defeated [[Darius III]] ({{Reign}}336–330 BC) in the battles of [[Battle of the Granicus|Granicus]], [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] and [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]], swiftly conquering the Achaemanid Empire by 331 BC. Alexander's empire collapsed after his death; his general, [[Seleucus I Nicator]], tried to take control of Iran, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Syria]], and [[Anatolia]]. His empire was the [[Seleucid Empire]].

==== Parthian and Sasanian empires ====
{{Main|Parthian Empire|Sasanian Empire}}

The Arsacids of [[Parthia]],{{Sfn|Venning|2023|p=118}} initially Seleucid vassals,{{Sfn|Strootman|2020|p=151}} originated as leaders of the Iranian{{efn|The Parni was an eastern Iranian tribe established on the Amu Darya in the conferedation of [[Dahae]].{{sfn|Lecoq|2011}} To Yarshater, they were a [[Sakas|Saka]] tribe, who penetrated Parthia, adopted its language, and eventually challenged the Seleucids' power in Parthia.{{sfn|Yarshater|2004}}}} [[Parni]] tribe in the northeastern [[steppe]]s.{{Sfn|Venning|2023|p=162}} The Parthians gradually [[Seleucid–Parthian Wars|challenged Seleucid rule]] over Iran, eventually securing control through the 142 BC conquest of [[Babylonia]].{{Sfn|Venning|2023|p=118}}{{Sfn|Strootman|2020|p=150}} Although fighting continued, the death of [[Antiochus VII Sidetes]] in 129 BC marked the collapse of the Seleucid Empire,{{Sfn|Strootman|2020|p=150}} which then lingered on as a [[rump state]] in Syria until conquered by the [[Roman Empire]] in the 60s BC.{{Sfn|Venning|2023|p=118}}

[[File:The Sasanian Empire at its apex under Khosrow II.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Sasanian Empire]] at its greatest extent {{Circa|620}}, under the reign of [[Khosrow II]]]]

The [[Parthian Empire]] endured for five centuries, but civil wars destabilized it. Parthian power evaporated when [[Ardashir I]] revolted against the Arsacids and killed their last ruler, [[Artabanus IV of Parthia|Artabanus IV]], in 224 AD. Ardashir established the [[Sasanian Empire]], which ruled Iran and much of [[Near East]] before the [[Early Muslim conquests|Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century AD.{{Sfn|Shahbazi|2005}}

At their zenith, the Sasanians controlled all of modern-day Iran and Iraq and parts of the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|Arabian Peninsula]], as well as the [[Caucasus]], the [[Levant]], and parts of [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]]. The strong economic conditions left by Parthians allowed the Sasanians to build a powerful and distinctive economic state whose reputation spread well beyond its political frontiers and time.{{Sfn|Gyselen|1997}} The Sasanian Empire was characterized by a complex and centralized government bureaucracy and the revitalization of [[Zoroastrianism]] as a legitimizing and unifying ideal.{{Sfn|Eiland|2004|p=81}}

=== Medieval period ===
After the fall of the Sasanian Empire in 651, the [[Arabs]] of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] adopted many Persian customs, especially the administrative and the court mannerisms. Arab provincial governors were either Persianized [[Arameans]] or ethnic Persians; Persian remained the official language of the caliphate until the adoption of Arabic toward the end of the 7th century.{{Sfn|Hawting|1986|p=63–64}} However, Iran was still not entirely under Arab control; the [[Daylam]] region was under the control of the [[Daylamites]], [[Tabaristan]] was under [[Dabuyid dynasty|Dabuyid]] and [[Paduspanids|Paduspanid]] control, and [[Mount Damavand]] under [[Masmughans of Damavand|Masmughan]] control. Arabs had invaded these regions several times but the regions' inaccessible terrain prevented a decisive result. The most prominent ruler of the Dabuyids, [[Farrukhan the Great]] ({{Reign}}712–728), managed to hold his domains during his long struggle against the Arab general [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]], who was defeated by a combined Daylamite–Dabuyid army and forced to retreat from Tabaristan.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|pp=312–313}}

==== Iranian Intermezzo ====
{{Main|Iranian Intermezzo}}

[[File:Saffarids 900ad.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Saffarid dynasty]] in 900 AD]]
[[File:Iran circa 1000AD.png|thumb|upright=1.2|A map of Iranian dynasties in the mid 10th-century]]

Anti-Umayyad insurrections were supported by non-Arab Islamic converts, who were resentful over being relegated to lower social standing. In 747–750, one of these insurrections grew into the [[Abbasid revolution]], in which descendants of Muhammad's uncle, [[Abbas ibn Ali|Abbas]], overthrew the Umayyads.{{Sfn|Osman|2014|pp=62–63}} The political authority of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid caliphs]] diminished over the course of the 9th and 10th centuries.{{Sfn|Lorentz|2007|p=xxviii}} This led to the establishment of several independent Iranian dynasties,{{Sfn|Lorentz|2007|p=xxviii}} the ousting of Arab rulers from their scattered bastions across the country, and an Iranian cultural renaissance.{{Sfn|Mahendrarajah|2019}} The period between the collapse of Abbasid authority and the conquest of Iran by the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]] in the 11th century is referred to as the "[[Iranian Intermezzo]]."{{Sfn|Mahendrarajah|2019}}

The Iranian Intermezzo saw the rise and fall of several major and minor dynasties.{{Sfn|Mahendrarajah|2019}} Among the most important of these overlapping dynasties were the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (821–873); the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarids]] in [[Sistan]] (861–1003); and the [[Samanid Empire|Samanids]] (819–1005), originally at [[Bukhara]]. The Samanids eventually ruled an area from central Iran to Pakistan. By early 10th century, the Abbasids almost lost control to the growing Iranian faction known as the [[Buyid dynasty]] (934–1062). Since much of the Abbasid administration had been Persian, the Buyids were quietly able to assume real power in Baghdad. The Buyids were defeated in the mid-11th century by the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuq Turks]], who continued to exert influence over the Abbasids. From the empire's inception, the Seljuk rulers minted coins with the title ''šāhānšāh'' ({{Literal translation|King of Kings}}) in its Persian form,{{sfn|Barthold|1962|p=108}} perhaps adopting it from the Buyids.{{Sfn|Blair|1992|p=6}} The Seljuk Empire fractured after the death of [[Ahmad Sanjar]] in 1157.

The [[Islamization of Iran]] was a long process. As Persian Muslims consolidated their rule, the Muslim population rose from approximately 40% in the mid-9th century to close to 90% by the end of the 11th century. Historian [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] suggests that the rapid increase in conversion was aided by the Persian nationality of the rulers. Although Persians adopted the religion of their conquerors, over the centuries they worked to protect and revive their distinctive language and culture, a process known as [[Persianization]]. Arabs and Turks participated in this process.

==== Mongol invasions ====
{{See also|Mongol invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire|Mongol conquest of Persia and Mesopotamia}}
[[File:Map of the Khwarazmian Empire.png|thumb|Territory of the [[Khwarazmian Empire]] on the eve of the [[Mongol campaigns in Central Asia|Mongol conquests]], {{circa}} 1215]]
In the early 13th century, the Mongols reached Iran.{{sfn|Ward|2009|p=39}} [[Siege of Bukhara|Bukhara was conquered]] in 1220{{Sfn|Aigle|2024|p=26}} and the [[Khwarazmian Empire]] was destroyed.{{Sfn|Bosworth|2009}}  During 1220–21 Bukhara, [[Siege of Samarkand (1220)|Samarkand]], [[Herat]], [[Tus, Iran|Tus]] and [[Nishapur]] were razed, and the whole populations were slaughtered. Over the following decades, further conquests followed, culminating in the [[Siege of Baghdad|fall of Baghdad]] and end of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]'s rule in 1258.{{Sfn|Lane|2012|p=250}}[[File:MongolMap.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Ilkhanate was one of the four major [[Division of the Mongol Empire|divisions of the Mongol Empire]] after the death of Genghis Khan]]
After the death of [[Möngke Khan]], the [[Mongol Empire]] was fractured by civil war, both over the succession of the next Great Khan and between nomadic traditionalists and the new settled princes of China and the Middle East. [[Kublai Khan]] was eventually universally recognized, but the empire was irreversibly fragmented.{{Sfn|Lane|2012|p=250}} In much of the southwest of the empire, including Iran, power fell to [[Hulegu Khan]],{{Sfn|Rossabi|2002|p=32}} who had been made a deputy there under Möngke Khan.{{Sfn|Lane|2012|p=250}} Hulegu was accepted as a legitimate ruler in Iran and was legitimized through a ''[[fatwa]]'' issued by the Shia scholar [[Ali ibn Tawus al-Hilli]].{{Sfn|Lane|2012|pp=253–254, 256}} Iran experienced a cultural renaissance under [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanid]] rule.{{Sfn|Lane|2012|pp=253–254, 256}} [[Ghazan Khan]] converted to Islam in the late 13th century, turning the state further away from the other Mongol realms.{{Sfn|Rossabi|2002|p=32}}

After Ghazan's nephew [[Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan|Abu Said]] died in 1335, the Ilkhanate lapsed into civil war and was divided between several petty dynasties – most prominently the [[Jalayirids]], [[Muzaffarids (Iran)|Muzaffarids]], [[Sarbadars]] and [[Kartids]]. The mid-14th-century [[Black Death]] killed about 30% of the country's population.

==== Timur and the rise of new powers ====
{{See also|Timurid conquests and invasions}}
[[File:Empire of Timur and his Campaigns.png|thumb|[[Timur]]'s empire and his military campaigns]]
Iran remained divided until the establishment of the Persianate [[Timurid dynasty]] in 1370. Its founder, Timur (r. 1370–1405), hailed from a [[Turkification|Turkified]] tribe of Mongols. After establishing a power base in [[Transoxiana]], Timur invaded Iran in 1381 and eventually conquered most of it. Timur's campaigns were known for their brutality; many people were slaughtered and several cities were destroyed. In 1387, Timur ordered the complete [[Siege of Isfahan (1387)|massacre of Isfahan]], killing 70,000 people. The Timurids maintained control of most of Iran until 1452, when they lost the bulk of it to the [[Qara Qoyunlu]], who were conquered in turn by the [[Aq Qoyunlu]] 1468. [[Uzun Hasan]] and his successors were the masters of Iran until the rise of the Safavids.

=== Early modern period ===
{{Main|Safavid Iran|Afsharid Iran|Zand dynasty|Qajar Iran|Portuguese–Safavid wars|Ottoman–Persian Wars}}

[[File:Safavid Empire 1501 1722 AD.png|thumb|[[Safavid Iran]] (1501–1722) at its greatest extent]]

The [[Safavid Iran|Safavid Empire]], founded by [[Ismail I]] (r. 1505–1524), is often considered the beginning of modern Iranian history.{{Sfn|Matthee|2008}} While Safavid Iran predated the concept of the nation-state as such, it established the basis for the modern state of Iran.{{Sfn|Matthee|2008}}{{Sfn|Brown|2011|p=432}} The [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] dynastic period was one of the most important Iranian history, as it reunified Iran as a cohesive entity under native rule and established Shia Islam as the [[State religion|official religion]].{{Sfn|Savory|Karamustafa|1998|p=}} The Safavids ruled from 1501 to 1722, and experienced a brief restoration from 1729 to 1736.

The Safavid state had a complex bureaucratic system of checks and balances, which ensured transparency and prevented fraud. However, this system was intended not to equalize power between branches of government, but to ensure total power of the shah. Legitimized by his bloodline as a [[sayyid]], or descendant of Muhammad, the shah monitored the actions of government officials through reports provided by the superintendent of each department. [[Jean Chardin]], French merchant and eventual ambassador to Iran, wrote that the Safavid shahs ruled their land with an iron fist and often in a [[Despotism|despotic]] manner.[[File:Afsharid Iran 1741.png|thumb|The [[Afsharid Iran]] at its greatest extent in 1741–1745 under [[Nader Shah]]]]
Complex rivalries in the region of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] led to the Afghan [[Hotak dynasty]] invading Iran. In 1722, this conflict led to the collapse of the Safavid Empire after the [[siege of Isfahan]].{{Sfn|Matthee|2008}}{{Sfn|Aghaie|2012|p=306}} The brief interlude between 1722 and the rise of the [[Qajar dynasty]] in 1789–1796 was marked by widespread political turmoil in Iran and several rival attempts to establish power over the country. The Safavids failed to regain power and the Hotaks failed to establish control. The rival [[Afsharid Iran|Afsharid]] and [[Zand dynasty|Zand]] dynasties were established by [[Nader Shah]] ({{Reign}}1736–1747) and [[Karim Khan Zand|Karim Khan]] ({{Reign}}1751–1779), respectively.{{Sfn|Aghaie|2012|p=306}}

==== Nader Shah and the shifting balance of power ====
{{See also|Campaigns of Nader Shah}}
Nader Shah has been described as "the last great Asiatic military conqueror," and compared by some historians to Napoleon and Alexander the Great.{{sfn|Axworthy|2008|p=xvii}} His numerous campaigns created a great empire that, at its maximum extent, briefly encompassed all or part of modern-day Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Georgia, India, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Oman, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, the [[North Caucasus]], and the [[Persian Gulf]]. However, his military spending had a ruinous effect on the Iranian economy.{{sfn|Tucker|2006a}}

[[File:Map Iran 1900-en.png|thumb|A map of Iran under the [[Qajar dynasty]] in the 19th century.]]
Nader Shah's death was followed by a [[Division of the Afsharid Empire|period of anarchy]] in Iran as rival army commanders fought for power. Nader's own family, the Afsharids, lost all but a small domain in Khorasan. The Zand family seized control of much of Iran in the 1750s.{{Sfn|Baker|2005|p=13}} The Zand rulers never proclaimed themselves to be ''shah''s, but as [[regent]]s of Iran.{{Sfn|Baker|2005|p=13}}''{{Sfn|Perry|2000}}'' They first staked their claim to power on behalf of the Safavid puppet [[Ismail III]] ({{Reign}}1750–1773) and then on behalf of the Iranian people.{{Sfn|Baker|2005|p=13}}''{{Sfn|Perry|2000}}''

==== Rise of the Qajar dynasty and foreign interference ====
The Qajar dynasty gradually increased in power as they clashed with the Afsharids and the Zands for control of the land, culminating in [[Agha Mohammad Shah]] proclaiming himself ruler in 1789.{{sfn|Perry|1984}} Agha Mohammad defeated the Zand dynasty in 1794 and was officially crowned in 1796.{{Sfn|Baker|2005|p=13}}{{sfn|Perry|1984}} Shortly thereafter, he captured and deposed the Afsharid Shahrokh Shah, reunifying Iran under a single ruler.{{sfn|Perry|1984}}

In the 19th century, Iran lost significant territories in the [[Caucasus]] to the [[Russian Empire]] following the [[Russo-Persian Wars]].{{Sfn|Dowling|2014|p=728–729}} Meanwhile, [[United Kingdom|Britain]] became involved in [[southern Iran]] to counter Russia's presence in the north, which posed a threat to [[British India]].{{sfn|Amanat|2002}} Amid this struggle for power, drought, shifting agricultural priorities, and poor governance culminated in the [[Persian famine of 1870–1872|Great Persian Famine of 1870–1871]]. While the death toll is unknown, the famine killed a significant portion of Iran's population; between several hundred thousand and four million Iranians are believed to have died as a result.

=== 20th century up to the Iranian Revolution ===
{{Main|Pahlavi Iran}}

==== Constitutional Revolution and the rise of the Pahlavi dynasty ====
[[File:RezaShahBozorgTakhteJamshid32.jpg|thumb|[[Reza Shah Pahlavi]] with [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] at [[Persepolis]]]]
The [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] between 1905 and 1911 led to the establishment of an Iranian parliament. After the [[1921 Persian coup d'état|1921 coup d'état]], the Qajar dynasty was replaced with the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. The dynasty was founded by [[Reza Shah]], who established an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian government]] that valued [[Iranian nationalism|nationalism]], [[militarism]], [[secularism in Iran|secularism]] and [[anti-communism]] combined with strict [[censorship]] and [[state propaganda]]. Reza Shah introduced many socio-economic reforms, reorganizing the army, government administration, and finances. Reza Shah ruled for almost 16 years until 1941, when he was forced to [[Abdication|abdicate]] by the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]].

To his supporters, his reign brought "[[Law and order (politics)|law and order]], discipline, central authority, and modern amenities – schools, trains, buses, radios, cinemas, and telephones." However, his reign has been characterized as a corrupt [[police state]] which provided only surface level modernization.

==== World War II and post-occupation instability ====
Due in part to Nazi Germany's [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]], the Iranian government expected Germany to win the war and establish a powerful force on the Russian-Iranian border. Iran rejected British and Soviet demands to expel German residents from its borders. In response, the two [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] invaded in August 1941 and easily overwhelmed the weak Iranian army in [[Operation Countenance]]. Iran became the major conduit of Allied [[Lend-Lease]] aid to the Soviet Union. The purpose was to secure Iranian oil fields and ensure Allied supply lines through the [[Persian Corridor]]. Iran remained officially neutral. Reza Shah was deposed during the subsequent occupation and replaced with his young son [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]. At the 1943 [[Tehran Conference]], the Allied "Big Three"—[[Joseph Stalin]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and [[Winston Churchill]]—issued the Tehran Declaration to guarantee the post-war independence and boundaries of Iran.

==== Mosaddegh and the Shah's rule ====
{{See also|1953 Iranian coup d'état}}
[[File:Jimmy Carter with King Hussein of Jordan the Shah of Iran and Shahbanou of Iran - NARA - 177332 04.jpg|thumb|[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] and [[Farah Pahlavi|Shahbanou]] of [[Pahlavi Iran|Iran]] with US President [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[King Hussein]] of Jordan in 1977]]
In 1951, under Prime Minister [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]], the Iranian parliament voted to nationalize the British-owned oil industry, leading to the [[Abadan Crisis]]. Despite British pressure, including an economic blockade, nationalization continued. Mosaddegh was removed from power in 1952 but was quickly re-appointed by the Shah, due to a popular uprising in support of the premier. He forced the Shah into a brief exile in August 1953 after a failed military coup by [[Imperial Guard (Iran)|Imperial Guard]] Colonel [[Nematollah Nassiri]].

On 19 August, a successful [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|coup]] was headed by retired army general [[Fazlollah Zahedi]], aided by the US ([[CIA]]) and the British ([[MI6]]), known as Operation Ajax and Operation Boot to the respective agencies. The coup—with a [[black propaganda]] campaign  against Mosaddegh — forced Mosaddegh from office. Mosaddegh was arrested and tried for treason. Found guilty, his sentence was reduced to house arrest on his family estate while his foreign minister, [[Hossein Fatemi]], was executed. [[Fazlollah Zahedi|Zahedi]] succeeded him as prime minister and suppressed opposition to the Shah, specifically from the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] and the communist [[Tudeh Party]].

From that time until the revolution, Iran was ruled as an autocracy under the Shah, with strong American support. Iran initiated economic, social, agrarian, and administrative reforms to modernize the country, which became known as the [[White Revolution]]. Many Islamic leaders criticized these initiatives, and the land reform had mixed results. By 1978, the Shah had become wildly unpopular among the Iranian people. Daily demonstrations destabilized the region, and the Shah established [[martial law]] to curb opposition. When hundreds of thousands of protestors persisted, security forces opened fire on the crowds in an incident that became known as [[Black Friday (1978)|Black Friday]].

=== Iranian Revolution ===
{{Main|Iranian Revolution}}

[[File:Imam Khomeini in Mehrabad.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] returns to Iran after 14 years exile in France on 1 February 1979.]]
The protests against the Shah grew to include more than 10% of the country; it is rare for revolutions to involve even 1% of a country's population. Frustration with the Shah was so great that even secular and leftist groups supported [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Rohullah Khomeini]], the leader of the [[Iranian Revolution|revolution]], despite sharing none of his political positions. Under increasing pressure, the Shah eventually fled Iran, charging the interim [[Regency Council (Iran)|Regency Council]] with his duties until a new government was formed. [[Shapour Bakhtiar]], the head of the Council, invited Khomeini to return from exile. However, upon return, Khomeini pledged to defeat the interim government led by Bakhtiar and claimed to support free democratic elections. Violence broke out between the two factions, ultimately leading Bakhtiar to flee Iran in disguise.

On 31 March 1979, a [[1979 Iranian Islamic Republic referendum|referendum]] was held on whether to transition from a government of monarchy to an [[Islamic republic]]. The referendum was approved by a massive margin. It mandated the creation of an [[Assembly for the Final Review of the Constitution|assembly]] to draft the new [[theocratic]] constitution, whereby Khomeini became [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] in December 1979. Iran's modernizing, capitalist economy was replaced by populist Islamic economic and cultural policies. Industries were nationalized, laws and schools [[Islamization of knowledge|Islamized]], and [[Western world|Western influence]] restricted.

==== Khomeini, Iran-Iraq War, and leadership transition ====
{{See also|Aftermath of the Iranian Revolution|Iran-Iraq War}}
[[File:Chemical weapon1.jpg|thumb|An Iranian soldier with gas mask during the [[Iran–Iraq War]]]]
The shah, now out of power, went to the US to seek cancer treatment after other countries denied him entry. Supporters of the revolution feared that this was a step toward a coup to reinstate the Shah's reign. On 4 November 1979, Iranian students [[Iran hostage crisis|seized US embassy personnel]], labeling the embassy a "den of spies." 52 hostages were held for 444 days until January 1981.

Iraqi leader [[Saddam Hussein]] attempted to take advantage of the disorder of the revolution, the weakness of the Iranian military and the revolution's antagonism against Western governments. On 22 September 1980, the Iraqi army [[Iraqi invasion of Iran|invaded Iran]] at [[Khuzestan province|Khuzestan]], precipitating the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. The attack took revolutionary Iran by surprise. Although Hussein's forces made early advances, Iranian forces pushed the Iraqi army back into Iraq by 1982. Khomeini sought to [[Exporting the revolution|export the revolution]] westward into Iraq, especially to the country's Shi'a Arab majority. The war continued until 1988, when Khomeini "drank the cup of poison" and accepted a truce mediated by the UN. The war, which ended in a stalemate in 1988, killed approximately 500,000 people. During the war, Saddam extensively used [[Iraqi chemical weapons program|chemical weapons]] against Iranians.

==== Khamenei era ====
{{further|Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Assassination of Qasem Soleimani|2024 Iran–Israel conflict|Iran–Israel war}}On his deathbed in 1989, Khomeini appointed a 25-man Constitutional Reform Council which named [[Ali Khamenei]] as the next Supreme Leader, and made changes to Iran's constitution. A smooth transition followed Khomeini's death on 3 June 1989. While Khamenei lacked Khomeini's "charisma and clerical standing", he developed a network of supporters within Iran's armed forces and its economically powerful [[Bonyad|religious foundations]].

In 1989, President [[Akbar Rafsanjani]] concentrated on a pro-business policy of rebuilding the economy, without breaking with the ideology of the revolution. He supported a free market, favoring privatization of state industries and a moderate position internationally. In 1997, Rafsanjani was succeeded by moderate [[Iranian reform movement|reformist]] [[Mohammad Khatami]], whose government advocated [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], constructive diplomatic relations with Asia and the European Union, and policy that supported a free market and foreign investment.

The [[2005 Iranian presidential election|2005 presidential election]] brought conservative populist and nationalist candidate [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] to power. He was known for his hardline views, nuclearization, and [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Israel|hostility towards Israel]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the UK, US and other states. He was the first president to be summoned by the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly|parliament]] to answer questions regarding his presidency. In 2013, centrist and reformist [[Hassan Rouhani]] was elected president. He encouraged personal freedom, free access to information, and improved women's rights. He improved Iran's diplomatic relations through exchanging conciliatory letters. The [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] was reached in [[Vienna]] in 2015, between Iran, the [[P5+1]] ([[permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] + Germany) and the EU. The negotiations centered around ending the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929|economic sanctions]] in exchange for Iran's restriction in producing [[enriched uranium]]. In 2018, the US under President [[First presidency of Donald Trump|Donald Trump]] withdrew from the deal and new sanctions were imposed. This nulled the economic provisions and brought Iran to [[nuclear latency|nuclear threshold status]]. In 2020, [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|IRGC]] general [[Qasem Soleimani]], the 2nd-most powerful person in Iran, was [[Assassination of Qasem Soleimani|assassinated by the US]], heightening [[Iran–United States relations|tensions between them]]. [[Operation Martyr Soleimani|Iran retaliated against US airbases in Iraq]], the largest ballistic missile attack ever on Americans; 110 sustained [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injuries]]. On 8 January, Iran's [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] shot down [[Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752]], killing 176 civilians and leading to [[Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 protests|nation-wide protests]]. An international investigation led to the government admitting to the shootdown of the plane by a surface-to-air missile after three days of denial, calling it a "human error".

Hardliner [[Ebrahim Raisi]] lost a presidential bid in 2017, but he ran again [[2021 Iranian presidential election|in 2021]], succeeding Rouhani. During Raisi's term, Iran [[Nuclear program of Iran|intensified uranium enrichment]], hindered international inspections, joined SCO and BRICS, [[Iran and the Russian invasion of Ukraine|supported Russia]] in its [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|Ukraine invasion]] and restored diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. In April 2024, the [[Israeli airstrike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus]] killed an IRGC commander. Iran [[April 2024 Iranian strikes on Israel|retaliated]] with [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]], [[Cruise missile|cruise]] and [[ballistic missile]]s; 9 hit Israel. It was the largest drone strike in history, biggest missile attack in Iranian history, its first ever direct attack on Israel and the first time [[1991 Iraqi missile attacks against Israel|since 1991]] that Israel was directly attacked by a state force. Israel conducted [[April 2024 Israeli strikes on Iran|another strike]] the same month. In May 2024, Raisi was killed in a [[2024 Varzaqan helicopter crash|helicopter crash]], and Iran held a [[2024 Iranian presidential election|presidential election]] in June, when reformist and former [[Ministry of Health and Medical Education|Minister of Health]], [[Masoud Pezeshkian]], was elected.

On 1 October 2024, Iran [[October 2024 Iranian strikes on Israel|launched]] 180 ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for assassinations [[Assassination of Ismail Haniyeh|of Ismail Haniyeh]], [[2024 Hezbollah headquarters strike|Hassan Nasrallah]] and [[Abbas Nilforoushan]]. On 27 October, Israel [[October 2024 Israeli strikes on Iran|struck]] Iranian military sites. In May 2025, the Iranian government ordered the [[2025 Afghan deportation from Iran|mass deportation]] of an estimated 4 million [[Afghan diaspora|Afghan migrants]] and refugees who were living in Iran.

The weakening of Iran's [[Axis of Resistance|key allies and proxies]] since 2023 have left the Iranian government weakened and isolated. In early 2025, Iran was rapidly advancing its nuclear program. Analysts warned such activity exceeded any plausible civilian justification. Beginning in April, Iran and the US [[2025 Iran-United States negotiations|entered negotiations]] for a new nuclear agreement, but progress stalled. In June, [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] found Iran non-compliant with its nuclear obligations; in response, Iran announced the activation of a new enrichment facility.

On 13 June 2025, Israel launched strikes across Iran, targeting nuclear facilities and killing many top members of Iran's military leadership. Iran retaliated with its own missile strikes, and hostilities resulted in a brief [[Iran–Israel war|direct conflict]] between the two countries. On 22 June, the [[United States strikes on Iranian nuclear sites|US struck the Iranian nuclear facilities]] of [[Fordow Uranium Enrichment Plant|Fordow]], [[Natanz Nuclear Facility|Natanz]], and [[Isfahan Nuclear Technology/Research Center|Isfahan]]; Iran [[2025 Iranian strikes on Al Udeid Air Base|attacked U.S. bases in Qatar]] as a result. On 24 June, Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire after insistence from the US.
