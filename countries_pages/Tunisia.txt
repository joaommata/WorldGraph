{{main|Capsian culture|Ancient Carthage}}

Farming methods reached the [[Nile|Nile Valley]] from the [[Fertile Crescent]] region about 5000 BC, and spread to the [[Maghreb]] by about 4000 BC. Agricultural communities in the humid coastal plains of central Tunisia then were ancestors of today's [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes.

It was believed in ancient times that Africa was originally populated by [[Gaetuli]]ans and Libyans, both nomadic peoples. According to the Roman historian [[Sallust]], the demigod Hercules died in Spain and his polyglot eastern army was left to settle the land, with some [[Human migration|migrating]] to Africa. Persians went to the West and intermarried with the Gaetulians and became the Numidians. The Medes settled and were known as Mauri, later Moors.

The Numidians and Moors belonged to the race from which the Berbers are descended. The translated meaning of Numidian is Nomad and indeed the people were semi-nomadic until the reign of [[Masinissa]] of the Massyli tribe.

At the beginning of recorded history, Tunisia was inhabited by [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes. Its coast was settled by [[Phoenicia]]ns starting as early as the 12th century BC ([[Bizerte]], [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]]). The city of [[Carthage]] was founded in the 9th century BC by Phoenicians. Legend says that [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] from Tyre, now in modern-day Lebanon, founded the city in 814 BC, as retold by the [[Greeks|Greek]] writer [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus of Tauromenium]]. The settlers of Carthage brought their culture and religion from Phoenicia, now present-day [[Lebanon]] and adjacent areas.

After the series of wars with Greek city-states of Sicily in the 5th century BC, Carthage rose to power and eventually became the dominant civilization in the Western [[Mediterranean]]. The people of Carthage worshipped a pantheon of Middle Eastern gods including [[Baal]] and [[Tanit]]. Tanit's symbol, a simple female figure with extended arms and long dress, is a popular icon found in ancient sites. The founders of Carthage also established a [[Tophet]], which was altered in Roman times.

A Carthaginian invasion of Italy led by [[Hannibal]] during the [[Second Punic War]],  one of a series of wars with [[Roman Republic|Rome]], nearly crippled the rise of Roman power. From the conclusion of the Second Punic War in 202 BC, Carthage functioned as a client state of the Roman Republic for another 50 years.

Following the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]] which began in 149 BC during the [[Third Punic War]], Carthage was conquered by Rome in 146 BC.{{sfn|Steel|2013|p=9–10}} Following its conquest, the Romans renamed Carthage to [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], incorporating it as a province.

During the Roman period, the area of what is now Tunisia enjoyed a huge development. The economy, mainly during the Empire, boomed: the prosperity of the area depended on agriculture. Called the ''Granary of the Empire'', the area of actual Tunisia and coastal [[Tripolitania]], according to one estimate, produced one million tons of cereals each year, one quarter of which was exported to the Empire. Additional crops included beans, figs, grapes, and other fruits.

By the 2nd century, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item. In addition to the cultivations and the capture and transporting of exotic wild animals from the western mountains, the principal production and exports included textiles, marble, wine, timber, livestock, pottery such as [[African Red Slip]], and wool.

There was even a huge production of mosaics and ceramics, exported mainly to Italy, in the central area of [[El Djem]] (where there was the second biggest amphitheater in the Roman Empire).

Berber bishop [[Donatus Magnus]] was the founder of a Christian group known as the [[Donatist]]s. During the 5th and 6th centuries (from 430 to 533 AD), the Germanic [[Vandals]] invaded and ruled over a kingdom in Northwest Africa that included present-day Tripoli. The region was easily reconquered in 533–534 AD, during the rule of Emperor [[Justinian I]], by the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Romans]] led by General [[Belisarius]], preluding a 165-year era of [[Byzantine North Africa|Byzantine rule]].

=== Middle Ages ===
{{main|History of medieval Tunisia}}

[[File:Statue de Okba ibn Nafi al Fihri en Algérie.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Uqba ibn Nafi]] led the [[Umayyad]] conquest of Tunisia in the late 7th century.]]
Sometime between the second half of the 7th century and the early part of the 8th century, [[Arab]] [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Muslim conquest occurred in the region]]. They founded the first Islamic city in Northwest Africa, [[Kairouan]]. It was there in 670 AD that the [[Mosque of Uqba]], or the Great Mosque of Kairouan, was constructed. This mosque is the oldest and most prestigious sanctuary in the Muslim West with the oldest standing [[minaret]] in the world; it is also considered a masterpiece of Islamic art and architecture. The [[Arab migration to the Maghreb]] began during this time.

The region in its entirety was taken in 695, retaken by the Byzantine Eastern Romans in 697, but lost permanently in 698. The transition from a Latin-speaking Christian Berber society to a Muslim and mostly Arabic-speaking society took over 400 years (the equivalent process in Egypt and the Fertile Crescent took 600 years) and resulted in the final disappearance of Christianity and Latin in the 12th or 13th century. The majority of the population were not Muslim until quite late in the 9th century; a vast majority were during the 10th. Also, some Tunisian Christians emigrated; some richer members of society did so after the conquest in 698 and others were welcomed by Norman rulers to Sicily or Italy in the 11th and 12th centuries – the logical destination because of the 1200 year close connection between the two regions.

The Arab governors of Tunis founded the [[Aghlabids|Aghlabid dynasty]], which ruled Tunisia, [[Tripolitania]] and eastern Algeria from 800 to 909. This prosperity permitted luxurious court life and was marked by the construction of new palace cities such as al-Abbasiya (809) and Raq Adda (877). Zirid Tunisia flourished in many areas: agriculture, industry, trade, and religious and secular learning. Management by the later Zirid [[emirs]] was neglectful though, and political instability was connected to the decline of Tunisian trade and agriculture.

The depredation of the Tunisian campaigns by the [[Banu Hilal]], a warlike Arab tribe encouraged by the Fatimids of Egypt to seize Northwest Africa, sent the region's rural and urban economic life into further decline. The Arab historian [[Ibn Khaldun]] wrote that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.

The main Tunisian cities were conquered by the [[Normans]] of [[Sicily]] under the [[Kingdom of Africa]] in the 12th century, but following [[Almohad conquest of Ifriqiya|the conquest of Tunisia]] in 1159–1160 by the [[Almohads]] the Normans were evacuated to Sicily. Communities of Tunisian Christians would still exist in [[Nefzaoua]] up to the 14th century. The Almohads initially ruled over Tunisia through a governor, usually a near relative of the Caliph. Despite the prestige of the new masters, the country was still unruly, with continuous rioting and fighting between the townsfolk and wandering Arabs and Turks, the latter being subjects of the Muslim Armenian adventurer Karakush. Also, Tunisia was occupied by [[Ayyubids]] between 1182 and 1183 and again between 1184 and 1187.

The greatest threat to Almohad rule in Tunisia was the [[Banu Ghaniya]], relatives of the [[Almoravids]], who from their base in [[Mallorca]] tried to restore Almoravid rule over the Maghreb. Around 1200 they succeeded in extending their rule over the whole of Tunisia until they were crushed by Almohad troops in 1207. After this success, the Almohads installed Walid Abu Hafs as the governor of Tunisia. Tunisia remained part of the Almohad state, until 1230 when the son of Abu Hafs declared himself independent.

During the reign of the [[Hafsid dynasty]] from their capital Tunis, fruitful commercial relationships were established with several Christian Mediterranean states. In the late 16th century the coast became a [[pirate]] stronghold.

=== Ottoman Tunisia ===
{{main|Ottoman Tunisia}}

[[File:Frans Hogenberg battle of Tunis.jpg|left|thumb|[[Conquest of Tunis (1535)|Conquest of Tunis]] by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and liberation of Christian [[galley slave]]s in 1535]]
In the last years of the [[Hafsid dynasty]], Spain seized many of the coastal cities, but these were recovered by the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The [[Conquest of Tunis (1534)|first Ottoman conquest of Tunis]] took place in 1534 under the command of [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha]], the younger brother of Oruç Reis, who was the [[Kapudan Pasha]] of the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman Fleet]] during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. However, it was not until the [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|final Ottoman reconquest of Tunis from Spain]] in 1574 under Kapudan Pasha [[Uluç Ali Reis]] that the Ottomans permanently acquired the former [[History of medieval Tunisia#Hafsid dynasty of Tunis|Hafsid Tunisia]], retaining it until the [[French conquest of Tunisia]] in 1881.

Initially under Turkish rule from Algiers, soon the [[Ottoman Porte]] appointed directly for [[Tunis]] a governor called the [[Pasha]] supported by [[janissary]] forces. Before long, however, Tunisia became in effect an autonomous province, under the local [[bey]]. Under its [[Turkish People|Turkish]] governors, the beys, Tunisia attained virtual independence. The [[Husainid Dynasty|Hussein dynasty]] of beys, established in 1705, lasted until 1957. This evolution of status was from time to time challenged without success by Algiers. During this era, the governing councils controlling Tunisia remained largely composed of a foreign elite who continued to conduct state business in the [[Turkish language]].

[[File:St Louis Cathedral - Carthage - Tunisia - 1899.jpg|thumb|St Louis Cathedral – Carthage – Tunisia – 1899]]
Attacks on European shipping were made by [[Barbary corsairs|corsairs]], primarily from Algiers, but also from Tunis and [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]], yet after a long period of declining raids the growing power of the European states finally forced its termination.

The [[Second plague pandemic|plague epidemics]] ravaged Tunisia in 1784–1785, 1796–1797 and 1818–1820.

In the 19th century, the rulers of Tunisia became aware of the ongoing efforts at political and social [[Tanzimat|reform in the Ottoman capital]]. The Bey of Tunis then, by his own lights but informed by the Turkish example, attempted to effect a modernizing reform of institutions and the economy. Tunisian international debt grew unmanageable. This was the reason or pretext for French forces to establish a [[History of French era Tunisia|protectorate]] in 1881.

=== French Protectorate of Tunisia (1881–1956) ===
{{main|French protectorate of Tunisia}}

[[File:A Churchill tank and other vehicles parade through Tunis, 8 May 1943. NA2880.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|British tank moves through Tunis after the city was taken from Axis troops, 8 May 1943.]]
In 1869, Tunisia declared itself bankrupt and an international financial commission took control over its economy. In 1881, using the pretext of a Tunisian incursion into [[Algeria]], the French invaded with an army of about 36,000 and forced the Bey of Tunis, [[Muhammad III as-Sadiq]], to agree to the terms of the 1881 [[Treaty of Bardo]]. With this treaty, Tunisia was officially made a [[French occupation of Tunisia|French protectorate]], over the objections of Italy. European settlements in the country were actively encouraged; the number of [[French people|French]] colonists grew from 34,000 in 1906 to 144,000 in 1945. In 1910 there were also 105,000 [[Italian Tunisians|Italians in Tunisia]].

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the protectorate of Tunisia was controlled by the collaborationist [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government in Metropolitan France. The antisemitic [[Vichy anti-Jewish legislation|Statute on Jews]] enacted by the Vichy government was also implemented in Vichy-controlled Northwest Africa and other overseas French territories. Thus, the persecution and murder of the Jews from 1940 to 1943 was part of [[the Holocaust]] in France.

From November 1942 until May 1943, Vichy-controlled Tunisia was occupied by Germany. [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] Commander [[Walter Rauff]] continued to implement the "Final Solution" there. From 1942 to 1943, Tunisia was the scene of the [[Tunisia Campaign]], a series of battles between the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces. The battle opened with initial success by the German and Italian forces, but the massive supply and numerical superiority of the Allies led to the [[Tunisian Campaign|Axis surrender]] on 13 May 1943. The six-month campaign of Tunisia's liberation from Axis occupation signalled the end of the war in Africa.

=== Struggle for independence (1943–1956) ===

After the liberation of Tunisia from the Germans, the French regained control over the government and made participation in a nationalist party illegal once more. [[Moncef Bey]], who was popular amongst Tunisians, was deposed by the French. He attended the [[American Federation of Labor]] meeting in [[San Francisco]], California. Voizard had previously been the French Minister to [[Monaco]]. 20 March is celebrated annually as Tunisian Independence Day. A year later, Tunisia was declared a republic, with Bourguiba as [[List of Presidents of Tunisia|the first President]]. From independence in 1956 until the 2011 revolution, the government and the [[Constitutional Democratic Rally]] (RCD), formerly [[Neo Destour]] and the [[Socialist Destourian Party]], were effectively one. Following a report by [[Amnesty International]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' called Tunisia "one of the most modern but repressive countries in the Arab world". On 12 May 1964, Tunisia nationalized foreign farmlands. Immediately after, France canceled all financial assistance for the country, which was to amount to more than $40 million.

[[File:Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.jpg|thumb|[[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]], president of Tunisia from 1987 to 2011|209x209px]]
In November 1987, doctors declared Bourguiba unfit to rule and, in a bloodless coup d'état, Prime Minister [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] assumed the presidency The anniversary of Ben Ali's succession, 7 November, was celebrated as a national holiday. He was consistently re-elected with enormous majorities every five years (well over 80 percent of the vote), the last being 25 October 2009, until he fled the country amid popular unrest in January 2011.

Ben Ali and his family were accused of corruption and plundering the country's money. Economic liberalisation provided further opportunities for financial mismanagement, while corrupt members of the Trabelsi family, most notably in the cases of [[Imed Trabelsi]] and [[Belhassen Trabelsi]], controlled much of the business sector in the country. The First Lady [[Leila Ben Ali]] was described as an "unabashed [[Oniomania|shopaholic]]" who used the state airplane to make frequent unofficial trips to Europe's fashion capitals. Tunisia refused a French request for the extradition of two of the President's nephews, from Leila's side, who were accused by the French State prosecutor of having stolen two mega-yachts from a French marina. According to ''[[Le Monde]]'', Ben Ali's son-in-law was being primed to eventually take over the country.

Independent human rights groups, such as [[Amnesty International]], [[Freedom House]], and Protection International, documented that basic human and political rights were not respected. The regime obstructed in any way possible the work of local human rights organizations. In 2008, in terms of [[press freedom]], Tunisia was ranked 143rd out of 173.

=== Post-revolution (since 2011) ===
{{see also|Tunisian Revolution}}
[[File:Tunisia Unrest - VOA - Tunis 14 Jan 2011 (2).jpg|thumb|Tunis on 14 January 2011 during the [[Tunisian Revolution]]|242x242px|left]]
The Tunisian Revolution was an intensive campaign of [[civil resistance]] that was precipitated by high [[unemployment]], [[food inflation]], [[corruption]], a lack of [[freedom of speech]] and other [[political freedom]]s and poor [[living conditions]]. Labour unions were said to be an integral part of the protests. The protests inspired the [[Arab Spring]], a wave of similar actions throughout the Arab world. The catalyst for mass demonstrations was the death of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]], a 26-year-old Tunisian street vendor, who set himself afire on 17 December 2010 in protest at the confiscation of his wares and the humiliation inflicted on him by a municipal official named [[Faida Hamdy]]. Anger and violence intensified following Bouazizi's death on 4 January 2011, ultimately leading longtime [[President of Tunisia|President]] [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] to resign and flee the country on 14 January 2011, after 23 years in power.

Protests continued for banning of the ruling party and the eviction of all its members from the transitional government formed by [[Mohamed Ghannouchi|Mohammed Ghannouchi]]. Eventually the new government gave in to the demands. A Tunis court banned the ex-ruling party RCD and confiscated all its resources. A decree by the minister of the interior banned the "political police", special forces which were used to intimidate and persecute political activists.

On 3 March 2011, the interim president announced that [[Tunisian Constituent Assembly election, 2011|elections to a Constituent Assembly]] would be held on 24 July 2011. On 9 June 2011, the prime minister announced the election would be postponed until 23 October 2011. International and internal observers declared the vote free and fair. The [[Ennahda Movement]], formerly banned under the Ben Ali regime, came out of the election as the largest party, with 89 seats out of a total of 217. On 12 December 2011, former dissident and veteran human rights activist [[Moncef Marzouki]] was elected president. In March 2012, Ennahda declared it will not support making sharia the main source of legislation in the new constitution, maintaining the secular nature of the state. Ennahda's stance on the issue was criticized by hardline Islamists, who wanted strict sharia, but was welcomed by secular parties. On 6 February 2013, [[Chokri Belaid]], the leader of the leftist opposition and prominent critic of Ennahda, was assassinated. In 2014, President [[Moncef Marzouki]] established Tunisia's [[Truth and Dignity Commission (Tunisia)|Truth and Dignity Commission]], as a key part of creating a national reconciliation.

Tunisia was hit by two terror attacks on foreign tourists in 2015, [[Bardo National Museum attack|first killing 22 people]] at the [[Bardo National Museum (Tunis)|Bardo National Museum]], and [[2015 Sousse attacks|later killing 38 people]] at the [[Sousse]] beachfront. Tunisian president [[Beji Caid Essebsi]] renewed the state of emergency in October for three more months. The [[Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet]] won the 2015 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for its work in building a peaceful, pluralistic political order in Tunisia.

==== Presidency of Kais Saied (2019–present) ====
Tunisia's first democratically elected president [[Beji Caid Essebsi]] died in July 2019. Following him, [[Kais Saied]] became Tunisia's president after a landslide victory in the [[2019 Tunisian presidential election]]s in October. On 23 October 2019, Saied was sworn in as Tunisia's new president.

On 25 July 2021, amid ongoing demonstrations concerning government dysfunction and corruption and rises in [[COVID-19]] cases, Kais Saied unilaterally [[2021 Tunisian political crisis|suspended parliament, dismissed the prime minister and withdrew immunity of parliament members]]. In September 2021, Saied said he would appoint a committee to help draft new constitutional amendments.{{Efn|The new constitution, which increased presidential powers, was passed in a [[2022 Tunisian constitutional referendum|referendum]] the following year with a turnout of only around 30%, amidst a widespread boycott.}} On 29 September, he named [[Najla Bouden]] as the new prime minister and tasked her with forming a [[Bouden Cabinet|cabinet]], which was sworn in on 11 October. On 3 February 2022, Tunisia was voted to the African Union's (AU) Peace and Security Council for the term 2022–2024, according to the Tunisian Foreign Ministry. The poll took place on the fringes of the AU Executive Council's 40th ordinary session, which was held in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, according to the ministry.

In February 2022, Tunisia and the International Monetary Fund held preliminary negotiations in the hopes of securing a multibillion-dollar bailout for an economy beset by recession, public debt, inflation, and unemployment.

In April 2023, the Tunisian government closed the headquarters of the [[Ennahda]] party and arrested its leader [[Rached Ghannouchi]]. In October 2023 [[Abir Moussi]], head of the [[Free Destourian Party|Free Destourian Party (FDL)]], became the latest prominent opponent of president Saied to have been detained or imprisoned. The FDL had emerged from the [[Democratic Constitutional Rally|Democratic Constitutional Assembly]].

In September 2023 Saied had asked to postpone a visit by a delegation of the [[European Commission|EU commission]] to discuss migration according to [[Ministry of the Interior (Tunisia)|Minister of the Interior]] [[Kamel Feki]]. Meanwhile, human rights organisations were criticizing the July migration agreement. Feki said that Tunisia, which is one of the most important transit countries for people on their way to Europe, In October 2023 Saied turned down 127 million in EU aid saying that the amount was small and doesn't square with a deal signed three months ago. This in turn caused surprise in Brussels. In April 2025, Tunisia dismantled dozens of makeshift camps housing African migrants, displacing as many as 7,000 people.

On 6 October 2024, President Kais Saied won a second term with more than 90% of the vote in a [[2024 Tunisian presidential election|presidential election]] with a 28.8% turnout. Five political parties had urged people to boycott the elections.
