=== Ancient period ===
[[File:20100923 amman37.JPG|thumb|The [['Ain Ghazal Statues]], c. 7250 BC, uncovered in Amman are some of the oldest human statues ever found.]]

The oldest known evidence of [[hominid]] habitation in Jordan dates back at least 200,000 years. Jordan is a rich source of [[Paleolithic]] human remains (up to 20,000 years old) due to its location within the [[Levant]], where [[Recent African origin of modern humans|migrations out of Africa]] converged, and its more humid climate during the [[Late Pleistocene]], which resulted in the formation of numerous remains-preserving wetlands in the region. Past lakeshore environments attracted different groups of hominids, and several remains of tools dating from the Late Pleistocene have been found there.

During the [[Neolithic]] period (10,000–4,500 BC), there was a transition there from a [[hunter-gatherer]] culture to a culture with established populous agricultural villages. [[Ayn Ghazal (archaeological site)|'Ain Ghazal]], one such village located at a site in the eastern part of present-day [[Amman]], is one of the largest known prehistoric settlements in the [[Near East]]. [['Ain Ghazal Statues|Dozens of plaster statues]] of the human form, dating to 7250 BC or earlier, have been uncovered there. They are one of the oldest large-scale representations of humans ever found. During the [[Chalcolithic|Chalcolithic period]] (4500–3600 BC), several villages emerged in Transjordan including [[Teleilat el Ghassul|Tulaylet Ghassul]] in the [[Jordan Valley]]; a series of circular stone enclosures in the eastern basalt desert from the same period have long baffled archaeologists.

Fortified towns and urban centres first emerged in the southern Levant early in the [[Bronze Age]] (3600–1200 BC). [[Wadi Feynan]] became a regional centre for copper extraction: the metal was exploited on a large scale to produce bronze. Trade and movement of people in the Middle East peaked, causing cultural innovations and whole civilisations to spread. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian populations expanded towards the Levant and came to control both banks of the Jordan River.

During the [[Iron Age]] (1200–332 BC), after the withdrawal of the Egyptians, Transjordan was home to the kingdoms of [[Ammon]], [[Edom]] and [[Moab]]. The northwestern region of the Transjordan, known then as [[Gilead]], was settled by the [[Israelites]]. 

The three kingdoms continually clashed with the neighbouring Hebrew kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], centred west of the Jordan River. One record of this is the [[Mesha Stele]], erected by the Moabite king [[Mesha]] in 840 BC. In an inscription on it, he lauds himself for the building projects that he initiated in Moab and commemorates his glory and his victory against the Israelites. The stele constitutes one of the most important archeological parallels to [[Historicity of the Bible|accounts recorded in the Bible]]. At the same time, Israel and the Kingdom of [[Aram-Damascus]] competed for control of the Gilead.

Around 740–720 BC, Israel and Aram-Damascus were conquered by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]. The kingdoms of Ammon, Edom and Moab were subjugated but were allowed to maintain some degree of independence. Then in 627 BC, following after the disintegration of the Assyrians' empire, [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonians]] took control of the area.

=== Classical period ===
[[File:Al Khazneh Petra edit 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Petra]], one of the [[New 7 Wonders of the World]], contains [[Al-Khazneh]], believed to be the mausoleum of the [[Nabataean]] King [[Aretas IV Philopatris|Aretas IV]], 1st century AD]]

[[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Wars of Alexander the Great|conquest]] of the Persian Empire in 332 BC introduced [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic culture]] to the Middle East.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=10}} After Alexander's death in 323 BC, the [[Partition of Babylon|empire split]] among his generals, and in the end much of Transjordan was disputed between the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemies]] based in Egypt and the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] based in Syria.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=10}} The [[Nabataeans]], nomadic Arabs based south of Edom, managed to establish an independent kingdom in 169 BC by exploiting the struggle between the two Greek powers.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=10}} The [[Nabataean Kingdom]] controlled much of the trade routes of the region, and it stretched south along the [[Red Sea]] coast into the [[Hejaz]] desert, up to as far north as [[Damascus]], which it controlled for a short period (85–71 BC).{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=51}} The Nabataeans massed a fortune from their control of the trade routes, often drawing the envy of their neighbours.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=30}} Petra, Nabataea's capital, flourished in the 1st century AD, driven by its extensive water irrigation systems and agriculture.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=70}} The Nabataeans were talented [[stone carving|stone carvers]], building their most elaborate structure, [[Al-Khazneh]], in the first century AD.

Roman legions under [[Pompey]] conquered much of the Levant in 63 BC, inaugurating a period of Roman rule that lasted four centuries. In 106 AD, Emperor [[Trajan]] annexed Nabataea unopposed and rebuilt the [[King's Highway (ancient)|King's Highway]] which became known as the [[Via Traiana Nova]] road. Jerash is one of the best preserved Roman cities in the East; it was even visited by Emperor [[Hadrian]] during his journey to Palestine.

[[File:Jerash 01 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|The Oval Forum of [[Jerash]] (c. 1st century AD), then member of the ten-city Greco-Roman league, the ''[[Decapolis]]'', seven of which are present in modern-day Jordan.]]

In 324 AD, the Roman Empire split and the Eastern Roman Empire, later known as the [[Byzantine Empire]], continued to control or influence the region until 636. Christianity had [[Edict of Milan|become legal within the empire in 313]] after co-emperors [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] and [[Licinius]] signed an&nbsp;edict of toleration. [[Umm ar-Rasas]] in southern Amman contains at least 16 Byzantine churches. Meanwhile, Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after a [[Galilee earthquake of 363|363 earthquake]] destroyed many structures it declined further, eventually being abandoned.

=== Islamic era ===
In 629, during the [[Battle of Mu'tah]] in what is today [[Karak Governorate]], the Byzantines and their [[Patronage in ancient Rome|Arab Christian clients]], the [[Ghassanids]], staved off an attack by a Muslim [[Rashidun]] force that marched northwards towards the Levant from the Hejaz. The Byzantines however were defeated by the Muslims in 636 at the decisive [[Battle of the Yarmuk]] just north of Transjordan. The [[Abbasid Caliphate]]'s campaign to take over the Umayyad's began in a village in Transjordan known as [[Humayma]]. The powerful [[749 Galilee earthquake|749 earthquake]] is thought to have contributed to the Umayyads' [[Abbasid revolution|defeat by the Abbasids]], who moved the caliphate's capital from Damascus to [[Baghdad]]. During the [[Battle of Hattin]] (1187) near [[Sea of Galilee|Lake Tiberias]] just north of Transjordan, the Crusaders lost to [[Saladin]], the founder of the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] (1187–1260).{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=23}} The Ayyubids built the [[Ajloun Castle]] and rebuilt older castles to be used as military outposts against the Crusaders.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=23}} Villages in Transjordan under the Ayyubids became important stops for Muslim pilgrims going to [[Mecca]] who travelled along the route that connected Syria to the Hejaz. Several of the Ayyubid castles were used and expanded by the [[Mamluk Sultanate|Mamluks]] (1260–1516), who divided Transjordan between the provinces of Karak and Damascus.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=25}} During the next century Transjordan experienced [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] attacks, but the Mongols were ultimately repelled by the Mamluks at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] (1260).

In 1516 the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Caliphate]]'s forces [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–1517)|conquered Mamluk territory]].{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=26}} Agricultural villages in Transjordan witnessed a period of relative prosperity in the 16th century but were later abandoned. Transjordan was of marginal importance to the Ottoman authorities. As a result, Ottoman presence was virtually absent and reduced to annual tax collection visits. Only after Pasha's campaign did the Ottoman Empire try to solidify its presence in the [[Syria Vilayet]], which Transjordan was part of.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=37}}

A series of tax and land reforms (''[[Tanzimat]]'') in 1864 brought some prosperity back to agriculture and to abandoned villages; the end of virtual autonomy led a backlash in other areas of Transjordan.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=37}} Muslim [[Circassians]] and [[Chechens]], fleeing [[Circassian genocide|Russian persecution]], sought refuge in the Levant. The Ottoman authorities' establishment of its administration, conscription and heavy taxation policies led to revolts in the areas it controlled.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=38}} Transjordan's tribes in particular revolted during the [[Shoubak revolts|Shoubak]] (1905) and the [[Karak revolt]]s (1910), which were brutally suppressed. The revolt reached its climax when Faisal entered Damascus in October 1918 and established an Arab-led military administration in [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration|OETA East]], later declared as the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]], both of which Transjordan was part of.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=41}} During this period, the southernmost region of the country, including [[Ma'an]] and [[Aqaba]], was also [[Occupation of Ma'an|claimed by]] the neighbouring [[Kingdom of Hejaz]].

The nascent Hashemite Kingdom over the [[Syria (region)|region of Syria]] was forced to surrender to French troops on 24 July 1920 during the [[Battle of Maysalun]]; the French occupied only the northern part of Syria, leaving [[Interregnum (Transjordan)|Transjordan in a period of interregnum]]. Arab aspirations failed to gain international recognition, due mainly to the secret 1916 [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]], which divided the region into French and British spheres of influence, and the 1917 [[Balfour Declaration]], in which Britain announced its support for the establishment of a "national home" for Jews in Palestine.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=34}} This was seen by the Hashemites and the Arabs as a betrayal of their previous agreements with the British,{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=71}} including the 1915 [[McMahon–Hussein Correspondence]], in which the British stated their willingness to recognise the independence of a unified Arab state stretching from [[Aleppo]] to [[Aden]] under the rule of the Hashemites.

[[File:The high commissioner's first visit to Transjordan, in Es-Salt..jpg|thumb|[[As-Salt]] residents gather on 20 August 1920 during the [[Mandate for Palestine|British]] [[High Commissioners for Palestine and Transjordan|High Commissioner]]'s visit to Transjordan]]
British [[List of high commissioners for Palestine and Transjordan|High Commissioner]] [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] travelled to Transjordan on 21 August 1920 to meet with As-Salt's residents. He there declared to a crowd of 600 Transjordanian notables that the British government would aid the establishment of local governments in Transjordan, which was to be kept separate from that of Palestine. The second meeting took place in [[Umm Qais]] on 2 September, where the British representative Major [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Fitzroy Somerset]] received a petition that demanded: an independent Arab government in Transjordan to be led by an Arab prince (emir); land sale in Transjordan to [[Jews]] be stopped as well as the prevention of Jewish immigration there; that Britain establish and fund a national army; and that free trade be maintained between Transjordan and the rest of the region.

Abdullah, the second son of Sharif Hussein, [[Establishment of the Emirate of Transjordan|arrived from Hejaz by train in Ma'an]] in southern Transjordan on 21 November 1920 to redeem the Greater Syrian Kingdom his brother had lost.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=82}} Transjordan then was in disarray, widely considered to be ungovernable with its dysfunctional local governments.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=91}} Abdullah gained the trust of Transjordan's tribal leaders before scrambling to convince them of the benefits of an organised government.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=100}} Abdullah's successes drew the envy of the British, even when it was in their interest.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=101}} The British reluctantly accepted Abdullah as ruler of Transjordan after having given him a six-month trial.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=96}} In March 1921, the British decided to add Transjordan to their [[Mandate for Palestine]], in which they would implement their "[[Sharifian Solution]]" policy without applying the provisions of the mandate dealing with Jewish settlement. On 11 April 1921 the [[Emirate of Transjordan]] was established with Abdullah as emir.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|p=93}}

In September 1922, the Council of the [[League of Nations]] recognised Transjordan as a state under the terms of the [[Transjordan memorandum]]. Transjordan remained a British mandate until 1946, but it had been granted a greater level of autonomy than the region west of the Jordan River. Multiple difficulties emerged upon the assumption of power in the region by the Hashemite leadership.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|pp=10, 30, 31, 49, 104}} In Transjordan, small local [[Kura rebellion|rebellions at Kura]] in 1921 and 1923 were suppressed by Abdullah's forces with the help of the British.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|pp=10, 30, 31, 49, 104}} Wahhabis from Najd regained strength and [[Ikhwan raids on Transjordan|repeatedly raided]] the southern parts of his territory, seriously threatening the emir's position.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|pp=10, 30, 31, 49, 104}} The emir was unable to repel those raids without the aid of the local Bedouin tribes and the British, who maintained a military base with a small [[Royal Air Force]] detachment close to Amman.{{sfn|Salibi|1998|pp=10, 30, 31, 49, 104}}

=== Post-independence ===
{{Main|Timeline of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan}}
[[File:King Abdullah I of Jordan declaring independence, 25 May 1946.jpg|thumb|right|[[Abdullah I of Jordan|King Abdullah I]] on 25 May 1946 declaring independence, with Prime Minister [[Ibrahim Hashem]] in the background.]]

The [[Treaty of London (1946)|Treaty of London]], signed by the British government and the Emir of Transjordan on 22 March 1946, recognised the independence of the state. On 25 May 1946, the day that the treaty was ratified by the Transjordan parliament, Transjordan was raised to the status of a kingdom under the name of the ''Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan'' in Arabic, with Abdullah as its first king; although it continued to be referred to as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan in English until 1949. 25 May is now celebrated as the nation's [[Independence Day (Jordan)|Independence Day]], a [[Public holidays in Jordan|public holiday]]. Jordan became a member of the United Nations on 14 December 1955.

On 15 May 1948, as part of the [[1948 Palestine war]], Jordan intervened along with several other Arab states. Following the war, Jordan controlled the [[West Bank]], and on 24 April 1950 Jordan formally [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|annexed these territories]] after the [[Jericho Conference]]. In response, some Arab countries demanded Jordan's expulsion from the [[Arab League]]. On 12 June 1950, the Arab League declared that the annexation was a temporary, practical measure and that Jordan was holding the territory as a "trustee" pending a future settlement.

King Abdullah was assassinated at the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in 1951 by a Palestinian militant, amid rumors he intended to sign a peace treaty with Israel. who ascended to the throne in 1953 at age 17. Jordan witnessed great political uncertainty in the following period. On 1 March 1956, King Hussein [[Arabization of the Jordanian Army command|Arabised the command of the Army]] by dismissing a number of senior British officers, an act made to remove remaining foreign influence in the country. In 1958, Jordan and neighbouring [[Kingdom of Iraq|Hashemite Iraq]] formed the [[Arab Federation]] as a response to the formation of the rival [[United Arab Republic]] between Nasser's Egypt and Syria.

[[File:Karama aftermath 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] on 21 March 1968 checking an abandoned [[Israel]]i tank in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Karameh]].]]

Jordan signed a military pact with Egypt just before Israel launched a preemptive strike on Egypt to begin the [[Six-Day War]] in June 1967, where Jordan and Syria joined the war. Despite the fact that the Palestinians had limited involvement against the Israeli forces, the events at Karameh gained wide recognition and acclaim in the Arab world.

In 1973, Egypt and Syria waged the [[Yom Kippur War]] on Israel, and fighting occurred along the 1967 [[Jordan River]] cease-fire line. Abdullah embarked on economic liberalisation when he assumed the throne, and his reforms led to an economic boom which continued until 2008. However, during the following years Jordan's economy experienced hardship as it dealt with the effects of the [[Great Recession]] and spillover from the [[Arab Spring]].

[[Al-Qaeda]] under [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]]'s leadership launched [[2005 Amman bombings|coordinated explosions]] in three hotel lobbies in Amman on 9 November 2005, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The attack is considered to be a rare event in the country, and Jordan's [[General Intelligence Directorate (Jordan)|internal security]] was dramatically improved afterwards. Abdullah and Jordan are viewed with contempt by Islamic extremists for the country's peace treaty with Israel, its relationship with the West, and its mostly non-religious laws.

The Arab Spring were large-scale protests that erupted in the [[Arab world]] in 2011, demanding economic and political reforms. Proportional representation was re-introduced to the Jordanian parliament in the [[2016 Jordanian general election|2016 general election]], a move which he said would eventually lead to establishing parliamentary governments. Jordan was left largely unscathed from the violence that swept the region despite an influx of 1.4&nbsp;million Syrian refugees into the natural resources-lacking country and the emergence of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL).<ref name="hhjdrp"/>

On 4 April 2021, [[2021 arrests in Jordan|19 people were arrested]], including [[Prince Hamzah bin Hussein|Prince Hamzeh]], the former crown prince of Jordan, who was placed under house arrest, after having been accused of working to "destabilize" the kingdom.
