=== Prehistory and early history ===
Archaeological excavations have revealed the existence of humans in what is now Vietnam as early as the [[Paleolithic]] age. Stone artefacts excavated in [[Gia Lai province]] have been claimed to date to 780,000 years ago, based on associated find of [[tektite]]s, however this claim has been challenged because tektites are often found in archaeological sites of various ages in Vietnam.  ''[[Homo erectus]]'' fossils dating to around 500,000 BC have been found in caves in [[Lạng Sơn province|Lạng Sơn]] and [[Nghệ An province|Nghệ An]] provinces in northern Vietnam.{{sfn|McKinney|2009}} The oldest ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' fossils from mainland Southeast Asia are of [[Middle Pleistocene]] provenance, and include isolated tooth fragments from Tham Om and Hang Hum.{{sfn|Akazawa|Aoki|Kimura|1992|p=321}}{{sfn|Rabett|2012|p=109}}{{sfn|Dennell|Porr|2014|p=41}} Teeth attributed to ''Homo sapiens'' from the [[Late Pleistocene]] have been found at Dong Can,{{sfn|Matsumura|Yoneda|Yukio|Oxenham|2008|p=12}} and from the Early [[Holocene]] at Mai Da Dieu,{{sfn|Matsumura|Lan Cuong|Kim Thuy|Anezaki|2001}}{{sfn|Oxenham|Tayles|2006|p=36}} Lang Gao{{sfn|Nguyen|1985|p=16}}{{sfn|Karlstrom|Kallen|2002|p=83}} and Lang Cuom.{{sfn|Oxenham|Buckley|2015|p=329}} Areas comprising what is now Vietnam participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archaeological research.

By about 1,000 BC, the development of wet-[[rice]] cultivation in the [[Ma River]] and [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] floodplains led to the flourishing of [[Đông Sơn culture]],{{sfn|Higham|1984}}{{sfn|Nang Chung|Giang Hai|2017|p=31}} notable for its [[bronze]] casting used to make elaborate bronze [[Đông Sơn drums]].{{sfn|de Laet|Herrmann|1996|p=408}}{{sfn|Calo|2009|p=51}}{{sfn|Kiernan|2017|p=31}} This culture spread to the rest of [[Southeast Asia]], including [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], throughout the first millennium BC.{{sfn|Calo|2009|p=51}}{{sfn|Cooke|Li|Anderson|2011|p=46}}

[[File:Nguyen Dynasty, administrative divisions map (1838).svg|thumb|Vietnam's territories around 1838, during the [[Vietnamese invasions of Cambodia|Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia]]]]
According to Vietnamese legends, the [[Hồng Bàng dynasty]] of the [[Hùng kings]], first established in 2879 BC, is considered the first state established in Vietnam (then known as Xích Quỷ and later [[Văn Lang]]).{{sfn|Pelley|2002|p=151}} Văn Lang was established by [[Lạc Việt]] tribes,{{sfn|Kiernan|2017|p=53}} who were likely a confederacy of multilingual [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] and [[Kra-Dai languages|Kra-Dai]] speakers who occupied the [[Red River Delta]] in northern Vietnam.{{sfn|Kiernan|2017|p=42}}

In 257 BC, the last Hùng king was defeated by Thục Phán. He consolidated the [[Lạc Việt]] and [[Âu Việt]] tribes, who came from southern China, to form the [[Âu Lạc]], proclaiming himself [[An Dương Vương]].{{sfn|Duc Tran|Thu Ha|2000|p=8}}

In 179 BC, a Chinese general named [[Zhao Tuo]] ("Triệu Đà") defeated An Dương Vương and consolidated Âu Lạc into [[Nanyue]].{{sfn|Nang Chung|Giang Hai|2017|p=31}} However, Nanyue was itself [[Southward expansion of the Han dynasty|incorporated into the empire]] of the Chinese [[Han dynasty]] in 111 BC after the [[Han–Nanyue War]].{{sfn|Ooi|2004|p=932}}{{sfn|Yao|2016|p=62}} Before the Han dynasty's invasion, Vietnam was marked by a vibrant mix of religion, culture, and social norms. For the next thousand years, what is now northern Vietnam remained mostly under [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|Chinese rule]].{{sfn|Holmgren|1980}}{{sfn|Taylor|1983|p=30}}{{sfn|Buttinger|1968|p=18, Ch.2}} Early independence movements, such as those of the [[Trưng Sisters]] and [[Lady Triệu]],{{sfn|Pelley|2002|p=177}} were temporarily successful,{{sfn|Cottrell|2009|p=15}} though the region gained a longer period of independence as Vạn Xuân under the [[Anterior Lý dynasty]] between AD 544 and 602.{{sfn|Thai Nguyen|Mung Nguyen|1958|p=33}}{{sfn|Chesneaux|1966|p=20}}{{sfn|University of California|1972|p=24}}{{verify source|date=December 2024}} By the early 10th century, northern Vietnam had gained autonomy, but not sovereignty, under the [[Khúc family]].{{sfn|Tuyet Tran|Reid|2006|p=32}}

In AD 938, the Vietnamese lord [[Ngô Quyền]] defeated the forces of the Chinese [[Southern Han]] state at [[Battle of Bạch Đằng (938)|Bạch Đằng River]] and achieved full independence for Vietnam in 939 after a millennium of Chinese domination.{{sfn|Hien Le|2003|p=65}}{{sfn|Hong Lien|Sharrock|2014|p=55}}{{sfn|Kiernan|2017|p=226}} By the 960s, the dynastic [[Đại Việt]] (''Great Viet'') kingdom was established, and Vietnamese society enjoyed a golden era under the Lý and [[Trần dynasty|Trần]] dynasties. During the rule of the Trần dynasty, Đại Việt repelled three [[Mongol invasions of Vietnam|Mongol invasions]].{{sfn|Cottrell|2009|p=16}}{{sfn|Hong Lien|Sharrock|2014|p=95}} Meanwhile, the [[Mahāyāna]] branch of [[Buddhism in Vietnam|Buddhism]] flourished and became the state religion.{{sfn|Kiernan|2017|p=226}}{{sfn|Keyes|1995|p=183}} Following the 1406–7 [[Ming–Hồ War]], which overthrew the [[Hồ dynasty]], Vietnamese independence was [[Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam|interrupted briefly]] by the Chinese [[Ming dynasty]], but was restored by [[Lê Lợi]], the founder of the [[Lê dynasty]].{{sfn|Hong Lien|Sharrock|2014|p=111}} The Vietnamese polity reached their zenith in the Lê dynasty of the 15th century, especially during the reign of emperor [[Lê Thánh Tông]] (1460–1497).{{sfn|Hong Lien|Sharrock|2014|p=120}}{{sfn|Kiernan|2017|p=265}} Between the 11th and 18th centuries, the Vietnamese polity expanded southward in a gradual process known as {{lang|vi|[[Nam tiến]]}} ("Southward expansion"),{{sfn|Anderson|Whitmore|2014|p=158}} eventually conquering the kingdom of [[Champa]] and part of the [[Post-Angkor Period|Khmer Kingdom]].{{sfn|Vo|2011|p=13}}{{sfn|Ooi|Anh Tuan|2015|p=212}}{{sfn|Phuong Linh|2016|p=39}}

From the 16th century onward, civil strife and frequent political infighting engulfed much of Đại Việt. First, the Chinese-supported [[Mạc dynasty]] challenged the Lê dynasty's power.{{sfn|Anderson|Whitmore|2014|p=174}} After the Mạc dynasty was defeated, the Lê dynasty was nominally reinstalled. Actual power, however, was divided between the northern [[Trịnh lords]] and the southern [[Nguyễn lords]], who engaged in a [[Trịnh–Nguyễn War|civil war]] for more than four decades before a truce was called in the 1670s.{{sfn|Leonard|1984|p=131}} Vietnam was divided into North (Trịnh) and South (Nguyễn) from 1600 to 1777. During this period, the Nguyễn expanded into the [[Mekong Delta]], annexing the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] and the Khmer lands in the Mekong Delta.{{sfn|Vo|2011|p=13}}{{sfn|Phuong Linh|2016|p=39}}{{sfn|Ooi|2004|p=356}} The division of the country ended a century later when the [[Tây Sơn]] brothers helped Trịnh to end Nguyễn; they also established a new dynasty and ended Trịnh. However, their rule did not last long, and they were defeated by the remnants of the Nguyễn lords, led by [[Gia Long|Nguyễn Ánh]]. Nguyễn Ánh unified Vietnam, and established the [[Nguyễn dynasty]], ruling under the name [[Gia Long]].{{sfn|Ooi|2004|p=356}}

=== French Indochina ===
{{Further|Cochinchina campaign|Tonkin campaign|Sino-French War|French Indochina}}

In the 1500s, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] explored the Vietnamese coast and reportedly erected a [[stele]] on the [[Chàm Islands]] to mark their presence.{{sfn|Hoang|2007|p=50}} By 1533, they began landing in the Vietnamese delta but were forced to leave because of local turmoil and fighting. They also had less interest in the territory than they did in China and Japan.{{sfn|Hoang|2007|p=50}} After they had settled in [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] and [[Portuguese Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] to begin the profitable Macau–Japan trade route, the Portuguese began to involve themselves in trade with [[Hội An]].{{sfn|Hoang|2007|p=50}} Portuguese traders and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries under the ''[[Padroado]]'' system were active in both Vietnamese realms of ''[[Đàng Trong]]'' ([[Cochinchina]] or Quinan) and ''[[Đàng Ngoài]]'' ([[Tonkin]]) in the 17th century.{{sfn|Tran|2018}} The [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] also tried to establish contact with Quinan in 1601 but failed to sustain a presence there after several violent encounters with the locals. The [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) only managed to establish official relations with Tonkin in the spring of 1637 after leaving [[Dejima]] in Japan to establish trade for [[silk]].{{sfn|Hoang|2007|p=52}} Meanwhile, in 1613, the first [[Kingdom of England|English]] attempt to establish contact with Hội An failed following a violent incident involving the [[East India Company]]. By 1672, the English did establish relations with Tonkin and were allowed to reside in [[Hưng Yên|Phố Hiến]].{{sfn|Hoang|2007|p=53}}
[[File:Prise de Saigon 18 Fevrier 1859 Antoine Morel-Fatio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Siege of Saigon|Capture of Saigon]] by [[Charles Rigault de Genouilly]] on 18 February 1859]]
Between 1615 and 1753, French traders also engaged in trade in Vietnam.{{sfn|Li|1998|p=89}}{{sfn|Lockard|2010|p=479}} The first French missionaries<!--Joseph Francis Tissanier and Pierre Jacques Albier, SJ--> arrived in 1658, under the Portuguese ''Padroado''. From its foundation, the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]] under [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|''Propaganda Fide'']] actively sent missionaries to Vietnam, entering Cochinchina first<!--Louis Chevreuil--> in 1664 and Tonkin first<!--François Deydier--> in 1666.{{sfn|Tran|2017|p=27}} Spanish [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] joined the Tonkin mission in 1676, and [[Franciscans]] were in Cochinchina from 1719 to 1834. The Vietnamese authorities began{{when|date=October 2020}} to feel threatened by continuous [[Christianisation]] activities.{{sfn|McLeod|1991|p=22}} After several Catholic missionaries were detained, the [[French Navy]] intervened in 1843 to free them, as the kingdom was perceived as [[xenophobic]].{{sfn|Woods|2002|p=42}} In a series of conquests from 1859 to 1885, [[French colonial empire|France eroded]] Vietnam's sovereignty.{{sfn|Cortada|1994|p=29}} At the [[siege of Tourane]] in 1858, France was aided by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] (with Filipino, [[Latin American Asian|Latin American]], and Spanish troops from the [[Philippines]]) and perhaps some Tonkinese Catholics.{{sfn|Keith|2012|p=46}} After the [[Treaty of Saigon (1862)|1862 Treaty]], and especially after France completely conquered [[Southern Vietnam|Lower Cochinchina]] in 1867, the [[Văn Thân movement]] of scholar-gentry class arose and committed violence against [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] across central and northern Vietnam.{{sfn|Keith|2012|pp=49–50}}

Between 1862 and 1867, the southern third of the country became the [[French Cochinchina|French colony of Cochinchina]].{{sfn|McLeod|1991|p=61}} By 1884, the entire country was under French rule, with the central and northern parts of Vietnam separated into the two protectorates of [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] and [[Tonkin (French protectorate)|Tonkin]]. The three entities were formally integrated into the union of [[French Indochina]] in 1887.{{sfn|Ooi|2004|p=520}}{{sfn|Cook|2001|p=396}} The French administration imposed significant political and cultural changes on Vietnamese society.{{sfn|Frankum|2011|p=172}} A Western-style system of modern education introduced new [[humanism|humanist]] values.{{sfn|Nhu Nguyen|2016|p=37}} Most French settlers in Indochina were concentrated in Cochinchina, particularly in [[Saigon]], and in [[Hanoi]], the colony's capital.{{sfn|Richardson|1876|p=269}}

During the early colonial period, guerrillas of the royalist [[Cần Vương movement]] rebelled against French rule and massacred around a third of [[Christianity in Vietnam|Vietnam's Christian]] population.{{sfn|Keith|2012|p=53}} Anti-Catholic violence persisted in Nam Định, Quảng Trị, and Bình Định during the 1880s.{{sfn|Ramsay|2008|p=171}} The French strategy for pacification in Vietnam relied more on alliances with local notables than on Christian missions to establish control and manage resistance.{{sfn|Quach-Langlet|1991|p=361}} The French developed a [[plantation economy]] to promote export of [[tobacco]], [[indigo dye|indigo]], [[tea]] and [[coffee]].{{sfn|Lim|2014|p=33}} However, they largely ignored the increasing demands for civil rights and [[self-government]]. An increasing dissatisfaction even led to half-hearted, badly coordinated, and still worse executed plots to oust the French, like the infamous [[Hanoi Poison Plot]] of 1908. Another large-scale rebellion, the [[Thái Nguyên uprising]] in 1917, was also suppressed heavily.{{sfn|Zinoman|2000}} 
[[File:ExpositionHanoi1902 GrandPalais (1).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Photograph of the Grand Palais building in Hanoi|The [[Grand Palais (Hanoi)|Grand Palais]] built for the [[Hanoi exhibition|1902–1903 world's fair]], when [[Hanoi]] became French Indochina's capital]]
A nationalist political movement soon emerged, with leaders like [[Phan Bội Châu]], [[Phan Châu Trinh]], [[Phan Đình Phùng]], Emperor [[Hàm Nghi]], and [[Ho Chi Minh]] fighting or calling for independence.{{sfn|Largo|2002|p=112}} This resulted in the 1930 [[Yên Bái mutiny]] by the [[Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng|Vietnamese Nationalist Party]] (VNQDĐ), which the French quashed. The mutiny split the independence movement, as many leading members converted to [[communism]].{{sfn|Khanh Huynh|1986|p=98}}{{sfn|Odell|Castillo|2008|p=82}}{{sfn|Thomas|2012}}

The French maintained full control of their colonies until World War II, when the [[Pacific War|war in the Pacific]] led to the [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina]] in 1940. Afterwards, the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] was allowed to station its troops in Vietnam while the pro-[[Vichy France|Vichy French]] colonial administration continued.{{sfn|Miller|1990|p=293}}{{sfn|Gettleman|Franklin|Young|Franklin|1995|p=4}} Japan exploited Vietnam's natural resources to support its military campaigns, culminating in a [[Japanese coup d'état in French Indochina|full-scale takeover of the country]] in March 1945. This led to the [[Vietnamese famine of 1944–1945]], which killed up to two million people.{{sfn|Thanh Nien|2015}}{{sfn|''Vietnam Net''|2015}}

=== First Indochina War ===
{{Further|Civil conflicts in Vietnam (1945–1949)|First Indochina War|1954 Geneva Conference}}
In 1941, the [[Viet Minh|Việt Minh]], a communist-led national liberation movement, emerged under [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s leadership.{{sfn|Joes|1992|p=95}}{{sfn|Pike|2011|p=192}} Mass political mobilization intensified during the [[French Indochina in World War II|Japanese military occupation of Indochina]], and nationalist parties fostered a stronger sense of national identity. After Japan's defeat in World War II, the Việt Minh seized Hanoi and Huế in August 1945, dissolved the [[Empire of Vietnam]], and established a provisional government that declared national independence on 2 September.{{sfn|Pike|2011|p=192}} In the south, Saigon's administrative services collapsed, and chaos, riots, and murder were widespread.{{sfn|Gunn|2014|p=270}} 

In August 1945, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] had decided to divide Indochina at the [[16th parallel north|16th parallel]] to allow [[Chiang Kai-shek]] of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] to [[Chinese occupation of northern Vietnam, 1945–1946|receive the Japanese surrender in the north]] while Britain's [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]] received their surrender in the south. The Allies agreed that Indochina still belonged to France.{{sfn|Neville|2007|p=175}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=6}}

But as the French were weakened by the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation]], [[British Raj|British-Indian]] forces and the remaining Japanese [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group]] were used to maintain order and help France reestablish control through the [[War in Vietnam (1945–1946)|1945–1946 War in Vietnam]], south of the 16th parallel.{{sfn|Neville|2007|p=124}} The Viet Minh sought to consolidate power by terrorizing and purging rival Vietnamese [[Vietnamese nationalism|nationalist groups]] and [[Trotskyism in Vietnam|Trotskyist leaders]].{{sfn|Guillemot|2004}}{{sfn|Kort|2017|pages=62–63, 81–85}}{{sfn|Tran|2022|pages=24–30}}{{sfn|Marr|2013|pages=383–441}} In 1946, the Franco-Chinese and [[Ho–Sainteny Agreement]]s enabled French forces to replace the Chinese north of the 16th parallel and facilitated a coexistence between the DRV and the French that strengthened the Viet Minh while undermining the nationalists.{{sfn|Goscha|2016|pages=204–208}}{{sfn|Holcombe |2020|pages=35, 38–44}} That summer, the Viet Minh, in collaboration with French forces, eliminated rival nationalist parties.{{sfn|Kort|2017|pages=83–84}}{{sfn|Reilly|2018|pages=175–177}}{{sfn|Guillemot|2004|pages=205–207}}{{sfn|Tran|2023|pages=699–700}} Hồ chose to take a compromising stance to avoid military conflict with France, asking the French to withdraw their colonial administrators and for French professors and engineers to help build a modern independent Vietnam.{{sfn|Pike|2011|p=192}} But [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|France]] did not act on these requests, including the idea of independence, and dispatched the [[French Far East Expeditionary Corps]] to restore colonial rule. With negotiations having broken down,{{sfn|Asselin|2024|pages=73–81}} tensions between the Viet Minh and French authorities erupted into the full-scale [[First Indochina War]] in December 1946.{{sfn|Joes|1992|p=95}}{{sfn|Pike|2011|p=192}}{{sfn|Tonnesson|2011|p=66}} Surviving nationalist partisans and politico-religious groups rallied behind the exiled [[Bảo Đại]] to reopen negotiations with [[French Fourth Republic|France]], ultimately establishing the [[State of Vietnam]] in opposition to communist domination.{{sfn|Goscha|2016|pages=238–247}} The defeat of [[French Union]] forces in the 1954 [[Battle of Điện Biên Phủ]] allowed Hồ to negotiate a ceasefire from a favourable position at the subsequent [[1954 Geneva Conference|Geneva Conference]].{{sfn|Pike|2011|p=192}}{{sfn|Waite|2012|p=89}}

The colonial administration was thereby ended and French Indochina was dissolved under the Geneva Accords of 21 July 1954 into three countries—Vietnam, and the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Cambodia (1953–1970)|Cambodia]] and [[Kingdom of Laos|Laos]]. Vietnam was further divided into North and South administrative regions at the [[Vietnamese Demilitarised Zone|Demilitarised Zone]], roughly along the [[17th parallel north]] (pending elections scheduled for July 1956{{efn|Neither the American government nor Ngô Đình Diệm's State of Vietnam signed anything at the 1954 Geneva Conference.

In October 1955, Ngô Đình Diệm toppled [[Bảo Đại]] in a fraudulent [[1955 State of Vietnam referendum|referendum]] organised by his brother [[Ngô Đình Nhu]], and proclaimed himself president of the [[Republic of Vietnam]].{{sfn|van Dijk|Gray|Savranskaya|Suri|2013|p=68}}

{{Main|Vietnam War}}
From 1953 to 1956, the [[North Vietnam]]ese government instituted [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] reforms including "[[Rent regulation|rent reduction]]" and "[[Land reform in Vietnam|land reform]]", which resulted in significant [[political repression]].{{sfn|Moise|2017|p=56}} This included 13,500 to as many as 100,000 executions.{{sfn|Vu|2007}}{{sfn|Turner|1975|p=143}} In the South, Diệm countered North Vietnamese subversion (including the assassination of over 450 South Vietnamese officials in 1956) by detaining tens of thousands of suspected communists in "political reeducation centres".{{sfn|Heneghan|1969|p=160}}{{sfn|Turner|1975|p=177}} This programme incarcerated many non-communists, but was successful at curtailing [[communism|communist]] activity in the country, if only for a time.{{sfn|Crozier|1955}} The North Vietnamese government claimed that 2,148 people were killed in the process by November 1957.{{sfn|Turner|1975|pp=174–178}} The pro-Hanoi [[Viet Cong]] began a guerrilla campaign in [[South Vietnam]] in the late 1950s to overthrow Diệm's government.{{sfn|Gilbert|2013|p=292}} From 1960, the Soviet Union and North Vietnam signed treaties providing for further Soviet military support.{{sfn|Jukes|1973|p=209}}{{sfn|Olsen|2007|p=92}}{{sfn|Khoo|2011|p=27}} The [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]] in the south was supported by the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[South Korea]], [[Thailand]], and [[Kingdom of Laos|Laos]] while the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] in the north was supported by the [[Soviet Union]], [[China|People's Republic of China]],{{sfn|van Dijk|Gray|Savranskaya|Suri|2013|p=68}} [[Khmer Rouge]], and later, [[Sweden]].

On 2 July 1976, North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|1976}} The war had devastated Vietnam and killed 966,000 to 3.8&nbsp;million people.{{sfn|Hirschman|Preston|Manh Loi|1995}}{{sfn|Shenon|1995}}{{sfn|Obermeyer|Murray|Gakidou|2008}} A 1974 US Senate subcommittee estimated nearly 1.4&nbsp;million [[Vietnam War casualties|Vietnamese civilians]] were killed or wounded between 1965 and 1974—including 415,000 killed.{{sfn|Dohrenwend|Turse|Wall|Yager|2018|p=69}} In its aftermath, under [[Lê Duẩn]]'s administration, there were no mass executions of South Vietnamese who had collaborated with the US or the defunct South Vietnamese government, confounding Western fears,{{sfn|Elliott|2010|pp=499, 512–513}} but up to 300,000 South Vietnamese were sent to [[Re-education camp (Vietnam)|reeducation camps]], where many endured torture, starvation, and disease while being forced to perform hard labour.{{sfn|Sagan|Denny|1982}} The government embarked on a mass campaign of [[collectivisation]] of farms and factories.{{sfn|Spokesman-Review|1977|p=8}} Many fled the country following the conclusion of the war.{{Sfn|Moise|1988|p=12}} In 1978, in response to the [[Khmer Rouge]] government of Cambodia ordering massacres of Vietnamese residents in the border villages in the districts of [[An Giang province|An Giang]] and [[Kiên Giang province|Kiên Giang]],{{sfn|Kissi|2006|p=144}} the Vietnamese military [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War|invaded Cambodia]] and removed them from power after occupying [[Phnom Penh]].{{sfn|Meggle|2004|p=166}} The intervention was a success, resulting in the establishment of a new, pro-Vietnam socialist government, the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]], which ruled until 1989.{{sfn|Hampson|1996|p=175}} However, this worsened relations with China, which had supported the Khmer Rouge. China later launched a [[Sino-Vietnamese War|brief incursion into northern Vietnam]] in 1979, causing Vietnam to rely even more heavily on Soviet economic and military aid, while mistrust of the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] escalated.{{sfn|Khoo|2011|p=131}}

At the [[6th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|Sixth National Congress]] of the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] (CPV) in December 1986, reformist politicians replaced the "old guard" government with new leadership.{{sfn|BBC News|1997}}{{sfn|Van Phuc|2014}} The reformers were led by 71-year-old [[Nguyễn Văn Linh]], who became the party's new general secretary.{{sfn|BBC News|1997}} He and the reformers implemented a series of market reforms known as {{lang|vi|[[Đổi Mới]]}} ("Renovation") that carefully managed the transition from a [[planned economy]] to a "[[socialist-oriented market economy]]".{{sfn|Murray|1997|pp=24–25}}{{sfn|Bich Loan|2007}} Although the authority of the state remained unchallenged under ''Đổi Mới'', the government encouraged [[private ownership]] of farms and factories, economic deregulation, and foreign investment, while maintaining control over strategic industries.{{sfn|Bich Loan|2007}}{{sfn|Howe|2016|p=20}} Subsequently, Vietnam's economy achieved strong growth in agricultural and industrial production, construction, exports, and foreign investment, although these reforms also resulted in a rise in income inequality and gender disparities.{{sfn|Goodkind|1995}}{{sfn|Gallup|2002}}{{sfn|Wagstaff|van Doorslaer|Watanabe|2003}}

In 2021, [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam]], [[Nguyễn Phú Trọng]], was re-elected for his third term in office, meaning he was Vietnam's most powerful leader in decades. He died 19 July 2024, and was followed by [[Tô Lâm]] as General Secretary of the Communist Party.
