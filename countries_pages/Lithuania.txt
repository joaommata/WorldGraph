The history of Lithuania dates back to settlements founded about 10,000 years ago. The first people settled in the territory of Lithuania after the [[Last Glacial Period]] in the 10th millennium BC: [[Kunda culture|Kunda]], [[Neman culture|Neman]] and [[Narva culture]]s. They were traveling hunters. In the 8th millennium BC the climate became warmer and forests developed. The inhabitants of what is now Lithuania travelled less and engaged in local [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting, gathering]] and fresh-water fishing. The [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-Europeans]], who arrived in the 3rd – 2nd millennium BC, mixed with the local population and formed various Baltic tribes. The [[Balts]] did not maintain close cultural or political contacts with the [[Roman Empire]], while maintaining trade contacts via the [[Amber Road]].

From the 9th to the 11th centuries, coastal Balts were subjected to raids by the [[Vikings]]. Lithuania comprised mainly the culturally different regions of [[Samogitia]] (known for its early medieval skeletal burials), and further east [[Aukštaitija]], or [[Lithuania proper]] (known for its early medieval cremation burials). The area was remote and unattractive to outsiders, including traders, which accounts for its separate linguistic, cultural and religious identity and delayed integration into general European patterns and trends. Traditional [[Lithuanian mythology|Lithuanian pagan customs and mythology]], with many archaic elements, were long preserved. Rulers' bodies were cremated up until the conversion to Christianity.

===Kingdom of Lithuania, Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===

[[File:Lithuanian state in 13-15th centuries.png|thumb|Changes in the territory of Lithuania from the 13th to 15th century. At its peak, Lithuania was the largest state in Europe. Facing the [[Livonian Crusade|German threat]], [[Mindaugas]] in the middle of the 13th century united a large part of the Baltic tribes and founded the State of Lithuania, while in 1253 he was crowned as the Catholic [[Kingdom of Lithuania|King of Lithuania]]. Moreover by taking advantage of the weakened territory of the former [[Kievan Rus']] due to the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Mongol invasion]], Mindaugas incorporated [[Black Ruthenia]] into Lithuania. [[Traidenis]] during his reign (1269–1282) reunified all Lithuanian lands and achieved military successes against the crusaders, fighting alongside other Baltic tribes, but was unable to militarily assist the [[Old Prussians]] in their [[Prussian uprisings#The Great Prussian uprising (1260–1274)|Great Uprising]]. Traidenis' main residence was in [[Kernavė]]. At the end of the 14th century Lithuania was the largest country in [[Europe]]. In 1385, Lithuania formed a [[dynastic union]] with [[History of Poland during the Jagiellonian dynasty|Poland]] through the [[Union of Krewo]]. Wars with the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic State]] in [[Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War|1409-1411]] and [[Golub War|in 1422]] concluded with the [[Treaty of Melno]]. The real union strongly intensified the [[Polonization]] of Lithuania and Lithuanian nobility.

The mid-17th century was marked with disastrous military losses for Lithuania as during the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]] most of the territory of Lithuania was annexed by the Tsardom of Russia, and [[Battle of Vilnius (1655)|Vilnius was captured]] for the first time by a foreign army and ravaged. In 1655, Lithuania unilaterally [[Union of Kėdainiai|seceded from Poland]], declared Swedish King [[Charles X Gustav]] as the Grand Duke of Lithuania and fell under the [[Swedish Lithuania|protection of the Swedish Empire]]. However, by 1657 Lithuania was once again a part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth following the Lithuanian revolt against the Swedes. Vilnius was recaptured from the Russians in 1661.

In the second half of the 18th century the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was three times [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned]] by three neighboring countries which completely [[Dissolution (politics)|dissoluted]] both independent Lithuania and Poland from the political map in 1795 after a failed [[Kościuszko Uprising]] and short-lived [[Vilnius uprising (1794)|recapture of Vilnius]] in 1794.]]

Following the annexation the [[Tsarist autocracy|Russian Tsarist]] authorities implemented [[Russification]] policies in Lithuania, which then made a part of a new administrative region [[Northwestern Krai]]. In 1812 [[Napoleon]] during the [[French invasion of Russia]] established the puppet [[Lithuanian Provisional Governing Commission]] to support his war efforts. After Napoleon's defeat the Russian rule was reinstated in Lithuania. Lithuanians resisted Russification through an extensive network of [[Lithuanian book smugglers]], secret Lithuanian publishing and homeschooling. Moreover, the [[Lithuanian National Revival]], inspired by Lithuanian history, language and culture, laid the foundations for the reestablishment of an independent Lithuania. The [[Great Seimas of Vilnius]] was held in 1905 and its participants adopted resolutions which demanded a wide [[Autonomy#Politics|autonomy]] for Lithuania. In 1917, the Lithuanians organized the [[Vilnius Conference]] which adopted a resolution, featuring the aspiration for the restoration of Lithuania's sovereignty and military alliance with Germany and elected the [[Council of Lithuania]]. The Lithuanian authorities prevented the [[1919 Polish coup attempt in Lithuania]], and in 1920 during the [[Żeligowski's Mutiny]] the Polish forces captured [[Vilnius Region]] and established a puppet state of the [[Republic of Central Lithuania]], which in 1922 was incorporated into Poland. In 1923, the [[Klaipėda Revolt]] was organized which unified the [[Klaipėda Region]] with Lithuania. The [[1926 Lithuanian coup d'état]] replaced the democratically elected government and [[Kazys Grinius#President (1926)|president]] with an authoritarian regime led by [[Antanas Smetona]]. In 1940 Lithuania accepted the [[Soviet ultimatum to Lithuania|Soviet ultimatum]] and recovered the control of its historical capital Vilnius, however, the acceptance resulted in the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|Soviet occupation of Lithuania]] and its transformation into the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. Since the late 1980s [[Sąjūdis]] movement sought for the restoration of independent Lithuania, and in 1989 the [[Baltic Way]] was held. After refusal to revoke the Act, [[Soviet Army|Soviet forces]] stormed the [[Seimas Palace]] while Lithuanians defended the democratically elected Council. The Act, the first such declaration in the USSR, later was a model and inspiration to other [[Soviet republics]], and strongly influenced the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

On 11 March 1990, the [[Supreme Council – Reconstituent Seimas|Supreme Council]] announced the restoration of Lithuania's independence. Lithuania became the first Soviet-occupied state to announce the restitution of independence. On 20 April 1990, the Soviets [[Soviet economic blockade of Lithuania|imposed an economic blockade]] by ceasing to deliver raw materials to Lithuania. Domestic industry and the population started feeling the lack of fuel, essential goods, and even hot water. Although the blockade lasted for 74 days, Lithuania did not renounce its declaration of independence.

Gradually, economic relations were restored. However, tensions peaked again in January 1991. Attempts were made to carry out a coup using the [[Soviet Armed Forces]], the Internal Army of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the USSR Committee for State Security ([[KGB]]). Because of the poor economic situation in Lithuania, the forces in Moscow thought the coup d'état would receive strong public support. People flooded to Vilnius to defend the [[Supreme Council – Reconstituent Seimas|Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania]] and independence. The coup ended with a few casualties and material loss. The [[Soviet Army]] killed 14 people and injured hundreds. A large part of the Lithuanian population participated in the [[January Events]].

On 31 May 2001, Lithuania joined the [[World Trade Organization]]. Since March 2004, Lithuania has been part of [[NATO]]. On 1 May 2004, it became a full member of the [[European Union]], and a member of the [[Schengen Agreement]] in December 2007. On 1 January 2015, [[Lithuania and the euro|Lithuania joined]] the [[eurozone]] and adopted the European Union's single currency. On 4 July 2018, Lithuania officially joined the [[OECD]]. On 24 February 2022, Lithuania declared a state of emergency in response to the 2022 [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]]. Together with seven other NATO member states, it invoked NATO [[North Atlantic Treaty#Article 4|Article 4]] to hold consultations on security.
