The history of Lithuania dates back to settlements founded about 10,000 years ago. The first people settled in the territory of Lithuania after the [[Last Glacial Period]] in the 10th millennium BC: [[Kunda culture|Kunda]], [[Neman culture|Neman]] and [[Narva culture]]s. They were traveling hunters. In the 8th millennium BC the climate became warmer and forests developed. The inhabitants of what is now Lithuania travelled less and engaged in local [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting, gathering]] and fresh-water fishing. The [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-Europeans]], who arrived in the 3rd – 2nd millennium BC, mixed with the local population and formed various Baltic tribes. The [[Balts]] did not maintain close cultural or political contacts with the [[Roman Empire]], while maintaining trade contacts via the [[Amber Road]].

From the 9th to the 11th centuries, coastal Balts were subjected to raids by the [[Vikings]]. Lithuania comprised mainly the culturally different regions of [[Samogitia]] (known for its early medieval skeletal burials), and further east [[Aukštaitija]], or [[Lithuania proper]] (known for its early medieval cremation burials). The area was remote and unattractive to outsiders, including traders, which accounts for its separate linguistic, cultural and religious identity and delayed integration into general European patterns and trends. Traditional [[Lithuanian mythology|Lithuanian pagan customs and mythology]], with many archaic elements, were long preserved. Rulers' bodies were cremated up until the conversion to Christianity.

===Kingdom of Lithuania, Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===

The first written record of the name for the country dates back to 1009 AD. Facing the [[Livonian Crusade|German threat]], [[Mindaugas]] in the middle of the 13th century united a large part of the Baltic tribes and founded the State of Lithuania, while in 1253 he was crowned as the Catholic [[Kingdom of Lithuania|King of Lithuania]]. Moreover by taking advantage of the weakened territory of the former [[Kievan Rus']] due to the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Mongol invasion]], Mindaugas incorporated [[Black Ruthenia]] into Lithuania. After Mindaugas' assassination in 1263, pagan Lithuania was again a target of the [[Lithuanian Crusade|Christian crusades]] of the [[Teutonic Order]] and [[Livonian Order]]. [[Traidenis]] during his reign (1269–1282) reunified all Lithuanian lands and achieved military successes against the crusaders, fighting alongside other Baltic tribes, but was unable to militarily assist the [[Old Prussians]] in their [[Prussian uprisings#The Great Prussian uprising (1260–1274)|Great Uprising]]. Traidenis' main residence was in [[Kernavė]].

From the late 13th century members of the [[Gediminids]] dynasty began ruling Lithuania. Grand Duke [[Gediminas]] consolidated a [[hereditary monarchy]] and established [[Vilnius]] as the [[capital city]] in [[Letters of Gediminas|his letters]]. [[Christianization of Lithuania|Lithuania was christianized]] and incorporated [[East Slavs]]' territories (e.g. principalities of [[Principality of Minsk|Minsk]], [[Principality of Kiev|Kyiv]], [[Principality of Polotsk|Polotsk]], [[Principality of Vitebsk|Vitebsk]], [[Principality of Smolensk|Smolensk]], etc.) significantly expanding the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]'s territory, expanding to ~650,000 km2 in the first half of the 14th century. At the end of the 14th century Lithuania was the largest country in [[Europe]]. In 1385, Lithuania formed a [[dynastic union]] with [[History of Poland during the Jagiellonian dynasty|Poland]] through the [[Union of Krewo]]. By the 15th century [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] [[Jagiellonian dynasty|members]] of the Lithuanian ruling Gediminids dynasty ruled Lithuania and Poland, as well as [[Kingdom of Hungary (1301–1526)|Hungary]], [[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|Croatia]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and [[Moldavia]]. Wars with the [[State of the Teutonic Order|Teutonic State]] in [[Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War|1409-1411]] and [[Golub War|in 1422]] concluded with the [[Treaty of Melno]].

In the 15th century the strengthened [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] renewed the [[Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars]] for the Lithuanian-controlled [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] territories. Due to the unsuccessful beginning of the [[Livonian War]], loss of land to the [[Tsardom of Russia]], and pressure by monarch [[Sigismund II Augustus]] (a supporter of a close Polish–Lithuanian union), the [[Lithuanian nobility]] agreed to conclude the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569 with the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]], which created the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] with a joint monarch, but Lithuania remained a separate state. After concluding the [[real union]], Lithuania and Poland jointly managed to reach [[List of wars involving Lithuania|military successes]] during the Livonian War, [[Polish–Lithuanian occupation of Moscow|occupation of Moscow]] (1610), [[Polish–Swedish War (1600–1611)|war with Sweden (1600–1611)]], [[Smolensk War|Smolensk war with Russia (1632–1634)]], etc. In 1588, [[Sigismund III Vasa]] personally confirmed the [[Statutes of Lithuania#Third Statute|Third Statute of Lithuania]] where it was stated that Lithuania and Poland have equal rights within the Commonwealth and ensured the [[separation of powers]]. The real union strongly intensified the [[Polonization]] of Lithuania and Lithuanian nobility.

The mid-17th century was marked with disastrous military losses for Lithuania as during the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]] most of the territory of Lithuania was annexed by the Tsardom of Russia, and [[Battle of Vilnius (1655)|Vilnius was captured]] for the first time by a foreign army and ravaged. In 1655, Lithuania unilaterally [[Union of Kėdainiai|seceded from Poland]], declared Swedish King [[Charles X Gustav]] as the Grand Duke of Lithuania and fell under the [[Swedish Lithuania|protection of the Swedish Empire]]. However, by 1657 Lithuania was once again a part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth following the Lithuanian revolt against the Swedes. Vilnius was recaptured from the Russians in 1661.

In the second half of the 18th century the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was three times [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned]] by three neighboring countries which completely [[Dissolution (politics)|dissoluted]] both independent Lithuania and Poland from the political map in 1795 after a failed [[Kościuszko Uprising]] and short-lived [[Vilnius uprising (1794)|recapture of Vilnius]] in 1794. Most of Lithuania's territory was [[Russian Partition|annexed by the Russian Empire]], while {{Interlanguage link|Užnemunė|lt=Užnemunė|lt}} was annexed by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].

===Efforts to restore statehood===

Following the annexation the [[Tsarist autocracy|Russian Tsarist]] authorities implemented [[Russification]] policies in Lithuania, which then made a part of a new administrative region [[Northwestern Krai]]. In 1812 [[Napoleon]] during the [[French invasion of Russia]] established the puppet [[Lithuanian Provisional Governing Commission]] to support his war efforts. After Napoleon's defeat the Russian rule was reinstated in Lithuania.

During the [[November Uprising]] (1830–1831) the Lithuanians and Poles jointly attempted to restore their statehoods, however the Russian victory resulted in stricter Russification measures: the [[Russian language]] was introduced in all government institutions, [[Vilnius University]] was closed in 1832, and theories that Lithuania had been a "Western Russian" state since its establishment were propagated. Subsequently, the Lithuanians once again tried to restore statehood by participating in the [[January Uprising]] (1863–1864), but yet another Russian victory resulted in even stronger Russification policies with the introduction of the [[Lithuanian press ban]], pressure on the [[Catholic Church in Lithuania]] and [[Mikhail Muravyov-Vilensky]]'s repressions. Lithuanians resisted Russification through an extensive network of [[Lithuanian book smugglers]], secret Lithuanian publishing and homeschooling. Moreover, the [[Lithuanian National Revival]], inspired by Lithuanian history, language and culture, laid the foundations for the reestablishment of an independent Lithuania. The [[Great Seimas of Vilnius]] was held in 1905 and its participants adopted resolutions which demanded a wide [[Autonomy#Politics|autonomy]] for Lithuania.

===Restored statehood and occupations===

During [[World War I]] the [[German Empire]] annexed Lithuanian territories from the Russian Empire and they became a part of ''[[Ober Ost]]''. In 1917, the Lithuanians organized the [[Vilnius Conference]] which adopted a resolution, featuring the aspiration for the restoration of Lithuania's sovereignty and military alliance with Germany and elected the [[Council of Lithuania]]. In 1918, the short-lived [[Kingdom of Lithuania (1918)|Kingdom of Lithuania]] was proclaimed; however on 16 February 1918 the Council of Lithuania adopted the [[Act of Independence of Lithuania]] which restored Lithuania as a democratic republic with its capital in Vilnius and without any political ties that existed with other nations in the past. 

In 1918–1920 Lithuanians defended the statehood of Lithuania against [[Lithuanian–Soviet War|Bolsheviks]], [[Lithuanian–Bermontian War|Bermontians]] and [[Polish–Lithuanian War|Poles]] during the [[Lithuanian Wars of Independence]]. The aims of the newly restored Lithuania clashed with [[Józef Piłsudski]]'s plans to create a federation ([[Intermarium]]) in territories previously ruled by the [[Jagiellonian dynasty|Jagiellonians]]. The Lithuanian authorities prevented the [[1919 Polish coup attempt in Lithuania]], and in 1920 during the [[Żeligowski's Mutiny]] the Polish forces captured [[Vilnius Region]] and established a puppet state of the [[Republic of Central Lithuania]], which in 1922 was incorporated into Poland. Consequently, [[Kaunas]] became the [[temporary capital of Lithuania]] where the [[Constituent Assembly of Lithuania]] was held and other primary Lithuanian institutions operated until 1940. In 1923, the [[Klaipėda Revolt]] was organized which unified the [[Klaipėda Region]] with Lithuania. The [[1926 Lithuanian coup d'état]] replaced the democratically elected government and [[Kazys Grinius#President (1926)|president]] with an authoritarian regime led by [[Antanas Smetona]].

In the late 1930s Lithuania accepted the [[1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania|1938 Polish ultimatum]], [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|1939 German ultimatum]] and transferred the Klaipėda Region to [[Nazi Germany]]. The 1939 [[Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty]] allowed the presence of Soviet troops in Lithuania. In 1940 Lithuania accepted the [[Soviet ultimatum to Lithuania|Soviet ultimatum]] and recovered the control of its historical capital Vilnius, however, the acceptance resulted in the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|Soviet occupation of Lithuania]] and its transformation into the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In 1941 during the [[June Uprising in Lithuania]] it was attempted to restore independent Lithuania and the [[Red Army]] was expelled from its territory, however in a few days Lithuania was [[German occupation of Lithuania during World War II|occupied by Nazi Germany]]. In 1944 Lithuania was [[Soviet re-occupation of the Baltic states (1944)|re-occupied by the Soviet Union]], and [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|Soviet political repressions]] along with [[Soviet deportations from Lithuania]] resumed. Thousands of [[Lithuanian partisans]] and their supporters attempted to militarily restore independent Lithuania, but their resistance was eventually suppressed in 1953 by the [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet authorities]] and their [[extermination battalion|collaborators]]. [[Jonas Žemaitis]], the chairman of the [[Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters]], was captured and executed in 1954, his successor as chairman [[Adolfas Ramanauskas]] was brutally tortured and executed in 1957. Since the late 1980s [[Sąjūdis]] movement sought for the restoration of independent Lithuania, and in 1989 the [[Baltic Way]] was held.

The Act, the first such declaration in the USSR, later was a model and inspiration to other [[Soviet republics]], and strongly influenced the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

On 11 March 1990, the [[Supreme Council – Reconstituent Seimas|Supreme Council]] announced the restoration of Lithuania's independence. Lithuania became the first Soviet-occupied state to announce the restitution of independence. On 20 April 1990, the Soviets [[Soviet economic blockade of Lithuania|imposed an economic blockade]] by ceasing to deliver raw materials to Lithuania. Domestic industry and the population started feeling the lack of fuel, essential goods, and even hot water. Although the blockade lasted for 74 days, Lithuania did not renounce its declaration of independence.

Gradually, economic relations were restored. However, tensions peaked again in January 1991. Attempts were made to carry out a coup using the [[Soviet Armed Forces]], the Internal Army of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the USSR Committee for State Security ([[KGB]]). Because of the poor economic situation in Lithuania, the forces in Moscow thought the coup d'état would receive strong public support. People flooded to Vilnius to defend the [[Supreme Council – Reconstituent Seimas|Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania]] and independence. The coup ended with a few casualties and material loss. The [[Soviet Army]] killed 14 people and injured hundreds. A large part of the Lithuanian population participated in the [[January Events]]. On 31 July 1991, Soviet paramilitaries killed 7 Lithuanian border guards on the Belarusian border in what became known as the [[Medininkai Massacre]]. On 17 September, Lithuania was admitted to the [[United Nations]].

On 25 October 1992, citizens voted in a referendum to adopt the [[Constitution of Lithuania|current constitution]]. On 14 February 1993, during the direct general elections, [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] became the first president after the restoration of independence. On 31 August 1993 the last units of the former Soviet Army left Lithuania.

On 31 May 2001, Lithuania joined the [[World Trade Organization]]. Since March 2004, Lithuania has been part of [[NATO]]. On 1 May 2004, it became a full member of the [[European Union]], and a member of the [[Schengen Agreement]] in December 2007. On 1 January 2015, [[Lithuania and the euro|Lithuania joined]] the [[eurozone]] and adopted the European Union's single currency. On 4 July 2018, Lithuania officially joined the [[OECD]]. On 24 February 2022, Lithuania declared a state of emergency in response to the 2022 [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]]. Together with seven other NATO member states, it invoked NATO [[North Atlantic Treaty#Article 4|Article 4]] to hold consultations on security.
