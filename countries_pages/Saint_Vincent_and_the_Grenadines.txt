===Pre-colonial period===
[[Saint Vincent (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines)|Saint Vincent]] was first inhabited by the [[Ciboney]] people from [[South America]] around 5000 B.C. They were succeeded by the [[Arawak]]s around the 3rd century A.D., who were later displaced by the [[Kalinago]] in the 14th century.

=== European arrival and early colonial period ===
It is thought that [[Christopher Columbus]] sighted the island in 1498, giving it the name St Vincent. The [[Kalinago]] people aggressively opposed European settlement on Saint Vincent.

The British captured the island and drove out the French from Barrouallie during the [[Seven Years' War]], a claim confirmed by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]].

During the [[Anglo-French War (1778–1783)]], the French [[French capture of Saint Vincent|recaptured St Vincent]] in 1779. However, the British regained control under the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)]].

In 1902, the [[La Soufrière (volcano)|La Soufrière]] volcano erupted again, killing 1,500–2,000 people; much farmland was damaged, and the economy deteriorated.

In April 1979, [[La Soufrière (volcano)|La Soufrière]] erupted once more. Although no one was killed, thousands were evacuated and extensive agricultural damage occurred.

===Post-independence era===

[[Milton Cato]] of the centre-left [[Saint Vincent Labour Party]] (SVLP) was the country's first Prime Minister (he had been Premier since 1974), ruling until his defeat in the [[1984 Vincentian general election]] by [[James Fitz-Allen Mitchell]] of the centre-right [[New Democratic Party (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP).
