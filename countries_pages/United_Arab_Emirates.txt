=== Antiquity ===

Stone tools recovered reveal a settlement of people from Africa some 127,000 years ago and a stone tool used for butchering animals discovered on the Arabian coast suggests an even older habitation from 130,000 years ago. In time, lively trading links developed with civilisations in [[Mesopotamia]], Iran, and the [[Indus Valley civilisation|Harappan culture]] of the Indus Valley. This contact persisted and became wider, probably motivated by the trade in copper from the [[Hajar Mountains]], which commenced around 3,000 BCE. Sumerian sources talk of the [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] civilisation, which has been identified as encompassing the modern UAE and Oman.

There are six periods of human settlement with distinctive behaviours in the region before Islam, which include the [[Hafit period]] from 3,200 to 2,600 BCE, the [[Umm Al Nar culture]] from 2,600 to 2,000 BCE, and the [[Wadi Suq culture]] from 2,000 to 1,300 BCE. From 1,200 BCE to the advent of Islam in Eastern Arabia, through three distinctive [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron Ages]] and the [[Mleiha]] period, the area was variously occupied by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] and other forces, and saw the construction of fortified settlements and extensive husbandry thanks to the development of the [[Qanat|''falaj'']] irrigation system.

===Islam===
The spread of [[Islam]] to the northeastern tip of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] is thought to have followed directly from a letter sent by the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] to the rulers of [[Oman]] in 630 CE. This led to a group of rulers travelling to [[Medina]], converting to Islam, and subsequently driving a successful uprising against the unpopular [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanids]], who dominated the coast at the time.{{sfnp|Heard-Bey|1996|p=127}} Following the death of Muhammad, the new Islamic communities south of the [[Persian Gulf]] threatened to disintegrate, with insurrections against the [[Muslim leaders]]. Caliph [[Abu Bakr]] sent an army from the capital [[Medina]] which completed its reconquest of the territory ([[Ridda wars|the Ridda Wars]]) with the [[Battle of Dibba]] in which 10,000 lives are thought to have been lost.{{sfnp|Heard-Bey|1996|pp=127–128}} This assured the integrity of the [[Caliphate]] and the unification of the Arabian Peninsula under the newly emerging [[Rashidun Caliphate]].

In 637, Julfar (in the area of today's [[Ras Al Khaimah]]) was an important port that was used as a staging post for the Islamic invasion of the [[Sasanian Empire]]. The area of the [[Al Ain]]/[[Buraimi Oasis]] was known as Tu'am and was an important trading post for camel routes between the coast and the Arabian interior.{{sfnp|Heard-Bey|1996|pp=22–23}}

The earliest [[Christianity|Christian]] site in the UAE was first discovered in the 1990s, an extensive monastic complex on what is now known as [[Sir Bani Yas]] Island and which dates back to the seventh century. Thought to be [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] and built in 600 CE, the church appears to have been abandoned peacefully in 750 CE. It forms a rare physical link to a legacy of Christianity, which is thought to have spread across the peninsula from 50 to 350 CE following trade routes. Certainly, by the fifth century, Oman had a bishop named John – the last bishop of Oman being Etienne, in 676 CE.

=== Portuguese era ===

The harsh desert environment led to the emergence of the "versatile tribesman", nomadic groups who subsisted due to a variety of economic activities, including animal husbandry, agriculture, and hunting. The seasonal movements of these groups led not only to frequent clashes between groups but also to the establishment of seasonal and semi-seasonal settlements and centres. These formed tribal groupings whose names are still carried by modern Emiratis, including the [[Bani Yas]] and [[Al Nahyan family|Al Bu Falah]] of [[Abu Dhabi]], Al Ain, [[Liwa Oasis|Liwa]], and the west coast; the [[Dhawahir]], Awamir, [[Al Ali (tribe)|Al Ali]], and [[Manasir (tribe)|Manasir]] of the interior; the [[Sharqiyin]] of the east coast; and the [[Al-Qasimi|Qawasim]] to the north.

With the expansion of European [[colonial empire]]s, [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[British Empire|English]], and [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] forces appeared in the Persian Gulf region. By the 18th century, the Bani Yas confederation was the dominant force in most of the area now known as Abu Dhabi,{{sfnp|Heard-Bey|1996|p=43}} while the Northern [[Al-Qasimi|Al Qawasim]] (Al Qasimi) dominated maritime commerce. The Portuguese maintained an influence over the coastal settlements, building [[Fortification|forts]] in the wake of the bloody 16th-century conquests of coastal communities by [[Afonso de Albuquerque|Albuquerque]] and the Portuguese commanders who followed him – particularly on the east coast at [[Muscat]], [[Sohar]], and [[Khor Fakkan]].{{sfnp|Heard-Bey|1996|p=282}}

The southern coast of the Persian Gulf was known to the British as the "[[History of the United Arab Emirates|Pirate Coast]]", as boats of the Al Qawasim federation harassed British-flagged shipping from the 17th century into the 19th. The charge of piracy is disputed by modern Emirati historians, including the current ruler of Sharjah, [[Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi|Sheikh Sultan Al Qasimi]], in his 1986 book ''The Myth of Arab Piracy in the Gulf''.

British expeditions to protect their Indian trade routes led to campaigns against Ras Al Khaimah and other harbours along the coast, including the [[Persian Gulf campaign of 1809]] and the more successful [[Persian Gulf campaign of 1819|campaign of 1819]]. The following year, Britain and a number of local rulers signed a [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820|maritime truce]], giving rise to the term [[Trucial States]], which came to define the status of the coastal emirates. A further treaty was signed in 1843 and in 1853, the [[Perpetual Maritime Truce]] was agreed. To this was added the 'Exclusive Agreements', signed in 1892, which made the [[Trucial States]] a British protectorate.

Under the 1892 treaty, the trucial sheikhs agreed not to dispose of any territory except to the British and not to enter into relationships with any foreign government other than the British without their consent. In return, the British promised to protect the Trucial Coast from all aggression by sea and to help in case of land attack. British maritime policing meant that pearling fleets could operate in relative security. However, the British prohibition of the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] meant an important source of income was lost to some sheikhs and merchants.

In 1869, the Qubaisat tribe settled at [[Khor Al Adaid]] and tried to enlist the support of the Ottomans. Khor Al Adaid was claimed by Abu Dhabi at that time, a claim supported by the British. In 1906, the British Political Resident, [[Percy Cox]], confirmed in writing to the ruler of Abu Dhabi, [[Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan]] ('Zayed the Great'), that Khor Al Adaid belonged to his sheikhdom.

=== British era and discovery of oil ===

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[Pearl hunting|pearling industry]] thrived, providing both income and employment to the people of the Persian Gulf. The [[World War I|First World War]] had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the [[economic depression]] of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the [[cultured pearl]], that wiped out the trade. The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the [[World War II|Second World War]], when the newly independent [[Government of India]] imposed heavy taxation on imported pearls. The decline of pearling resulted in extreme economic hardship in the Trucial States.

In 1922, the British government secured undertakings from the rulers of the Trucial States not to sign concessions with foreign companies without their consent. Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC, later to become [[BP|British Petroleum]], or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC. APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the [[Red Line Agreement]], which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=mid|-deep}} bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of £1 million.

The British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates. The seven [[sheikh]]s of the [[Emirates of the United Arab Emirates|emirates]] then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office. In 1952, they formed the Trucial States Council, and appointed [[Adi Bitar|Adi Al Bitar]], Dubai's [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]]'s legal advisor, as secretary general and legal advisor to the council. The council was terminated once the United Arab Emirates was formed. The tribal nature of society and the lack of definition of borders between emirates frequently led to disputes, settled either through mediation or, more rarely, force. The [[Trucial Oman Scouts]] was a small military force used by the British to keep the peace.

In 1953, a subsidiary of [[BP]], D'Arcy Exploration Ltd, obtained an offshore concession from the ruler of Abu Dhabi. BP joined with [[Total SE|Compagnie Française des Pétroles]] (later [[Total SE|Total]]) to form operating companies, Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Ltd (ADMA) and Dubai Marine Areas Ltd (DUMA). A number of undersea oil surveys were carried out, including one led by the famous marine explorer [[Jacques Cousteau]]. In 1958, a floating platform rig was towed from [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], and positioned over the [[Umm Shaif oil field|Umm Shaif]] pearl bed, in Abu Dhabi waters, where drilling began. In March, it struck oil in the Upper Thamama rock formation. This was the first commercial discovery of the Trucial Coast, leading to the first exports of oil in 1962. ADMA made further offshore discoveries at Zakum and elsewhere, and other companies made commercial finds such as the [[Fateh Oil Field|Fateh oilfield]] off Dubai and the Mubarak field off Sharjah (shared with Iran).

Meanwhile, onshore exploration was hindered by territorial disputes. In 1955, the [[United Kingdom]] represented Abu Dhabi and Oman in their dispute with Saudi Arabia over the [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Buraimi Oasis]]. A 1974 agreement between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia seemed to have settled the Abu Dhabi-Saudi [[Territorial dispute|border dispute]], but this has not been ratified. The UAE's border with Oman was ratified in 2008.

PDTC continued its onshore exploration away from the disputed area, drilling five more bore holes that were also dry. However, on 27 October 1960, the company discovered oil in commercial quantities at the Murban No. 3 well on the coast near Tarif. In 1962, PDTC became the [[Abu Dhabi Petroleum Company]]. As oil revenues increased, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], undertook a massive construction program, building schools, housing, hospitals, and roads. When Dubai's oil exports commenced in 1969, Sheikh [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], the ruler of Dubai, was able to invest the revenues from the limited reserves found to spark the diversification drive that would create the modern [[global city]] of Dubai. After [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Goronwy Roberts, Baron Goronwy-Roberts|Goronwy Roberts]] informed Sheikh Zayed of the news of British withdrawal, the nine Persian Gulf sheikhdoms attempted to form a union of Arab emirates, but by mid-1971 they were still unable to agree on terms of union even though the British treaty relationship was to expire in December of that year.

Fears of vulnerability were realised the day before independence. An Iranian destroyer group broke formation from an exercise in the lower Gulf, sailing to the [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs|Tunb islands]]. The islands were [[Seizure of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs|taken by force]], civilians and Arab defenders alike allowed to flee. A British warship stood idle during the course of the invasion. A destroyer group approached the island of [[Abu Musa]] as well. But there, [[Khalid bin Muhammad Al Qasimi|Sheikh Khalid bin Muhammad Al Qasimi]] had already negotiated with the Iranian shah, and the island was quickly leased to Iran for $3 million a year. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia laid claim to swathes of Abu Dhabi. It was not until 1974 that a [[Treaty of Jeddah (1974)|border agreement]] was signed with Saudi Arabia, formally demarcating the frontiers between the UAE and Saudi Arabia. The UAE's sense of threat from Iran influenced its financial support for [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] during the [[Iran–Iraq War]].

Originally intended to be part of the proposed Federation of Arab Emirates, Bahrain became independent in August, and Qatar in September 1971. When the British-Trucial Sheikhdoms treaty expired on 1 December 1971, both emirates became fully independent. On 2 December 1971, six of the emirates (Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Sharjah, and Umm Al Quwain) agreed to enter into a union named the United Arab Emirates. [[Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah|Ras al-Khaimah]] joined later, on 10 January 1972. In February 1972, the [[Federal National Council]] (FNC) was created; it was a 40-member consultative body appointed by the seven rulers. The UAE joined the [[Arab League]] on 6 December 1971 and the [[United Nations]] on 9 December. It was a founding member of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] in May 1981, with Abu Dhabi hosting the first [[GCC Summit|GCC summit]].

=== Post-independence period ===
{{Expand section|date=November 2025}}
The founding fathers of the United Arab Emirates were: [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]] of [[Abu Dhabi]]; [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]] of [[Dubai]]; [[Khalid bin Muhammad Al Qasimi]] of [[Sharjah]]; [[Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi III|Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi]] of [[Ajman]]; [[Ahmad bin Rashid Al Mualla]] of [[Umm Al Quwain]]; [[Saqr bin Mohammed Al Qasimi]] of [[Ras Al Khaimah]] and [[Mohammed bin Hamad Al Sharqi]] of [[Fujairah]].[[File:Burj Khalifa (worlds tallest building) and the Dubai skyline (25781049892).jpg|thumb|Skyline of [[Dubai]]]]
The UAE supported military operations by the US and other [[Coalition of the Gulf War|coalition states]] engaged in the [[Gulf War]] against [[Saddam Hussein]] in [[Ba'athist Iraq]] (1991), as well as operations supporting the Global [[War on Terror]] for the [[Horn of Africa]] at [[Al Dhafra Air Base]] located outside of Abu Dhabi. The air base also supported Allied operations during the 1991 Persian [[Gulf War]] and [[Operation Northern Watch]]. The country had already signed a [[military]] defence agreement with the U.S. in 1994 and one with France in 1995. In January 2008, France and the UAE signed a deal allowing France to set up a permanent military base in the emirate of Abu Dhabi. The UAE joined international military operations in Libya in March 2011.

On 2 November 2004, the UAE's first president, Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], died. Sheikh [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]] was elected as the [[President of the United Arab Emirates|president of the UAE]]. Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan]] succeeded Sheikh Khalifa as crown prince of Abu Dhabi. In January 2006, Sheikh [[Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], the prime minister of the UAE and the ruler of Dubai, died, and Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]] assumed both roles.

The first ever national elections were held on 16 December 2006. A number of voters chose half of the members of the [[Federal National Council]]. The UAE has largely escaped the [[Arab Spring]], which other countries have experienced; however, 60 Emirati activists from [[Al Islah (United Arab Emirates)|Al Islah]] were apprehended for an alleged coup attempt and the attempt of the establishment of an [[Islamism|Islamist]] state in the UAE. Mindful of the protests in nearby Bahrain, in November 2012 the UAE outlawed online mockery of its government or attempts to organise public protests through social media. Two months later, in March, the government announced the closure of shopping malls, schools, and places of worship, in addition to imposing a 24-hour curfew, and suspending all [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] passenger flights. This resulted in a major economic downturn, which eventually led to the merger of more than 50% of the UAE's [[:Category:United Arab Emirates federal entities|federal agencies]].

On 29 August 2020, the UAE established normal diplomatic relations with [[Israel]] and with the help of the [[United States]], they signed the [[Abraham Accords]] with [[Bahrain]].

On 9 February 2021, the UAE achieved a historic milestone when its probe, named ''[[Emirates Mars Mission|Hope]]'', successfully reached [[Mars]]'s orbit. The UAE became the first country in the [[Arab world]] to reach Mars, the fifth country to successfully reach Mars, and the second country, after an [[Mars Orbiter Mission|Indian probe]], to orbit Mars on its maiden attempt.

On 14 May 2022, Sheikh [[Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan]] was elected as the UAE's new president after the death of [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan|Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]].
