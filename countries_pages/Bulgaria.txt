[[Neanderthal]] remains dating to around 150,000 years ago, or the [[Middle Paleolithic]], are some of the earliest traces of human activity in the lands of modern Bulgaria. Remains from ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' found there are dated {{Circa|47,000 [[years BP]]}}. This result represents the earliest arrival of modern humans in Europe. The [[Karanovo culture]] arose {{Circa|6,500 BC}} and was one of several [[Neolithic]] societies in the region that thrived on [[agriculture]]. The [[Copper Age]] [[Varna culture]] (fifth millennium BC) is credited with inventing [[Goldsmith|gold metallurgy]]. The associated [[Varna Necropolis]] treasure contains the oldest golden jewellery in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years. The treasure has been valuable for understanding social hierarchy and stratification in the earliest European societies.

The [[Thracians]], one of the three primary ancestral groups of modern [[Bulgarians]], appeared on the [[Balkan Peninsula]] some time before the 12th century BC.{{Sfn|Crampton|1987|page=1}} The Thracians excelled in [[metallurgy]] and gave the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] the [[Orpheus|Orphean]] and [[Dionysus|Dionysian]] cults, but remained tribal and stateless. The Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] conquered parts of present-day Bulgaria (in particular eastern Bulgaria) in the 6th century BC and retained control over the region until [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|479 BC]].{{sfn|Roisman|2011|pages=135–138, 343–345}} The invasion became a catalyst for Thracian unity, and the bulk of their tribes united under king [[Teres I|Teres]] to form the [[Odrysian kingdom]] in the 470s BC. It was weakened and vassalised by [[Philip II of Macedon]] in 341 BC, attacked [[Tylis|by Celts]] in the 3rd century, and finally [[Thracia|became a province]] of the [[Roman Empire]] in AD 45.

By the end of the 1st century AD, Roman governance was established over the entire Balkan Peninsula and [[Christianity]] began spreading in the region around the 4th century. The region came under [[Byzantine]] control after the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]] in 476. The Byzantines were engaged in prolonged warfare against Persia and could not defend their Balkan territories from barbarian incursions. This enabled the [[Early Slavs|Slavs]] to enter the Balkan Peninsula as marauders, primarily through an area between the Danube River and the Balkan Mountains known as [[Moesia]]. Gradually, the interior of the peninsula became a country of the [[Sclaveni|South Slavs]], who lived under a [[democracy]]. The Slavs assimilated the partially [[Hellenistic period#Balkans|Hellenised]], [[Thraco-Romans|Romanised]], and [[Thracian Goths|Gothicised]] Thracians in the rural areas.{{Sfn|MacDermott|1998|page=19}}

=== First Bulgarian Empire ===

Their horde was a remnant of [[Old Great Bulgaria]], an extinct tribal confederacy situated north of the Black Sea in what is now Ukraine and southern Russia. Asparukh attacked Byzantine territories in Moesia and conquered the Slavic tribes there in 680.

Succeeding rulers strengthened the Bulgarian state throughout the 8th and 9th centuries. [[Krum]] introduced a written code of law and checked a major Byzantine incursion at the [[Battle of Pliska]], in which Byzantine emperor [[Nicephorus I]] was killed. [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]] abolished paganism in favour of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] in 864. The [[Christianization of Bulgaria|conversion]] was followed by a Byzantine recognition of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian church]] and the adoption of the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic alphabet]], developed in the capital, [[Preslav]].{{Sfn|Crampton|2007|pages=12–13}} The common language, religion and script strengthened central authority and gradually fused the Slavs and Bulgars into a unified people speaking a single [[Slavic languages|Slavic language]].{{Sfn|Crampton|2007|pages=12–13}} A [[Golden Age of Bulgaria|golden age]] began during the 34-year rule of [[Simeon the Great]], who oversaw the largest territorial expansion of the state.{{Sfn|The First Golden Age}} The literature produced in Old Bulgarian soon spread north from Bulgaria and became the [[lingua franca]] of the Balkans and Eastern Europe. The political, cultural, and spiritual power of the Bulgarian Empire during the [[Krum's dynasty]] turned Bulgaria into one of the [[List of medieval great powers|three superpowers]] in Europe at that time, alongside the Byzantine Empire and the [[Carolingian Empire]] of the [[Franks]], which would later become the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

After Simeon's death, Bulgaria was weakened by wars with [[Magyars]] and [[Pechenegs]] and the spread of [[Bogomilism]]. Simeon's successor [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Peter I]] negotiated a favourable [[Byzantine–Bulgarian Treaty of 927|peace treaty]]. The Byzantines agreed to recognise him as Emperor of Bulgaria and the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] as an independent Patriarchate, as well as to pay an annual tribute. The peace was reinforced with a marriage between Peter and Romanos's granddaughter [[Irene Lekapene]]. This agreement ushered in a period of 40 years of peaceful relations between the two powers. During the first years of his reign, Peter I faced revolts by two of his three brothers, John in 928 and [[Mihail of Bulgaria|Michael]] in 930, but both were quelled. During most of the reign of Emperor Peter I, the empire enjoyed a period of political consolidation, economic expansion, and cultural activity.

[[Veliki Preslav|Preslav]] was seized by the Byzantine army in 971 after consecutive [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] and Byzantine invasions. but this ended when Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] defeated the Bulgarian army at [[battle of Kleidion|Klyuch]] in 1014. Samuil died shortly after the battle, and by 1018 the Byzantines [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|had conquered the First Bulgarian Empire]].{{Sfn|Crampton|1987|page=4}} After the conquest, Basil II prevented revolts by retaining the rule of local nobility, integrating them in [[Byzantine bureaucracy and aristocracy]], and relieving their lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold, allowing [[tax in kind]] instead. The [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian Patriarchate]] was reduced to an [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|archbishopric]], but retained its [[autocephaly|autocephalous status]] and its [[diocese]]s.

=== Second Bulgarian Empire ===
{{Main|Second Bulgarian Empire}}

Byzantine domestic policies changed after Basil's death and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, [[Bulgarian uprising against the Byzantine Empire (1040–1041)|the largest]] being led by [[Peter Delyan]]. The empire's authority declined after a catastrophic military [[Battle of Manzikert|defeat at Manzikert]] against [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] invaders, and was further disturbed by the [[Crusades]]. This prevented Byzantine attempts at [[Hellenisation]] and created fertile ground for further revolt. In 1185, [[Asen dynasty]] nobles [[Ivan Asen I]] and [[Peter IV of Bulgaria|Peter IV]] organised a [[Uprising of Asen and Peter|major uprising]] and succeeded in re-establishing the Bulgarian state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire with its capital at [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]].

[[Kaloyan]], the third of the Asen monarchs, extended his dominion to [[Belgrade]] and [[Ohrid]]. He acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of [[the pope]] and received a royal crown from a [[papal legate]]. The empire reached its zenith under [[Ivan Asen II]] (1218–1241), when its borders expanded as far as the coast of [[Albania]], Serbia and [[Epirus]], while commerce and culture flourished. Bulgarian architecture, arts, and literature spread beyond the borders of Bulgaria into [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]], [[Wallachia]], [[Moldavia]], and the [[Rus' Principalities]] and affected Slavic culture.

=== Ottoman rule ===
{{Main|Ottoman Bulgaria}}
[[File:Battle of Nicopolis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Battle of Nicopolis in 1396 marked the end of medieval Bulgarian statehood.]]

The Ottomans were employed as mercenaries by the Byzantines in the 1340s, but later became invaders in their own right. The Bulgarian nobility was subsequently eliminated and the peasantry was [[Serfdom|enserfed]] to Ottoman masters, while much of the educated clergy fled to other countries.

Bulgarians were subjected to heavy taxes (including [[Devshirme]], or ''blood tax''), their culture was suppressed, Ottoman authorities established a religious administrative community called the [[Rum Millet]], which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population then gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying only by its faith. The clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept their ethnic identity alive, enabling its survival in remote rural areas,{{Sfn|Crampton|1987|page=8}} and in the militant [[Catholic Church in Bulgaria|Catholic community]] in the northwest of the country.

As Ottoman power began to wane, [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg Austria]] and Russia saw Bulgarian Christians as potential allies. The [[Habsburg monarchy|Austrians]] first backed an [[First Tarnovo Uprising|uprising in Tarnovo in 1598]], then [[Second Tarnovo Uprising|a second one in 1686]], the [[Chiprovtsi Uprising]] in 1688 and finally [[Karposh's rebellion]] in 1689. The [[Russian Empire]] also asserted itself as a protector of Christians in Ottoman lands with the [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]] in 1774.

=== Third Bulgarian state ===

[[File:Bulgaria-SanStefano -(1878)-byTodorBozhinov.png|upright=1.2|left|alt=Map of Bulgaria according to the Treaty of San Stefano|thumb|Borders of Bulgaria according to the preliminary Treaty of San Stefano]]

The [[Treaty of San Stefano]] was signed on 3 March 1878 by [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning [[Moesia]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]], roughly on the territories of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]],{{Sfn|San Stefano, Berlin and Independence}} and this day is now [[Public holidays in Bulgaria|a public holiday]] called [[Liberation Day (Bulgaria)|National Liberation Day]]. The other [[Great Powers#History|Great Powers]] immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the [[Balkans]] might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]], signed on 13 July. It provided for a much smaller state, the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], only comprising Moesia and the region of [[Sofia]], and leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country.{{Sfn|San Stefano, Berlin and Independence}} This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.{{Sfn|Historical Setting}}

The Bulgarian principality won [[Serbo-Bulgarian War|a war against Serbia]] and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of [[Eastern Rumelia]] in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908.{{Sfn|Crampton|2007|page=174}} In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarised and was often referred to as "the Balkan [[Prussia]]". It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918—two [[Balkan Wars]] and [[World War I]]. After a disastrous defeat in the [[Second Balkan War]], Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the [[Central Powers]] in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at [[Battle of Doiran (1917)|Doiran]] and [[Battle of Monastir (1917)|Monastir]], the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories [[Immigration|immigrated]] to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.

[[File:BASA-3K-7-342-28-Boris III of Bulgaria.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=A portrait of Tsar Boris III|Tsar Boris III]]
The resulting political unrest led to the establishment of a royal [[authoritarianism|authoritarian dictatorship]] by Tsar [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]] (1918–1943). Bulgaria entered World War II in 1941 as a member of [[Axis powers|the Axis]] but declined to participate in [[Operation Barbarossa]] and [[Rescue of the Bulgarian Jews|saved its Jewish population]] from deportation to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].{{Sfn|Bulgaria in World War II: The Passive Alliance}} The sudden death of Boris III in mid-1943 pushed the country into political turmoil as the war turned against Germany, and the communist guerrilla movement gained momentum. The government of [[Bogdan Filov]] subsequently failed to achieve peace with the Allies. Bulgaria did not comply with Soviet demands to expel German forces from its territory, resulting in a declaration of war and an invasion by the USSR in September 1944.{{Sfn|Wartime Crisis}} The communist-dominated [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Fatherland Front]] took power, ended participation in the Axis and joined the Allied side until the war ended. Bulgaria suffered little war damage and the Soviet Union demanded no reparations. But all wartime territorial gains, with the notable exception of [[Treaty of Craiova|Southern Dobrudzha]], were lost.{{Sfn|The Soviet Occupation}}

[[File:Georgi Dimitrov.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Georgi Dimitrov]], leader of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] from 1946 to 1949]]
The [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'état|left-wing coup d'état]] of 9 September 1944 led to the abolition of the monarchy and [[People's Court (Bulgaria)|the executions]] of some 1,000–3,000 dissidents, war criminals, and members of the former royal elite. But it was not until 1946 that a [[One-party state|one-party]] [[people's republic]] was instituted following a referendum.{{Sfn|Crampton|2005|page=271}} It fell into the Soviet sphere of influence under the leadership of [[Georgi Dimitrov]] (1946–1949), who established a repressive, rapidly industrialising [[Stalinist]] state.{{Sfn|The Soviet Occupation}} By the mid-1950s, standards of living rose significantly and political repression eased.{{Sfn|Domestic Policy and Its Results|ps=Quote: "real wages increased 75 percent, consumption of meat, fruit, and vegetables increased markedly, medical facilities and doctors became available to more of the population"}}{{Sfn|After Stalin}} The Soviet-style [[planned economy]] saw some experimental market-oriented policies emerging under [[Todor Zhivkov]] (1954–1989).{{Sfn|The Economy}} Compared to wartime levels, national [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] increased five-fold and per capita GDP quadrupled by the 1980s, although severe debt spikes took place in 1960, 1977 and 1980. Zhivkov's daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova|Lyudmila]] bolstered national pride by promoting Bulgarian heritage, culture and arts worldwide.{{Sfn|The Political Atmosphere in the 1970s}} Facing declining birth rates among the ethnic Bulgarian majority, Zhivkov's government in 1984 forced the minority ethnic [[Bulgarian Turks|Turks]] to adopt Slavic names in an attempt to erase their identity and assimilate them.{{Sfn|Bulgaria in the 1980s}} These policies resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 ethnic Turks to Turkey.

The Communist Party was forced to give up its political monopoly on 10 November 1989 under the influence of the [[Revolutions of 1989]]. Zhivkov resigned and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]].{{Sfn|Government and Politics}} The first free elections in June 1990 were won by the Communist Party, now rebranded as the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]. A [[Constitution of Bulgaria|new constitution]] that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991. The new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth—the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s. After 2001, economic, political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly,{{Sfn|Library of Congress|2006|page=16}} and Bulgaria achieved high Human Development status in 2003. It became a member of [[NATO]] in 2004
