===Pre-Columbian era===
Humans first settled Cuba around 6,000 years ago, descending from migrations from northern South America or Central America. The arrival of humans on Cuba is associated with extinctions of the islands native fauna, particularly its [[Megalocnidae|endemic sloths]]. The [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]]-speaking ancestors of the [[Taíno]] people arrived in the Caribbean in a separate migration from South America around 1,700 years ago. Unlike the previous settlers of Cuba, the Taíno extensively produced pottery and engaged in intensive agriculture. Descendants of the first settlers of Cuba persisted on the western part of the island until Columbian contact, where they were recorded as the [[Guanahatabey]] people, who lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on Cuba on 27 October 1492 and on the island's northeastern coast on 28 October. Columbus claimed the island for the new [[Habsburg Spain|Kingdom of Spain]] and named it ''Isla Juana'' ("John's Island") after [[John, Prince of Asturias]].

In 1511, the first [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish settlement]] was founded by [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] at [[Baracoa]]. Other settlements soon followed, including [[Havana|San Cristobal de la Habana]], founded in 1514 (southern coast of the island) and then in 1519 (current place), which later became the capital (1607). The indigenous Taíno individuals were forced to work under the ''[[encomienda]]'' system, which resembled the [[Feudalism|feudal system]] in medieval Europe. Within a century, the [[indigenous people]] faced high incidence of mortality due to multiple factors—primarily [[Eurasia]]n [[infectious diseases]] to which they had no [[acquired immunity]], aggravated by the harsh conditions of the repressive colonial subjugation. In 1529, a [[measles]] outbreak killed two-thirds of those few indigenous individuals who had previously survived [[smallpox]].

On 18 May 1539, [[conquistador]] [[Hernando de Soto]] departed from Havana with some 600 followers on an extensive expedition through the [[Southeastern United States]] in search of gold, treasure, fame, and power. On 1 September 1548, Gonzalo Perez de Angulo was appointed governor of Cuba. He arrived in [[Santiago, Cuba]], on 4 November 1549, and immediately declared the liberty of the indigenous population.{{sfn|Wright|1916|p=183}} He became Cuba's first permanent governor—residing in Havana instead of Santiago—and built the first church made of masonry in Cuba.{{sfn|Wright|1916|p=229}}{{efn|After the French captured Havana in 1555, the governor's son, Francisco de Angulo, went to the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]].{{sfn|Wright|1916|p=246}}}}

By 1570, most residents of Cuba had a mixture of Spanish, African, and Taíno heritages.

In 1812, the [[Aponte conspiracy|Aponte slave rebellion]] took place, but it was ultimately suppressed. The population of Cuba in 1817 was 630,980 (of which 291,021 were white, 115,691 were [[free people of color]] (mixed-race), and 224,268 black slaves).{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=352}} The population in 1841 was 1,007,624, of whom 425,521 were black slaves, 418,291 were white.

In part due to Cuban slaves working primarily in urbanized settings, by the 19th century, the practice of {{Lang|es|coartacion}} had developed (or "buying oneself out of slavery", a "uniquely Cuban development"), according to historian [[Herbert S. Klein]]. Due to a shortage of white labor, blacks dominated urban industries "to such an extent that when whites in large numbers came to Cuba in the middle of the nineteenth century, they were unable to displace Negro workers." A system of diversified agriculture, with small farms and fewer slaves, served to supply the cities with produce and other goods. On 27 December 1868, he issued a decree condemning slavery in theory—but accepting it in practice—and declaring free any slaves whose masters presented them for military service.{{sfn|Chomsky|Carr|Smorkaloff|2004|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sr2hQkCIihMC&pg=PA115 115–117]}} The 1868 rebellion resulted in a prolonged conflict known as the [[Ten Years' War]]. The Cuban rebels were joined by former Dominican colonial officers and volunteers from Canada, Colombia, France, Mexico, the United States, and Chinese [[indentured servants]],{{efn|According to one military historian, "The thirty-eight individuals who responded to the call for independence on 9 October 1868 had almost no military experience. They, and other Cubans, ignorant of the martial skills, were soon joined by a small band of political refugees from Santo Domingo. A number of these individuals had fought for Spain in Santo Domingo following its re-annexation (1861–65). When Spain quit Santo Domingo for the second time, some Dominican colonial officers immigrated to Cuba. Most were unable to find service in the Spanish army in Cuba. Some of these former soldiers joined the new Revolutionary army and provided its initial training and leadership."{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=353}} Mercenaries from Canada, Colombia, France, Mexico, and the United States joined the Cuban Revolutionary Army. Chinese nationals, brought to Cuba as indentured servants, also fought for the cause.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=353}} By 1876, the Cuban Revolutionary movement was facing internal strife, largely driven by racial tensions. General Máximo Gómez surrendered his command after officers refused to follow his orders because he was Dominican. At the same time, the campaign against Antonio Maceo, a [[mulatto]] leader, grew stronger as white factions sought to undermine his leadership because of his race. These racial divisions contributed to a decline in morale within the Revolutionary Army.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=357}}}} but lacked support from wealthy planters and the majority of slaves. In 1878, the [[Pact of Zanjón]] ended the conflict, with Spain promising greater autonomy to Cuba. In 1879–80, Cuban patriot [[Calixto García]] attempted to start another war known as the [[Little War (Cuba)|Little War]] but failed to receive enough support. [[Slavery in Cuba]] was abolished in 1875, but the process was completed only in 1886.{{sfn|Scott|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SmpMmVQAvAcC&pg=PA3 3]}}{{sfn|Chomsky|Carr|Smorkaloff|2004|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sr2hQkCIihMC&pg=PA37 37–38]}} An exiled dissident named [[José Martí]] founded the [[Cuban Revolutionary Party]] in New York City in 1892. The party aimed to achieve Cuban independence from Spain. In January 1895, Martí traveled to [[San Fernando de Monte Cristi]] and [[Santo Domingo]] in the Dominican Republic to join the efforts of [[Máximo Gómez]]. [[Cuban War of Independence|Fighting against the Spanish army]] began in Cuba on 24 February 1895, but Martí was unable to reach Cuba until 11 April 1895. Between 200,000 and 400,000 Cuban civilians died from starvation and disease in the Spanish concentration camps, numbers verified by the [[Red Cross]] and United States senator [[Redfield Proctor]], a former [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]]. American and European protests against Spanish conduct on the island followed.

The U.S. battleship [[USS Maine (1889)|USS ''Maine'']] was sent to protect American interests, but soon after its arrival, it exploded in the Havana harbor and sank quickly, killing nearly three-quarters of the crew. The cause and responsibility for the ship's sinking remained unclear after a board of inquiry. Popular opinion in the U.S., fueled by active [[yellow press]], concluded that the Spanish were to blame and demanded action. Spain and the United States declared war on each other in late April 1898.

===Republic (1902–1959)===
{{Main|Republican period (Cuba)}}

====First years (1902–1925)====
[[File:Raising the Cuban flag on the Governor General's Palace at noon on May 20, 1902.gif|thumb|Raising the Cuban flag on the Governor General's palace at noon on 20 May 1902.]]
After the [[Spanish–American War]], Spain and the United States signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)]], by which Spain relinquished sovereignty over Cuba and ceded [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], and the [[Philippines]] to the United States for the sum of {{Nowrap|US$20 million}} With the end of U.S. military government jurisdiction, Cuba gained formal independence on 20 May 1902 as the Republic of Cuba. Under Cuba's new constitution, the United States retained the right to intervene in Cuban affairs and to supervise its finances and foreign relations. Under the [[Platt Amendment]], the U.S. leased the [[Guantánamo Bay Naval Base]] from Cuba.

Following disputed elections in 1906, the first president, [[Tomás Estrada Palma]], faced an armed revolt by independence war veterans who defeated the meager government forces. The U.S. intervened by occupying Cuba and named [[Charles Edward Magoon]] as governor for three years. Cuban historians have characterized Magoon's governorship as introducing political and social corruption. In 1908, self-government was restored when [[José Miguel Gómez]] was elected president, but the U.S. continued intervening in Cuban affairs. In 1912, the [[Partido Independiente de Color]] attempted to establish a separate [[Black separatism|black republic]] in [[Oriente Province]], but was suppressed by General Monteagudo with considerable bloodshed.

In 1924, [[Gerardo Machado]] was elected president. The [[Wall Street crash of 1929]] led to a collapse in the price of sugar, political unrest, and repression. uprisings among sugar workers, and an army revolt forced Machado into exile in August 1933. He was replaced by [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada]].

====Revolution of 1933–1940====
{{Main|Cuban Revolution of 1933}}
[[File:1933-Pentarchy w Batista.jpg|thumb|The [[Pentarchy of 1933]]. [[Fulgencio Batista]], who controlled the armed forces, appears at far right]]
In September 1933, the [[Sergeants' Revolt]], led by Sergeant [[Fulgencio Batista]], overthrew Céspedes. A five-member executive committee (the [[Pentarchy of 1933]]) was chosen to head a provisional government. [[Ramón Grau San Martín]] was then appointed as provisional president. On balance, during the period 1933–1940, Cuba suffered from fragile political structures, reflected in the fact that it saw three different presidents in two years (1935–1936), and in the militaristic and repressive policies of Batista as head of the army.

==== Constitution of 1940 ====
{{Main|1940 Constitution of Cuba}}
A [[1940 Constitution of Cuba|new constitution]] was adopted in 1940 that engineered radically progressive ideas, including the right to labor and health care.{{sfn|Domínguez|1978|p={{page needed|date=December 2023}}}} Batista was elected president in the same year, holding the post until 1944. He is, as of 2004, the only non-white Cuban to win the nation's highest political office. His government carried out major social reforms. Several members of the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party]] held office under his administration.{{sfn|Sweig|2004|p={{page needed|date=December 2023}}}} Cuban armed forces were not greatly involved in combat during World War&nbsp;II—though president Batista did suggest a joint U.S.-Latin American assault on [[Spanish State|Francoist Spain]] to overthrow its authoritarian regime. Cuba lost six merchant ships during the war, and the Cuban Navy was credited with sinking the {{GS|U-176}}.

Batista adhered to the 1940 constitution's strictures preventing his re-election. Ramon Grau San Martin was the winner of the next election, in 1944. [[Carlos Prío Socarrás]], a protégé of Grau, became president in 1948.

==== Batista regime ====
{{Main|1952 Cuban coup d'état|Cuban Revolution}}
[[File:HavanaSlums1954.jpg|thumb|right|[[Slum]] (''bohío'') dwellings in Havana, Cuba in 1954, just outside [[Estadio Latinoamericano|Havana baseball stadium]]. In the background is advertising for a nearby [[casino]].]]
After finishing his term in 1944, Batista lived in Florida, returning to Cuba to run for president in 1952. Facing inevitable electoral defeat, he led a [[1952 Cuban coup d'état|military coup]] that preempted the election. Back in power, and receiving financial, military, and logistical support from the United States government, Batista suspended the 1940 constitution and revoked most political liberties, including the [[Strike action|right to strike]]. He then aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantations]], and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor Cubans. Batista outlawed the Cuban Communist Party in 1952. After the coup, Cuba had Latin America's highest per capita consumption rates of meat, vegetables, cereals, automobiles, telephones and radios, though about one-third of the population was considered poor and enjoyed relatively little of this consumption. However, in his "[[History Will Absolve Me]]" speech, Fidel Castro mentioned that national issues relating to land, industrialization, housing, unemployment, education, and health were contemporary problems.

In 1958, Cuba was a well-advanced country compared to other Latin American regions. Cuba was also affected by perhaps Latin America's largest labor union privileges, including bans on dismissals and mechanization. They were obtained in large measure "at the cost of the unemployed and the peasants", leading to disparities. Between 1933 and 1958, Cuba extended economic regulations enormously, causing economic problems. Unemployment became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs.

In the 1950s, various organizations, including some advocating armed uprising, competed for public support in bringing about political change. In 1956, [[Fidel Castro]] and about 80 supporters landed from the yacht [[Granma (yacht)|''Granma'']] in an attempt to start a rebellion against the Batista government.

===Revolutionary government (1959–present)===
====Consolidation and nationalization (1959–1970)====
{{Main|Consolidation of the Cuban Revolution|Revolutionary Offensive}}
[[File:CheyFidel.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Che Guevara]] and [[Fidel Castro]], photographed by [[Alberto Korda]] in 1961]]
The United States government initially reacted favorably to the Cuban Revolution, seeing it as part of a movement to bring democracy to Latin America. Castro's legalization of the Communist Party and the hundreds of executions of Batista agents, policemen, and soldiers that followed caused a deterioration in the relationship between the two countries. In February 1960, Castro signed a commercial agreement with Soviet Vice-Premier [[Anastas Mikoyan]]. Five rebel B-26s were shot down by the Cuban air force, and one was downed by anti-aircraft fire.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=250}} In January 1962, Cuba was suspended from the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), and later the same year the OAS started to impose sanctions against Cuba of similar nature to the U.S. sanctions. The failed amphibious assault on Cuba contributed to the Soviet decision to deploy [[R-12 Dvina|R-12]] missiles there,{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=253}} and the ensuing [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of October 1962 almost sparked [[World War III#Cuban Missile Crisis: 15–29 October 1962|World War III]]. In 1962, American generals proposed [[Operation Northwoods]] which would entail committing terrorist attacks in American cities and against refugees and falsely blaming the attacks on the Cuban government, manufacturing a reason for the United States to invade Cuba. This plan was rejected by President Kennedy. By 1963, Cuba was moving towards a full-fledged [[communist state]] system modeled on the USSR.
[[File:Guantanamo Naval Base aerial photo 1962.jpg|thumb|Since 1959, Cuba has regarded the U.S. presence in [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantánamo Bay]] as illegal.]]
[[Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo]] founded the anti-Castro group [[Alpha 66]] in the early 1960s, which used small craft to attack Cuban and Soviet merchant ships, killing or wounding crew members. In 1964, Menoyo set up a guerrilla training camp in the Dominican Republic, and after entering Cuba in 1965, he was captured; however, Alpha 66 continued its raids under new leadership.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=251}} By the mid-1960s, Soviet aid had strengthened the Cuban air force and navy, making raids against the island by Cuban dissidents costly without significant U.S. support.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=254}}

In 1963, Cuba sent 686 troops together with 22 tanks and other military equipment to support Algeria in the [[Sand War]] against Morocco. The Cuban forces remained in Algeria for over a year, providing training to the Algerian army. [[Che Guevara]], authorized by Fidel Castro, engaged in [[Simba rebellion|guerrilla activities in Africa]] and was killed in 1967 while attempting to start a [[Ñancahuazú Guerrilla|revolution in Bolivia]]. The campaign would spur industrialization in Cuba and focus the economy on sugar production, specifically to a deadline for an annual sugar harvest of 10 million tons by 1970. The economic focus on sugar production involved international volunteers and the mobilization of workers from all sectors of the Cuban economy. Economic mobilization also coincided with greater militarization of Cuban political structures and society in general. The ten million ton harvest goal was not reached.{{Rp|pages=37–38}} The Cuban economy fell into decline after large sectors of the economy were neglected when large amounts of urban labor mobilized to the countryside. Fidel Castro admitted the failures of economic policies in a 1970 speech. The vast majority of those executed directly following the 1959 Revolution were policemen, politicians, and informers of the Batista regime accused of crimes such as torture and murder, and their public trials and executions had widespread popular support among the Cuban population.

====Foreign interventions (1971–1991)====
{{Main|Foreign interventions by Cuba}}
[[File:Cubans in Ogaden1.JPG|thumb|Cuban artillery crew in [[Ethiopia]] during the [[Ogaden War]].]]
During the Cold War, Cuba received $33 billion in Soviet aid, and Cuban forces were deployed to all corners of Africa, either as military advisors or as combatants. Soviet pilots and technicians assumed defense duties in Cuba, freeing up Cuban personnel to be deployed in Africa. South Africa developed nuclear weapons due to the threat to its security posed by the presence of large numbers of [[Cuban intervention in Angola|Cuban troops in Angola]]. In 1975–76 and again in 1988 at the [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]], the Cubans alongside their MPLA allies fought [[UNITA]] rebels and [[apartheid]] South African forces. In December 1977, Cuba sent its combat troops from Angola, the People's Republic of the Congo, and the Caribbean to Ethiopia, Israeli sources reported the presence of a Cuban tank brigade in the [[Golan Heights]], which was supported by two brigades. The Israelis and the Cuban-Syrian tank forces engaged in battle on the Golan front.{{rp|37–38}}

After the U.S. was defeated in the [[Vietnam War]], Castro began supporting Marxist insurgencies in [[Guatemalan Civil War|Guatemala]], [[Salvadoran Civil War|El Salvador]], [[Nicaraguan Revolution|Nicaragua]], and [[Colombian conflict|Colombia]] by supplying weapons, munitions, and training.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=339}} Following the 1983 coup that resulted in the execution of Grenadian Prime Minister [[Maurice Bishop]] and establishment of the military government led by [[Hudson Austin]], [[United States invasion of Grenada|U.S. forces invaded]] Grenada in 1983, overthrowing the pro-Castro government. In a few days of fighting, 6,000 American combat troops defeated 784 Cubans (636 construction workers with military training, 43 military advisors, and 18 diplomats).{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=358}}

Cuba gradually withdrew its troops from Angola in 1989–91. and Castro's rule was severely tested in the aftermath of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet collapse in December 1991]] (known in Cuba as the [[Special Period]]). The country faced a severe economic downturn following the withdrawal of Soviet subsidies worth {{Nowrap|$4 billion}} to {{Nowrap|$6 billion}} annually, resulting in effects such as food and fuel shortages. The government did not accept American donations of food, medicines and cash until 1993.

In February 2008, Fidel Castro resigned as President of the State Council due to the serious gastrointestinal illness that he had suffered since July 2006. On 24 February, the [[National Assembly of People's Power|National Assembly]] elected his brother [[Raúl Castro]] the new president. In his inauguration speech, Raúl promised that some of the restrictions on freedom in Cuba would be removed. In March 2009, Raúl Castro [[2009 Cuban government dismissals|removed some of his brother's appointees]].

On 3 June 2009, the [[Organization of American States]] adopted a resolution to end the 47-year ban on Cuban membership of the group. The resolution stated, however, that full membership would be delayed until Cuba was "in conformity with the practices, purposes, and principles of the OAS".
[[File:Press conference, Havana.jpg|thumb|right|[[Raúl Castro]] and U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] at their joint press conference in Havana, Cuba, 21 March 2016]]

Effective 14 January 2013, Cuba ended the requirement established in 1961 that any citizens who wished to travel abroad were required to obtain an expensive government permit and a letter of invitation. In 1961 the Cuban government had imposed broad restrictions on travel to prevent the mass emigration of people after the 1959 revolution; it approved exit visas only on rare occasions. Requirements were simplified: Cubans need only a passport and a national ID card to leave; and they are allowed to take their young children with them for the first time. However, a passport costs on average five months' salary. Observers expect that Cubans with paying relatives abroad are most likely to be able to take advantage of the new policy. In the first year of the program, over 180,000 left Cuba and returned.
{{as of|2014|December|}}, talks with Cuban officials and American officials, including President [[Barack Obama]], resulted in the release of [[Alan Gross]], fifty-two political prisoners, and an unnamed non-citizen agent of the United States in return for the release of three Cuban agents currently imprisoned in the United States. Additionally, while the embargo between the United States and Cuba was not immediately lifted, it was relaxed to allow import, export, and certain limited commerce.

Raúl Castro stepped down from the presidency on 19 April 2018, and [[Miguel Díaz-Canel]] was elected president of the State Council by the National Assembly following [[2018 Cuban parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]]. Raúl Castro remained the [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba|First Secretary of the Communist Party]] and retained broad authority, including oversight over the president.

Cuba approved a new constitution in 2019. The optional vote attracted 84.4% of eligible voters. 90% of those who voted approved the new constitution, and 9% opposed it. The new constitution states that the Communist Party is the only legitimate political party, describes access to health and education as fundamental rights, imposes presidential term limits, enshrines the right to legal representation upon arrest, recognizes private property, and strengthens the rights of multinationals investing with the state. Any form of discrimination harmful to human dignity is banned under the new constitution. Raúl Castro announced at the Eighth [[Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba]], which began on 16 April 2021, that he was retiring as first secretary of the Communist Party. His successor, Miguel Díaz-Canel, was voted in on 19 April.

In July 2021, there were [[2021 Cuban protests|several large protests against the government]] under the banner of [[Patria y Vida]]. [[Cuban exiles]] also conducted protests overseas. The song associated with the movement received international acclaim including a [[Latin Grammy Award]].

On 25 September 2022, Cuba approved a [[2022 Cuban Family Code referendum|referendum]] which amended the Family Code to legalise [[same-sex marriage]] and allow [[surrogate pregnancy]] and [[same-sex adoption]]. [[Gender reassignment surgery]] and [[transgender hormone therapy]] are provided free of charge under Cuba's national healthcare system. The government supported the proposed changes, but conservatives and parts of the opposition opposed them. [[LGBT rights in Cuba|Official policies]] of the Cuban government from 1959 until the 1990s were hostile towards homosexuality, with the [[LGBT community]] marginalized on the basis of [[heteronormativity]], traditional [[gender role]]s, and strict criteria for [[moralism]].

The [[2024–2025 Cuba blackouts]] were the most severe living crisis that the country has experienced since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. President Díaz-Canel blamed the blackout on the [[United States embargo against Cuba]], which he said prevented much needed supplies and replacement parts from reaching Cuba.<ref name="bbc-20241018" />
