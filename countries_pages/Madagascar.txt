===Early period===

Traditionally, archaeologists have estimated that the earliest settlers arrived in successive waves in [[Outrigger canoe|outrigger canoes]] from [[South Kalimantan|South Borneo]], possibly throughout the period between 350&nbsp;BCE and 550&nbsp;CE, while others are cautious about dates earlier than 250 CE. In either case, these dates make Madagascar one of the most recent major landmasses on Earth to be settled by humans, predating the settlement of [[Iceland]] and [[New Zealand]]. It has been proposed that [[Ma'anyan people]] were brought as laborers and slaves by [[Java|Javan]] and [[Sumatra|Sumatran]]-[[Malay (ethnic group)|Malays]] in their trading fleets to Madagascar. Dates of settlement of the island earlier than the mid-first millennium CE are not strongly supported. However, there is scattered evidence for much earlier human visits and presence.{{efn|Archaeological finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and stone tools in the northeast indicate that Madagascar was visited by foragers around 2000 BCE. See [[History of Madagascar#First inhabitants and settlements (500 BCE–700 CE)|History of Madagascar]].}}

Upon arrival, early settlers practiced [[slash-and-burn agriculture]] to clear the coastal rainforests for cultivation. The first settlers encountered Madagascar's abundance of [[Pleistocene megafauna|megafauna]], including 17 species of [[Subfossil lemur|giant lemurs]], the large flightless [[Elephant bird|elephant birds]] (including possibly the largest bird to ever exist, ''[[Aepyornis maximus]]''), the [[Cryptoprocta spelea|giant fossa]], and several species of [[Malagasy hippopotamus]], which have since become extinct because of hunting and habitat destruction. According to the ''[[General History of Africa]]'', these first settlers, the ''[[tompontany]]'' (masters of the soil/land), are thought to have been the [[Kimosy]] in south-central Madagascar, the [[Antevinany]] in the southeast, the [[Antankoala]] and [[Kajemby]] in the northwest, and the [[Rasikajy]] in the northeast. Newer arrivals formed marriage alliances with the ''tompontany'', facilitating their gradual assimilation.{{Reference page|page=900}} By 600&nbsp;CE, groups of these early settlers had begun clearing the forests of the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|Central Highlands]]. According to the ''General History of Africa'', by the 8th century the [[Vazimba]] (a 'way of life' rather than ethnic group){{Reference page|page=71}} had absorbed or violently displaced the first settlers, and had come to refer to themselves as ''tompontany''.

Arab traders first reached the island between the 7th and 9th centuries, and introduced [[Islam]] and the [[Arabic script]] (adapted as ''[[sorabe]]'' for the [[Malagasy language]]). [[Indian Ocean trade]] along the northwestern coast of Madagascar came to be controlled by the [[Antalaotra]], Muslim [[Swahili language|Swahili]]-speakers who had migrated to the region around the 10th century and intermarried with the locals,{{Reference page|pages=36-7}} forming [[city-states]] such as {{Interlanguage link|Mahilaka|de}} and {{Interlanguage link|Irodo (village)|lt=Irodo|fr}}. Around this time, [[zebu]] from [[South India]] were first brought, intermingling with [[Sanga cattle|sanga]] found in East Africa. By 1100, all regions of Madagascar were inhabited, although the total population remained small.{{Reference page|page=70}} On the northern coast, Mahilaka was abandoned and replaced by [[Vohemar]] in the 15th century as one of the island's main trading ports,{{Reference page|pages=75, 91}} Over the following centuries the [[Indian Ocean slave trade|slave trade]] grew in importance as slaves were traded for firearms.{{Reference page|page=102}} In the late-17th century, Madagascar saw an influx of pirates who had been expelled from the [[Caribbean]], some of whom participated in local wars and {{Interlanguage link|Zanamalata|lt=married local women|mg}}, though they were routed by the [[British navy]] in the 1720s.{{Efn|[[Solofo Randrianja]] writes that "one or two pirates actually claimed to rule small areas of Madagascar themselves".}}{{Reference page|page=864}}

The origin of the Maroserana, the dynasty of the [[Sakalava empire]], is uncertain, with Sakalava traditions{{efn|Called ''fitera,'' ''n'antoaniraza'' (customs), or ''lovan'tsofina'' (heritage of the ears), Sakalava [[oral traditions]] vary in content, especially when compared to Imerina's body of tradition (the ''[[Tantara ny Andriana]]''), in part due to their time of collection in the mid-19th century when the empire had undergone disintegration, resulting in the absence of a single body of tradition.{{Reference page|page=26}} Mahafaly tradition has Olembetsitoto as their first Maroserana [[Sacred king|sacred ruler]] in the 16th century, who was protected by an {{Interlanguage link|Ombiasy|lt=''ombiasy''|fr|Ombiasy}} (priest).

In the Central Highlands, [[Merina people|Merina]] traditions hold that they encountered the Vazimba{{Efn|Represented as "primitive dwarfs".{{Reference page|page=142}} Of his successors, [[Ralambo]] founded the [[Merina Kingdom]],{{Efn|In Merina tradition, Ralambo is credited with founding various institutions, such as a [[head tax]] and [[standing army]], and with domesticating zebu. In the 18th century, the French established various trading posts along the east coast in order to supply the [[Mascarenes]].{{Reference page|page=204}} The 18th century had seen rivalry between the French and the British over the wider Indian Ocean trade, of which Malagasy trade had proved decisive during the [[Carnatic Wars]].{{Reference page|page=416}} and concluded a treaty in 1817 with the British governor of [[Mauritius]] to abolish the lucrative slave trade in return for British military and financial assistance, and recognition as the "King of Madagascar". Artisan missionary envoys from the [[London Missionary Society]] began arriving in 1818 who established schools, transcribed the [[Malagasy language]] using the [[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]], and translated the Bible. The combination of regular warfare, disease, difficult forced labor, and harsh measures of justice resulted in a high mortality rate among soldiers and civilians alike during her 33-year reign; the population of Madagascar is estimated to have declined from around 5&nbsp;million to 2.5&nbsp;million between 1833 and 1839. In 1839, Boina queen [[Tsiomeko of Boina|Tsiomeko]], having fled to the island of [[Nosy Be]], requested French assistance against Merina attacks. In accordance with France's conditions, she signed Nosy Be and part of the mainland to them, which the French then declared as its [[protectorate]]. Queen Rasoherina accepted, first marrying Rainivoninahitriniony, then later deposing him and marrying his brother, Prime Minister [[Rainilaiarivony]], who would go on to marry Queen [[Ranavalona II]] and Queen [[Ranavalona III]] in succession.

Over the course of Rainilaiarivony's 31-year tenure as prime minister, numerous policies were adopted to modernize and consolidate the power of the central government. Schools were constructed throughout the island and attendance was made mandatory. Army organization was improved and British consultants were employed to train and professionalize soldiers. [[Polygamy]] was outlawed and Christianity declared the official religion of the court in 1869, was adopted alongside traditional beliefs among a growing portion of the populace. At the end of the war, Madagascar ceded the northern port town of [[Antsiranana]] (Diego Suarez) to France and paid 560,000 francs to Lambert's heirs. In 1890, the British accepted the full formal imposition of a French [[protectorate]] on the island, but French authority was not acknowledged by the government of Madagascar. To force capitulation, the French bombarded and occupied the harbor of [[Toamasina]] on the east coast, and [[Mahajanga]] on the west coast, in December 1894 and January 1895 respectively.

A French military [[flying column]] then marched toward Antananarivo, losing many men to malaria and other diseases. Reinforcements came from [[Algeria]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Upon reaching the city in September 1895, the column bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, causing heavy casualties and leading Queen Ranavalona III to surrender. Popular resistance to the French capture of [[Antananarivo]]—known as the [[Menalamba rebellion]]—broke out in December 1895, and was not suppressed until the end of 1897. France annexed Madagascar in 1896 and declared the island a colony the following year, dissolving the Merina monarchy and sending the royal family into exile on [[Réunion|Réunion Island]] and to Algeria.{{Citation needed|date=November 2025}}

The conquest was followed by ten years of civil war, due to the Menalamba insurrection. The "pacification" carried out by the French administration lasted more than fifteen years, in response to the rural guerrillas scattered throughout the country. The French [[Franco-Menabe war|campaign against Menabe]] began with the {{Interlanguage link|Ambiky massacre|fr|Massacre d'Ambiky}} in 1897 and ended in 1902. The Antandroy and Mahafaly continued to oppose colonial rule, though yielded in 1904.{{Reference page|pages=238-9}} In total, the repression of this resistance to colonial conquest caused several tens of thousands of Malagasy victims. [[Slavery]] was abolished in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed; many remained in their former masters' homes as servants or as sharecroppers; in many parts of the island strong discriminatory views against slave descendants are still held today. Wide paved boulevards and gathering places were constructed in the capital city of Antananarivo and the Rova palace compound was turned into a museum. Additional schools were built, particularly in rural and coastal areas where the schools of the Merina had not reached. Education became mandatory between the ages of 6 and 13 and focused primarily on the French language and practical skills.
[[File:29_Mars_1947_Monument.jpg|thumb|National monument in [[Moramanga]] commemorating the beginning of the [[Malagasy Uprising]] on 29 March 1947. Between 11,000 and 90,000 Malagasy died during the uprising which lasted nearly two years.]]
Huge mining and forestry concessions were granted to large companies. Native chiefs loyal to the French administration were also granted part of the land. Forced labor was introduced in favor of the French companies and peasants were encouraged, through taxation, to work for wages (especially in the colonial concessions) to the detriment of small individual farms. However, the colonial period was accompanied by movements fighting for independence: the Menalamba, the [[Vy Vato Sakelika]], the [[Democratic Movement for Malagasy Renovation]] (MDRM). In 1927, major demonstrations were organized in Antananarivo, notably on the initiative of the communist activist {{Interlanguage link|François Vittori|fr}}, who was imprisoned as a result. The 1930s saw the Malagasy anti-colonial movement gain further momentum. Malagasy trade unionism began to appear underground and the [[Communist Party of the Madagascar region]] was formed. But in 1939, all the organizations were dissolved by the administration of the colony, which opted for the [[Vichy regime]]. The MDRM was accused by the colonial regime of being at the origin of the 1947 insurrection and was pursued by violent repression.

The Merina royal tradition of [[Corvée|taxes paid in the form of labor]] was continued under the French and used to construct a railway and roads linking key coastal cities to Antananarivo. Malagasy troops fought for France in [[World War I]]. In the 1930s, [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] political thinkers developed the [[Madagascar Plan]] that had identified the island as a potential site for the deportation of Europe's Jews. During the [[Second World War]], the island was the site of the [[Battle of Madagascar]] between the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] and an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] expeditionary force.

The occupation of France during the Second World War tarnished the prestige of the colonial administration in Madagascar and galvanized the growing independence movement, leading to the [[Malagasy Uprising]] of 1947. This movement led the French to establish reformed institutions in 1956 under the ''[[Loi Cadre]]'' (Overseas Reform Act), and Madagascar moved peacefully towards independence. The [[Malagasy Republic]] was proclaimed on 14 October 1958, as an [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] state within the [[French Community]]. A period of provisional government ended with the adoption of a constitution in 1959 and full independence on 26 June 1960.

[[File:Philibert_Tsiranana_1962.jpg|thumb|[[Philibert Tsiranana]], the first [[List of Presidents of Madagascar|president of Madagascar]] (1960–1972)]]
Since regaining independence, Madagascar has transitioned through four republics with corresponding revisions to its constitution. The [[Malagasy Republic|First Republic]] (1960–72), under the leadership of French-appointed President [[Philibert Tsiranana]], was characterized by a continuation of strong economic and political ties to France. Many high-level technical positions were filled by French expatriates, and French teachers, textbooks and curricula continued to be used in schools around the country. Popular resentment over Tsiranana's tolerance for this "neo-colonial" arrangement inspired a [[Rotaka|series of farmer and student protests]] that overturned his administration in 1972.

This period saw a political alignment with the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures stemming from the [[1973 oil crisis]], resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and a sharp decline in living standards,

Ratsiraka's dwindling popularity in the late 1980s reached a critical point in 1991 when presidential guards opened fire on unarmed protesters during a rally. Within two months, a transitional government had been established under the leadership of [[Albert Zafy]] (1993–96), who went on to win the 1992 presidential elections and inaugurate the [[Third Republic of Madagascar|Third Republic]] (1992–2010). The new [[Constitution of Madagascar|Madagascar constitution]] established a multi-party democracy and a separation of powers that placed significant control in the hands of the National Assembly. The new constitution also emphasized human rights, social and political freedoms, and free trade. In March 2009, Rajoelina was declared by the Supreme Court as the President of the [[High Transitional Authority]], an interim governing body responsible for moving the country toward presidential elections. In 2010, a new constitution was [[Malagasy constitutional referendum, 2010|adopted by referendum]], establishing a Fourth Republic, which sustained the democratic, multi-party structure established in the previous constitution.

In 2018 the first round of the [[2018 Malagasy presidential election|presidential election]] was held on 7 November and the second round was held on 10 December. Three former presidents and the most recent president were the main candidates of the elections. Rajoelina won the second round of the elections. Ravalomana lost the second round and he did not accept the results because of allegations of fraud. Rajaonarimampianina received very modest support in the first round. In January 2019 the High Constitutional Court declared Rajoelina as the winner of the elections and the new president. In June 2019 [[2019 Malagasy parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] the Rajoelina's won absolute majority of the seats of the National Assembly. It received 84 seats and the supporters of former president Ravalomana got only 16 seats of 151 seats of the National Assembly. 51 seats of deputies were independent or represented small parties. Rajoelina could rule as a [[Strongman (politics)|strongman]].

Mid-2021 marked the beginning of the [[2021–2022 Madagascar famine]] which, due to a severe drought, caused hundreds of thousands of people to face [[Food security|food insecurity]] and over one million people were on the verge of a [[famine]].

In November 2023, Rajoelina was re-elected to another term with 58.95% of the vote in the first round of the [[2023 Malagasy presidential election|election]] amidst an opposition boycott and a controversy about his acquisition of French citizenship and subsequent eligibility. Turnout was 46.36%, the lowest in a presidential election in the country's history.
