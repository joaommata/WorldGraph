===Prehistory===
[[File:Turkana Boy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Turkana boy|Turkana Boy]], a 1.6-million-year-old ''[[Homo erectus]]'' fossil]]

[[Hominid]] species, such as ''[[Homo habilis]]'' (fl. 1.8 to 2.5 million years ago) and ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (fl. 1.9 million to 350,000 years ago), possibly the direct ancestors of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', had lived in Kenya in the [[Pleistocene]] epoch. East Africa, including Kenya, is one of the earliest regions where modern humans (''[[Homo sapiens]]'') are believed to have lived. In 1984, during excavations at Lake Turkana palaeoanthropologist [[Richard Leakey]], assisted by [[Kamoya Kimeu]], had discovered the [[Turkana Boy]], a 1.6-million-year-old ''Homo erectus'' fossil. Further evidence of Kenya's prehistory was found in 2018, namely the early emergence of [[Behavioral modernity|modern behaviours]], including long-distance trade networks (involving goods such as [[obsidian]]), the use of pigments, and possibly the making of [[projectile points]], about 320,000 years ago. The authors of three 2018 studies on the site suggest that complex and modern behaviours had already begun in Africa around the time of the emergence of ''Homo sapiens''.

The first inhabitants of present-day Kenya were [[hunter-gatherer]] groups, akin to the modern [[Khoisan]] speakers. These people were later largely replaced by agropastoralist [[Cushitic]] (ancestral to Kenya's Cushitic speakers), who originated from the [[Horn of Africa]]. During the early [[Holocene]], the region's climate shifted from drier to wetter conditions. This provided an opportunity for the development of cultural traditions such as agriculture and [[herding]] in a more favourable environment. Today, the country's Nilotic ethnic groups include the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]], [[Samburu people|Samburu]], [[Luo (family of ethnic groups)|Luo]], [[Turkana people|Turkana]], and [[Maasai people|Maasai]].

By the first millennium AD, [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking farmers had moved into the region, initially along the [[Kenyan coast]]. The Bantus had originated in West Africa along the [[Benue River]] in what is now eastern [[Nigeria]] and western [[Cameroon]]. The [[Bantu migration]] brought new developments in agriculture and [[History of ferrous metallurgy|ironworking]] to the region. The Swahili people were of mixed African and Asian (particularly Persian) ancestry, as [[DNA]] evidence has revealed.

By the 1st century CE, many of the area's city-states, such as [[Mombasa]], [[Malindi]], and [[Zanzibar]], began to establish trading relations with the [[Arabs]]. This led to increased economic growth of the Swahili states, the introduction of [[Islam]], [[Arabic]] influences on the [[Swahili language]], [[cultural diffusion]], as well as the Swahili city-states becoming members of a larger trade network. Many historians had long believed that the city-states were established by Arab or Persian traders, but archaeological evidence has led scholars to recognise the city-states as an indigenous development which, though subjected to foreign influence due to trade, retained a Bantu cultural core.

The [[Kilwa Sultanate]] was a medieval [[sultanate]] centred at [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], in modern-day Tanzania. At its height, its authority stretched over the entire length of the [[Swahili Coast]], including Kenya. Beginning in the 10th century, the rulers of Kilwa would go on to build elaborate coral mosques and introduce copper coinage.

Swahili, a [[Bantu language]] with [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and other Middle-Eastern and South Asian [[loanword]]s, later developed as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' for trade between the different peoples.

===Early Portuguese presence===
[[File:Braun Mombasa UBHD.jpg|thumb|left|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese presence]] in Kenya lasted from 1498 until 1730. [[Mombasa]] was under Portuguese rule from 1593 to 1698 and again from 1728 to 1729.]]
The Swahili built Mombasa into a major port city and established trade links with other nearby city-states, as well as commercial centres in Persia, Arabia, and even India. By the 15th century, Portuguese voyager [[Duarte Barbosa]] wrote that "Mombasa is a place of great traffic and has a good harbour in which there are always moored small craft of many kinds and also great ships, both of which are bound from [[Sofala]] and others which come from [[Cambay]] and [[Malindi|Melinde]] and others which sail to the island of Zanzibar."

One major city on the Kenyan coast is Malindi. It has been an important Swahili settlement since the 14th century, and the city once rivalled Mombasa for dominance in the [[African Great Lakes]] region. Malindi has traditionally been a friendly port city for foreign powers. In 1414, the Chinese trader and explorer [[Zheng He]], representing the [[Ming Dynasty]], visited the East African coast on one of his last '[[Ming treasure voyages|treasure voyages]]'. Malindi also welcomed the Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] in 1498.

In the 17th century, the Swahili coast was conquered by the [[Omani Arabs]], who expanded the [[Indian Ocean slave trade|slave trade]] to meet the demands of plantations in [[Oman]] and Zanzibar. Initially, these traders came mainly from Oman, but later many came from Zanzibar (such as [[Tippu Tip]]). In addition, the Portuguese started buying slaves from the Omani and Zanzibari traders in response to the interruption of the [[transatlantic slave trade]] by British abolitionists.

===18th and 19th centuries===

During the 18th and 19th century, the [[Masai people]] moved into the central and southern [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Rift Valley]] plains of Kenya, from a region north of Lake Rudolf (now [[Lake Turkana]]). Although there weren't many of them, they managed to conquer a great amount of land in the plains, where people did not put up much resistance.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}} The [[Nandi people|Nandi]] peoples managed to oppose the Masai, while the Taveta peoples fled to the forests on the eastern edge of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], although they later were forced to leave the land due to the threat of [[smallpox]]. An outbreak of either [[rinderpest]] or [[pleuropneumonia]] greatly affected the Masai's cattle, while an epidemic of smallpox affected the Masai themselves. After the death of the Masai [[Mbatian]], the chief ''laibon'' (medicine man), the Masai split into warring factions. The Masai caused much strife in the areas they conquered; however, cooperation between such groups as the [[Luo people]], [[Luhya people]], and [[Gusii people]] is evidenced by shared vocabulary for modern implements and similar economic regimes. Although Arab traders remained in the area, trade routes were disrupted by the hostile Masai, though there was trade in ivory between these factions.

The first foreigners to successfully get past the Masai were [[Johann Ludwig Krapf]] and [[Johannes Rebmann]], two German missionaries who established a mission in [[Rabai]], not too far from [[Mombasa]]. The pair were the first Europeans to sight [[Mount Kenya]].

===German Protectorate (1885–1890)===
The [[German Empire]] established a protectorate over the [[Sultan of Zanzibar]]'s coastal possessions in 1885, followed by the arrival of the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] in 1888. Imperial rivalry was prevented by the [[Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty]], so Germany handed its East African coastal holdings to Britain in 1890.

===British Kenya (1888–1962)===
{{main|Kenya Colony}}
[[File:Africa 1909 16a.png|thumb|right|[[British East Africa]] in 1909]]
The transfer by Germany to Britain was followed by the building of the [[Uganda Railway]] passing through the country.

The building of the railway was resisted by some ethnic groups—notably the [[Nandi people|Nandi]], led by ''[[Orkoiyot]]'' [[Koitalel Arap Samoei]] from 1890 to 1900—but the British eventually built it. The ''Nandi'' were the first ethnic group to be put in a native reserve to stop them from disrupting the building of the railway. They and most of their descendants later remained in Kenya and formed the core of several distinct Indian communities, such as the [[Ismailism|Ismaili Muslim]] and [[Sikh]] communities. While building the railway through [[Tsavo]], a number of the Indian railway workers and local African labourers were attacked by two lions known as the [[Tsavo maneaters]].

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, the governors of [[British East Africa]] (as the protectorate was generally known) and [[German East Africa]] initially agreed on a truce in an attempt to keep the young colonies out of direct hostilities. But Lieutenant Colonel [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck]], the German military commander, determined to tie down as many British resources as possible. Completely cut off from Germany, Lettow-Vorbeck conducted [[East African campaign (World War I)|an effective guerrilla warfare campaign]], living off the land, capturing British supplies, and remaining undefeated. He eventually surrendered in [[Northern Rhodesia]] (today Zambia) 14 days after the Armistice was signed in 1918. One depiction of this period of change from a colonist's perspective is found in the memoir ''[[Out of Africa]]'' by Danish author Baroness Karen von Blixen-Finecke, published in 1937. By the 1930s, approximately 30,000 white settlers lived in the area and gained a political voice because of their contribution to the market economy.

Throughout [[World War II]], [[Kenya in World War II|Kenya was]] an important source of manpower and agriculture for the United Kingdom. Kenya itself was the site of [[East African Campaign (World War II)|fighting]] between Allied forces and Italian troops in 1940–41, when Italian forces invaded. [[Wajir]] and [[Malindi]] were bombed as well.

===Mau Mau Uprising===
{{Further|Mau Mau Uprising}}
[[File:Statue of Dedan Kimathi Nairobi, Kenya.jpg|thumb|A statue of [[Dedan Kimathi]], a Kenyan leader with the [[Kenya Land and Freedom Army|Mau Mau]] who fought against the British colonial system in the 1950s]]

From October 1952 to December 1959, Kenya was in a state of emergency arising from the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Mau rebellion]] against British rule. The Mau Mau, also known as the Kenya Land and Freedom Army, were primarily [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], [[Embu people|Embu]] and [[Meru people|Meru]] people. During the colonial administration's crackdown, over 11,000 freedom fighters had been killed, along with 100 British troops and 2,000 Kenyan loyalist soldiers. War crimes were committed on both sides of the conflict, including the publicised [[Lari massacre]] and the [[Hola massacre]]. The governor requested and obtained British and African troops, including the [[King's African Rifles]]. The British began counter-insurgency operations. In May 1953, General Sir [[George Erskine]] took charge as commander-in-chief of the colony's armed forces, with the personal backing of [[Winston Churchill]].

The capture of [[Waruhiu Itote]] (nom de guerre ''"General China"'') on 15 January 1954 and the subsequent interrogation led to a better understanding of the Mau Mau command structure for the British. [[Mau Mau Uprising#British gain the initiative|Operation Anvil]] opened on 24 April 1954, after weeks of planning by the army with the approval of the War Council. The operation effectively placed Nairobi under military siege. Nairobi's occupants were screened and suspected Mau Mau supporters moved to detention camps. More than 80,000 Kikuyu were [[List of British Detention Camps during the Mau Mau Uprising|held in detention camps]] without trial, often subject to brutal treatment. The Home Guard formed the core of the government's strategy as it was composed of loyalist Africans, not foreign forces such as the [[British Army]] and King's African Rifles.

The capture of [[Dedan Kimathi]] on 21 October 1956 in [[Nyeri]] signified the ultimate defeat of the Mau Mau and essentially ended the military offensive.

===Somalis of Kenya referendum, 1962===
{{Further|Somalis in Kenya}}
Before Kenya got its independence, [[Somalis in Kenya|Somali ethnic people in present-day Kenya]] in the areas of [[Northern Frontier Districts]] petitioned Her Majesty's Government not to be included in Kenya. The colonial government decided to hold Kenya's first referendum in 1962 to check the willingness of [[Somalis in Kenya]] to join [[Somalia]].

The result of the referendum showed that 86% of Somalis in Kenya wanted to join [[Somalia]], yet the British colonial administration rejected the result and the Somalis remained in Kenya.

===Early independence period===
[[File:Jomo Kenyatta.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The first president and founding father of Kenya, [[Jomo Kenyatta]]]]

The first direct elections for native Kenyans to the Legislative Council took place in 1957.

Despite British hopes of handing power to "moderate" local rivals, it was the [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU) of [[Jomo Kenyatta]] that formed a government. The Colony of Kenya and the Protectorate of Kenya each came to an end on 12 December 1963, with independence conferred on all of Kenya. The U.K. ceded sovereignty over the Colony of Kenya. The Sultan of Zanzibar agreed that simultaneous with independence for the colony, he would cease to have sovereignty over the Protectorate of Kenya so that all of Kenya would become one sovereign state. In this way, Kenya became an independent country under the Kenya Independence Act 1963 of the United Kingdom. On 12 December 1964, Kenya became a republic under the name "Republic of Kenya". A ceasefire was eventually reached with the signing of the Arusha Memorandum in October 1967, but relative insecurity prevailed through 1969. To discourage further invasions, Kenya signed a defence pact with [[Ethiopia]] in 1969, which is still in effect.

===First presidency===
{{Further|Presidency of Jomo Kenyatta|Jomo Kenyatta}}
On 12 December 1964, the Republic of Kenya was proclaimed, and [[Jomo Kenyatta]] became Kenya's first president. Under Kenyatta, corruption became widespread throughout the government, civil service, and business community. Kenyatta and his family were tied up with this corruption as they enriched themselves through the mass purchase of property after 1963. Their acquisitions in the Central, Rift Valley, and Coast Provinces aroused great anger among landless Kenyans. His family used his presidential position to circumvent legal or administrative obstacles to acquiring property. The Kenyatta family also heavily invested in the coastal hotel business, with Kenyatta personally owning the Leonard Beach Hotel.

Kenyatta's mixed legacy was highlighted at the 10-year anniversary of Kenya's independence. A December 1973 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Kenyatta's leadership and Kenya for emerging as a model of pragmatism and conservatism. Kenya's GDP had increased at an annual rate of 6.6%, higher than the population growth rate of more than 3%. But [[Amnesty International]] responded to the article by stating the cost of the stability in terms of human rights abuses. The opposition party started by [[Oginga Odinga]]—[[Kenya People's Union]] (KPU)—was banned in 1969 after the [[Kisumu Massacre]] and KPU leaders were still in detention without trial in gross violation of the [[U.N. Declaration of Human Rights]]. The Kenya Students Union, [[Jehovah Witnesses]] and all opposition parties were outlawed.

===Moi era===
{{Further|Daniel arap Moi|Presidency of Daniel Moi|1978 Kenyan presidential election|1988 Kenyan general election|1992 Kenyan general election}}
[[File:Moi and Bush.jpg|thumb|[[Daniel arap Moi]], Kenya's second President, and [[George W. Bush]], 2001]]
After Kenyatta died, [[Daniel arap Moi]] became president. He retained the presidency, running unopposed in elections held in 1979, 1983 ([[snap election]]s), and 1988, all of which were held under the single-party constitution. The 1983 elections were held a year early, and were a direct result of [[1982 Kenyan coup d'état attempt|a failed military coup]] on 2 August 1982.

The 1982 coup was masterminded by a low-ranking Air Force serviceman, Senior Private [[Hezekiah Ochuka]], and was staged mainly by enlisted men of the Air Force. It was quickly suppressed by forces commanded by Chief of General Staff [[Mahamoud Mohamed]], a veteran Somali military official. They included the General Service Unit (GSU)—a paramilitary wing of the police—and later the regular police.

On the heels of the [[Garissa Massacre]] of 1980, Kenyan troops committed the [[Wagalla massacre]] in 1984 against thousands of civilians in [[Wajir County]]. An official probe into the atrocities was later ordered in 2011.{{clarify|What were the results of the probe?|date=December 2019}}

The election held in 1988 saw the advent of the ''mlolongo'' (queuing) system, where voters were supposed to line up behind their favoured candidates instead of casting a secret ballot. This was seen as the climax of a very undemocratic regime and led to widespread agitation for constitutional reform. Several contentious clauses, including the one that allowed for only one political party, were changed in the following years.

=== Transition to multiparty democracy ===
In 1991, Kenya transitioned to a multiparty political system after 26 years of single-party rule. On 28 October 1992, Moi dissolved parliament, five months before the end of his term. As a result, preparations began for all elective seats in parliament as well as the president. The election was scheduled to take place on 7 December 1992, but delays led to its postponement to 29 December. Apart from KANU, the ruling party, other parties represented in the elections included [[Forum for the Restoration of Democracy|FORD]] Kenya and FORD Asili. This election was marked by large-scale intimidation of opponents and harassment of election officials. It resulted in an economic crisis propagated by ethnic violence as the president was accused of rigging electoral results to retain power. This election was a turning point for Kenya as it signified the beginning of the end of Moi's leadership and the rule of KANU. Moi retained the presidency and [[George Saitoti]] became vice president. Although it held on to power, KANU won 100 seats and lost 88 seats to the six opposition parties. In the next five years, many political alliances were formed in preparation for the next elections. In 1994, [[Jaramogi Oginga Odinga]] died and several coalitions joined his FORD Kenya party to form a new party, United National Democratic Alliance. This party was plagued with disagreements. In 1995, [[Richard Leakey]] formed the Safina party, but it was denied registration until November 1997.

In 1996, KANU revised the constitution to allow Moi to remain president for another term. Subsequently, Moi stood for reelection and won a 5th term in 1997. His win was strongly criticised by his major opponents, [[Mwai Kibaki|Kibaki]] and [[Raila Odinga|Odinga]], as fraudulent. Following this win, Moi was constitutionally barred from another presidential term. Beginning in 1998, he attempted to influence the country's succession politics to have [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] elected in the 2002 elections.

===President Kibaki and the road to a new constitution===
{{Further|Mwai Kibaki|Presidency of Mwai Kibaki|2002 Kenyan general election|2007 Kenyan general election}}
Moi's plan to be replaced by Uhuru Kenyatta failed, and [[Mwai Kibaki]], running for the opposition coalition "National Rainbow Coalition" ([[National Rainbow Coalition|NARC]]), was elected president. David Anderson (2003) reports the elections were judged free and fair by local and international observers, and seemed to mark a turning point in Kenya's democratic evolution. As a result, the elections of 2007 took place following the procedure set by the old constitution. Kibaki was reelected in highly contested elections marred by [[2007–08 Kenyan crisis|political and ethnic violence]]. The main opposition leader, Raila Odinga, claimed the election was rigged and that he was the rightfully elected president. In the ensuing violence, 1,500 people were killed and another 600,000 internally displaced, making it the worst post-election violence in Kenya. To stop the death and displacement of people, Kibaki and Odinga agreed to work together, with the latter taking the position of a prime minister. This made Odinga [[Prime Minister of Kenya|the second prime minister of Kenya]].

In July 2010, Kenya partnered with other East African countries to form the new East African Common Market within the [[East African Community]]. In 2011, [[Operation Linda Nchi|Kenya began sending troops]] to Somalia to fight the terror group [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]]. In mid-2011, two consecutive missed rainy seasons precipitated the worst [[2011 East Africa drought|drought in East Africa]] in 60 years. The northwestern [[Turkana District|Turkana region]] was especially affected, with local schools shut down as a result. The crisis was reportedly over by early 2012 because of coordinated relief efforts. Aid agencies subsequently shifted their emphasis to recovery initiatives, including digging irrigation canals and distributing plant seeds.

In August 2010, Kenyans held a [[2010 Kenyan constitutional referendum|referendum]] and passed [[Constitution of Kenya|a new constitution]], which limited presidential powers and devolved the central government. Kenyatta was re-elected in 2017 in [[2017 Kenyan general election|another disputed election]]. Odinga accused the [[Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission]] of mismanaging the election and Kenyatta and his party of rigging. The Supreme Court overturned the results in a landmark ruling that established its position as an independent check on the president. In the repeated election, Kenyatta won after Odinga refused to participate, citing irregularities.

In March 2018, a historic [[2018 Kenya handshake|handshake]] between Kenyatta and Odinga signaled a period of reconciliation followed by economic growth and increased stability. Between 2019 and 2021, the two combined efforts to promote major changes to the Kenyan constitution, labelled the "Building Bridges Initiative" (BBI). They said their efforts were to improve inclusion and overcome the country's election system that often resulted in post-election violence. The BBI proposal called for broad expansion of the legislative and executive branches, including the creation of a [[prime minister]] with two deputies and an official leader of the opposition, reverting to selecting cabinet ministers from among the elected Members of Parliament, establishing up to 70 new [[constituencies]], and adding up to 300 unelected members of Parliament (under an "[[affirmative action]]" plan).

Ruto narrowly won the [[2022 Kenyan general election|2022 presidential election]], defeating Odinga to become Kenya's fifth president. In 2024, Ruto and the [[Kenya Kwanza]] coalition faced [[Kenya Protests (2024)|popular protests]] over the [[Kenya Finance Bill 2024|Kenyan Finance Bill 2024]].
