The region currently known as the country of Uzbekistan has been referred to by many names over the millennia. The name Uzbekistan first appears in 16th century literature.

The [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] conquest under [[Genghis Khan]] during the 13th century brought change to the region. The invasions of Bukhara, Samarkand, [[Köneürgenç|Urgench]] and others resulted in [[Destruction under the Mongol Empire|mass murders]] and unprecedented destruction, which saw parts of [[Khwarazmian Empire|Khwarezmia]] being completely razed.

Following the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, his empire was divided among his four sons and family members. Despite the potential for serious fragmentation, an orderly succession continued for several generations. Control of most of Transoxiana stayed in the hands of the direct descendants of [[Chagatai Khan]], the second son of Genghis Khan. Orderly succession, prosperity, and internal peace prevailed in the Chaghatai lands, and the Mongol Empire as a whole remained a strong and united kingdom, known as the [[Golden Horde]].{{sfnp|Lubin|1997|pp=389-90}}

=== Timurid period ===
One tribal chieftain, [[Timur]] (Tamerlane), emerged from these struggles in the 1380s as the dominant force in Transoxiana. Although he was not a descendant of Genghis Khan, Timur became the ''de facto'' ruler of Transoxiana and proceeded to conquer all of western Central Asia, [[Iran]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Asia Minor]], and the southern steppe region north of the [[Aral Sea]]. He also invaded Russia before dying during an invasion of [[Ming dynasty|China]] in 1405.{{sfnp|Lubin|1997|pp=389-90}} Timur was also known for his extreme brutality and his conquests were accompanied by [[genocidal massacre]]s in the cities he occupied.

Timur initiated the last flowering of Transoxiana by gathering together numerous artisans and scholars from the vast lands he had conquered into his capital, Samarkand, thus imbuing his empire with a rich Perso-Islamic culture. During his reign and the reigns of his immediate descendants, a wide range of religious and palatial construction masterpieces were undertaken in Samarkand and other population centres.

Tamerlane also established an exchange of medical discoveries and patronised physicians, scientists and artists from the neighbouring regions such as India; his grandson [[Ulugh Beg]] was one of the world's first great astronomers. It was during the Timurid dynasty that Turkic, in the form of the [[Chagatai language|Chaghatai]] dialect, became a literary language in its own right in Transoxiana, although the Timurids were Persianate in culture. The greatest Chaghataid writer, [[Ali-Shir Nava'i]], was active in the city of [[Herat]] (now in northwestern Afghanistan) in the second half of the 15th century.{{sfnp|Lubin|1997|pp=389-90}}

=== Uzbek period ===
The Timurid state quickly split in half after the death of Timur. The chronic internal fighting of the Timurids attracted the attention of the Uzbek nomadic tribes living to the north of the Aral Sea. In 1501, the Uzbek forces began a wholesale invasion of Transoxiana.{{sfnp|Lubin|1997|pp=389-90}} The [[Bukhara slave trade|slave trade]] in the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] became prominent and was firmly established at this time. The Khanate of Bukhara was eventually invaded by the foreign government of Persia in 1510, and then became a part of the Persian empire of the day.

Before the arrival of the [[Russians]], present-day Uzbekistan was divided between the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] and the [[khanate]]s of [[Khanate of Khiva|Khiva]] and [[Khanate of Kokand|Kokand]].

=== Russian conquest ===
In the 19th century, the [[Russian Empire]] began to expand and spread into [[Central Asia]]. There were 210,306 Russians living in Uzbekistan in 1912. The "[[Great Game]]" period is generally regarded as running from approximately 1813 to the [[Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907]]. A second, less intensive phase followed the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] of 1917. At the start of the 19th century, there were some {{convert|3,200|km|mi}} separating [[British India]] and the outlying regions of [[Imperial Russia|Tsarist Russia]]. Much of the land between was unmapped. In the early 1890s, [[Sven Hedin]] passed through Uzbekistan, during his first expedition.

=== Soviet period ===
{{main|Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic}}
By the beginning of 1920, Central Asia was firmly in the hands of Russia and, despite some early [[Basmachi movement|resistance]] to the [[Bolsheviks]], Uzbekistan and the rest of Central Asia became a part of the [[Soviet Union]]. On 27 October 1924, the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]] was created. From 1941 to 1945, during [[World War II]], 1,433,230 people from Uzbekistan fought in the [[Red Army]] against [[Nazi Germany]]. As many as 263,005 Uzbek soldiers died in the battlefields of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], and 32,670 went missing in action.

During the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], a number of Uzbek troops fought in neighbouring [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]]. At least 1,500 lost their lives and thousands more paralysed.{{cn|date=April 2025}}

===Independence===
On 20 June 1990, Uzbekistan declared its state sovereignty. On 31 August 1991, Uzbekistan declared independence after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|failed coup attempt]] in Moscow. 1 September was proclaimed National Independence Day. The Soviet Union was [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] on 26 December of that year. [[Islam Karimov]], previously first secretary of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan since 1989, was elected president of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic in 1990. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, he was elected president of independent Uzbekistan. An authoritarian ruler, Karimov died in September 2016. He was replaced by his long-time [[Prime Minister of Uzbekistan|Prime Minister]], [[Shavkat Mirziyoyev]], on 14 December of the same year. On 6 November 2021, Mirziyoyev was sworn into his second term in office, after gaining a landslide victory in presidential [[2021 Uzbek presidential election|election.]]
