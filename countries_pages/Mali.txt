The rock art in the [[Sahara]] suggests that northern Mali has been inhabited since 10,000 BC, when the Sahara was fertile and rich in wildlife. Early ceramics have been discovered at the central Malian site of Ounjougou dating to about 9,400 BC, and are believed to represent an instance of the independent invention of pottery in the region. Farming took place by 5000 BC and iron was used by around 500 BC.
In the first millennium BC, early cities and towns were created by Mande peoples related to the [[Soninke people]], along the middle Niger River in central Mali, including [[Dia, Mali|Dia]] which began from around 900 BC, and reached its peak around 600 BC, and [[Djenne-Djenno]], which lasted from around 300 BC to 900 AD. Through approximately 6th century BC and 4th century BC, the lucrative trans-Saharan trade in pack-animals, gold, salt and slaves had begun, facilitating the rise of West Africa's great empires.

There are a few references to Mali in early Islamic literature. Among these are references to "Pene" and "Malal" in the work of [[al-Bakri]] in 1068, the story of the conversion of an early ruler, known to [[Ibn Khaldun]] (by 1397) as Barmandana, and a few geographical details in the work of [[al-Idrisi]].

Mali was once part of three famed West African empires which controlled [[trans-Saharan trade]] in gold, salt, other precious commodities, and [[slaves]] majorly during the reign of [[Mansa Musa]] from c. 1312 – c. 1337. These [[Sahelian kingdom]]s had neither rigid geopolitical boundaries nor rigid ethnic identities.

The [[Battle of Kirina]] in 1235, culminated in a victory for the [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] under the command of the exiled prince [[Sundiata Keita]], which led to the downfall of the [[Sosso Empire]].

The [[Mali Empire]] later formed on the upper [[Niger River]], and reached the height of power in the 14th century.

Mali fell under the control of France during the [[Scramble for Africa]] in the late 19th century. The last resistance was suppressed only in September 1916. During the suppression of the uprising, over 100 villages were destroyed by French colonial troops.

On 24 November 1958, French Sudan (which changed its name to the Sudanese Republic) became an autonomous republic within the [[French Community]]. In January 1959, Mali and [[Senegal]] united to become the [[Mali Federation]].

[[Modibo Keïta]] was elected the first president. On 19 November 1968, following progressive economic decline, the Keïta regime was overthrown in a bloodless military coup led by [[Moussa Traoré]], a day which is now commemorated as [[Liberation Day]].

=== Moussa Traoré regime ===
The subsequent military-led regime, with Traoré as president, attempted to reform the economy. His efforts were frustrated by political turmoil and a devastating [[Sahel drought|drought]] from 1968 to 1974, The Traoré regime faced student unrest beginning in the late 1970s and three coup attempts. The Traoré regime repressed all dissenters until the late 1980s. Scattered acts of rioting and vandalism of public buildings followed, but most actions by the dissidents remained nonviolent.

26 March 1991 is the day that marks the clash between military soldiers and peaceful demonstrating students which climaxed in the massacre of dozens under the orders of Traoré. He and three associates were later tried and convicted and received the death sentence for their part in the decision-making of that day. Nowadays, the day is a national holiday in order to remember the tragic events and the people who were killed. The coup is remembered as Mali's [[1991 Malian coup d'état|March Revolution of 1991]].

By 26 March, the growing refusal of soldiers to fire into the largely nonviolent protesting crowds turned into a full-scale tumult, and resulted in thousands of soldiers putting down their arms and joining the pro-democracy movement.{{cn|date=June 2025}} That afternoon, Lieutenant Colonel [[Amadou Toumani Touré]] announced on the radio that he had arrested the dictatorial president, Moussa Traoré. 

=== Multi-party democracy ===
Opposition parties were legalized, a transitional government was formed and a national congress of civil and political groups met to draft a [[Constitution of Mali|new democratic constitution]] to be approved by a national referendum. During this democratic period Mali was regarded as one of the most politically and socially stable countries in Africa.

[[Slavery in modern Africa|Slavery]] persists in Mali today with as many as 200,000 people held in direct servitude to a master.

In January 2012 [[Tuareg rebellion (2012)|a Tuareg rebellion]] began in northern Mali, led by the [[National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad]] (MNLA). In March, military officer [[Amadou Sanogo]] seized power in [[2012 Malian coup d'état|a coup d'état]], citing Touré's failures in quelling the rebellion, and leading to sanctions and an embargo by the [[Economic Community of West African States]]. The MNLA quickly took control of the north, declaring its independence as [[Azawad]]. However, Islamist groups, including [[Ansar Dine]] and [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb|Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)]], who had helped the MNLA defeat the government, turned on the Tuareg and took control of the north with the goal of implementing [[sharia]] in Mali.

On 11 January 2013, the [[French Armed Forces]] [[Operation Serval|intervened]] at the request of the interim government of president [[Dioncounda Traoré]]. On 30 January, the coordinated advance of the French and Malian troops claimed to have retaken the last remaining Islamist stronghold of Kidal, which was also the last of three northern provincial capitals. On 2 February, French president [[François Hollande]] joined Dioncounda Traoré in a public appearance in recently recaptured Timbuktu.

In August 2013, [[Ibrahim Boubacar Keita]] was elected as the new [[president of Mali]] in the second round of [[2013 Malian presidential election|the election]].

=== Conflict in Central Mali ===
In the central Mali province of [[Mopti Region|Mopti]], conflict has escalated since 2015 between agricultural communities like the [[Dogon people|Dogon]] and the [[Bambara people|Bambara]], and the [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] [[Fula people|Fula (or Fulani) people]]. Historically, the two sides have fought over access to land and water, factors which have been exacerbated by [[climate change]] as the Fula move into new areas. The Dogon and the Bambara communities have formed "self-defense groups" The government denies this. no candidate received more than 50% of the vote in the first round. A runoff was held on 12 August 2018 between the top two candidates, incumbent president [[Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta]] of the [[Rally for Mali]] and [[Soumaïla Cissé]] of the [[Union for the Republic and Democracy]], and Keïta was re-elected with 67% of the vote.

In September 2018, the [[Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue]] negotiated a unilateral ceasefire with Dan Na Ambassagou "in the context of the conflict which opposes the group to other community armed groups in central Mali". However, the group has been blamed for the [[March 2019 attacks against Fulani herders|24 March 2019 massacre of 160 Fula villagers]]. The group denied the attack, but afterwards Malian president Keita ordered the group to disband. The UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, [[Adama Dieng]], warned of a growing [[ethnicization]] of the conflict. By 2020, more than 600,000 people had been [[Refugee|displaced]] by the conflict in Mali. The United Nations reported that the number of children killed in the conflict in the first six months of 2019 was twice as many for the entire year of 2018. Many of the children have been killed in intercommunal attacks attributed to ethnic militias, with the majority of attacks occurring around [[Mopti]]. It is reported that around 900 schools have closed down and that armed militias are recruiting children.

During the first week of October 2019, two jihadist attacks in the towns of Boulikessi and [[Mondoro]] killed more than 25 Mali soldiers near the border with [[Burkina Faso]]. President Keïta declared that "no military coup will prevail in Mali", continuing by saying that he does not think it "is on the agenda at all and cannot worry us". On 1 November 2019, the [[Islamic State in the Greater Sahara|IS-GS]] militants killed at least 50 soldiers in the [[2019 Indelimane attack]] in the [[Ménaka Region]] of Mali. In February 2020, Human Rights Watch documented atrocities against civilians in Central Mali and said that at least 456 civilians were killed, while hundreds were injured from January 2019 until November.

Popular unrest began on 5 June 2020 following irregularities in the March and April parliamentary elections, including outrage against the kidnapping of opposition leader [[Soumaïla Cissé]]. Between 11 and 23 deaths followed protests that took place from 10 to 13 June. President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta and Prime Minister [[Boubou Cissé]] were arrested, and shortly after midnight Keïta announced his resignation, saying he did not want to see any bloodshed.

On 12 September 2020, the CNSP agreed to an 18-month political transition to civilian rule. Shortly after, [[Bah Ndaw|Bah N'daw]] was named interim president by a group of 17 electors, with Goïta being appointed vice president. The government was inaugurated on 25 September 2020. On 18 January 2021, the transitional government announced that the CNSP had been disbanded, almost four months after had been promised under the initial agreement.

Tensions between the civilian transitional government and the military ran high after the handover of power in September 2020. The tensions came to a head on 24 May 2021 after a cabinet reshuffle, where two leaders of the 2020 military coup – [[Sadio Camara]] and [[Modibo Kone]] – were replaced by N'daw's administration. Later that day, journalists reported that three key civilian leaders – President N'daw, Prime Minister [[Moctar Ouane]] and Defence Minister [[Souleymane Doucouré]], were being detained in a military base in [[Kati, Mali|Kati]], outside Bamako. On 7 June 2021, Mali's military commander Assimi Goïta was sworn into office as the new interim president.

In 2022 and 2023, the [[Islamic State in the Greater Sahara]] saw major gains in the [[Mali War]], occupying large swathes of territory in southeastern Mali. [[Ansongo]] and [[Tidermène]] were also captured by the group. By mid-2023, the militant group had doubled the amount of territory it controlled since the overthrow of the previous government and establishment of the junta.

On 10 January 2022, Mali announced the closure of its borders and recalled several ambassadors to ECOWAS countries in response to sanctions placed on Mali for deferring elections for four years. On 4 February, France's ambassador was expelled. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], Malian troops and suspected Russian mercenaries from the [[Wagner Group]] executed around 300 civilian men in central Mali in March 2022. France had started withdrawing French troops from Mali in February 2022, commencing the end of [[Operation Barkhane]]. On 2 May, the military government announced breaking its defence accords concluded in 2013 with France, constituting an additional step in the deterioration of Malian–French relations. This latest announcement has been criticized by French authorities and considered as "illegitimate". A UN panel reported that in the first three months of 2022, 543 civilians were killed and 269 wounded, warning the 2015 peace agreement between the government and pro-independence groups was threatened by a potential risk of confrontation for the first time in five years. The report also noted a sharp increase in the number of people needing humanitarian assistance over the previous year.

In June 2023, Mali removed French as an official language with the approval of a new constitution by 97% of voters in [[2023 Malian constitutional referendum|a referendum]] conducted by the junta.

On 7 September 2023, al-Qaeda linked [[Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin|JNIM]] militants [[Tombouctou and Bamba attacks|attacked]] a vessel on the [[Niger River]], killing at least 154 civilians.

In July 2024, [[Strategic Framework for the Defense of the People of Azawad|CSP-DPA]] rebels and JNIM militants killed dozens of Russian mercenaries and Malian government forces during the [[Battle of Tinzaouaten (2024)|Battle of Tinzaouaten]]. On 5 August 2024 the Republic of Mali announced that it was severing diplomatic relations with [[Ukraine]].

On 17 September 2024, al-Qaeda linked JNIM militants [[2024 Bamako attacks|attacked several locations]] across [[Bamako]], killing at least 77 people and injuring 255 others. 

In July 2025, JNIM began a strategy to blockade the government-controlled cities from foreign fuel imports and to cut them off from each other. Mali depends on foreign fuel imports, receiving 95% of its fuel from [[Senegal]] or [[Ivory Coast]]. Starting from 1 July, JNIM attacks cut off connections to [[Mauritania]] and Senegal, and they were followed by similar attacks in the south near Ivory Coast and [[Guinea]]. This increased fuel prices in the capital by 500% and has led to economic disruption, lines at gas stations, school closures, and cancellations of flights from the [[Bamako International Airport]]. In early September the Malian truckers' union stopped operations for two weeks due to the dangerous conditions along roads in southern Mali, leaving 1,000 fuel trucks waiting in Ivory Coast.<ref name="AfricaCenter" /> On 28 October, the U.S. Embassy advised all American citizens to leave the country immediately because of increasing instability, and to do so by plane, because of "terrorist attacks along national highways".<ref name="AJ-102925" />
