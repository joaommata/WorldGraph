Modern Angola was populated predominantly by [[nomad]]ic [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] and [[San people|San]] peoples prior to the first [[Bantu migration]]s. The Khoi and San peoples were [[hunter-gatherer]]s, rather than practicing [[pastoralism]] or cultivation of crops.

In the first millennium BC, they were displaced by [[Bantu peoples]] arriving from the north, most of whom likely originated in what is today northwestern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Niger]]. Bantu speakers introduced the cultivation of [[banana]]s and [[taro]], as well as maintenance of large cattle herds, to Angola's central highlands and the Luanda plain. Due to a number of inhibiting geographic factors throughout the territory of Angola, namely harshly traversable land, hot/humid climate, and a plethora of deadly diseases, intermingling of pre-colonial tribes in Angola had been rare.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

After settlement of the migrants, a number of political entities developed. The best-known of these was the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], based in Angola. It extended northward to what are now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], and [[Gabon]]. It established [[trade route]]s with other city-states and civilisations up and down the coast of southwestern and western Africa. Its traders even reached [[Great Zimbabwe]] and the [[Mutapa Empire]], although the kingdom engaged in little or no trans-oceanic trade. To its south lay the [[Kingdom of Ndongo]], from which the area of the later Portuguese colony was sometimes known as ''Dongo''. Next to that was the [[Kingdom of Matamba]]. The lesser [[Kakongo|Kingdom of Kakongo]] to the north was later a vassal of the [[Kingdom of Kongo]]. The people in all of these states spoke [[Kongo language|Kikongo]] as a common language.

===Portuguese colonisation===

[[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Age of Discovery|explorer]] [[Diogo Cão]] reached the area in 1484. The transition from a feudal system of slavery to a capitalist one with Portugal would prove crucial to the history of the Kingdom of Kongo.

As relations between Kongo and Portugal grew in the early 16th century, trade between the kingdoms also increased. Most of the trade was in palm cloth, copper, and ivory, but also increasing numbers of slaves.

Afonso continued to expand the kingdom of Kongo into the 1540s, expanding its borders to the south and east. The expansion of Kongo's population, coupled with Afonso's earlier religious reforms, allowed the ruler to centralize power in his capital and increase the power of the monarchy. He also established a royal monopoly on some trade. The increased production and sale of guns within the kingdom was due to the salient issue of the slave trade, which had become an increasingly violent struggle. There was a constant need for slaves for the kings and queens to sell in exchange for foreign commodities, the absence of which would prevent them from having any influence with European powers such as Portugal and eventually the [[Dutch Republic]].

Kongolese kings needed this influence to garner support from European powers for quelling internal rebellions. The situation became increasingly complicated during the rule of [[Garcia II of Kongo|Garcia II]], who needed the assistance of the Dutch military to drive out the Portuguese from [[Luanda]], in spite of the fact that Portugal was Kongo's primary slave trading partner.

War broke out more widely in the Kingdom of Kongo after the death of António I. usually in exchange for manufactured goods from Europe. This part of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] continued until after [[independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]] in the 1820s.

Despite Portugal's territorial claims in Angola, its control over much of the country's vast interior was minimal.

During the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], the [[Dutch West India Company]] [[Dutch Loango-Angola|occupied]] the principal settlement of Luanda in 1641, using alliances with local peoples to carry out attacks against Portuguese holdings elsewhere. In this period, the Portuguese came up against different forms of armed resistance from various peoples in Angola.

The [[Berlin Conference]] in 1884–1885 set the colony's borders, delineating the boundaries of Portuguese claims in Angola, Trade between Portugal and its African territories rapidly increased as a result of protective [[tariff]]s, leading to increased development, and a wave of new Portuguese immigrants.

===Angolan War of Independence===
{{Main|Angolan War of Independence|Portuguese Colonial War}}

Under colonial law, black Angolans were forbidden from forming political parties or labour unions. The first nationalist movements did not take root until after [[World War II]], spearheaded by a largely Westernised and Portuguese-speaking urban class, which included many [[mestiço]]s. During the early 1960s they were joined by other associations stemming from ''ad hoc'' labour activism in the rural workforce. Throughout the conflict, three militant nationalist movements with their own partisan guerrilla wings emerged from the fighting between the Portuguese government and local forces, supported to varying degrees by the [[Portuguese Communist Party]].

The ''[[FNLA|National Front for the Liberation of Angola]]'' (FNLA) recruited from [[Bakongo]] refugees in [[Zaire]]. Benefiting from particularly favourable political circumstances in [[Kinshasa|Léopoldville]], and especially from a common border with Zaire, Angolan political exiles were able to build up a power base among a large expatriate community from related families, clans, and traditions. People on both sides of the border spoke mutually intelligible dialects and enjoyed shared ties to the historical Kingdom of Kongo. Between 1961 and 1975 the MPLA, UNITA, and the FNLA competed for influence in the Angolan population and the international community.

The collapse of Portugal's [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] government following the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]] suspended all Portuguese military activity in Africa and the brokering of a ceasefire pending negotiations for Angolan independence. This was ratified by the [[Alvor Agreement]] later that month, which called for general elections and set the country's independence date for 11 November 1975. The fighting intensified with street clashes in April and May, and UNITA became involved after over two hundred of its members were massacred by an MPLA contingent that June.

In August 1975, the MPLA requested direct assistance from the Soviet Union in the form of ground troops. It embarked on an ambitious programme of [[Nationalization|nationalisation]], and the domestic private sector was essentially abolished. The ruling party survived an [[1977 Angolan coup d'état attempt|attempted coup d'état]] by the [[Maoism|Maoist]]-oriented [[Communist Organization of Angola|Communist Organisation of Angola]] (OCA) in 1977, which was suppressed after a series of bloody political purges left thousands of OCA supporters dead.

The MPLA abandoned its former Marxist ideology at its third party congress in 1990, and declared [[social democracy]] to be its new platform. By May 1991 it reached a peace agreement with UNITA, the [[Bicesse Accords]], which scheduled [[Angolan general election, 1992|new general elections]] for September 1992.

In 1997, [[George Soros]]'s [[Open Society Foundations]] launched its activities in Angola with the help of its first national representative until 2004, [[Rafael Marques de Morais]]. Despite the initial collaboration with the Angolan government on developing [[primary school]] education, relations quickly soured over OSF's [[democratisation]] and [[human rights]] campaigning.

===21st century===

On 22 February 2002, government troops killed Savimbi in a skirmish in the [[Moxico (province)|Moxico province]]. UNITA and the MPLA consented to the [[Luena, Angola|Luena]] Memorandum of Understanding in April; UNITA agreed to give up its armed wing. With the [[elections in Angola|elections]] in [[2008 Angolan parliamentary election|2008]] and [[2012 Angolan general election|2012]], an MPLA-ruled [[dominant-party system]] emerged, with UNITA and the FNLA as opposition parties.

Angola experienced a serious humanitarian crisis; the result of the prolonged war, the abundance of [[minefield]]s, and the continued political agitation in favour of the independence of the [[exclave]] of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] (carried out in the context of the protracted [[Cabinda War|Cabinda conflict]] by the [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda|FLEC]]). While most of the internally displaced have now [[Squatting in Angola|squatted]] around the capital, in ''musseques'' ([[shanty towns]]) the general situation for Angolans remains desperate.

In 2007, a separatist movement was launched in the diamond-rich [[Lunda Norte Province]] by the retired [[Military justice|military judge]] Jota Filipe Malakito under the name of the Commission of the Legal-Sociological Manifesto of the Lunda Tchokwé Protectorate (''Comissão do Manifesto Jurídico-Sociológico do Protectorado Lunda Tchokwé'', CMJSPLT).{{efn|Later changed to Legal-Sociological Manifesto of the Lunda People, ''Manifesto Jurídico-Sociológico do Povo Lunda'', MJSLP, and disbanded in 2025.}} After Malakito's release from prison in 2011, a [[hardline]] faction led by the former [[Secretary (title)|secretary general]] José Mateus "Zeca Mutchima" split from the CMJSPLT, forming the Movement of the Portuguese Protectorate of Lunda Chokwe (''Movimento do Protetorado Português da Lunda Tchokwé'', MPPLT), whose statement of principles was partly drawn from [[Diogo Pacheco de Amorim]]'s 2003 manifesto for the Portuguese right-wing party [[New Democracy Party (Portugal)|New Democracy]]. The separatist movement eventually targeted Angola's six eastern provinces, corresponding to 51,6% of its territory.

A [[drought]] in 2016 caused the worst food crisis in [[Southern Africa]] in 25 years, affecting 1.4 million people across seven of Angola's eighteen provinces. [[Food prices]] rose and acute [[malnutrition]] rates doubled, impacting over 95,000 children.

[[José Eduardo dos Santos]] stepped down as [[President of Angola]] after 38 years in 2017, being peacefully succeeded by [[João Lourenço]], Santos' chosen successor. Some members of the dos Santos family were later linked to high levels of corruption. In July 2022, ex-president José Eduardo dos Santos died in Spain.

In August 2022, the ruling party, MPLA, won another majority and President Lourenço won a second five-year term in the [[2022 Angolan general election|election]]. However, the election was the tightest in Angola's history.
