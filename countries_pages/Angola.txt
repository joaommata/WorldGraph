Modern Angola was populated predominantly by [[nomad]]ic [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] and [[San people|San]] peoples prior to the first [[Bantu migration]]s. The Khoi and San peoples were [[hunter-gatherer]]s, rather than practicing [[pastoralism]] or cultivation of crops.

In the first millennium BC, they were displaced by [[Bantu peoples]] arriving from the north, most of whom likely originated in what is today northwestern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Niger]]. Bantu speakers introduced the cultivation of [[banana]]s and [[taro]], as well as maintenance of large cattle herds, to Angola's central highlands and the Luanda plain. Due to a number of inhibiting geographic factors throughout the territory of Angola, namely harshly traversable land, hot/humid climate, and a plethora of deadly diseases, intermingling of pre-colonial tribes in Angola had been rare.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

After settlement of the migrants, a number of political entities developed. The best-known of these was the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], based in Angola. It extended northward to what are now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], and [[Gabon]]. It established [[trade route]]s with other city-states and civilisations up and down the coast of southwestern and western Africa. Its traders even reached [[Great Zimbabwe]] and the [[Mutapa Empire]], although the kingdom engaged in little or no trans-oceanic trade. To its south lay the [[Kingdom of Ndongo]], from which the area of the later Portuguese colony was sometimes known as ''Dongo''. Next to that was the [[Kingdom of Matamba]]. The lesser [[Kakongo|Kingdom of Kakongo]] to the north was later a vassal of the [[Kingdom of Kongo]]. The people in all of these states spoke [[Kongo language|Kikongo]] as a common language.

===Portuguese colonisation===

[[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Age of Discovery|explorer]] [[Diogo Cão]] reached the area in 1484. The previous year, the Portuguese had established relations with the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], which stretched at the time from modern [[Gabon]] in the north to the [[Kwanza River]] in the south. The Portuguese established their primary early trading post at [[Soyo]], which is now the northernmost city in Angola apart from the [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] [[enclave and exclave|exclave]].

[[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded São Paulo de Loanda ([[Luanda]]) in 1575 with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers. [[Benguela]] was fortified in 1587 and became a township in 1617. An authoritarian state, the Kingdom of Kongo was highly centralised around its monarch and controlled neighbouring states as [[vassal state|vassals]]. It had a strong economy, based on the industries of [[copper]], [[ivory]], [[salt]], [[Hide (skin)|hides]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Slavery|slaves]]. The transition from a feudal system of slavery to a capitalist one with Portugal would prove crucial to the history of the Kingdom of Kongo.

As relations between Kongo and Portugal grew in the early 16th century, trade between the kingdoms also increased. Most of the trade was in palm cloth, copper, and ivory, but also increasing numbers of slaves. Kongo exported few slaves, and its slave market had remained internal. But, following the development of a successful sugar-growing colony after Portuguese settlement of [[São Tomé]], Kongo became a major source of [[Slavery|slaves]] for the island's traders and plantations. Correspondence by King Afonso documents the purchase and sale of slaves within the country. His accounts also detail which slaves captured in war were given or sold to Portuguese merchants.

Afonso continued to expand the kingdom of Kongo into the 1540s, expanding its borders to the south and east. The expansion of Kongo's population, coupled with Afonso's earlier religious reforms, allowed the ruler to centralize power in his capital and increase the power of the monarchy. He also established a royal monopoly on some trade. To govern the growing slave trade, Afonso and several Portuguese kings claimed a joint monopoly on the external slave trade.

The slave trade increasingly became Kongo's primary, and arguably sole, [[economic sector]]. A major obstacle for the Kingdom of Kongo was that slaves were the only commodity for which the European powers were willing to trade. Kongo lacked an effective [[World currency|international currency]]. Kongolese nobles could buy slaves with the national currency of [[Shell money|nzimbu shells]], which could be traded for slaves. These could be sold to gain international currency.

As the slave trade was the only commodity in which Europeans were interested in the region during the 16th and 17th centuries, the Kongo economy was unable to [[Economic diversification|diversify]] or later [[Industrial Revolution|industrialise]] outside of sectors in which slavery was involved, such as the [[arms industry]]. The increased production and sale of guns within the kingdom was due to the salient issue of the slave trade, which had become an increasingly violent struggle. There was a constant need for slaves for the kings and queens to sell in exchange for foreign commodities, the absence of which would prevent them from having any influence with European powers such as Portugal and eventually the [[Dutch Republic]].

Kongolese kings needed this influence to garner support from European powers for quelling internal rebellions. The situation became increasingly complicated during the rule of [[Garcia II of Kongo|Garcia II]], who needed the assistance of the Dutch military to drive out the Portuguese from [[Luanda]], in spite of the fact that Portugal was Kongo's primary slave trading partner.

By the early 17th century, the supply of foreign slaves captured by the Kongolese externally was waning. The government began to approve the enslavement of freeborn Kongolese citizens for relatively minor infractions, nearly any disobeying of the authoritarian system and the aristocracy. If several villagers were deemed guilty of a crime, it became relatively common for the whole village to be enslaved. The resulting chaos and internal conflict from Garcia II's reign would lead into that of his son and successor, [[António I of Kongo|António I]]. He was killed in 1665 by Portuguese at the [[Battle of Mbwila]] 1665, together with a substantial proportion of the aristocracy. The colonists were expanding their power.

War broke out more widely in the Kingdom of Kongo after the death of António I. Much of the stability and access to [[iron ore]] and [[charcoal]] necessary for [[gunsmith]]s to maintain the arms industry was disrupted. From then on, in this period almost every Kongolese citizen was in danger of being enslaved. Many Kongolese subjects were adroit in making guns, and they were enslaved to have their skills available to colonists in the New World, where they worked as blacksmiths, ironworkers, and charcoal makers.

The Portuguese established several other settlements, forts and trading posts along the Angolan coast, principally trading in [[Slavery in Angola|Angolan slaves]] for [[plantations in the American South|plantations]]. Local slave dealers provided a large number of slaves for the [[Portuguese Empire]], usually in exchange for manufactured goods from Europe. This part of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] continued until after [[independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]] in the 1820s.

Despite Portugal's territorial claims in Angola, its control over much of the country's vast interior was minimal. In the 16th century Portugal gained control of the coast through a series of treaties and wars. Life for European colonists was difficult and progress was slow. [[John Iliffe (historian)|John Iliffe]] notes that "Portuguese records of Angola from the 16th century show that a great [[famine]] occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys".

During the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], the [[Dutch West India Company]] [[Dutch Loango-Angola|occupied]] the principal settlement of Luanda in 1641, using alliances with local peoples to carry out attacks against Portuguese holdings elsewhere. A fleet under [[Salvador de Sá]] retook Luanda in 1648; reconquest of the rest of the territory was completed by 1650. New treaties with the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]] were signed in 1649; others with [[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba|Njinga]]'s Kingdom of [[Matamba]] and [[Ndongo]] followed in 1656. The conquest of [[Pungo Andongo]] in 1671 was the last major Portuguese expansion from Luanda, as attempts to invade Kongo in 1670 and Matamba in 1681 failed. Colonial outposts also expanded inward from Benguela, but until the late 19th century the inroads from Luanda and Benguela were very limited. Hamstrung by a series of political upheavals in the early 1800s, Portugal was slow to mount a large scale annexation of Angolan territory.

The [[History of slavery|slave trade]] was abolished in Angola in 1836, and in 1854 the colonial government freed all its existing slaves. Four years later, a more progressive administration appointed by Portugal abolished [[slavery]] altogether. However, these decrees remained largely unenforceable, and the Portuguese depended on assistance from the British [[Royal Navy]] and what became known as the [[Blockade of Africa]] to enforce their ban on the slave trade. This coincided with a series of renewed military expeditions into the bush.

By the mid-nineteenth century Portugal had established its dominion as far north as the [[Congo River]] and as far south as [[Moçâmedes|Mossâmedes]]. Until the late 1880s, Portugal entertained proposals to link Angola with its [[colony]] in [[Mozambique]] but was blocked by British and Belgian opposition. In this period, the Portuguese came up against different forms of armed resistance from various peoples in Angola.

The [[Berlin Conference]] in 1884–1885 set the colony's borders, delineating the boundaries of Portuguese claims in Angola, although many details were unresolved until the 1920s. Trade between Portugal and its African territories rapidly increased as a result of protective [[tariff]]s, leading to increased development, and a wave of new Portuguese immigrants.

In 1925, an expedition to Angola was conducted by American naturalist explorer [[Arthur Stannard Vernay]]. Between 1939 and 1943, Portuguese army operations against the Mucubal, whom they accused of rebellion and cattle-thieving, resulted in hundreds of Mucubal killed. During the campaign, 3,529 were taken prisoner, 20% of whom were women and children, and imprisoned in concentration camps. Many died in captivity from undernourishment, violence and forced labor. Around 600 were sent to [[Sao Tome and Principe]]. Hundreds were also sent to a camp in [[Damba (municipality)|Damba]], where 26% died.

===Angolan War of Independence===
{{Main|Angolan War of Independence|Portuguese Colonial War}}

Under colonial law, black Angolans were forbidden from forming political parties or labour unions. The first nationalist movements did not take root until after [[World War II]], spearheaded by a largely Westernised and Portuguese-speaking urban class, which included many [[mestiço]]s. During the early 1960s they were joined by other associations stemming from ''ad hoc'' labour activism in the rural workforce. Portugal's refusal to address increasing Angolan demands for [[self-determination]] provoked an armed conflict, which erupted in 1961 with the [[Baixa de Cassanje revolt]] and gradually evolved into a protracted [[Angolan War of Independence|war of independence]] that persisted for the next twelve years. Throughout the conflict, three militant nationalist movements with their own partisan guerrilla wings emerged from the fighting between the Portuguese government and local forces, supported to varying degrees by the [[Portuguese Communist Party]].

The ''[[FNLA|National Front for the Liberation of Angola]]'' (FNLA) recruited from [[Bakongo]] refugees in [[Zaire]]. Benefiting from particularly favourable political circumstances in [[Kinshasa|Léopoldville]], and especially from a common border with Zaire, Angolan political exiles were able to build up a power base among a large expatriate community from related families, clans, and traditions. People on both sides of the border spoke mutually intelligible dialects and enjoyed shared ties to the historical Kingdom of Kongo. Though as foreigners skilled Angolans could not take advantage of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]'s state employment programme, some found work as middlemen for the absentee owners of various lucrative private ventures. The migrants eventually formed the FNLA with the intention of making a bid for political power upon their envisaged return to Angola.
[[File:FNLA1973.jpg|thumb|upright|Members of the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] training in 1973.]]
A largely [[Ovimbundu]] guerrilla initiative against the Portuguese in central Angola from 1966 was spearheaded by [[Jonas Savimbi]] and the ''[[UNITA|National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]]'' (UNITA). It remained handicapped by its geographic remoteness from friendly borders, the ethnic fragmentation of the Ovimbundu, and the isolation of peasants on European plantations where they had little opportunity to mobilise.

During the late 1950s, the rise of the Marxist–Leninist ''[[MPLA|Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]]'' (MPLA) in the east and Dembos hills north of Luanda came to hold special significance. Formed as a coalition resistance movement by the [[Angolan Communist Party]], the organisation's leadership remained predominantly [[Ambundu]] and courted public sector workers in [[Luanda]]. Although both the MPLA and its rivals accepted material assistance from the [[Soviet Union]] or the People's Republic of [[China]], the former harboured strong anti-imperialist views and was openly critical of the [[United States]] and its support for Portugal. This allowed it to win important ground on the diplomatic front, soliciting support from nonaligned governments in [[Morocco]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], and the [[United Arab Republic]].

The MPLA attempted to move its headquarters from [[Conakry]] to Léopoldville in October 1961, renewing efforts to create a common front with the FNLA, then known as the ''Union of Angolan Peoples'' (UPA) and its leader [[Holden Roberto]]. Roberto turned down the offer. When the MPLA first attempted to insert its own insurgents into Angola, the cadres were ambushed and annihilated by UPA partisans on Roberto's orders—setting a precedent for the bitter factional strife which would later ignite the [[Angolan Civil War]].

===Angolan Civil War===
{{Main|Angolan Civil War}}

Throughout the war of independence, the three rival nationalist movements were severely hampered by political and military factionalism, as well as their inability to unite guerrilla efforts against the Portuguese. Between 1961 and 1975 the MPLA, UNITA, and the FNLA competed for influence in the Angolan population and the international community. The [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]] became especially sympathetic towards the MPLA and supplied that party with arms, ammunition, funding, and training. They also backed UNITA militants until it became clear that the latter was at irreconcilable odds with the MPLA.

The collapse of Portugal's [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] government following the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]] suspended all Portuguese military activity in Africa and the brokering of a ceasefire pending negotiations for Angolan independence. Encouraged by the [[Organisation of African Unity]], Holden Roberto, Jonas Savimbi, and MPLA chairman [[Agostinho Neto]] met in [[Mombasa]] in early January 1975 and agreed to form a coalition government. This was ratified by the [[Alvor Agreement]] later that month, which called for general elections and set the country's independence date for 11 November 1975. All three factions, however, followed up on the ceasefire by taking advantage of the gradual Portuguese withdrawal to seize various strategic positions, acquire more arms, and enlarge their militant forces. The rapid influx of weapons from numerous external sources, especially the Soviet Union and the United States, as well as the escalation of tensions between the nationalist parties, fueled a new outbreak of hostilities. With tacit American and Zairean support the FNLA began massing large numbers of troops in northern Angola in an attempt to gain military superiority. Meanwhile, the MPLA began securing control of Luanda, a traditional Ambundu stronghold. Sporadic violence broke out in Luanda over the next few months after the FNLA attacked the MPLA's political headquarters in March 1975. The fighting intensified with street clashes in April and May, and UNITA became involved after over two hundred of its members were massacred by an MPLA contingent that June. An upswing in Soviet arms shipments to the MPLA influenced a decision by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] to likewise provide substantial covert aid to the FNLA and UNITA.

In August 1975, the MPLA requested direct assistance from the Soviet Union in the form of ground troops. The Soviets declined, offering to send advisers but no troops; however, Cuba was more forthcoming and in late September dispatched nearly five hundred combat personnel to Angola, along with sophisticated weaponry and supplies. By independence, there were over a thousand Cuban soldiers in the country. They were kept supplied by a massive [[Cuba–Angola airbridge|airbridge]] carried out with Soviet aircraft. The persistent buildup of Cuban and Soviet military aid allowed the MPLA to drive its opponents from Luanda and blunt an abortive intervention by Zairean and [[South Africa]]n troops, which had deployed in a belated attempt to assist the FNLA and UNITA. The FNLA was largely annihilated after the decisive [[Battle of Quifangondo]], although UNITA managed to withdraw its civil officials and militia from Luanda and seek sanctuary in the southern provinces. From there, Savimbi continued to mount a determined insurgent campaign against the MPLA.

Between 1975 and 1991, the MPLA implemented an economic and political system based on the principles of [[scientific socialism]], incorporating [[Planned economy|central planning]] and a [[Marxist–Leninist]] [[one-party state]]. It embarked on an ambitious programme of [[Nationalization|nationalisation]], and the domestic private sector was essentially abolished. Privately owned enterprises were nationalised and incorporated into a single umbrella of state-owned enterprises known as ''Unidades Economicas Estatais'' (UEE). Under the MPLA, Angola experienced a significant degree of modern [[industrialisation]]. However, corruption and graft also increased and public resources were either allocated inefficiently or simply embezzled by officials for personal enrichment. The ruling party survived an [[1977 Angolan coup d'état attempt|attempted coup d'état]] by the [[Maoism|Maoist]]-oriented [[Communist Organization of Angola|Communist Organisation of Angola]] (OCA) in 1977, which was suppressed after a series of bloody political purges left thousands of OCA supporters dead.

The MPLA abandoned its former Marxist ideology at its third party congress in 1990, and declared [[social democracy]] to be its new platform. Angola subsequently became a member of the [[International Monetary Fund]]; restrictions on the market economy were also reduced in an attempt to draw foreign investment. By May 1991 it reached a peace agreement with UNITA, the [[Bicesse Accords]], which scheduled [[Angolan general election, 1992|new general elections]] for September 1992. When the MPLA secured a major electoral victory, UNITA objected to the results of both the presidential and legislative vote count and returned to war. Following the election, the [[Halloween massacre (Angola)|Halloween massacre]] occurred from 30 October to 1 November, where MPLA forces killed thousands of UNITA supporters.

In 1997, [[George Soros]]'s [[Open Society Foundations]] launched its activities in Angola with the help of its first national representative until 2004, [[Rafael Marques de Morais]]. Despite the initial collaboration with the Angolan government on developing [[primary school]] education, relations quickly soured over OSF's [[democratisation]] and [[human rights]] campaigning.

===21st century===
{{Main|2000s in Angola}}
[[File:Porto de Luanda - Angola 2015.jpg|thumb|right|[[Luanda]] is experiencing widespread urban renewal and redevelopment in the 21st century, backed largely by profits from the oil and diamond industries.]]

On 22 February 2002, government troops killed Savimbi in a skirmish in the [[Moxico (province)|Moxico province]]. UNITA and the MPLA consented to the [[Luena, Angola|Luena]] Memorandum of Understanding in April; UNITA agreed to give up its armed wing. With the [[elections in Angola|elections]] in [[2008 Angolan parliamentary election|2008]] and [[2012 Angolan general election|2012]], an MPLA-ruled [[dominant-party system]] emerged, with UNITA and the FNLA as opposition parties.

Angola experienced a serious humanitarian crisis; the result of the prolonged war, the abundance of [[minefield]]s, and the continued political agitation in favour of the independence of the [[exclave]] of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] (carried out in the context of the protracted [[Cabinda War|Cabinda conflict]] by the [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda|FLEC]]). While most of the internally displaced have now [[Squatting in Angola|squatted]] around the capital, in ''musseques'' ([[shanty towns]]) the general situation for Angolans remains desperate.

In 2007, a separatist movement was launched in the diamond-rich [[Lunda Norte Province]] by the retired [[Military justice|military judge]] Jota Filipe Malakito under the name of the Commission of the Legal-Sociological Manifesto of the Lunda Tchokwé Protectorate (''Comissão do Manifesto Jurídico-Sociológico do Protectorado Lunda Tchokwé'', CMJSPLT).{{efn|Later changed to Legal-Sociological Manifesto of the Lunda People, ''Manifesto Jurídico-Sociológico do Povo Lunda'', MJSLP, and disbanded in 2025.}} After Malakito's release from prison in 2011, a [[hardline]] faction led by the former [[Secretary (title)|secretary general]] José Mateus "Zeca Mutchima" split from the CMJSPLT, forming the Movement of the Portuguese Protectorate of Lunda Chokwe (''Movimento do Protetorado Português da Lunda Tchokwé'', MPPLT), whose statement of principles was partly drawn from [[Diogo Pacheco de Amorim]]'s 2003 manifesto for the Portuguese right-wing party [[New Democracy Party (Portugal)|New Democracy]]. The separatist movement eventually targeted Angola's six eastern provinces, corresponding to 51,6% of its territory.

A [[drought]] in 2016 caused the worst food crisis in [[Southern Africa]] in 25 years, affecting 1.4 million people across seven of Angola's eighteen provinces. [[Food prices]] rose and acute [[malnutrition]] rates doubled, impacting over 95,000 children.

[[José Eduardo dos Santos]] stepped down as [[President of Angola]] after 38 years in 2017, being peacefully succeeded by [[João Lourenço]], Santos' chosen successor. Some members of the dos Santos family were later linked to high levels of corruption. In July 2022, ex-president José Eduardo dos Santos died in Spain.

In August 2022, the ruling party, MPLA, won another majority and President Lourenço won a second five-year term in the [[2022 Angolan general election|election]]. However, the election was the tightest in Angola's history.
