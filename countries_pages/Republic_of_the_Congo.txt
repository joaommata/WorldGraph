{{main|History of the Republic of the Congo}}
[[Bantu peoples|Bantu-speaking peoples]], who founded tribes during the [[Bantu expansion]]s, mostly displaced and absorbed the earlier inhabitants of the region, the [[African Pygmies|Pygmy]] people, about 1500{{nbsp}}BC. The [[Bakongo]], a Bantu ethnic group that occupied parts of what later became Angola, Gabon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, formed the basis for ethnic affinities and rivalries among those countries.{{cn|date=July 2025}}

By the 13th century, there were three main confederations of states in the western Congo Basin. In the east were the [[Seven Kingdoms of Kongo dia Nlaza]], considered to be the oldest and most powerful, which likely included [[Nsundi]], [[Mbata Kingdom|Mbata]], [[Mpangu]], and possibly [[Kundi kingdom|Kundi]] and [[Okanga]]. South of these was [[Mpemba]] which stretched from modern-day [[Angola]] to the [[Congo River]]. It included various kingdoms such as [[Mpemba Kasi]] and [[Vunda]]. To its west across the Congo River was a confederation of three small states; [[Vungu]] (its leader), [[Kakongo]], and [[Ngoyo]].{{Rp|pages=24–25}} Some Bantu kingdoms—including those of the [[Kongo people|Kongo]], the [[Tio people|Tio]], and [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]]—built trade links leading into the [[Congo Basin]]. The [[Tio Kingdom]] formed in the 14th century; the association of kingship with [[smithing]] is believed to have originated among the Tio before spreading to the kingdoms of Loango and [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]].{{Reference page|pages=439-42}}

The [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Diogo Cão]] reached the mouth of the Congo in 1484.

The area north of the Congo River came under French sovereignty in 1880 as a result of [[Pierre de Brazza]]'s treaty with Tio King {{ill|Iloo I|fr|Illoy Ier}}.{{efn|De Brazza promised benefits of trade and an alliance, which was likely interpreted as military assistance. While some sources attest that Iloo was aware of the condition, [[Jan Vansina]] wrote that "it seems clear that he only wanted to cede land for the establishment of a [[Trading post|commercial station]]", and that his desire for an alliance may have been influenced by the hostility of [[Henry Morton Stanley's first trans-Africa expedition|Henry Stanley's expedition]] a few years earlier.{{Reference page|pages=409-12}}}} After the death of Iloo, his widow Queen [[Ngalifourou]] upheld the terms of the treaty and became an ally to the colonizers. This Congo Colony became known first as [[French Congo]], then as Middle Congo in 1903.

In 1908, France organized [[French Equatorial Africa]] (AEF), comprising the Middle Congo, [[French Gabon|Gabon]], [[French Chad|Chad]], and [[Oubangui-Chari]] (which later became the [[Central African Republic]]). The French designated [[Brazzaville]] as the federal capital. Economic development during the first 50 years of colonial rule in Congo centered on natural resource extraction. Construction of the [[Congo–Ocean Railway]] following [[World War I]] has been estimated to have cost at least 14,000 lives. The [[Brazzaville Conference of 1944]] heralded a period of reform in French colonial policy. Congo "benefited" from the postwar expansion of colonial administrative and infrastructure spending as a result of its central geographic location within AEF and the federal capital at Brazzaville. Antagonism between the [[Mbochi]]s (who favored [[Jacques Opangault]]) and the [[Lari people (Congo)|Lari]]s and [[Kongo people|Kongo]]s (who favored [[Fulbert Youlou]], the first black mayor elected in French Equatorial Africa) resulted in a series of riots in Brazzaville in February 1959, which the [[French Army]] subdued.

Elections took place in April 1959. By the time the Congo became independent in August 1960, Opangault, the former opponent of Youlou, agreed to serve under him. Youlou, an avid anti-communist, became the first President of the Republic of the Congo. Since the political tension was so high in [[Pointe-Noire]], Youlou moved the capital to Brazzaville.{{cn|date=July 2025}}

[[File:Alphonse Massamba-Debat.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Alphonse Massamba-Débat]]'s 1-party rule (1963–1968) attempted to implement a [[political economy|political economic]] strategy of "[[scientific socialism]]".]]
The Republic of the Congo became fully independent from France on 15 August 1960. Youlou ruled as the country's first president until labor elements and rival political parties instigated a [[Trois Glorieuses (1963)|three-day uprising]] that ousted him. The Congolese military took over the country and installed a civilian provisional government headed by [[Alphonse Massamba-Débat]].

Under the 1963 constitution, Massamba-Débat was elected president for a five-year term. Under his presidency, the Congo began to [[industrialize]]. Some large production units with large workforces were built: the textile factory of Kinsoundi, the palm groves of Etoumbi, the match factory of [[Bétou]], the shipyards of Yoro, etc. Health centers were created as well as school groups (colleges and elementary school). The country's school enrollment rate became the highest in Black Africa.

On the night of 14 to 15 February 1965, three public officials of the Republic of the Congo were kidnapped: {{ill|Lazare Matsocota|fr}} (prosecutor of the Republic), {{ill|Joseph Pouabou|fr}} (President of the Supreme Court), and {{ill|Anselme Massouémé|fr}} (director of the Congolese Information Agency). The bodies of two of these men were later found, mutilated, by the Congo River. Massamba-Débat's regime invited some hundred [[Cuba]]n army troops into the country to train his party's militia units. These troops helped his government survive a [[1966 Republic of the Congo coup d'état attempt|''coup d'état'' in 1966]] led by paratroopers loyal to future President [[Marien Ngouabi]]. Massamba-Débat's regime ended with a bloodless [[1968 Republic of the Congo coup d'état|''coup'' in September 1968]]. An 11-member Military Committee of the Party (CMP) was then named to head an interim government, with [[Joachim Yhombi-Opango]] serving as president. Two years later, Yhombi-Opango was forced from power, and [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]] became the new president. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 resulted in the ending of Soviet aid to prop up the regime, and it abdicated power.

[[Pascal Lissouba]] who became Congo's first elected president (1992–1997) during the period of multi-party democracy attempted to implement economic reforms with IMF backing to liberalize the economy. In the years 1993 and 1994 the [[Republic of the Congo Civil War (1993–1994)|first Congo Civil War in Congo]] occurred. In June 1996, IMF approved a three-year [[Special drawing rights|SDR]] 69.5m (US$100m) [[enhanced structural adjustment facility]] (ESAF) and was on the verge of announcing a renewed annual agreement when civil war broke out in Congo in 1997.

Congo's democratic progress was derailed in 1997 when Lissouba and Sassou started to fight for power in the [[Republic of the Congo Civil War (1997–1999)|civil war]]. As presidential elections scheduled for July 1997 approached, tensions between the Lissouba and Sassou camps mounted. On 5 June, President Lissouba's government forces surrounded Sassou's compound in Brazzaville, and Sassou ordered members of his private militia (known as "Cobras") to resist. Thus began a four-month conflict that destroyed or damaged some of Brazzaville and caused tens of thousands of civilian deaths. In October, the Angolan government began an invasion of Congo to install Sassou in power and the Lissouba government fell. After that, Sassou declared himself president. A [[constitution]], agreed upon by [[Republic of the Congo constitutional referendum, 2002|referendum in January 2002]], granted the president new powers, extended his term to seven years and introduced a new bicameral assembly. International observers took issue with the organization of the presidential election and the constitutional referendum, both of which were reminiscent in their organization of Congo's era of the 1-party state. Following the presidential elections, fighting restarted in the [[Pool Department|Pool region]] between government forces and rebels led by [[Pastor Ntumi]]; a peace treaty to end the conflict was signed in April 2003.

Sassou won the following [[Republic of the Congo presidential election, 2009|presidential election in July 2009]]. According to the Congolese Observatory of Human Rights, a non-governmental organization, the election was marked by "very low" turnout and "fraud and irregularities". In March 2015, Sassou announced that he wanted to run for yet another term in office and a [[Republic of the Congo constitutional referendum, 2015|constitutional referendum]] in October resulted in a [[Constitution of the Republic of the Congo|changed constitution]] that allowed him to run during the [[Republic of the Congo presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]]. He won the election believed by some to be fraudulent. After violent protests in the capital, Sassou attacked the Pool region where the [[Ninja (militia)|Ninja rebel]]s of the civil war used to be based, in what was believed to be a distraction. This led to a revival of the Ninja rebels who launched attacks against the army in April 2016, leading 80,000 people to flee their homes. A ceasefire deal was signed in December 2017.

In 2023, the [[Odzala National Park|Forest Massif of Odzala-Kokoua]] was listed as a natural [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].
