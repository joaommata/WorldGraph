According to Korea's [[Civil religion|founding mythology]], the history of Korea begins with the founding of Joseon (also known as "[[Old Chosŏn|Gojoseon]]", or "Old Joseon", to differentiate it from the 14th century dynasty) in 2333 BC by the legendary [[Dangun]]. Gojoseon was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century. Gojoseon expanded until it controlled the northern Korean Peninsula and parts of [[Manchuria]]. [[Gija Joseon]] was purportedly founded in the 12th century BC, but its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era. In 108 BC, the [[Han dynasty]] [[Gojoseon–Han War|defeated]] [[Wiman Joseon]] and installed [[Four Commanderies of Han|four commanderies]] in the northern Korean peninsula. Three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades, but the [[Lelang commandery]] remained a center of cultural and economic exchange with successive Chinese dynasties ruling for four centuries, until it was conquered by Goguryeo in 313. 

The linguistic homeland of Proto-[[Koreans]] is located somewhere in southern [[Siberia]]/[[Manchuria]], such as the [[Liao River]] area or the [[Amur]] River area. Proto-Koreans arrived in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula at around 300 BC, replacing and assimilating [[Japonic languages|Japonic]]-speaking [[Yayoi people|Yayoi]] and likely causing their migration to the [[Japanese archipelago]].

=== Three Kingdoms of Korea ===
During the [[Proto–Three Kingdoms period]], the states of [[Buyeo]], [[Okjeo]], [[Eastern Ye|Dongye]], and [[Samhan]] occupied the whole Korean peninsula and southern Manchuria. From them, the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] emerged: [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], and [[Silla]].

Goguryeo, the largest and most powerful among them, was a highly militaristic state and competed with various Chinese dynasties during its 700 years of history. Goguryeo experienced a golden age under [[Gwanggaeto the Great]] and his son [[Jangsu of Goguryeo|Jangsu]], who both subdued Baekje and Silla during their respective reigns, achieving a brief unification of the Three Kingdoms and becoming the most dominant power on the Korean Peninsula. In addition to contesting control of the Korean Peninsula, Goguryeo had many [[Military history of Goguryeo|military conflicts]] with various [[Dynasties of China|Chinese dynastie]]s, most notably the [[Goguryeo–Sui War]], in which Goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men.

Baekje was a maritime power, sometimes called the "[[Phoenicia]] of East Asia". Its maritime ability was instrumental in the dissemination of [[East Asian Buddhism|Buddhism throughout East Asia]] and spreading continental culture to Japan. Baekje was once a great military power on the Korean Peninsula, especially during the time of [[Geunchogo of Baekje|Geunchogo]], but was critically defeated by Gwanggaeto the Great and declined. Silla was the smallest and weakest of the three, but used opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful Korean kingdoms, and eventually [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]], to its advantage.

In 676, the unification of the Three Kingdoms by Silla led to the [[Northern and Southern States period]], in which relationships between Korea and China remained relatively peaceful. [[Balhae]], a Goguryeo successor state founded by a [[Go of Balhae|general]], controlled most of Manchuria and parts of the Russian Far East and was called the "Prosperous Country in the East". In addition to Koreans, there were many other ethnicities such as the [[Mohe people|Mohe]], [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], and Chinese.

[[Late Silla]] was a wealthy country, and its metropolitan capital of [[Gyeongju]] grew to become the fourth largest city in the world. It experienced a golden age of art and culture, exemplified by monuments such as [[Hwangnyongsa]], [[Seokguram]], and the [[Bell of King Seongdeok|Emille Bell]]. It also carried on the maritime legacy and prowess of Baekje, and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of East Asia and the trade between China, Korea, and Japan, most notably during the time of [[Chang Pogo]]. In addition, Silla people made overseas communities in China on the [[Shandong Peninsula]] and the mouth of the [[Yangtze]] River. However, Silla was later weakened due to internal strife and the revival of successor states [[Later Baekje|Baekje]] and [[Taebong|Goguryeo]], which culminated into the [[Later Three Kingdoms]] period in the late 9th century.

Buddhism flourished during this time. Many [[Korean Buddhism|Korean Buddhists]] gained great fame among Chinese Buddhist circles and greatly contributed to [[Chinese Buddhism]]. Examples of significant Korean Buddhists from this period include [[Woncheuk]], [[Wonhyo]], [[Uisang]], [[Kim Hwasang|Musang]], and [[Kim Gyo-gak]]. Kim was a Silla prince whose influence made [[Mount Jiuhua]] one of the Four [[Sacred Mountains of China|Sacred Mountains]] of Chinese Buddhism.

=== Unified dynasties ===

In 936, the Later Three Kingdoms were united by [[Taejo of Goryeo|Wang Geon]], who established [[Goryeo]] as a successor state to Goguryeo. Balhae had fallen to the [[Khitan Empire]] in 926, and a decade later the [[Dae Gwang-hyeon|last crown prince of Balhae]] fled south to Goryeo, where he was warmly welcomed and included in the ruling family by Wang Geon, thus unifying the two successor nations of Goguryeo. Like Silla, Goryeo was a highly cultural state, and invented the metal movable type [[printing press]]. After defeating the Khitan Empire, which was the most powerful empire of its time in the [[Goryeo–Khitan War]], Goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century, during which the [[Tripitaka Koreana]] was completed and significant developments in printing and publishing occurred. This promoted education and the dispersion of knowledge on philosophy, literature, religion, and science. By 1100, there were 12 universities that produced notable scholars.

However, the [[Mongol invasions of Korea|Mongol invasions]] in the 13th century greatly weakened the kingdom. Goryeo was never conquered by the Mongols, but exhausted after three decades of fighting, the Korean court sent its [[Wonjong of Goryeo|crown prince]] to the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] capital to swear allegiance to [[Kublai Khan]], who accepted and married one of his daughters to the Korean crown prince. Henceforth, Goryeo continued to rule Korea, though as a tributary ally to the Mongols for the next 86 years. During this period, the two nations' royalty became intertwined as all subsequent Korean kings married Mongol princesses. The first 200 years of the Joseon dynasty were marked by peace and saw great advancements in science and education, among them the creation of [[Hangul]] by [[Sejong the Great]] to promote literacy among the common people. The prevailing ideology of the time was [[Korean Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism]], which was epitomized by the [[seonbi]] class: nobles who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity. Between 1592 and 1598, Japan under [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] launched [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|invasions of Korea]], but the advance was halted by Korean forces (most notably the [[Joseon Navy]] led by Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] and his renowned "[[turtle ship]]") with assistance from [[righteous army]] militias formed by Korean civilians, and [[Ming dynasty]] Chinese troops. Through a series of successful battles of attrition, the Japanese forces were eventually forced to withdraw, and relations between all parties became normalized. However, the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] took advantage of Joseon's war-weakened state and [[Manchu invasion of Korea|invaded in 1627 and 1637]]. After normalizing relations with the new [[Qing dynasty]], Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace. Kings [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]] and [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]] particularly led a new renaissance of the Joseon dynasty during the 18th century.

In the 19th century, Joseon began experiencing economic difficulties and widespread uprisings, including the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]]. The royal in-law families had gained control of the government, leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state. Additionally, the strict isolationism of the Joseon government that earned it the nickname "the [[hermit kingdom]]" became increasingly ineffective due to increasing encroachment from powers such as Japan, Russia, and the United States. This was exemplified by the [[Joseon–United States Treaty of 1882]], which forced Joseon to open its borders.

=== Japanese occupation and World War II ===
{{Main|Korea under Japanese rule}}
In the late 19th century, Japan became a significant regional power after winning the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] against Qing China and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] against the [[Russian Empire]]. In 1897, King Gojong, the [[List of monarchs of Korea|last king of Korea]], proclaimed Joseon as the [[Korean Empire]]. However, Japan [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905|compelled Korea to become its protectorate]] in 1905 and [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910|formally annexed it]] in 1910. What followed was a period of forced assimilation, in which Korean language, culture, and history were suppressed. This led to the [[March First Movement]] protests in 1919 and the subsequent foundation of resistance groups in exile, primarily in China. Among the resistance groups was [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]].

Towards the end of [[World War II]], the U.S. proposed dividing the Korean peninsula into two occupation zones: a [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|U.S. zone]] and a [[Soviet Civil Administration|Soviet zone]]. [[Dean Rusk]] and [[Charles H. Bonesteel III]] suggested the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] as the dividing line, as it placed Seoul under U.S. control. To the surprise of Rusk and Bonesteel, the Soviets accepted their proposal and agreed to divide Korea.

=== Division of Korea ===
[[File:Ceremony inaugurating the government of the Republic of Korea (colored).jpg|thumb|Ceremony for the inauguration of the South Korean government (August 15, 1948)]]
Despite intentions to liberate a unified peninsula in the [[1943 Cairo Declaration]], escalating tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States led to the [[division of Korea]] into two political entities in 1948: North Korea and South Korea.

In the South, the United States appointed and supported the former head of the Korean Provisional Government [[Syngman Rhee]] as leader. Rhee won the first presidential elections of the newly declared Republic of Korea in May 1948. In the North, the Soviets backed a former anti-Japanese guerrilla and communist activist, [[Kim Il Sung]], who was appointed premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in September.

In October, the Soviet Union declared Kim Il Sung's government as sovereign over both the north and south. The UN declared Rhee's government as "a lawful government having effective control and jurisdiction over that part of Korea where the UN Temporary Commission on Korea was able to observe and consult" and the government "based on elections which was observed by the Temporary Commission" in addition to a statement that "this is the only such government in Korea." Both leaders engaged in authoritarian repression of political opponents. South Korea requested military support from the United States but was denied, while North Korea's military was heavily reinforced by the Soviet Union.

=== Korean War ===
On June 25, 1950, [[Operation Pokpung|North Korea invaded]] South Korea, sparking the [[Korean War]], the [[Cold War]]'s first major conflict, which continued until 1953. At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the UN, thus forfeiting [[United Nations Security Council veto power|their veto rights]]. This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country. The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of [[People's Volunteer Army|Chinese troops]]. After an ebb and flow that saw both sides facing defeat with massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate. During the war, Rhee's party promoted the [[Ilminism|One-People Principle]], an effort to build an obedient citizenry through ethnic homogeneity and authoritarian appeals to [[nationalism]].

The [[Korean Armistice Agreement|1953 armistice]], never signed by South Korea, split the peninsula along the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|demilitarized zone]] near the original demarcation line. No peace treaty was ever signed, resulting in the two countries remaining technically at war. Approximately 3 million people died in the Korean War, with a higher proportional civilian death toll than [[World War II]] or the [[Vietnam War]], making it one of the deadliest conflicts of the Cold War era. In addition, virtually all of Korea's major cities were destroyed by the war.

=== Miracle on the Han River ===
{{main|Miracle on the Han River}}
[[File:South Korea's GDP (PPP) growth from 1911 to 2008.png|thumb|Between 1962 and 1994, the [[Economy of South Korea|South Korean economy]] grew at an average of 10% annually, fueled by annual export growth of 20%, in a period called the [[Miracle on the Han River]].]]In 1960, a student uprising (the "[[April Revolution]]") led to the resignation of the autocratic President Syngman Rhee. This was followed by 13 months of political instability as South Korea was led by the weak and ineffectual [[Second Republic of Korea|Second Republic]]. This instability was broken by the [[May 16 coup|May 16, 1961 coup]] led by General [[Park Chung Hee]]. As president, Park oversaw a period of rapid [[Export-oriented industrialization|export-led economic growth]] enforced by [[Political repression in South Korea|political repression]]. Under Park, South Korea [[South Korea in the Vietnam War|took an active role]] in the Vietnam War.

Park was heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a [[Yusin Constitution|new constitution]], which gave the president dictatorial powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms. The [[Economy of South Korea|Korean economy]] developed significantly during Park's tenure, largely due to investment in [[Chaebol|family-run conglomerates]]. The government developed the [[Expressways in South Korea|nationwide expressway system]], the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|Seoul subway system]], and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year tenure, which ended with [[Assassination of Park Chung Hee|his assassination]] in 1979.

The years after Park's assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979, General [[Chun Doo-hwan]] led the [[coup d'état of December Twelfth]]. On May 17, Chun forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to [[Jeju Island]]. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities, and further curtailed the press. Chun's assumption of the presidency through the events of May 17 triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy; these protests were particularly widespread in [[Gwangju]], to which Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the [[Gwangju Uprising|Gwangju Democratization Movement]].

Chun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan. Chun and his government held South Korea under a despotic rule until 1987, when a [[Seoul National University]] student, [[Park Jong-chul]], was tortured to death. On {{Nowrap|June 10}}, the [[Catholic Priests Association for Justice]] revealed the incident, igniting the [[June Democratic Struggle]] across the country. Eventually, Chun's party, the [[Democratic Justice Party]], and its leader, [[Roh Tae-woo]], announced the [[June 29 Declaration]], which promised a democratic election of the president.

=== Democracy ===
Roh Tae-woo went on to win the [[1987 South Korean presidential election|1987 election]] by a narrow margin against the two main opposition leaders, [[Kim Dae-jung]] and [[Kim Young-sam]]. Seoul hosted the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games in 1988]], which was widely regarded as successful and a significant boost for South Korea's global image and economy.

[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 702|South Korea was formally invited]] to become a member of the United Nations in 1991. The transition of Korea from autocracy to modern democracy was marked in 1997 by the election of Kim Dae-jung, who was sworn in as the eighth president of South Korea on February 25, 1998. His election was significant given that he had in earlier years been a political prisoner sentenced to death (later commuted to exile). He won against the backdrop of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], where he took [[IMF]] advice to restructure the economy and the nation soon recovered its economic growth, albeit at a slower pace.

[[File:Kim Dae-jung (2001).tif|thumb|President [[Kim Dae-jung]], the 2000 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient for advancing democracy and human rights in South Korea and East Asia and for reconciliation with North Korea, was sometimes called the "[[Nelson Mandela]] of Asia". Later that year, Kim received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] "for his work for democracy and human rights in South Korea and in East Asia in general, and for peace and reconciliation with North Korea in particular". However, because of discontent among the population for fruitless approaches to the North under the previous administrations and, amid North Korean provocations, a conservative government was elected in 2007 led by President [[Lee Myung-bak]], former [[mayor of Seoul]]. While [[Japan–Korea relations|South Korean and Japanese relations]] improved when they jointly co-hosted the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], it later [[Japan–Korea disputes|soured]] because of conflicting claims of sovereignty over the [[Liancourt Rocks dispute|Liancourt Rocks]].

[[File:2010 G-20 Seoul summit.jpg|thumb|South Korea became the first non-[[G7]] chair of the [[G-20]] when it hosted the [[2010 G-20 Seoul summit|2010 Seoul summit]].]]

In 2010, there was an [[List of border incidents involving North and South Korea|escalation in attacks]] by North Korea. In March 2010 the South Korean warship [[ROKS Cheonan sinking|ROKS ''Cheonan'' was sunk]] killing 46 South Korean sailors, allegedly by a North Korean submarine. In November 2010 [[Yeonpyeongdo]] [[Bombardment of Yeonpyeong|was attacked]] by a significant North Korean artillery barrage, with 4 people dying. The official UN report declined to explicitly name North Korea as the perpetrator for the ''Cheonan'' sinking. The lack of a strong response to these attacks from both South Korea and the international community caused significant anger with the South Korean public.

=== Contemporary history ===
The children of presidents Park Chung Hee and Kim Jong Il would take power in the two Koreas from 2011 to 2012. [[Kim Jong Un]] succeeded his father as leader of North Korea in 2011, while South Korea elected the first ever female president [[Park Geun-hye]] in the [[2012 South Korean presidential election|2012 election]]. The conservative Park Geun-hye administration was formally accused of corruption, bribery, and influence-peddling for the involvement of Park's close friend [[Choi Soon-sil]] in state affairs. There followed a series of [[2016–2017 South Korean protests|nationwide public demonstrations]] from November 2016, and she was removed from office. After the fallout of Park's impeachment and dismissal, elections were held and [[Moon Jae-in]] of the [[Democratic Party (South Korea, 2015)|Democratic Party]] won the presidency, immediately taking office on May 10, 2017. His tenure saw an improving political relationship with North Korea, some increasing divergence in the military alliance with the United States, and the successful hosting of [[2018 Winter Olympics|the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang]]. In April 2018, Park Geun-hye was sentenced to 24 years in jail and convicted of abuse of power and corruption. [[COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea|The COVID-19 pandemic]] caused South Korea to record more deaths than births, resulting in a population decline for the first time on record.

In March 2022, [[Yoon Suk Yeol]], the candidate of the conservative opposition [[People Power Party (South Korea)|People Power Party]], won a close [[2022 South Korean presidential election|election]] over Democratic Party candidate [[Lee Jae-myung]] by the narrowest margin in the history of the Sixth Republic and was sworn in on May 10, 2022. He declared [[2024 South Korean martial law|martial law]] on December 3, 2024, accusing the opposition of being pro-North Korean and conducting anti-state activities. After several hours, the National Assembly voted to nullify the declaration in a unanimous vote of 190/0, causing Yoon to end martial law early on December 4. Yoon's actions resulted in [[Impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol|his impeachment]] on December 14, 2024, followed by his unanimous removal from office on April 4, 2025. Lee Jae-myung won the [[2025 South Korean presidential election|election]] to succeed Yoon, immediately taking office on June 4, 2025.
