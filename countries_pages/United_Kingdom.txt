Settlement by [[Cro-Magnons]] of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago. The island has been continuously inhabited since the last retreat of ice around 11,500 years ago. By the end of the [[Prehistoric Britain|region's prehistoric period]], the population is thought to have belonged largely to a culture termed [[Insular Celts|Insular Celtic]], comprising [[Britons (historical)|Brittonic Britain]] and [[Gaelic Ireland]].

The [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest]], beginning in AD 43, and the 400-year [[Roman Britain|rule of southern Britain]], was followed by an invasion by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Anglo-Saxon]] settlers, reducing the Brittonic area mainly [[Wales#Post-Roman era|to what was to become Wales]], [[Cornwall]] and, until the latter stages of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, the [[Hen Ogledd]] (northern England and parts of southern Scotland). Most of the [[Anglo-Saxon England|region settled by the Anglo-Saxons]] became unified as the Kingdom of England in the 10th century. [[Dál Riata|Gaelic speakers in north-west Britain]] (with connections to the north-east of Ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the 5th century) united with the [[Picts]] to create the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] in the 9th century.

In 1066 the [[Normans]] invaded England from northern France. After [[Norman conquest of England|conquering England]] they seized [[Norman invasion of Wales|large parts of Wales]], [[Norman invasion of Ireland|conquered much of Ireland]] and were invited to settle in Scotland, bringing to each country [[feudalism]] on the Northern French model and [[Norman-French]] culture. The [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[ruling class]] greatly influenced, but eventually assimilated with, the local cultures. Subsequent [[House of Plantagenet|medieval English kings]] completed the [[conquest of Wales]] and tried unsuccessfully [[Wars of Scottish Independence|to annex Scotland]]. Asserting its independence in the 1320 [[Declaration of Arbroath]], Scotland maintained its independence thereafter, albeit in [[Anglo-Scottish Wars|near-constant conflict with England]].

In 1215 [[Magna Carta]] was the first document to state that no government was above the law and that citizens have rights protecting them.

The English monarchs, through inheritance of [[Angevin Empire|substantial territories in France]] and claims to the French crown, were also heavily involved in conflicts in France, most notably the [[Hundred Years' War]], while the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Kings of Scots]] were in [[Auld Alliance|an alliance with the French]] during this period. [[Early modern Britain]] saw religious conflict resulting from the [[Reformation]] and the introduction of [[Protestant]] state churches in each country. The [[English Reformation]] ushered in political, constitutional, social and cultural change in the 16th century and [[State religion|established]] the [[Church of England]]. It defined a national identity for England and slowly, but profoundly, changed people's religious beliefs. Wales was [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542|fully incorporated into the Kingdom of England]], and Ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the English crown. In what was to become Northern Ireland, the lands of the independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and [[Plantation of Ulster|given to Protestant settlers]] from England and Scotland.

[[File:Bayeux Tapestry WillelmDux.jpg|thumb|The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] depicts the [[Battle of Hastings]], 1066, and the events leading to it.]]

In 1603 the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland were united in a [[personal union]] when [[James VI of Scotland]] inherited the crowns of England and Ireland and moved his court from Edinburgh to London; each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political, legal and religious institutions.

In the mid-17th century, all three kingdoms [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|were involved in a series of connected wars]] (including the [[English Civil War]]) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy, with [[Execution of Charles I|the execution]] of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], and the establishment of the short-lived [[unitary republic]] of the [[Commonwealth of England]], Scotland and Ireland.

Although the [[Restoration (1660)|monarchy was restored]], the [[Interregnum (1649–1660)|Interregnum]] along with the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and the subsequent [[Bill of Rights 1689]] in England and [[Claim of Right Act 1689]] in Scotland ensured that, unlike much of the rest of Europe, [[royal absolutism]] would not prevail, and a professed Catholic could never accede to the throne. The [[British constitution]] would develop on the basis of [[constitutional monarchy]] and the [[parliamentary system]]. With the founding of the [[Royal Society]] in 1660, science was greatly encouraged. During this period, particularly in England, the development of [[English navy|naval power]] and the interest in [[Age of Discovery|voyages of discovery]] led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies, particularly in North America and the Caribbean.

Though previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within Great Britain in 1606, 1667 and 1689 had proved unsuccessful, the attempt initiated in 1705 led to the [[Treaty of Union]] of 1706 being agreed and ratified by both parliaments.

=== Union of England and Scotland ===
{{Main|Treaty of Union|Kingdom of Great Britain}}

[[File:Articles of Union between England and Scotland 28 Jan 1707.png|thumb|right|170px|The [[Treaty of Union]] which unified the [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland]] on 1 May 1707]]
On 1 May 1707 the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed, the result of the [[Acts of Union 1707]] between the [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. In the 18th century cabinet government developed under [[Robert Walpole]], who is considered the ''[[de facto]]'' first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] from 1721 to 1742. A series of [[Jacobite uprisings]] sought to remove the Protestant [[House of Hanover]] from the throne and restore the Catholic [[House of Stuart]]. The Jacobites were finally defeated at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746, after which the [[Scottish Highlanders]] were forcibly assimilated into Scotland by revoking the feudal independence of [[Scottish clan chief|clan chiefs]]. The British colonies in North America that broke away in the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] became the [[United States]]. British imperial ambition turned towards Asia, particularly to [[India]].

British merchants played a leading part in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], mainly between 1662 and 1807 when British or British-colonial [[slave ships]] transported nearly 3.3&nbsp;million slaves from Africa. The slaves were taken to [[Plantation economy|work on plantations]], principally [[History of the British West Indies|in the Caribbean]] but also [[British America|in North America]]. However, with pressure from the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist movement]], Parliament banned the trade in 1807, banned slavery in the British Empire in 1833, and Britain took a leading role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide through the [[blockade of Africa]] and pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties.

=== United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ===
{{Main|History of the United Kingdom|Acts of Union 1800|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland}}

[[File:Victoria in her Coronation robes.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] reigned as [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]] and [[Empress of India]] during the 19th century.]]
In 1800 the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act of Union, uniting the two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 January 1801.

After the defeat of France at the end of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1792–1815) the United Kingdom emerged as the principal naval and imperial power (with London the [[List of largest cities throughout history|largest city in the world from about 1830]]). [[History of the Royal Navy (after 1707)#Pax Britannica, 1815–1914|Unchallenged at sea]], British dominance was later described as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]'' ("British Peace"), a period of [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)|relative peace amongst the great powers]] (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global [[hegemon]] and adopted the role of [[global policeman]]. From 1853 to 1856 Britain took part in the [[Crimean War]], allied with the [[Ottoman Empire]] against [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]]. Following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] the British government led by [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] assumed [[direct rule]] over [[British Raj|India]]. Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it [[Informal empire|effectively controlled]] the economies of regions such as [[East Asia]] and [[Latin America]].

Throughout the [[Victorian era]] (1837–1901) political attitudes favoured [[free trade]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' policies. Beginning with the [[Great Reform Act]] in 1832, Parliament gradually [[Reform Acts|widened the voting franchise]], with the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|1884 Reform Act]] championed by [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] granting [[suffrage]] to a majority of males for the first time. The British population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid [[urbanisation]], causing significant social and economic stresses. By the late 19th century the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under [[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] initiated a period of [[Scramble for Africa|imperial expansion in Africa]], maintained a policy of "[[splendid isolation]]" in Europe, and attempted to contain the influence of the [[Russian Empire]] in [[Emirate of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] and [[Qajar Iran|Persia]], in what came to be known as the [[Great Game]]. During this time [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] were granted self-governing [[dominion]] status. At the turn of the century, Britain's industrial dominance became challenged by the [[German Empire]] and the [[United States]]. The [[Edwardian era]] (1901–1910) included [[Liberal welfare reforms|social reform]] and [[Irish Home Rule movement|home rule for Ireland]] become important domestic issues, while the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] emerged from an alliance of [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade unions]] and small socialist groups in 1900, and [[suffragettes]] campaigned for women's right to vote.

=== World wars and partition of Ireland ===

[[File:Wreaths Are Laid at the Cenotaph, London During Remembrance Sunday Service MOD 45152052.jpg|thumb|Wreaths being laid during the [[Remembrance Sunday]] service at the [[The Cenotaph|Cenotaph]] in [[Whitehall]], London]]

Britain was one of the principal [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] that defeated the [[Central Powers]] in the [[First World War]] (1914–1918). Alongside their French, Russian and (after 1917) American counterparts, British armed forces were engaged across much of the British Empire and in several regions of Europe, particularly on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. The high fatalities of [[trench warfare]] caused the loss of much of a generation of men, with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order. Britain had suffered 2.5&nbsp;million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt. 

The consequences of the war persuaded the government to expand the right to vote in national and local elections to all adult men and most adult women with the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]]. After the war Britain became a permanent member of the Executive Council of the [[League of Nations]] and received [[League of Nations mandate|a mandate]] over a number of former German and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] colonies. Under the leadership of [[David Lloyd George]], the British Empire reached its greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of its population.

By the mid-1920s most of the British population could listen to [[BBC]] radio programmes. Experimental [[Television in the United Kingdom|television]] broadcasts [[History of television#United Kingdom|began in 1929]] and the [[First day of BBC television|first scheduled BBC Television Service]] commenced in 1936. The rise of [[Irish nationalism]], and disputes within Ireland over the terms of [[Irish Home Rule]], led eventually to the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]] in 1921. [[The Troubles in Ulster (1920–1922)|A period of conflict in what is now Northern Ireland]] occurred from June 1920 until June 1922. The [[Irish Free State]] became independent, initially with [[Dominion]] status in 1922, and [[Statute of Westminster 1931#Irish Free State|unambiguously independent in 1931]]. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom. The [[1928 Equal Franchise Act]] gave women electoral equality with men in national elections. Strikes in the mid-1920s culminated in the [[General Strike of 1926]]. Britain had still not recovered from the effects of the First World War when the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] (1929–1932) led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas, as well as political and social unrest with rising membership in communist and socialist parties. [[National Government (1931)|A coalition government]] was formed in 1931.

Nonetheless, Britain was described as "a very wealthy country, formidable in arms, ruthless in pursuit of its interests and sitting at the heart of a global production system." After [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, Britain entered the [[Second World War]]. Despite the defeat of its European allies in the first year, Britain and its empire continued the war against Germany.

In 1940 the [[Royal Air Force]] defeated the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' in the [[Battle of Britain]]. Urban areas suffered heavy bombing during [[the Blitz]]. The [[Grand Alliance (World War II)|Grand Alliance]] of Britain, the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] formed in 1941, leading the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] against the [[Axis powers]]. There were eventual hard-fought victories in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], the [[North Africa campaign]] and the [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]]. British forces played important roles in the [[Normandy landings]] of 1944 and the [[liberation of Europe]]. The British Army led the [[Burma campaign]] against Japan, and the [[British Pacific Fleet]] fought Japan at sea. [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|British scientists contributed]] to the American [[Manhattan Project]], whose task was to build a [[nuclear weapon]].

=== Post-war 20th century ===
{{Main|Post-war Britain (1945–1979)|Social history of post-war Britain (1945–1979)}}

[[File:British Empire 1921.png|thumb|right|upright=1.4|The [[British Empire]] at its territorial peak in 1921]]

The UK was one of the [[Big Three (World War II)|Big Three]] powers (with the US and the Soviet Union) who met to plan the [[Aftermath of World War II|post-war world]]; it drafted the [[Declaration by United Nations]] with the United States and became one of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]]. It worked closely with the United States to establish the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]] and [[NATO]]. The war left the UK severely weakened and financially dependent on the American [[Marshall Plan]], but it was spared the total war that devastated [[eastern Europe]].

In the immediate post-war years the [[Labour Government 1945–1951|Labour government]] under [[Clement Attlee]] initiated a radical programme of reforms, which significantly affected British society [[Post-war consensus|in the following decades]]. Major industries and public utilities were [[nationalised]], a [[welfare state]] was established, and a comprehensive, publicly funded healthcare system, the [[National Health Service]], was created. The rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with Britain's much-diminished economic position after [[History of the United Kingdom during the First World War|its involvement in the First World War]] and [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|the Second World War]], so that a policy of [[decolonisation]] was unavoidable. Independence was granted to India and Pakistan in 1947. Over the next three decades, most colonies of the British Empire gained their independence, and many became members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

The UK was the third country to develop [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|a nuclear weapons arsenal]], with its first atomic bomb test, [[Operation Hurricane]], in 1952, but the post-war limitations of Britain's international role were illustrated by the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956. The [[English-speaking world|international spread of the English language]], the world's [[List of languages by total number of speakers|most-widely-spoken language]] and [[List of languages by number of native speakers|third-most-spoken native language]], ensured the continuing international influence of [[British literature|its literature]] and [[Culture of the United Kingdom|culture]]. As a result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s, the government [[Modern immigration to the United Kingdom|encouraged immigration]] from [[Commonwealth countries]]. In the following decades the UK became a more [[Multiracialism|multiracial]] and [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] society. Despite rising living standards in the late 1950s and 1960s, the UK's economic performance was less successful than many of its main competitors such as France, [[West Germany]] and Japan. The UK was the first democratic nation to [[Representation of the People Act 1969|lower its voting age to 18]] in 1969.

In the decades-long process of [[European integration]] the UK was a founding member of the [[Western European Union]], established with the [[London and Paris Conferences]] in 1954. In 1960 the UK was one of the seven founding members of the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA), but in 1973 it left to join the [[European Communities]] (EC). In a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]] 67 per cent voted to stay in it. When the EC became the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1992, the UK was one of the 12 founding member states.

From the late 1960s, Northern Ireland experienced communal and [[paramilitary]] violence, sometimes affecting other parts of the UK, known as [[the Troubles]]. It is usually considered to have ended with the 1998 [[Belfast Agreement|Belfast "Good Friday" Agreement]]. Following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the 1970s, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of the 1980s led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] initiated a radical policy of [[monetarism]], [[deregulation]], particularly of the financial sector (for example, the [[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]] in 1986) and labour markets, the sale of state-owned companies (privatisation), and the withdrawal of subsidies to others.

[[File:HMS Invincible Returns From Falklands War.jpg|thumb|right|[[HMS Invincible (R05)|HMS ''Invincible'']] returns after defeating Argentine forces in the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.]]

In 1982 [[Argentina]] invaded the British territories of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], leading to the 10-week [[Falklands War]] in which Argentine forces were defeated. The inhabitants of the islands strongly favour British sovereignty, expressed in a [[2013 Falkland Islands sovereignty referendum|2013 referendum]]. From 1984 the British economy was helped by the inflow of substantial [[North Sea oil]] revenues. Another British Overseas Territory, [[Gibraltar]], is [[Port of Gibraltar|a key military base]]; a [[2002 Gibraltar sovereignty referendum|referendum in 2002]] on shared sovereignty with Spain was rejected.

Around the end of the 20th century, there were major changes to the governance of the UK with the establishment of [[devolution|devolved]] administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. [[Human Rights Act 1998|The statutory incorporation]] followed acceptance of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The UK remained a [[List of modern great powers#United Kingdom|great power]] with global diplomatic and military influence and a leading role in the United Nations and NATO.

[[File:Johnson signed Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.jpg|thumb|Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] signs the [[Brexit withdrawal agreement]] in 2020, formally [[Brexit|withdrawing the UK]] from the [[European Union]] (EU).]]
The UK broadly supported the United States' approach to the "[[war on terror]]" in the early 21st century. British troops fought in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)|war in Afghanistan]], but controversy surrounded Britain's [[Iraq War|military deployment in Iraq]], which saw the [[15 February 2003 anti-war protests|largest protest in British history]] in opposition to the government led by [[Tony Blair]].

The [[Great Recession]] (2007–2010) severely affected the British economy, and was followed by a period of weak growth and stagnation. The [[Cameron–Clegg coalition]] government of 2010 introduced [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity measures]] intended to tackle the substantial public deficits. [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|A referendum]] on [[Scottish independence]] in 2014 resulted in the Scottish electorate voting by 55.3 to 44.7 per cent to remain part of the United Kingdom.

In 2016, 51.9 per cent of voters in the UK [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|voted to leave the European Union]] (EU). The [[Brexit|UK left the EU]] in 2020. On 1 May 2021 the [[EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement]], a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU, came into force.

The [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|COVID-19 pandemic]] had a severe [[Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|impact on the British economy]], caused major [[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education in the United Kingdom|disruptions to education]] and had [[Social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|far-reaching impacts on society and politics]] in 2020 and 2021. The UK was the first country in the world to use an approved [[COVID-19 vaccine]], developing [[Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine|its own vaccine]], which allowed the UK's vaccine rollout to be amongst the fastest in the world.
