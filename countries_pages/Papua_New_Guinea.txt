===First settlement===
[[File:Female gable image, Sawos people, Papua New Guinea, Bishop Museum, 1989.400.358.JPG|thumb|alt=Wooden status of a woman sitting with her legs open|Female gable image, Sawos people, Oceanic art in the [[Bishop Museum]]]]
Archaeological evidence indicates that modern humans first arrived in what became [[Sahul|New Guinea and Australia]], as well as the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], around 42,000 to 45,000 years ago. Bougainville was settled by around 28,000 years ago, and the more distant [[Manus Island]] by around 20,000 years ago. These were part of the [[Early human migrations|earliest migrations of humans]] from Africa, and the resulting populations remained relatively isolated from the rest of the world throughout prehistory.{{rp|11}} [[Past sea level|Rising sea levels]] isolated New Guinea from Australia about 10,000 years ago, although [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|New Guineans]] had already diverged from each other from about 37,000 years ago.

Agriculture was independently developed in the New Guinea highlands around 7000 BC, making it one of the few areas in the world [[Vavilov center|where people independently domesticated plants]]. Before the onset of full-scale agriculture, some plants had already been domesticated, including [[sago]], ''[[Canarium indicum]]'', and [[karuka]].{{rp|13}} Archaeological evidence shows that [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian-speaking]] peoples of the [[Lapita culture]] reached the Bismarck Archipelago by 3,300 years ago.{{rp|252}} It is unknown whether they also settled on the mainland at this time, but there is strong evidence of their presence in coastal areas from around 500&nbsp;BC.{{rp|256}} These communities interacted with larger trade networks. It is likely through these trading networks that [[banana]] and [[sugarcane]] moved from New Guinea to other areas of the world.{{rp|<!--15-->52–53}}

Trade became rarer around 300&nbsp;AD, as demand for goods shifted to the [[Maluku Islands]] and [[Timor]]. After European interest in the region grew in the 16th century, Dutch influence grew over the [[Sultanate of Tidore]]. As Dutch authorities become more interested in New Guinea, they confirmed and extended the sultanate's claims over western New Guinea.{{rp|16–17<!--more from 109–120-->}} Renewed trade began to spread to the eastern parts of New Guinea in the late 17th century, driven by demand for goods such as [[dammar gum]], [[sea cucumber]]s, [[pearl]]s, [[copra]], shells, and [[bird-of-paradise]] feathers.{{rp|18}}

On New Guinea, communities were economically linked through trading networks. Despite this, aside from some political alliances, each community functioned largely independently, relying on [[subsistence agriculture]].{{rp|51}} Goods were often traded along established chains, and some villagers would be familiar with and sometimes know the languages of the immediately neighbouring villages (although language by itself was not a marker of political allegiance). Some wider trading networks existed in maritime areas.{{rp|132–133}} While people did not move far along these routes, goods moved long distances through local exchanges, and cultural practices likely diffused along them.{{rp|19–20}} Despite these links, the creation of larger political entities under European rule had no precedent, and in many cases brought together communities that historically had antagonistic relationships, or no relationship at all.{{rp|11}}

===European influence===
It is likely that some ships from China and Southeast Asia visited the island at times, and that there was some contact with New Guinean communities.{{rp|10}} The Portuguese explorer [[António de Abreu]] was the first European to discover the island of New Guinea.{{rp|152}} [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese traders]] introduced the South American [[sweet potato]] to the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]]. From there, it likely spread into what is today Papua New Guinea sometime in the 17th or 18th century, initially from the southern coast. It soon spread inland to the highlands, and became a [[staple food]].{{rp|165, 282–283}} The introduction of the sweet potato, possibly alongside other agricultural changes, transformed traditional agriculture and societies. This likely led to the spread of the [[Big man (anthropology)|Big man]] social structure. Sweet potato largely supplanted the previous staple, [[taro]], and led to significant population growth in the highlands.

[[German colonial empire|Germany]] and [[British Empire|Britain]] controlled the eastern half of New Guinea.]]
By the 1800s, there was some trade with the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Beginning in the 1860s, people from New Guinea were effectively taken as slaves to [[Queensland]] and [[Fiji]] as part of the [[blackbirding]] trade. This was stopped in 1884. Most of those taken were from coastal Papua. Those who returned to New Guinea brought their experiences with Western culture with them, but the largest impact was the development of a [[Melanesian Pidgin]] that would eventually become the [[Tok Pisin]] language.{{rp|9–10}}

Christianity was introduced to New Guinea on 15 September 1847 when a group of [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marist missionaries]] went to [[Woodlark Island]]. Missions were the primary source of Western culture as well as religion.{{rp|9}} The western half of the island was [[Dutch New Guinea|annexed by the Netherlands]] in 1848.{{rp|278}} The nearby [[Torres Strait Islands]] were annexed by Queensland in 1878,{{rp|280}} and Queensland attempted to annex some of New Guinea in 1883.{{rp|152}}{{rp|227}} The eastern half of the island was divided between Germany in the north and the United Kingdom in the south in 1884.{{rp|302}} The [[German New Guinea Company]] had initially tried to develop plantations, but when this was not successful began to engage in barter trade.{{rp|219–221}} In the British area, gold was found near the [[Mambare River]] in 1895.

In 1888, the British protectorate was annexed by [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In 1902, Papua was effectively transferred to the authority of the [[Federation of Australia|newly federated]] British [[dominion]] of [[Australia]]. With the passage of the [[Papua Act 1905]], the area was officially renamed the [[Territory of Papua]],{{rp|227}} and the Australian administration became formal in 1906, with Papua becoming fully annexed as an Australian territory.{{rp|225}}

Under European rule, social relations amongst the New Guinean population changed. Tribal fighting decreased, while in new urban areas there was greater mixing as people moved to partake in the [[cash crop]] economy. The large inequality between colonial administrators and locals led to the emergence of what colonial governments called [[cargo cult]]s.{{rp|52–53}} One of the most significant impacts was to changes in local travel. Colonial authorities outlawed tribal warfare, and it became normal to move for work, while roads increased the connectivity between inland areas.{{rp|20–22}}

Colonial authorities generally worked with individual village representatives, although neither German nor British authorities developed an effective system of indirect rule.{{rp|209–210}} In German New Guinea [[Tok Pisin]] began to spread through local adoption, and was reluctantly used by German authorities.{{rp|135–137}} In areas under British and then Australian governance, [[Hiri Motu]], a pidgin version of the [[Motu language]], became established as a ''de facto'' official language.{{rp|137–139}}

Following the outbreak of [[World War I|World War&nbsp;I]] in 1914, Australian forces [[Australian occupation of German New Guinea|captured German New Guinea]] and occupied it throughout the war. After the end of the war, the [[League of Nations]] authorised Australia to administer this area as a Class "C" [[League of Nations mandate]] territory from 9 May 1921, which became the [[Territory of New Guinea]].{{rp|152}}{{rp|228}} The Territory of Papua and the new Mandate of New Guinea were administered separately.{{rp|228}} Gold was discovered in [[Bulolo]] in the 1920s, and prospectors searched other areas of the island. The [[New Guinea Highlands|highland valleys]] were explored by prospectors in the 1930s and were found to be inhabited by over a million people.

===World War II and Australian rule===
[[File:Buna (AWM 014008).jpg|thumb|left|alt=A tank and some infantry walking through knee-high grass dotted with palm trees|Australian forces attack Japanese positions during the [[Battle of Buna–Gona]], 7 January 1943.]]
During [[World War II]], Japanese forces sought to capture Port Moresby, invading overland in mid-1942 and moving south in the [[Kokoda Track campaign]]. Australian forces carried out a number of [[rearguard]] actions as they withdrew almost to Port Moresby. In September an Australian counter-offensive began, and Japanese forces fought rearguard actions as they retreated north. Australian forces were supported during this campaign through significant contributions from local soldiers and helpers. While this campaign was ongoing, the Japanese launched the [[Battle of Milne Bay]], where their attack was repulsed by Australian and American forces. These events, along with the nearby [[Guadalcanal campaign]], marked a turning point in the [[Pacific War]]. A [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] continued until 1944, when allied forces fully recaptured Papua and New Guinea. In total, the [[New Guinea campaign]] resulted in the deaths of approximately 216,000 Japanese, Australian, and U.S. servicemen on both the mainland and offshore islands.

During the war, the civil government of both territories was suspended and replaced by a joint military government.{{rp|228}} The Second World War punctured the myth of differences between locals and foreigners, and increased the exposure of the population to the wider world and modern social and economic ideas. It also led to significant population movements, beginning the establishment of a common identity shared by those in the two Australian-ruled territories.{{rp|53}} Both Tok Pisin and Hiri Motu became more common to facilitate communication, and were used for radio broadcasts.{{rp|139}} The war was the first time Tok Pisin became widely spread in Papua.{{rp|149, 152}} The joint governance of both territories that was established during the war was continued after the war ended.{{rp|134}}{{rp|302}}

In 1946, New Guinea was declared a [[United Nations trust territories|United Nations trust territory]] under Australian governance. In 1949 Papuans became Australian citizens,{{rp|223}} and Australia [[Papua and New Guinea Act 1949|formally combined]] Papua and New Guinea into the [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]]. The [[Legislative Council of Papua and New Guinea]] was created in November 1951. Village councils were first created in both Papua and in New Guinea starting 1949, with the number steadily increasing over the years.{{rp|174–175}} These created alternative power structures, which while sometimes filled by traditional leaders, saw the beginning of a shift towards leaders with administrative or business experience.{{rp|211}}

The political aims of Australian rule were uncertain, with independence and becoming an [[States and territories of Australia|Australian state]] both seen as possible futures.{{rp|303–305}} The 1960s and 1970s saw significant social changes as more of the population began to participate in the formal economy, leading to the development of a more local bureaucracy. Alongside this, Australian administrators promoted a shared national identity.{{rp|57}} English was introduced by Australian authorities as a potential unifying language, and many Papua New Guineans viewed it as a [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige language]].{{rp|150}}

Aerial surveys in the 1950s found further inhabited valleys in the highlands. The re-establishment of Australian administration following the war was followed by an expansion of that control, including over the previously mostly uncontrolled highland areas.{{rp|134}}{{rp|303}} Some tribes remained [[Uncontacted peoples|uncontacted]] by Westerners until the 1960s and 1970s.{{rp|149}} The administration of the highlands led to a large expansion of coffee cultivation in the region.{{rp|303}} The [[1964 Papua New Guinean general election|1964 election]], and the subsequent [[1968 Papua New Guinean general election|1968 election]], took place alongside campaigns to introduce the political system.{{rp|107}} The leadup to the 1968 election saw the formation of [[Pangu Pati]], the first political party.{{rp|306}}

Mining exploration by [[Rio Tinto (corporation)|Rio Tinto]] in Bougainville began in 1964. In spite of resistance from some local landowners, the [[Bougainville Copper]] corporation was established and began to [[Panguna mine|operate a large mine]]. Resistance became interlinked with a desire for greater autonomy. Bougainville was geographically close to the [[British Solomon Islands]], and its people are more culturally linked to those of the Solomon Islands than to others in the territory. However, the mine was seen as crucial for diversifying the economic base of Papua New Guinea from agriculture alone.{{rp|306}}

Australian Opposition Leader [[Gough Whitlam]] visited Papua New Guinea in 1969. Whitlam made self-rule in the territory an election issue, and called for self-governance as early as 1972. In March 1971 [[House of Assembly of Papua and New Guinea|the House of Assembly]] recommended that the territory seek self-governance in the next parliament, which was agreed to by Australia.{{rp|110–111}} In June 1971, the flag and emblem were adopted.{{rp|229}} In July, the "and" was removed and the territory was renamed to simply "Papua New Guinea".

[[File:Copper ore concentrator undergoing construction. Mill building. 2 c. 1971.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Large metal building in front of a mountain with large portions cut out|The [[Panguna mine]] on Bougainville Island in 1971]]
Following the time of Whitlam's first visit, political debate significantly intensified alongside significant social changes.{{rp|306}} At the [[1972 Papua New Guinean general election]] in July, [[Michael Somare]] was elected as [[Chief Minister of Papua and New Guinea|Chief Minister]].{{rp|17}} Somare sought a better relationship with regional movements, which increased the number of local groups, but also decreased their salience and encouraged them to join the national political system.{{rp|75–77}} In December, Whitlam was elected as Prime Minister at the [[1972 Australian federal election]]. The [[Whitlam government]] then instituted self-governance in late 1973. The [[Papua New Guinean kina|kina]] was introduced as a separate currency in April 1975.{{rp|377}}

The push for independence was driven by internal policies of the Whitlam government, rather than responding to particular calls from Papua New Guinea.{{rp|224}} The concept of a "country" remained foreign to many in the territory, and there was no strong shared national identity.{{rp|229}} In the early 1970s there were fears that independence would allow for large tribes to dominate others, and create more risk of foreign land acquisition. The subsequent creation of a local consensus for independence was due to the actions of local political leaders. On 1 September 1975, shortly before the scheduled date of Papua New Guinean independence, the government of Bougainville itself [[Republic of the North Solomons|declared independence]].{{rp|72}}{{rp|45}} Payments to the province were suspended in response. Other regional movements emerged prior to independence. The [[Papua Besena]] party sought to separate the territory of Papua from New Guinea, while the [[Highlands Liberation Front]] sought to prevent dominance of highland areas by the coast. Smaller groups advocated for the creation of new provinces.{{rp|72–74}} Nonetheless, the [[Papua New Guinea Independence Act 1975]] passed in September 1975, setting 16 September 1975 as the date of independence.{{rp|45}} Somare continued as the country's first Prime Minister.

===Independence===
[[File:Michael Somare 1973.jpg|thumb|alt=Michael Somare sitting at a desk speaking with an out of focus microphone in front of the shot|[[Michael Somare]] in 1973 alongside [[Bill Morrison (politician)|Bill Morrison]], Minister for External Territories of the [[Whitlam government]]]]
Upon independence, most Australian officials, including agricultural, economic, educational, and medicinal staff, left the territory. Very little training had been provided to their successors. This led to a restructuring and a loss of efficiency, particularly in serving rural areas.{{rp|18}} By the 1980s, the civil service, including the military, had become politicised, decreasing effectiveness and accountability.{{rp|13}}

The voting system was changed to [[first past the post]], as an unsuccessful attempt to encourage the development of a [[two-party system]] with clearly defined political parties.{{rp|3}} National governments changed through constitutional means. Somare retained the prime ministership following the [[1977 Papua New Guinean general election|1977 election]], and was ousted through a vote of no confidence in 1980 and was replaced by [[Julius Chan]]. Somare became prime minister again following the [[1982 Papua New Guinean general election|1982 election]], but lost another vote of no confidence in 1985.{{rp|18, 20}}

Although an August 1976 agreement with the national government resolved the initial declaration of independence,{{rp|45}} the issue of Bougainville persisted past independence. A secessionist movement in 1975–76 on [[Bougainville Island]] resulted in a modification of the [[Constitution of Papua New Guinea]], with the [[Organic Law on Provincial Government]] legally devolving power to the 19 provinces.{{rp|179}}{{rp|26}} Following instances of provincial government mismanagement, Somare's proposal to reduce provincial government power brought further threats of secession from some of the country's [[Islands Region|island provinces]].{{rp|189}}{{rp|27}}{{rp|257}}

While warfare significantly decreased under Australian governance, tribal fighting in the highland areas increased in the 1970s. These areas had been under outside control for less time, meaning former tribal conflict was still remembered and restarted upon independence. The first state of emergency there was declared in 1979, although it and similar interventions did not quell the violence. Unemployment and imbalanced gender ratios in cities meant tribal fighting morphed into the [[Raskol gangs|emergence of gangs]]. Gang violence led to a state of emergency in Port Moresby in 1984, which led to the intervention of the [[Papua New Guinea Defence Force]] (PNGDF). The effectiveness of this deployment led to further [[Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary|police]] and military interventions elsewhere. Both the police and military became more politicised, and less disciplined. Demand for private security increased as a response, and foreign investment was deterred.{{rp|29, 32}}{{rp|8–9}}{{rp|260–261, 264, 270}}{{rp|239–241}} In 1995, provincial governments were reformed, becoming made up of relevant national MPs and a number of appointed members. Some of their responsibilities were devolved towards local governments, a factor that caused significant controversy due to an expected lack of capacity at this level. This lack of capacity has meant that national MPs gained significant powers at the local level.{{rp|174}}{{rp|11}}

[[File:AMBULA~1.jpg|thumb|alt=A burned ambulances and other damaged and destroyed vehicles|The town of [[Arawa, Bougainville|Arawa]] was destroyed during the [[Bougainville conflict]].]]
The employment needs of the Bougainville mine decreased after construction was completed, meaning younger individuals received little benefit from the presence of the mine. A renewed [[Bougainville conflict|uprising on Bougainville]] started in 1988, fighting against both the Bougainville government and the national government. After the mine closed in May 1989, the [[Bougainville Revolutionary Army]] (BRA) declared independence, and the national government pulled out in 1990 and blockaded the province, the conflict shifted into a complex internal civil war. National security forces re-entered the island at the end of 1990, and together with local allies slowly gained more control.{{rp|266–267}} An agreement between the government and some rebels was reached in October 1994, and in 1995 a transitional Bougainville government was established, although fighting continued with the BRA. In 1997, the [[Sandline affair]] over the hiring of mercenaries to intervene in Bougainville brought down the national government. Following New Zealand-mediated peace talks, a ceasefire was reached in January 1998.{{rp|12}}

The first decade of independence saw slow but steady economic growth. The [[Ok Tedi Mine]] opened in 1982. While Australian contribution to the budget dropped from 40% of government revenue in 1975 to 17% in 1988, improved taxation allowed for government expenditure to be maintained.{{rp|312–313}} The closure of the Bougainville mine led to issues with government finances, however an expansion of exports of oil, minerals, and forestry products led to economic recovery in the early 1990s. This growth did not decrease inequality however, and government services declined.{{rp|263–264}} Increasing government expense and resulting rising debt led to [[1994 Papua New Guinea financial crisis|significant economic trouble]]. The [[Papua New Guinean kina]] was devalued and put on a [[floating exchange rate]] in 1994, and the country obtained an emergency loan from the [[World Bank]] in 1995.{{rp|313–314}}

In the [[1997 Papua New Guinean general election|1997 election]], only 4 candidates won overall majorities, with 95 (87%) of winners receiving less than 30% of the vote. After government changed mid-parliament in 1999, a Constitutional Development Commission was established to bring about political reform. The resulting [[Organic Law on the Integrity of Political Parties and Candidates]] created public funding for registered parties, incentivised the selection of female candidates, and instituted punishments for [[Party switching|party hopping]]. It also barred independent MPs from voting for the prime minister, or from joining coalitions before a prime minister is elected.{{rp|3–7}} Another measure was to begin a shift from first past the post to a Limited Preferential Vote system (LPV), a version of the [[instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]].{{rp|17}}{{rp|2}}

The [[Bougainville Peace Agreement]] was signed in 2001, under which Bougainville would gain higher autonomy than other provinces, and an independence referendum would be held in the future. The [[2002 Papua New Guinean general election|2002 election]] saw an uptick in violence. Australian police were brought to PNG to help train PNG police in 2004. While most left the next year after a Supreme Court ruling, this began a long-term Australian police presence in the country. In 2009, Parliament approved the creation of two additional provinces: [[Hela Province]], consisting of part of the existing [[Southern Highlands Province]], and [[Jiwaka Province]], formed by dividing [[Western Highlands Province]].

In 2011, there was a [[2011–2012 Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] between the parliament-elect Prime Minister, [[Peter O'Neill]] (voted into office by a large majority of MPs), and Somare, who was deemed by the supreme court to retain office. The parliament voted to delay the upcoming elections, however they did not have the constitutional authority to do this, and the [[Papua New Guinea Electoral Commission]] continued to prepare.{{rp|207–211}} The [[2012 Papua New Guinean general election|2012 national elections]] went ahead as scheduled, and O'Neill was once again elected as prime minister by a majority of parliament. Somare joined O'Neill's government, charges against the court judges and others who supported Somare were dropped, and legislation asserting control of the judiciary and that affecting the office of the prime minister was repealed.{{rp|207–211}}

[[Liquefied natural gas]] exports [[Natural gas in Papua New Guinea|began in 2014]], however falling prices as well as lower oil prices meant that government revenue was lower than expected. The debt-to-GDP ratio rose, and as of 2019, Papua New Guinea's HDI rating was the lowest in the Pacific.{{rp|4}} In March 2015 the [[Bougainville Mining Act]] shifted control over mining from the national government to the Bougainville government. It also stated that minerals belonged to [[customary land]]owners rather than the state, giving landowners veto power over future extraction.

The 2012–2017 O'Neill government was dogged by corruption scandals. The [[2017 Papua New Guinean general election|2017 general election]] saw O'Neill return as prime minister, although initially with a smaller coalition. This election saw widespread voter intimidation in some regions, and delays in the reporting of seat results.{{rp|253–255}} Financial scandals, as well as criticism of the purchase of expensive cars for [[APEC Papua New Guinea 2018]] meeting, created pressure on O'Neill and led to defections from government.{{rp|255–258}} In May 2019, O'Neill resigned as prime minister and was replaced by [[James Marape]].

The government set 23 November 2019 as the voting date for [[2019 Bougainvillean independence referendum|a non-binding independence referendum]] in the [[Autonomous Region of Bougainville|Bougainville autonomous region]]. Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence (98.31%). Prime Minister James Marape's [[Pangu Pati|PANGU]] Party secured the most seats of any party in the [[2022 Papua New Guinean general election|2022 election]], enabling him to continue as PNG's Prime Minister.
