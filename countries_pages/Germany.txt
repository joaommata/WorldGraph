=== Prehistory ===
{{Main|Linear Pottery culture|Unetice culture|Urnfield culture|Celts}}

Ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago. The first non-modern human fossil (the [[Neanderthal]]) was discovered in the [[Neandertal (valley)|Neander Valley]]. Similarly dated evidence of modern humans has been found in the [[Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura|Swabian Jura]], including 42,000-year-old [[Paleolithic flute|flutes]] which are the oldest musical instruments ever found, the 40,000-year-old [[Lion-man|Lion Man]], and the 41,000-year-old [[Venus of Hohle Fels]].

=== Germanic tribes, Roman frontier and the Frankish Empire ===

[[File:Trier 012.JPG|thumb|[[Aula Palatina|Basilica of Constantine]] in [[Trier]] (''[[Augusta Treverorum]]''), built in the 4th century]]
The [[Germanic peoples]] are thought to have [[Ethnogenesis|emerged]] from the [[Jastorf culture]] during the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] or early [[Pre-Roman Iron Age|Iron Age]]. From southern [[Scandinavia]] and [[northern Germany]], they expanded south, east, and west, coming into contact with the [[Celts|Celtic]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Balts|Baltic]], and [[Early Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. Southern Germany was inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, who belonged to the wider [[La Tène culture]]. They were later assimilated by the Germanic conquerors.

Under [[Augustus]], the [[Roman Empire]] began to invade lands inhabited by the Germanic tribes, creating a short-lived Roman province of [[Germania Antiqua|Germania]] between the Rhine and [[Elbe]] rivers. In 9 AD, three [[Roman legion]]s were [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|defeated]] by [[Arminius]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. The outcome of this battle dissuaded the Romans from their ambition of conquering [[Germania]] and is thus considered one of the most important events in [[European history]].{{sfn|Murdoch|2004|p=57}} By 100 AD, when [[Tacitus]] wrote ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the [[Limes Germanicus]]), occupying most of modern Germany. However, [[Baden Württemberg|Baden-Württemberg]], southern [[Bavaria]], southern [[Hesse]] and the western [[Rhineland]] had [[Germanic Wars|been incorporated]] into [[Roman province]]s.{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp=9–13}}

Around 260, Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands. After the invasion of the [[Huns]] in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest: the Franks established the [[Frankish Kingdom]] and pushed east to subjugate [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. Areas of modern eastern Germany were inhabited by [[West Slavs|Western Slavic]] tribes.{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp=9–13}}

=== East Francia and the Holy Roman Empire ===

[[File:Lucas Cranach d.Ä. - Martin Luther, 1528 (Veste Coburg).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Martin Luther]], born in [[Eisleben]] in 1483, challenged the indulgences of the [[Catholic Church]], giving rise to the [[Reformation]] and [[Protestantism]].]]
[[Charlemagne]] founded the [[Carolingian Empire]] in 800; it was [[Treaty of Verdun|divided in 843]].{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|p= 11}} The eastern successor kingdom of [[East Francia]] stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe river in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps.{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|p= 11}} Subsequently, the Holy Roman Empire emerged from it. The [[Ottonian]] rulers (919–1024) consolidated several major [[Stem duchy|duchies]]. In 996, [[Pope Gregory V|Gregory V]] became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin [[Otto III]], whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and [[Burgundy (historical region)|Burgundy]] under the [[Salian]] emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the [[Investiture Controversy]].

Under the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors (1138–1254), German princes encouraged German settlement to the south and east ({{lang|de|[[Ostsiedlung]]}}).{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp= 19–20}} Members of the [[Hanseatic League]], mostly north German towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp= 13–24}} The population declined starting with the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|Great Famine]] in 1315, followed by the [[Black Death]] of 1348–1350. The [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]] issued in 1356 provided the constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven [[prince-elector]]s.{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|p= 27}}

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, laying the basis for the [[democratization of knowledge|democratisation of knowledge]]. In 1517, [[Martin Luther]] incited the Protestant Reformation and [[Luther Bible|his translation of the Bible]] began the standardisation of the language; the 1555 [[Peace of Augsburg]] tolerated the "Evangelical" faith ([[Lutheranism]]), but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects ({{lang|la|[[cuius regio, eius religio]]}}). From the [[Cologne War]] through the [[Thirty Years' War]]s (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands and significantly reduced the population.

The [[Peace of Westphalia]] ended religious warfare among the [[Imperial Estate]]s. The [[House of Habsburg]] held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] in 1740. Following the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], Charles VI's daughter [[Maria Theresa]] ruled as [[Queen consort|empress consort]] when her husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], became emperor.

From 1740, [[German dualism|dualism]] between the Austrian [[Habsburg monarchy]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] dominated German history. In 1772, 1793, and 1795, Prussia and Austria, along with the [[Russian Empire]], agreed to the [[Partitions of Poland]]. During the period of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the [[Napoleonic era]] and the subsequent [[Final Recess of the Reichsdeputation|final meeting of the Imperial Diet]], most of the [[Free Imperial Cities]] were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the {{lang|de|Imperium}} was dissolved; France, Russia, Prussia, and the Habsburgs (Austria) competed for hegemony in the German states during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|p= 97}}

=== German Confederation and Empire ===
{{Main|German question|German Confederation|Unification of Germany|German Empire|German colonial empire}}

[[File:German Confederation (1815).svg|thumb|The German Confederation in 1815]]
Following the fall of [[Napoleon]], the [[Congress of Vienna]] founded the German Confederation, a loose league of [[States of the German Confederation|39 sovereign states]]. The appointment of the [[emperor of Austria]] as the permanent president reflected the Congress's rejection of [[Prussia]]'s rising influence. Disagreement within [[Concert of Europe|restoration]] politics partly led to the rise of [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman [[Klemens von Metternich]]. The {{lang|de|[[Zollverein]]}}, a tariff union, furthered economic unity. In light of [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movements in Europe]], intellectuals and commoners started the [[German revolutions of 1848–1849|revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], raising the German question. King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] was offered the title of emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, a temporary setback for the movement.

[[File:Berlin Nationaldenkmal Kaiser Wilhelm mit Schloss 1900.jpg|thumb|right|[[Berlin Palace]], the main residence of the Kings of Prussia and German Emperors]]
King [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]] as the [[Minister President of Prussia]] in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded the [[Second Schleswig War|war with Denmark in 1864]]; the subsequent decisive Prussian victory in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866 enabled him to create the [[North German Confederation]] which excluded [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. After the defeat of France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the King of Prussia ruled as its [[German Emperor|Emperor]] ({{lang|de|Kaiser}}), and Berlin became its capital.

In the {{lang|de|[[Gründerzeit]]}} period following the unification of Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as [[chancellor of Germany]] secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances and avoiding war. [[Dual Alliance (1879)|A dual alliance]] was created with the [[multinational state|multinational realm]] of [[Austria-Hungary]]; the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance of 1882]] included Italy. Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances to protect against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp= 135, 149}} At the [[Berlin Conference]] in 1884, Germany claimed several [[List of former German colonies|colonies]] including [[German East Africa]], [[German South West Africa]], [[Togoland]], and [[Kamerun]]. Later, Germany further expanded its colonial empire to include holdings in the Pacific and [[China]]. The colonial government in South West Africa (present-day [[Namibia]]), from 1904 to 1908, carried out the [[Herero and Nama genocide|annihilation of the local Herero and Nama peoples]] as punishment for an uprising; this was the 20th century's first [[genocide]]. [[Armistice with Germany|a general armistice]] ended the fighting. In the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|German Revolution]] (November 1918), Wilhelm II and the ruling princes [[abdication|abdicated]] their positions, and Germany was declared a [[federal republic]]. Germany's new leadership signed the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919, accepting defeat by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating, which was seen by historians as influential in the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Germany lost around 13% of its European territory and ceded all of its colonial possessions.

=== Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany ===

On 11 August 1919, President [[Friedrich Ebert]] signed the democratic [[Weimar Constitution]].{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp=156–160}} [[Bavarian Soviet Republic|Communists briefly seized power in Bavaria]] and a few larger cities, while conservative elements failed to overthrow the central government in the 1920 [[Kapp Putsch]]. The [[occupation of the Ruhr]] by Belgian and French troops and a period of [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]] followed. A [[Dawes Plan|plan to restructure Germany's war reparations]] and the creation of [[German Rentenmark|a new currency]] in 1924 helped stabilise the government and ushered in the [[Golden Twenties]], an era of artistic innovation and liberal cultural life.

The worldwide [[Great Depression]] hit Germany in 1929, and by 1932 the unemployment rate had risen to 24%. The [[Nazi Party]] led by [[Adolf Hitler]] became the largest party in the Reichstag after the [[July 1932 German federal election|election of July 1932]], and [[President Hindenburg]] appointed Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933.{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp=155–158, 172–177}} After the [[Reichstag fire]], [[Reichstag Fire Decree|a decree]] abrogated basic [[civil rights]], and the first [[Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]] opened. On 23 March 1933, the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power, overriding the constitution, and marked the beginning of Nazi Germany. His government established a centralised [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian state]], [[1933 German referendum|withdrew from the League of Nations]], and dramatically increased the [[German re-armament|country's rearmament]]. A government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works, the most famous of which was the {{lang|de|[[Reichsautobahn|Autobahn]]}}.

In 1935, the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the [[Nuremberg Laws]] which targeted [[Jews]] and other [[Minority group|minorities]]. Germany also reacquired control of the [[Territory of the Saar Basin|Saarland]] in 1935,{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp=188–189}} [[remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarised the Rhineland]] in 1936, [[Anschluss|annexed]] Austria in 1938, [[Sudetenland#Sudetenland as part of Nazi Germany|annexed]] the Sudetenland in 1938 with the [[Munich Agreement]], and, in violation of the agreement, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|occupied Czechoslovakia]] in March 1939. {{lang|de|[[Kristallnacht]]}} (Night of Broken Glass) saw the burning of synagogues, the destruction of Jewish businesses, and mass arrests of Jewish people.

In August 1939, [[Government of Nazi Germany|Hitler's government]] negotiated the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] that divided Eastern Europe into German and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spheres of influence. On 1 September 1939, Germany [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], beginning [[European theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]];{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp=190–195}} Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September. In the spring of 1940, Germany [[Operation Weserübung|conquered Denmark and Norway]], [[German invasion of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[German invasion of Belgium (1940)|Belgium]], [[German invasion of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], and [[Battle of France|France]], forcing the French government to sign an [[armistice]]. The British repelled German air attacks in the [[Battle of Britain]] in the same year. In 1941, German troops [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded Yugoslavia]], [[Battle of Greece|Greece]] and the [[Operation Barbarossa|Soviet Union]], and Germany declared war on the United States. By 1942, Germany and its allies controlled most of [[German-occupied Europe|continental Europe]] and [[North Africa]], but following the Soviet victory at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], the Allied [[North African Campaign|reconquest of North Africa]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|invasion of Italy]] in 1943, German forces suffered repeated military defeats. In 1944, the Soviets [[Eastern Front (World War II)#Summer 1944|pushed into Eastern Europe]]; the Western allies [[Operation Overlord|landed in France]] and entered Germany despite a [[Battle of the Bulge|final German counteroffensive]]. Following [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's suicide]] during the [[Battle of Berlin]], [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germany signed the surrender document]] on 8 May 1945, [[End of World War II in Europe|ending World War II in Europe]]{{sfn|Fulbrook |1991|pp=190–195}} and Nazi Germany. Following the end of the war, surviving Nazi officials were tried for [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht|war crimes]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]].

In what later became known as [[the Holocaust]], the German government persecuted [[Holocaust victims|minorities]], including interning them in concentration and [[Extermination camp|death camps]] across Europe. The regime systematically murdered around 6 million [[Jews]], at least 130,000 [[Porajmos|Romani]], 275,000 [[Aktion T4|disabled]], thousands of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], thousands of [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany|homosexuals]], and hundreds of thousands of [[Nacht und Nebel|political and religious opponents]]. [[Generalplan Ost|Nazi policies in German-occupied countries]] resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2.7&nbsp;million [[Polish people|Poles]], 1.3&nbsp;million [[Ukrainians]], 1&nbsp;million [[Belarusians]] and 3.5&nbsp;million [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|Soviet prisoners of war]]. and around 900,000 German civilians died. Around 12&nbsp;million [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950)|ethnic Germans were expelled]] from across Eastern Europe, and Germany lost roughly [[Former eastern territories of Germany|one-quarter]] of its pre-war territory.

=== East and West Germany ===
{{Main|History of Germany (1945–1990)|Allied-occupied Germany|West Germany|East Germany}}

[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|The [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989 was one of the first developments in the end of the [[Cold War]], leading ultimately to the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]].]]

After the surrender of Nazi Germany, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] ''[[de jure]]'' [[Berlin Declaration (1945)|abolished the German state]] and partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]], were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) ({{langx|de|Bundesrepublik Deutschland}}); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR) ({{lang|de|Deutsche Demokratische Republik}}; DDR). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany. East Germany selected [[East Berlin]] as its capital, while West Germany chose [[Bonn]] as a provisional capital to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was temporary.

West Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a [[social market economy]]. In 1948, West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the American [[Marshall Plan]]. [[Konrad Adenauer]] was elected the first [[Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany|federal chancellor of Germany]] in 1949. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth ({{lang|de|[[Wirtschaftswunder]]}}) beginning in the early 1950s. West Germany joined [[NATO]] in 1955 and was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]]. On 1 January 1957, the [[Saar Protectorate|Saarland]] joined West Germany.

East Germany was an [[Eastern Bloc]] state under political and military control by the [[Soviet Union]] via occupation forces and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members ({{lang|de|[[Politburo|Politbüro]]}}) of the communist-controlled [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], supported by the {{lang|de|[[Stasi]]|italic=no}}, an immense secret service. While [[Communist propaganda|East German propaganda]] was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity. The [[Berlin Wall]], built in 1961, prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany, becoming a symbol of the [[Cold War]].

Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the late 1960s by Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]'s {{lang|de|[[Ostpolitik]]}}. In 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the [[Iron Curtain]] and [[Removal of Hungary's border fence with Austria|open its border with Austria]], causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary and Austria. This had devastating effects on the GDR, where [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|regular mass demonstrations]] received increasing support. In an effort to help retain East Germany as a state, the East German authorities eased border restrictions, but this actually led to an acceleration of the {{lang|de|Wende}} reform process, culminating in the ''[[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Two Plus Four Treaty]]'' under which Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the [[New states of Germany|five re-established states]] of the former GDR. The [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989 became a symbol of the [[Fall of Communism]], the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], German reunification and {{lang|de|[[Die Wende]]}} ("the turning point").

=== Reunified Germany and the European Union ===
{{Main|German reunification|History of Germany since 1990}}

[[File:Berlin reichstag west panorama 2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Berlin/Bonn Act]] made [[Berlin]] the [[capital of Germany]] again, with the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] becoming the seat of the [[German parliament]] in 1999.]]
United Germany was considered the enlarged continuation of [[West Germany]], so it retained its memberships in international organisations. Based on the [[Berlin/Bonn Act]] (1994), [[Berlin]] again became the [[capital of Germany]], while [[Bonn]] obtained the unique status of a {{lang|de|Bundesstadt}} (federal city), retaining some federal ministries. The relocation of the government was completed in 1999, and modernisation of the East German economy was scheduled to last until 2019.

Since reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the [[European Union]], signing the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in 1992 and the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007, and co-founding the [[eurozone]]. Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the [[1999 NATO bombing in Yugoslavia|Balkans]] and sent [[Bundeswehr|German troops]] to [[Afghanistan]] as part of a NATO effort to provide [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)|security in that country]] after the ousting of the [[Taliban]].

In the [[2005 German federal election|2005 elections]], [[Angela Merkel]] became the first female chancellor. In 2009, the German government approved a €50&nbsp;billion stimulus plan. Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of [[European integration]], the [[Energy transition in Germany|country's energy transition]] ({{lang|de|Energiewende}}) for a [[sustainable energy]] supply, the [[Debt brake (Germany)|debt brake]] for balanced budgets, measures to increase the [[Ageing of Europe#Germany|fertility rate]] ([[Natalistic politics|pronatalism]]), and [[high-tech]] strategies for the transition of the German economy, summarised as [[Industry 4.0]]. During the [[2015 European migrant crisis]], the country took in over a million refugees and migrants.
