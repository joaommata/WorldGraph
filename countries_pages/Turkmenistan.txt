{{Main|History of Turkmenistan}}
Historically inhabited by [[Indo-Iranians]], Turkmenistan's written history begins with its annexation by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of ancient Iran. After centuries of turmoil, over a thousand years later, in the 8th century AD, [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] tribes moved from [[Mongolia]] into present-day Central Asia. Part of a powerful confederation of tribes, these Oghuz formed the ethnic basis of the modern Turkmen population. In the 10th century, the name "Turkmen" was first applied to Oghuz groups that accepted [[Islam]] and began to occupy present-day Turkmenistan. There they were under the dominion of the [[Seljuk Empire]], which was composed of Oghuz groups living in present-day [[Iran]] and Turkmenistan. Oghuz groups in the service of the empire played an important role in the spreading of Turkic culture when they migrated westward into present-day [[Azerbaijan]] and eastern [[Turkey]].

In the 12th century, [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] and other tribes overthrew the Seljuk Empire. In the next century, the [[Mongols]] took over the more northern lands where the Turkmens had settled, scattering the Turkmens southward and contributing to the formation of new tribal groups. The sixteenth and eighteenth centuries saw a series of splits and confederations among the [[nomad]]ic Turkmen tribes, who remained staunchly independent and inspired fear in their neighbors. By the 16th century, most of those tribes were under the nominal control of two sedentary [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] [[khanate]]s, [[Khanate of Khiva|Khiva]] and [[Khanate of Bukhara|Bukhoro]]. Turkmen soldiers were an important element of the Uzbek militaries of this period. In the 19th century, raids and rebellions by the [[Yomud]] Turkmen group resulted in that group's dispersal by the Uzbek rulers. In 1855 the [[Turkmen tribes|Turkmen tribe]] of [[Teke (Turkmen tribe)|Teke]] led by Gowshut-Khan defeated the invading army of the [[Khanate of Khiva|Khan of Khiva]] Muhammad Amin Khan and in 1861 the invading [[Persia]]n army of [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar|Nasreddin-Shah]].

In the second half of the 19th century, northern Turkmens were the main military and political power in the [[Khanate of Khiva]]. According to Paul R. Spickard, "Prior to the Russian conquest, the Turkmen were known and feared for their involvement in the Central Asian [[History of slavery in Asia|slave trade]]."

Russian forces began occupying Turkmen territory late in the 19th century. From their [[Caspian Sea]] base at Krasnovodsk (now [[Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan|Türkmenbaşy]]), the Russians eventually overcame the Uzbek khanates. In 1879, the Russian forces were defeated by the [[Teke (Turkmen tribe)|Teke Turkmens]] during the [[Battle of Geok Tepe (1879)|first attempt to conquer the Ahal area of Turkmenistan]]. However, in 1881, the last significant resistance in Turkmen territory was crushed at the [[Battle of Geok Tepe]], and shortly thereafter Turkmenistan was annexed, together with adjoining Uzbek territory, into the [[Russian Empire]]. In 1916, the Russian Empire's participation in [[World War I]] resonated in Turkmenistan, as an anticonscription revolt swept most of Russian Central Asia. Although the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 had little direct impact, in the 1920s Turkmen forces joined [[Kazakhs]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], and Uzbeks in the so-called [[Basmachi rebellion]] against the rule of the newly formed [[Soviet Union]]. In 1921 the tsarist province of [[Transcaspian Oblast|Transcaspia]] ({{langx|ru|Закаспийская область}}, 'Transcaspian Oblast') was renamed Turkmen Oblast ({{langx|ru|Туркменская область}}), and in 1924, the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic]] was formed from it. By the late 1930s, Soviet reorganization of agriculture had destroyed what remained of the nomadic lifestyle in Turkmenistan, and Moscow controlled political life. The [[1948 Ashgabat earthquake|Ashgabat earthquake]] of 1948 killed over 110,000 people, amounting to two-thirds of the city's population.

During the next half-century, Turkmenistan played its designated economic role within the Soviet Union and remained outside the course of major world events. Even the major [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–1991)|liberalization movement]] that shook Russia in the late 1980s had little impact. However, in 1990, the Supreme Soviet of Turkmenistan declared sovereignty as a [[nationalist]] response to perceived exploitation by [[Moscow]]. Although Turkmenistan was ill-prepared for independence and then-[[communist]] leader [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] preferred to preserve the Soviet Union, in October 1991, the fragmentation of that entity forced him to call a national referendum that approved independence. On 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Niyazov continued as Turkmenistan's chief of state, replacing communism with a unique brand of independent nationalism reinforced by a pervasive [[cult of personality]]. A 1994 referendum and legislation in 1999 abolished further requirements for the president to stand for re-election (although in 1992 he completely dominated the only [[Turkmenistani presidential election, 1992|presidential election]] in which he ran, as he was the only candidate and no one else was allowed to run for the office), making him effectively [[president for life]]. During his tenure, Niyazov conducted frequent purges of public officials and abolished organizations deemed threatening. Throughout the post-Soviet era, Turkmenistan has taken a neutral position on almost all international issues. Niyazov eschewed membership in regional organizations such as the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]], and in the late 1990s he maintained relations with the [[Taliban]] and its chief opponent in [[Afghanistan]], the [[Northern Alliance]]. He offered limited support to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|military campaign against the Taliban]] following the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]]. In 2002 an alleged assassination attempt against Niyazov led to a new wave of security restrictions, dismissals of government officials, and restrictions placed on the media. Niyazov accused exiled former foreign minister [[Boris Shikhmuradov]] of having planned the attack.

Between 2002 and 2004, serious tension arose between Turkmenistan and [[Uzbekistan]] because of bilateral disputes and Niyazov's implication that Uzbekistan had a role in the 2002 assassination attempt. In 2004, a series of bilateral treaties restored friendly relations. In the [[Turkmenistani parliamentary election, 2004|parliamentary elections of December 2004 and January 2005]], only Niyazov's party was represented, and no [[Election monitoring|international monitors]] participated. In 2005, Niyazov exercised his dictatorial power by closing all hospitals outside [[Ashgabat]] and all rural libraries. The year 2006 saw intensification of the trends of arbitrary policy changes, shuffling of top officials, diminishing economic output outside the oil and gas sector, and isolation from regional and world organizations. China was among a very few nations to whom Turkmenistan made significant overtures. The sudden death of Niyazov at the end of 2006 left a complete vacuum of power, as [[List of cults of personality#Turkmenistan|his cult of personality]], comparable to the [[Kim Il-sung's cult of personality|one]] of eternal president [[Kim Il Sung]] of [[North Korea]], had precluded the naming of a successor. Deputy Prime Minister [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]], who was named interim head of government, won a non-democratic [[Turkmen presidential election, 2007|special presidential election]] held in early February 2007. His appointment as interim president and subsequent run for president violated the constitution. Berdimuhamedow won two additional non-democratic elections, with approximately 97% of the vote in both [[Turkmen presidential election, 2012|2012]] and [[2017 Turkmenistan presidential election|2017]]. His son [[Serdar Berdimuhamedow]] won a non-democratic [[2022 Turkmenistan presidential election|snap presidential election]] in 2022, establishing a [[political dynasty]] in Turkmenistan. On 19 March 2022, Serdar Berdimuhamedov was sworn in as Turkmenistan's new president to succeed his father.
