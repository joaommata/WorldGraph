Cultures in the region have been dated back to at least the fourth millennium BC, including the [[Bronze Age]] [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex]], the [[Andronovo culture|Andronovo]] cultures and the [[Sarazm|pro-urban site of Sarazm]], a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].

The earliest recorded history of the region dates back to about 500 BC when most, if not all, of Tajikistan was part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Some authors have suggested that in the seventh and sixth centuries BC parts of Tajikistan, including territories in the Zeravshan valley, formed part of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Kambojas]] tribe before it became part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].
After the region's conquest by [[Alexander the Great]] it became part of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], a successor state of Alexander's empire. Northern Tajikistan (the cities of [[Khujand]] and [[Panjakent]]) was part of [[Sogdia]], a collection of city-states which was overrun by [[Scytho-Siberians]] and [[Yuezhi]] nomadic tribes around 150 BC. The [[Silk Road]] passed through the region and following the expedition of Chinese explorer [[Zhang Qian]] during the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han|Wudi]] (141 BC–87 BC) commercial relations between [[Han Empire]] and Sogdiana flourished. Sogdians played a role in facilitating trade and worked in other capacities, as farmers, carpetweavers, glassmakers, and woodcarvers.<!--an unsourced Indian assertion? However, the Sogdian traders were then still less important in the Silk Road trade than their southern neighbors, Indians and Bactrians.-->

The [[Kushan Empire]], a collection of [[Yuezhi]] tribes, took control of the region in the first century AD and ruled until the fourth century AD during which time [[Buddhism]], [[Nestorian Christianity]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and [[Manichaeism]] were practised in the region. Later the [[Hephthalite Empire]], a collection of nomadic tribes, moved into the region, and the [[Arabs]] [[Spread of Islam|disseminated Islam]] in the eighth century.

=== Samanid Empire ===
{{Main|Samanid Empire}}

The [[Samanids|Samanid Empire]], 819 to 999, restored [[Persian people|Persian]] control of the region and enlarged the cities of [[Samarkand]] and [[Bukhara]], which became the cultural centres of [[Iran]]; the region was known as Khorasan. The empire was centred in Khorasan and Transoxiana, at its greatest extent encompassing Afghanistan, parts of Iran, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, parts of Kazakhstan, and Pakistan.

Four brothers Nuh, Ahmad, Yahya, and Ilyas founded the Samanid state. Each of them ruled territory under [[Abbasid]] suzerainty. In 892, [[Ismail Samani]] (892–907) united the Samanid state under one ruler, thus putting an end to the feudal system used by the Samanids. It was under him that the Samanids became independent of Abbasid authority.

The [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] conquered [[Transoxania]] (which corresponded approximately with what later would be Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, southern Kyrgyzstan, and southwest Kazakhstan) and ruled between 999 and 1211. Their arrival in Transoxania signalled a definitive shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia, and gradually the Kara-khanids became assimilated into the Perso-Arab Muslim culture of the region.

In the 13th century, the [[Mongol Empire]] swept through Central Asia, invaded the [[Khwarezmian Empire]] and sacked its cities, looting and massacring people. [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turco-Mongol]] conqueror [[Timur|Tamerlane]] founded the [[Timurid Empire]], becoming the first ruler of the [[Timurid dynasty]] in and around what later became Tajikistan and Central Asia.

=== Bukharan rule ===
{{Main|Khanate of Bukhara}}

What later became Tajikistan fell under the rule of the [[Khanate of Bukhara]] during the 16th century and, with the empire's collapse in the 18th century, it came under the rule of the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] and [[Khanate of Kokand]]. The [[Emirate of Bukhara]] remained intact until the 20th century.

=== Imperial Russia ===
{{Main|Russian conquest of Turkestan}}
{{Further|Russian Turkestan|The Great Game}}

During the 19th century, the Russian Empire began to conquer parts of the region. Russian [[Imperialism]] led to the [[Russian Empire]]'s conquest of [[Central Asia]] during the 19th century's [[Great Game|Imperial Era]]. Between 1864 and 1885, Russia gradually took control of the entire territory of [[Russian Turkestan]], the Tajikistan portion of which had been controlled by the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] and [[Khanate of Kokand]]. Russia was interested in gaining access to a supply of [[cotton]] and in the 1870s attempted to switch cultivation in the region from grain to cotton (a strategy later copied and expanded by the Soviets).

During the 19th century, the [[Jadid]]ists established themselves as an Islamic social movement throughout the region. While the Jadidists were pro-modernisation and not necessarily anti-Russian, the Russians viewed the movement as a threat because the Russian Empire was predominantly Christian. Russian troops were required to restore order during uprisings against the Khanate of Kokand between 1910 and 1913. Further violence occurred in July 1916 when demonstrators attacked Russian soldiers in [[Khujand]] over the threat of forced [[conscription]] during [[World War I]]. While Russian troops brought Khujand back under control, clashes continued throughout the year in various locations in Tajikistan.


=== Soviet period ===
{{Main|Basmachi movement|Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic}}
[[File:Negotiations with basmachs Fergana, 1921.jpg|thumb|Soviet negotiations with ''[[Basmachi movement|basmachi]]'', 1921]]

After the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 guerrillas throughout Central Asia, known as ''[[basmachi]]'', waged [[Kokand Autonomy|a war]] against [[Bolshevik]] armies in an attempt to maintain independence. The Bolsheviks prevailed after a four-year war, in which [[mosque]]s and villages were burned down and the population suppressed.

Between 1928 and 1941, Soviet authorities started an [[USSR anti-religious campaign (1928–1941)|anti-religious campaign]] of [[secularization|secularisation]]. Practising [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], or [[Judaism]] was discouraged and repressed; due to the [[Soviet anti-religious legislation]], several [[Church (building)|churches]], [[mosque]]s, and [[synagogue]]s were closed. As a consequence of the conflict and Soviet agriculture policies, [[Central Asia]], Tajikistan included, underwent a famine that claimed lives.

Tajikistan was first created in 1924 as the [[Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] (abbrievated Tajik ASSR), an autonomous republic within the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]].{{sfn|Heathershaw|Herzig|2013|p=1}} Despite their historical status as Tajik cities and mostly being populated by Tajiks, none of the regional urban centres—such as [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]], [[Tirmiz]], [[Qarshi]], and [[Khojand]]—were included in Tajikistan. Instead, the Tajikistani capital was established in [[Dushanbe]], a mountain town with approximately 1,000 residents.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=119}}

A specific Persian dialect, with vocabulary and pronunciation different from formal written Persian, was deliberately made the national language of Tajikistan by the Soviets and renamed "Tajiki" to forcibly separate it from the common variant of Persian spoken from [[Istanbul]] to [[Calcutta]]. The Tajiks were also excluded from the enormous global world of Persian literature, both past and current, by the creation of a new phonetic alphabet, first Latin-based in 1928 and later Cyrillic in 1940.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=118}} With Persian confined to Tajikistan and replaced by Russian as Central Asia's common language, the unity of the [[Persianate]] world was broken, steering Soviet and post-Soviet Central Asia onto a developmental path distinct from Iran and Afghanistan.{{sfn|Arjomand|2025|p=344}} In 1929, the Tajik ASSR was elevated to its own full [[Republics of the Soviet Union|union republic]], the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The [[Sughd Region]] was added to Tajikistan in the same year.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=120}}

Between 1927 and 1934, [[collectivization of agriculture|collectivisation of agriculture]] and an expansion of cotton production took place, especially in the southern region. Soviet collectivization policy brought violence against farmers and peasants, classified as [[anti-Soviet]] categories of "[[enemies of the people]]", and [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|forced resettlement]] occurred throughout Tajikistan. Consequently, some peasants fought collectivisation and revived the [[Basmachi movement]]. Some industrial development occurred during this time along with the expansion of irrigation infrastructure.

Two rounds of [[Great Purge|Stalin's purges]] (1927–1934 and 1937–1938) resulted in the expulsion of nearly 10,000 people from all levels of the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Ethnic [[Russians]] were sent in to replace those expelled and subsequently Russians dominated party positions at all levels, including the top position of first secretary. Between 1926 and 1959 the proportion of Russians among Tajikistan's population grew from less than 1% to 13%. [[Bobojon Ghafurov]], [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan]] from 1946 to 1956, was the only Tajik politician of significance outside of the republic during the Soviet Era.

Tajiks began to be conscripted into the [[Red Army]] in 1939 and during [[World War II]] around 260,000 Tajik citizens fought against [[Nazi Germany]], [[Finland in World War II|Finland]], and the [[Empire of Japan]]. Between 60,000 (4%) and 120,000 (8%) of Tajikistan's 1,530,000 citizens were killed during World War II.

Following the war and the end of Stalin's reign, attempts were made to further expand the agriculture and industry of Tajikistan. During 1957–58 [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[Virgin Lands Campaign]] focused attention on Tajikistan, where living conditions, education and industry lagged behind the other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]]. In the 1980s, Tajikistan had the lowest household saving rate in the USSR, the lowest percentage of households in the two top per capita income groups, and the lowest rate of university graduates per 1000 people.

By the 1980s Tajik nationalists were calling for increased rights. Real disturbances did not occur within the republic until 1990. The following year, the [[Soviet Union]] collapsed, and Tajikistan declared its independence on 9 September 1991, a day which is celebrated as the country's [[Independence Day (Tajikistan)|Independence Day]].

In February 1990, [[1990 Dushanbe riots|riots and strikes]] in [[Dushanbe]] and other cities began due to the difficult socio-economic situation, lack of housing, and youth unemployment. The nationalist and democratic opposition and supporters of independence joined the strikes and began to demand the independence of the republic and democratic reforms. [[Islamism|Islamists]] began to hold strikes to demand respect for their rights and independence. The Soviet leadership introduced Internal Troops in Dushanbe to eliminate the unrest.

Following independence, the nation fell into [[Tajikistani Civil War|civil war]] among factions distinguished by clan loyalties. Regional groups from the [[Gharm]] and [[Gorno-Badakhshan]] regions of Tajikistan, led by a combination of [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] reformers and [[Islamists]], who eventually became the [[United Tajik Opposition]], rose up against the newly formed government of President [[Rahmon Nabiyev]], which was dominated by people from the [[Khujand]] and [[Kulob]] regions.

The war lasted until 1997. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution and increased poverty, seeking better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were [[refugee]]s inside and outside of the country.

[[Emomali Rahmon]] came to power in the early part of this conflict in 1992, after Nabiyev was forced at gunpoint on 7 September 1992 to resign from office. Rahmon defeated former prime minister [[Abdumalik Abdullajanov]] in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote.

In 1997, a [[ceasefire]] was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result praised as a successful United Nations peacekeeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the [[United Tajik Opposition|opposition]]. [[Tajikistani presidential election, 1999|Elections]] were held in 1999 and were criticised by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair; Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. [[Tajik presidential election, 2006|Elections in 2006]] were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) criticised it, while observers from the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] claimed the elections were legal and transparent.

Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.

Russian border troops were stationed along the Tajik–Afghan border until summer 2005. Since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], French troops have been stationed at [[Dushanbe Airport]] in support of air operations of [[NATO]]'s [[International Security Assistance Force]] in [[Afghanistan]]. [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] personnel periodically visit Tajikistan to conduct joint training missions of up to several weeks' duration. The [[Government of India]] rebuilt the [[Ayni Air Base]], a military airport located 15&nbsp;km southwest of Dushanbe, at a cost of $70 million, completing the repairs in September 2010. It is the main base of the Tajikistan air force. There have been talks with Russia concerning use of the Ayni facility, and Russia continues to maintain a base on the outskirts of Dushanbe.

In 2010, there were concerns among Tajik officials that Islamic militarism in the east of the country was on the rise following the escape of 25 militants from a Tajik prison in August, an ambush that killed 28 Tajik soldiers in the [[Rasht Valley]] in September, and another ambush in the valley in October that killed 30 soldiers, followed by fighting outside [[Gharm]] that left three militants dead. The country's Interior Ministry insisted that the central government maintained full control over the country's east, and the military operation in the Rasht Valley was concluded in November 2010.

[[2012 Gorno-Badakhshan clashes|Fighting erupted]] again, this time in and around Gorno-Badakhshan, in July 2012.
In 2015, Russia sent more troops to Tajikistan.

In May 2015, Tajikistan's national security underwent a setback when Colonel [[Gulmurod Khalimov]], commander of the special-purpose police unit (OMON) of the Interior Ministry, defected to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]]. Khalimov was allegedly killed on 8 September 2017 during a Russian airstrike near [[Deir ez-Zor]], [[Syria]], although Tajikistan authorities express doubts whether he has died.

In 2021, following the [[Fall of Kabul (2021)|Fall of Kabul]], Tajikistan allegedly got involved in the [[Panjshir conflict]] against the [[Taliban]] on the side of the [[National Resistance Front of Afghanistan]].

In September 2022 [[2022 Kyrgyzstan–Tajikistan clashes|armed clashes]], including the use of artillery, erupted along most of the border between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
