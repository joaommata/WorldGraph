After a pause of 200 to 300 years, a new wave of exploration led to the discovery and settlement of New Zealand.]]

The first people to reach New Zealand were Polynesians in ocean going {{lang|mi|[[Waka (canoe)|waka]]}}, who are believed to have arrived in several waves between about 1280 and 1350. According to most [[Māori history|Māori oral traditions]], the islands were first discovered by the semi-legendary explorer [[Kupe]] while in pursuit of a giant octopus. These traditions hold that Kupe was followed by a great fleet of settlers, who set out from Hawaiki in eastern Polynesia around 1350. The existence of a single great fleet that settled New Zealand has since been superseded by the belief that the majority of settlement was a planned and deliberate event that occurred over several decades.

The exact date of this settlement is unclear, with recent sources favouring settlement in the 14th century. While [[mitochondrial DNA]] variability within Māori populations suggest that New Zealand was first settled between 1250 and 1300,{{sfn|Mein Smith|2005|p= 6}} no human remains, artefacts or structures can be reliably dated to earlier than the Kaharoa eruption of [[Mount Tarawera]] around 1314. This scenario is also consistent with a debated third line of oral evidence, traditional genealogies ({{Lang|mi|[[whakapapa]]}}) that point to around 1350 as a probable arrival date for several of the [[Māori migration canoes|migratory waka]] (canoes) from which many Māori trace their descent. Some Māori later migrated to the [[Chatham Islands]], where they developed their distinct [[Moriori]] culture; a later 1835 invasion by Māori [[iwi]] resulted in the massacre and virtual extinction of the Moriori.

In a hostile 1642 encounter between [[Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri]] and [[Abel Tasman]]'s crew,{{sfn|Mein Smith|2005|p=23}} four of Tasman's crew members were killed and at least one Māori was hit by [[canister shot]]. Europeans did not revisit New Zealand until 1769, when British explorer [[James Cook]] mapped almost the entire coastline.{{sfn|Mein Smith|2005|p=23}} Following Cook, New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American [[History of whaling|whaling]], [[Seal hunting|sealing]], and trading ships. They traded European food, metal tools, weapons, and other goods for timber, Māori food, artefacts, and water.{{sfn|King|2003|p=122}}

The introduction of the potato and the [[musket]] transformed Māori agriculture and warfare. Potatoes provided a reliable food surplus, which enabled longer and more sustained military campaigns. The resulting intertribal [[Musket Wars]] encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and 1840, killing 30,000–40,000 Māori. From the early 19th century, Christian [[Missionary|missionaries]] began to settle New Zealand, eventually [[Religious conversion|converting]] most of the Māori population. The Māori population declined to around 40% of its pre-contact level during the 19th century; introduced diseases were the major factor.

The [[Resident minister|British Government]] appointed [[James Busby]] as British Resident to New Zealand in 1832. His duties, given to him by Governor Bourke in Sydney, were to protect settlers and traders "of good standing", prevent "outrages" against Māori, and apprehend escaped convicts. In 1835, following an announcement of impending French settlement by [[Charles de Thierry]], the nebulous [[United Tribes of New Zealand]] sent a [[Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand|Declaration of Independence]] to King [[William IV of the United Kingdom]] asking for protection. The [[Treaty of Waitangi]] was first signed in the [[Bay of Islands]] on 6 February 1840. In response to the New Zealand Company's attempts to establish an independent settlement in [[Wellington]], Hobson declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand on 21 May 1840, even though copies of the treaty were still circulating throughout the country for Māori to sign. With the signing of the treaty and declaration of sovereignty, the number of immigrants, particularly from the United Kingdom, began to increase.

New Zealand was administered as a dependency of the [[Colony of New South Wales]] until becoming a separate [[Crown colony]], the [[Colony of New Zealand]], on 3 May 1841. Armed conflict began between the colonial government and Māori in 1843 with the [[Wairau Affray]] over land and disagreements over sovereignty. These conflicts, mainly in the North Island, saw thousands of imperial troops and the Royal Navy come to New Zealand and became known as the [[New Zealand Wars]]. Following these armed conflicts, large areas of [[New Zealand land confiscations|Māori land were confiscated by the government]] to meet settler demands.

The colony gained a [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852|representative government in 1852]], and the [[1st New Zealand Parliament|first Parliament]] met in 1854. In 1856 the colony effectively became self-governing, gaining responsibility over all domestic matters, except [[Indigenous peoples|native]] policy, which was granted in the mid-1860s. Wellington was chosen for its central location, with Parliament officially sitting there for the first time in 1865.

In 1886, New Zealand annexed the volcanic [[Kermadec Islands]], about {{cvt|1000|km}} northeast of Auckland. Since 1937, the islands are uninhabited except for about six people at [[Raoul Island]] station. These islands put the northern border of New Zealand at 29 degrees South latitude. After the 1982 [[UNCLOS]], the islands contributed significantly to New Zealand's [[Exclusive economic zone of New Zealand|exclusive economic zone]].

In 1891, the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] came to power as the first organised political party. The [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal Government]], led by [[Richard Seddon]] for most of its period in office, passed many important social and economic measures. In 1893, New Zealand was the first nation in the world to grant all [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand|women the right to vote]] The Liberals also guaranteed a minimum wage in 1894, a world first.

In 1907, at the request of the New Zealand Parliament, King [[Edward VII]] proclaimed New Zealand a [[Dominion of New Zealand|Dominion]] within the [[British Empire]], reflecting its self-governing status. In 1947, New Zealand [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947|adopted]] the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], confirming that the [[British Parliament]] could no longer legislate for the country without its consent. The British government's residual legislative powers were later removed by the [[Constitution Act 1986]], and final rights of appeal to British courts were abolished in 2003. and suffering through the [[Great Depression]]. The depression led to the election of the [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|first Labour Government]] and the establishment of a comprehensive [[welfare state]] and a [[protectionist]] economy. New Zealand experienced increasing prosperity following the Second World War, and Māori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work. A [[Māori protest movement]] developed, which criticised [[Eurocentrism]] and worked for greater recognition of [[Māori culture]] and of the Treaty of Waitangi. In 1975, the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty, and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985. although [[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy|Māori claims to the foreshore and seabed]] proved controversial in the 2000s.
