===Prehistory===
{{further|Prehistory of the Levant}}
The [[Ubeidiya prehistoric site]] in northern Israel shows the [[Early expansions of hominins out of Africa|presence of archaic humans]] around 1.5 million years ago. The second-oldest evidence of [[anatomically modern human]]s [[Recent African origin of modern humans|outside Africa]] is a 200,000-year-old fossil from [[Misliya Cave]] on Mount Carmel. The [[Natufian culture]] ({{circa}} 10,000 BCE) may be linked to the [[Proto-Afroasiatic language]] and is notable for adopting [[sedentism]] before the [[Origins of agriculture in West Asia|advent of agriculture]] and the [[Neolithic Revolution]].

===Bronze and Iron Ages===
{{Main|History of ancient Israel and Judah}}
[[File:Ruins atop Tel Megiddo with circular altar-like shrine and a series of temples on top of the other dating from the early bronze-age through the iron-age periods, Tel Meggido, Israel (19888642855).jpg|thumb|[[Tel Megiddo]], the ruins of a Canaanite and later Israelite city]]
Early references to "[[Canaan]]" and "Canaanites" appear in ancient [[Ancient Near East|Near Eastern]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] texts ({{Circa}} 2000 BCE); these populations were structured as politically independent [[city-state]]s. During the [[Late Bronze Age]] (1550–1200 BCE), large parts of Canaan formed [[vassal state]]s of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. As a result of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]], Canaan fell into chaos, and Egyptian control over the region collapsed. Ancestors of the [[Israelites]] are thought to have included [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] native to this area.{{rp|78–79}} Modern archaeological accounts suggest that the Israelites and their culture branched out of the Canaanite peoples through the development of a distinct [[Monolatry|monolatristic]]—and later [[Monotheism|monotheistic]]—religion centered on [[Yahweh]]. They spoke an archaic form of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], known as [[Biblical Hebrew]]. Around the same time, the [[Philistines]] settled on the southern [[Israeli coastal plain|coastal plain]].{{sfn|Killebrew|2005|p=230}}{{sfn|Shahin|2005|p=6}}

Most modern scholars agree that the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] narrative in the [[Torah]] and [[Old Testament]] did not take place as depicted; however, some elements of these traditions do have [[Historicity of the Bible|historical roots]]. There is debate about the earliest existence of the [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Kingdoms of Israel and Judah]] and their extent and power. While it is unclear if there was a [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Kingdom of Israel]], historians and archaeologists agree that the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] existed by {{Abbr|ca.|circa}} 900 BCE{{rp|169–195}} and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] by {{Abbr|ca.|circa}} 850 BCE. The Kingdom of Israel was the more prosperous of the two and soon developed into a regional power, with a capital at [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]]; during the [[Omrides|Omride dynasty]], it controlled [[Samaria]], [[Galilee]], the upper [[Jordan Valley]], the [[Sharon plain|plain of Sharon]] and large parts of [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]]. The Kingdom of Judah, under [[Davidic line|Davidic]] rule with its capital in [[Jerusalem]], later became a [[client state]] of first the Neo-Assyrian Empire and then the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]. It is estimated that [[Demographic history of Palestine (region)|the region's population]] was around 400,000 in the [[Iron Age II]]. In 587/6 BCE, following a [[Judah's revolts against Babylon|revolt in Judah]], King [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|besieged and destroyed Jerusalem]] and [[Solomon's Temple]], dissolved the kingdom and [[Babylonian captivity|exiled much of the Judean elite to Babylon]].

=== Classical antiquity ===
{{Main|Second Temple period}}
After [[Fall of Babylon|capturing Babylon]] in 539 BCE, [[Cyrus the Great]], founder of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], issued [[Edict of Cyrus|a proclamation]] allowing the exiled Judean population to return. The construction of the [[Second Temple]] was completed {{Circa|520 BCE}}. In 332 BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the region as part of his [[Wars of Alexander the Great|campaign against the Achaemenid Empire]]. After his death, the area was controlled by the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] and [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] empires as a part of [[Coele-Syria]]. Under the Hellenistic kingdoms, ongoing [[Hellenization]] generated cultural tensions among the Jewish population that culminated under [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]], whose decrees outlawed Jewish practices and triggered the [[Maccabean Revolt]] in 167 BCE. The revolt weakened Seleucid control over Judea; by 142/141 BCE the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmoneans]] had secured autonomy and soon established an [[Hasmonean Judea|independent Jewish kingdom]] that, in the late 2nd–early 1st century BCE, expanded into neighboring territories.

[[File:Israel-2013-Aerial 21-Masada.jpg|thumb|upright|View of the [[Masada]] fortress overlooking the [[Dead Sea]], which is the location of a [[Siege of Masada|1st-century Roman siege]]]]
The [[Roman Republic]] invaded the region in 63 BCE, first [[Third Mithridatic War|taking control of Syria]], and then intervening in the [[Hasmonean civil war]]. [[Roman–Parthian Wars|The struggle]] between pro-Roman and pro-[[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] factions in Judea led to the installation of [[Herod the Great]] as a [[Herodian dynasty|dynastic vassal]] of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. In 6 CE, the area was annexed as the [[Judaea (Roman province)|Roman province of Judaea]]; tensions with Roman rule led to a series of [[Jewish–Roman wars]], resulting in widespread destruction. The [[First Jewish–Roman War]] (66–73 CE) resulted in the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple]] and a sizable portion of the population being killed or displaced.

A second uprising known as the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] (132–136 CE) initially allowed the Jews to form an independent state, but the Romans brutally crushed the rebellion, devastating and depopulating Judea's countryside. Jerusalem was rebuilt as a [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colony]] ([[Aelia Capitolina]]), and the province of Judea was renamed [[Syria Palaestina]]. Jews were expelled from the districts surrounding Jerusalem. Nevertheless, there was a continuous small Jewish presence, and Galilee became its religious center.

=== Late antiquity and the medieval period ===
{{further|Byzantine Palestine|Bilad al-Sham|Kingdom of Jerusalem}}
[[File:Ruins of the Ancient Synagogue at Bar'am.jpg|thumb|3rd-century [[Kfar Bar'am synagogue]] in the Galilee]]
During the [[Byzantine Palestine|Byzantine period]], [[Early Christianity]] displaced [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman paganism]] in the 4th century CE, with [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] embracing and promoting the Christian religion and [[Theodosius I]] making it [[Christianity as the Roman state religion|the state religion]]. A series of laws were passed that discriminated against Jews and Judaism, and Jews were persecuted by both the church and the authorities. Many Jews had emigrated to flourishing [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] communities, while locally there was both Christian immigration and local conversion. By the middle of the 5th century, there was a Christian majority. Towards the end of the 5th century, [[Samaritan revolts]] erupted, continuing until the late 6th century and resulting in a large decrease in the Samaritan population. After the [[Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem]] and the short-lived [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius]] in 614 CE, the Byzantine Empire [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628|reconsolidated control of the area]] in 628.

In 634–641 CE, the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|conquered the Levant]]. Caliph [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] ({{Reign|634|644}}) lifted the Christian ban on Jews entering [[Jerusalem]] and permitted them to worship there. Over the next six centuries, control of the region transferred between the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]], [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]], and [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] caliphates, and subsequently the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] and [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] dynasties. The population drastically decreased during the following several centuries, dropping from an estimated 1 million during Roman and Byzantine periods to about 300,000 by the early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman period]], and there was steady [[Arabization|Arabisation]] and [[Islamization|Islamisation]]. The end of the 11th century brought the [[Crusades]], [[Pope|papally]]-sanctioned incursions of Christian crusaders intent on wresting Jerusalem and the [[Holy Land]] from Muslim control and establishing [[crusader states]]. The Ayyubids pushed back the crusaders before Muslim rule was fully restored by the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk sultans of Egypt]] in 1291.

=== Modern period and the emergence of Zionism ===
{{main|Jerusalem Sanjak|Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem}}
{{further|Old Yishuv|Zionism}}
[[File:Jews at Western Wall by Felix Bonfils, 1870s.jpg|thumb|Jews at the [[Western Wall]] in the 1870s]]
In 1516, the Ottoman Empire conquered the region and ruled it as part of [[Ottoman Syria]]. Under the Ottoman Empire, the Levant was fairly cosmopolitan, with religious freedoms for [[People of the Book|Christians, Muslims, and Jews]]. In 1561 the [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Ottoman sultan]] invited [[Sephardic Jews]] escaping the [[Spanish Inquisition]] to settle in and rebuild the city of [[Tiberias]].

Under the Ottoman Empire's [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]], Christians and Jews were considered ''[[dhimmi]]'' ("protected") under [[Ottoman law]] in exchange for loyalty to the state and payment of the ''[[jizya]]'' tax. Non-Muslim Ottoman subjects faced geographic and lifestyle restrictions, though these were not always enforced. The millet system organised non-Muslims into autonomous communities on the basis of religion.

[[File:THEODOR HERZL AT THE FIRST ZIONIST CONGRESS IN BASEL ON 25.8.1897. תאודור הרצל בקונגרס הציוני הראשון - 1897.8.25.jpg|thumb|The [[First Zionist Congress]] (1897) in [[Basel]], Switzerland]]
The [[Return to Zion|concept of an eventual return to Zion]] remained a symbol within religious Jewish belief which emphasised that their return should be determined by [[Divine providence in Judaism|Divine Providence]] rather than human action.{{sfn|Avineri|2017}} The Jewish population of Palestine from the Ottoman rule to the beginning of the Zionist movement, known as the [[Old Yishuv]], comprised a minority and fluctuated in size. During the 16th century, Jewish communities struck roots in the [[Four Holy Cities]]—Jerusalem, Tiberias, [[Hebron]], and [[Safed]]—and in 1697, Rabbi Yehuda Hachasid led 1,500 Jews to Jerusalem. A 1660 [[Druze power struggle (1658–1667)#Lebanon and Galilee campaign|Druze revolt]] against the Ottomans destroyed [[1660 destruction of Safed|Safed]] and [[1660 destruction of Tiberias|Tiberias]].

In the late 18th century, local Arab Sheikh [[Zahir al-Umar]] created a de facto independent emirate in the Galilee. Ottoman attempts to subdue the sheikh failed. After Zahir's death the Ottomans regained control of the area. In 1799, governor [[Jazzar Pasha]] repelled an [[Siege of Acre (1799)|assault on Acre]] by [[Napoleon]]'s troops, prompting the French to abandon the Syrian campaign. In 1834, a [[Peasants' revolt in Palestine|revolt by Palestinian Arab peasants]] against Egyptian conscription and taxation policies under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] was suppressed; Muhammad Ali's army retreated and Ottoman rule was restored with British support in 1840. The [[Tanzimat]] reforms were implemented across the Ottoman Empire.

The first wave of modern Jewish migration to [[Southern Syria|Ottoman-ruled Palestine]], known as the [[First Aliyah]], began in 1881, as Jews fled [[pogrom]]s in Eastern Europe. The 1882 [[May Laws]] increased economic discrimination against Jews, and restricted where they could live. In response, political [[Zionism]] took form, a movement that sought to establish a [[Jewish state]] in Palestine, thus offering a solution to the [[Jewish question]] of the European states.{{sfn|Herzl|1946|p=11}}{{better source needed|date=September 2024}} Antisemitism, pogroms and official policies in tsarist Russia led to the emigration of three million Jews in the years between 1882 and 1914, only 1% of whom went to Palestine. Those who went to Palestine were driven primarily by ideas of self-determination and Jewish identity, rather than as a response to pogroms or economic insecurity.{{sfn|Avineri|2017}}

The [[Second Aliyah]] (1904–1914) began after the [[Kishinev pogrom]]; some 40,000 Jews settled in Palestine, although nearly half left eventually. Both the first and second waves of migrants were mainly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]]. The Second Aliyah included [[Labor Zionism|Zionist socialist]] groups who established the ''[[kibbutz]]'' movement based on the idea of establishing a separate Jewish economy based exclusively on Jewish labour.{{sfn|Romano|2003|p=30}} Those of the Second Aliyah who became leaders of the [[Yishuv]] in the coming decades believed that the Jewish settler economy should not depend on Arab labour. This would be a dominant source of antagonism with the Arab population, with the new Yishuv's nationalist ideology overpowering its socialist one. Though the immigrants of the Second Aliyah largely sought to create communal Jewish agricultural settlements, [[Tel Aviv]] was established as the first planned Jewish town in 1909. Jewish armed militias emerged during this period, the first being [[Bar-Giora (organization)|Bar-Giora]] in 1907. Two years later, the larger [[Hashomer]] organisation was founded as its replacement.

=== British Mandate for Palestine ===
{{main|Mandatory Palestine}}
{{further|Yishuv|Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine|1948 Palestine war}}
{{see also|Jewish land purchase in Palestine}}

[[Chaim Weizmann]]'s efforts to garner British support for the Zionist movement eventually secured the [[Balfour Declaration]] of 1917, stating Britain's support for the creation of a Jewish "[[Homeland for the Jewish people|national home]]" in Palestine. Weizmann's interpretation of the declaration was that negotiations on the future of the country were to happen directly between Britain and the Jews, excluding Arabs. [[Islamic–Jewish relations|Jewish-Arab relations]] in Palestine deteriorated dramatically in the following years.

In 1918, the [[Jewish Legion]], primarily Zionist volunteers, assisted in the British [[Sinai and Palestine campaign|conquest of Palestine]]. In 1920, the territory was divided between Britain and France under the [[League of Nations mandate|mandate system]], and the British-administered area (including modern Israel) was named [[Mandatory Palestine]]. Arab opposition to British rule and Jewish immigration led to the [[1920 Nebi Musa riots|1920 Palestine riots]] and the formation of a Jewish militia known as the [[Haganah]] as an outgrowth of Hashomer, from which the [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] paramilitaries later split. In 1922, the [[League of Nations]] granted Britain the [[Mandate for Palestine]] under terms which included the Balfour Declaration with its promise to the Jews and with similar provisions regarding the Arab Palestinians. The [[Demographic history of Palestine (region)|population of the area]] was predominantly Arab and Muslim, with Jews accounting for about 11% and Arab Christians about 9.5% of the population.
[[File:"Jews and Arabs in Grim Struggle for Holy Land" article (1938).jpg|thumb|"Jews and Arabs in Grim Struggle for Holy Land", article from 1938]]

The [[Third Aliyah|Third]] (1919–1923) and [[Fourth Aliyah]]s (1924–1929) brought an additional 100,000 Jews to Palestine. The [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|rise of Nazism]] and the increasing persecution of Jews in 1930s Europe led to the [[Fifth Aliyah]], with an influx of a quarter of a million Jews. This was a major cause of the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab revolt of 1936–39]], which was suppressed by British security forces and Zionist militias. Several hundred British security personnel and Jews were killed; 5,032 Arabs were killed, 14,760 wounded, and 12,622 detained. An estimated ten percent of the adult male [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arab]] population was killed, wounded, imprisoned, or exiled.

The British introduced restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine with the [[White Paper of 1939]]. With countries around the world turning away Jewish refugees fleeing [[the Holocaust]], a clandestine movement known as [[Aliyah Bet]] was organised to bring Jews to Palestine. By the end of [[World War II]], 31% of the population of Palestine was Jewish. The UK found itself facing a [[Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine|Jewish insurgency]] over immigration restrictions and continued conflict with the Arab community over limit levels. The Haganah joined Irgun and Lehi in an armed struggle against British rule.{{sfn|Fraser|2004|p=27}} The Haganah attempted to bring tens of thousands of Jewish refugees and [[Holocaust survivors]] to Palestine by ship. Most of the ships were intercepted by the [[Royal Navy]] and the refugees placed in detention camps in [[Atlit detainee camp|Atlit]] and [[Cyprus internment camps|Cyprus]].

On 22 July 1946, Irgun [[King David Hotel bombing|bombed the British administrative headquarters]] for Palestine, killing 91. The attack was a response to [[Operation Agatha]] (a series of raids, including one on the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]], by the British) and was the deadliest directed at the British during the Mandate era. The Report of the Committee [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|proposed a plan]] to replace the British Mandate with "an independent Arab State, an independent Jewish State, and the City of Jerusalem [...] the last to be under an International Trusteeship System".

Meanwhile, the Jewish insurgency continued and peaked in July 1947, with a series of widespread guerrilla raids culminating in [[the Sergeants affair]], in which the Irgun took two British sergeants hostage as attempted leverage against the planned execution of three Irgun operatives. After the executions were carried out, the Irgun killed the two British soldiers, hanged their bodies from trees, and left a booby trap at the scene which injured a British soldier. The incident caused widespread outrage in the UK. In September 1947, the British cabinet decided to evacuate Palestine as the Mandate was no longer tenable.

[[File:UN Palestine Partition Versions 1947.jpg|thumb|upright|[[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|UN Map]], "Palestine plan of partition with economic union"]]

On 29 November 1947, the General Assembly adopted [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|Resolution 181 (II)]]. The plan attached to the resolution was essentially that proposed in the report of 3 September. The Jewish Agency, the recognised representative of the Jewish community, accepted the plan, which assigned 55–56% of Mandatory Palestine to the Jews. At the time, the Jews were about a third of the population and owned around 6–7% of the land. Arabs constituted the majority and owned about 20% of the land, with the remainder held by the Mandate authorities or foreign landowners.

The [[Arab League]] and [[Arab Higher Committee]] of Palestine rejected the partition plan on the basis that the partition plan privileged European interests over those of the Palestinians, and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|pp=40–41}} On 1 December 1947, the Arab Higher Committee proclaimed a three-day strike, and [[1947 Jerusalem riots|riots broke out in Jerusalem]]. The situation spiralled into [[1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine|a civil war]]. Colonial Secretary [[Arthur Creech Jones]] announced that the British Mandate would end on 15 May 1948, at which point the British would evacuate. As Arab militias and gangs attacked Jewish areas, they were faced mainly by the Haganah as well as the smaller Irgun and Lehi. In April 1948, the Haganah moved onto the offensive.{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=77–78}}

On 14 May 1948, the day before the expiration of the British Mandate, [[David Ben-Gurion]], the head of the Jewish Agency, [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|declared "the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel"]]. The following day, the armies of four Arab countries—Egypt, Syria, Transjordan, and Iraq—entered what had been Mandatory Palestine, launching the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]];{{sfn|Ben-Sasson|1985|p=1058}} contingents from [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen|Yemen]], [[Morocco]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Sudan]] joined the war.{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=205}} The purpose of the invasion was to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state. The Arab League stated the invasion was to restore order and prevent further bloodshed.

[[File:Raising the Ink Flag at Umm Rashrash (Eilat) (3x4).jpg|thumb|right|Raising of the [[Ink Flag]] on 10 March 1949, marking the end of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|1948 war]]]]

After a year of fighting, a [[1949 Armistice Agreements|ceasefire was declared]] and temporary borders, known as the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]], were established. [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordan annexed]] what became known as the [[West Bank]], including [[East Jerusalem]], and [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by the United Arab Republic|Egypt occupied]] the [[Gaza Strip]]. Over 700,000 Palestinians [[1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight|fled or were expelled]] by [[Zionist political violence|Zionist militias]] and the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli military]]—what would become known in Arabic as the {{lang|ar-Latn|[[Nakba]]}} ('catastrophe'). The events also led to the destruction of most of Palestine's Arab [[Culture of Palestine|culture]], [[Palestinian identity|identity]], and [[Palestinian nationalism|national aspirations]]. Some 156,000 Arabs remained and became [[Arab citizens of Israel]].

By [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 273]], Israel was admitted as a member of the UN on 11 May 1949. In the early years of the state, the [[Labor Zionism|Labour Zionist]] movement led by Prime Minister Ben-Gurion dominated [[Politics of Israel|Israeli politics]].{{sfn|Lustick|1988|pp=37–39}} Immigration to Israel during the late 1940s and early 1950s was aided by the Israeli Immigration Department and the non-government sponsored [[Mossad LeAliyah Bet]] ({{Abbr|lit.|literally|class=small}} "Institute for [[Aliyah Bet|Immigration B]]"). The latter engaged in clandestine operations in countries, particularly in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, where the lives of Jews were in danger and exit was difficult. Mossad LeAliyah Bet was disbanded in 1953. The immigration was in accordance with the [[One Million Plan]]. Some immigrants held Zionist beliefs or came for the promise of a better life, while others moved to escape persecution or were expelled from their homes.

An [[Aliyah#Early statehood (1948–1960)|influx of Holocaust survivors]] and [[Jewish exodus from the Muslim world|Jews from Arab and Muslim countries]] to Israel during the first three years increased the number of Jews from 700,000 to 1,400,000. By 1958, the population had risen to two million. Between 1948 and 1970, approximately 1,150,000 Jewish refugees relocated to Israel. Some immigrants arrived as refugees and were housed in temporary camps known as ''[[ma'abarot]]''; by 1952, over 200,000 people were living in these tent cities. [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jews of European background]] were often treated more favourably than Jews from [[Mizrahi Jews|Middle Eastern]] and [[Sephardi Jews|North African]] countries—housing units reserved for the latter were often re-designated for the former, so Jews newly arrived from Arab lands generally ended up staying longer in transit camps.{{sfn|Segev|2007|pp=155–157}} During this period, food, clothes and furniture were rationed in what became known as the [[Austerity in Israel|austerity period]]. The need to solve the crisis led Ben-Gurion to sign a [[Reparations Agreement between Israel and the Federal Republic of Germany|reparations agreement with West Germany]] that triggered mass protests by Jews angered at the idea that Israel could accept monetary compensation for the Holocaust.{{sfn|Shindler|2002|pp=49–50}}

==== Arab–Israeli conflict ====
{{Main|Arab–Israeli conflict}}

There were [[1949–1956 Palestinian expulsions|further expulsions of Palestinians]] after the establishment of Israel. During the 1950s, Israel was [[List of attacks against Israeli civilians before 1967|frequently attacked]] by [[Palestinian fedayeen]], nearly always against civilians, mainly from the Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip,{{sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=58}} leading to several Israeli [[reprisal operations]]. In 1956, the UK and France aimed at regaining control of the [[Suez Canal]], which Egypt had nationalised. The continued blockade of the Suez Canal and [[Straits of Tiran]] to Israeli shipping, together with increasing fedayeen attacks against Israel's southern population and recent Arab threatening statements, prompted Israel to attack Egypt. Israel joined [[Protocol of Sèvres|a secret alliance]] with the UK and France and overran the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in the [[Suez Crisis]] but was pressured to withdraw by the UN in return for guarantees of Israeli shipping rights. The war resulted in significant reduction of Israeli border infiltration.

[[File:1961-04-13 Tale Of Century - Eichmann Tried For War Crimes.ogv|thumb|U.S. newsreel on the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]]]]
In the early 1960s, Israel captured Nazi war criminal [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Argentina and brought him to Israel [[Eichmann trial|for trial]].{{sfn|Bascomb|2009|p=219–229}} Eichmann remains the only person executed in Israel by conviction in an Israeli civilian court. In 1963, Israel was engaged in a diplomatic standoff with the United States in relation to the Israeli [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|nuclear programme]].

Since 1964 Arab countries, concerned over Israeli plans to divert waters of the [[Jordan River]] into the [[Israeli coastal plain|coastal plain]], had been trying to divert the headwaters to deprive Israel of water resources, [[War over Water (Jordan River)|provoking tensions]] between Israel on the one hand, and Syria and Lebanon on the other. [[Arab nationalist]]s led by Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] refused to recognise Israel and called for its destruction. By 1966 Israeli-Arab relations had deteriorated to the point of battles taking place between Israeli and Arab forces.{{sfn|Segev|2007|p=178}}

In May 1967, Egypt massed its army near the border with Israel, expelled [[United Nations Emergency Force|UN peacekeepers stationed in the Sinai Peninsula]] since 1957, and blocked Israel's access to the Red Sea. Other Arab states mobilised their forces.{{sfn|Segev|2007|p=289}} Israel reiterated that these actions were a ''[[casus belli]]'' and launched a pre-emptive strike ([[Operation Focus]]) against Egypt in June. Jordan, Syria and Iraq attacked Israel.

[[File:Six Day War Territories.svg|thumb|Territory held by Israel: {{legend|#ffffd0|before the [[Six-Day War]]}} {{legend|#f7d3aa|after the war}} The [[Sinai Peninsula]] was returned to Egypt in 1982.]]

In the ensuing [[Six-Day War]], Israel captured and occupied the West Bank from Jordan, the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from Syria. Israeli forces [[Naksa|expelled ~300,000 Palestinians]] from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Jerusalem's boundaries were enlarged, incorporating [[East Jerusalem]]. The 1949 Green Line became the administrative boundary between Israel and the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]].{{sfn|Shlay|Rosen|2010|pp=362–363}}

Following the 1967 war and the "[[Khartoum Resolution|Three Nos]]" resolution of the Arab League, Israel faced attacks from the Egyptians in the Sinai Peninsula during the 1967–1970 [[War of Attrition]], and from Palestinian groups targeting Israelis in the occupied territories, globally, and in Israel. Most important among the Palestinian and Arab groups was the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|Palestine Liberation Organisation]] (PLO), established in 1964, which initially committed itself to "armed struggle as the only way to liberate the homeland". In the late 1960s and early 1970s, [[Palestinian political violence|Palestinian groups launched attacks]] against Israeli and Jewish targets around the world, including [[Munich massacre|a massacre of Israeli athletes]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich. The Israeli government responded with an [[Mossad assassinations following the Munich massacre|assassination campaign]] against the organisers of the massacre, [[1972 Israeli air raid in Syria and Lebanon|a bombing]] and a [[1973 Israeli raid in Lebanon|raid on the PLO headquarters in Lebanon]].

On 6 October 1973, the Egyptian and Syrian armies launched [[Operation Badr (1973)|a surprise attack]] against Israeli forces in the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights, opening the [[Yom Kippur War]]. The war ended on 25 October with Israel repelling Egyptian and Syrian forces but suffering great losses. An [[Agranat Commission|internal inquiry]] exonerated [[Fifteenth government of Israel|the government]] of responsibility for failures before and during the war, but public anger forced Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] to resign.{{better source needed|date=February 2023}} In July 1976, an airliner was hijacked in flight from Israel to France by Palestinian guerrillas; Israeli commandos [[Operation Entebbe|rescued 102 of 106 Israeli hostages]].

==== Peace process ====
{{main|Israeli–Palestinian peace process}}
The [[1977 Israeli legislative election|1977 Knesset elections]] marked a major turning point in Israeli political history as [[Menachem Begin]]'s [[Likud]] party took control from the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labour Party]]. Later that year, Egyptian President [[Anwar El Sadat]] made a trip to Israel and spoke before the [[Knesset]] in what was the first recognition of Israel by an Arab head of state.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|pp=171–174}} Sadat and Begin signed the [[Camp David Accords]] (1978) and the [[Egypt–Israel peace treaty]] (1979).{{sfn|Bregman|2002|pp=186–187}} In return, Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula and agreed to enter negotiations over autonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|pp=186–187}}

On 11 March 1978, a PLO guerilla raid from Lebanon led to the [[Coastal Road massacre]]. Israel responded by launching an [[1978 South Lebanon conflict|invasion of southern Lebanon]] to destroy PLO bases. Begin's government meanwhile provided incentives for [[Israeli settlement|Israelis to settle]] in the [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|occupied West Bank]], increasing friction with the Palestinians there.

The 1980 [[Jerusalem Law]] was believed by some to reaffirm Israel's 1967 annexation of Jerusalem by government decree and [[UN Security Council Resolution 478|reignited international controversy]] over the [[Status of Jerusalem|status of the city]]. No Israeli legislation has defined the territory of Israel, and no act specifically included East Jerusalem therein. In 1981 Israel [[Golan Heights Law|effectively annexed]] the Golan Heights. The international community largely rejected these moves, with the UN Security Council declaring both the Jerusalem Law and the Golan Heights Law null and void. Several waves of [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]] [[Aliyah from Ethiopia|immigrated to Israel]] since the 1980s, while between 1990 and 1994, [[1990s post-Soviet aliyah|immigration from the post-Soviet states]] increased Israel's population by twelve percent.

On 7 June 1981, during the [[Iran–Iraq War]], the [[Operation Opera|Israeli air force destroyed]] Iraq's sole nuclear reactor, then under construction, in order to impede the Iraqi nuclear weapons programme. Following a series of PLO attacks in 1982, Israel [[1982 Lebanon War|invaded Lebanon]] to destroy the PLO bases.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|p=199}} In the first six days, Israel destroyed the military forces of the PLO in Lebanon and decisively defeated the Syrians. An Israeli government inquiry (the [[Kahan Commission]]) held Begin and several Israeli generals indirectly responsible for the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] and held [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|defence minister]] [[Ariel Sharon]] as bearing "personal responsibility". Sharon was forced to resign.

In 1985, Israel responded to a Palestinian [[Larnaca yacht killings|terrorist attack in Cyprus]] by [[Operation Wooden Leg|bombing the PLO headquarters]] in Tunisia. Israel withdrew from most of Lebanon in 1986 but continued to [[Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon|occupy a borderland buffer zone]] in southern Lebanon until 2000, from where Israeli forces [[South Lebanon conflict (1985–2000)|engaged in conflict]] with [[Hezbollah]]. The [[First Intifada]], a Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule, broke out in 1987, with waves of uncoordinated demonstrations and violence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Over the following six years, the intifada became more organised and included economic and cultural measures aimed at disrupting the Israeli occupation. Over 1,000 people were killed. During the 1991 [[Gulf War]], the PLO supported [[Saddam Hussein]] and Iraqi missile [[Iraqi rocket attacks on Israel|attacks against Israel]]. Despite public outrage, Israel heeded American calls to refrain from hitting back.{{sfn |Mowlana |Gerbner |Schiller |1992 |p=111}}

In 1992, [[Yitzhak Rabin]] became prime minister following [[1992 Israeli legislative election|an election]] in which his party called for compromise with Israel's neighbours.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|p=236}} The following year, [[Shimon Peres]] on behalf of Israel and [[Yasser Arafat]] for the PLO signed the [[Oslo Accords]], which gave the [[Palestinian Authority|Palestinian National Authority]] (PNA) the right to govern [[West Bank areas in the Oslo II Accord|parts of the West Bank]] and the Gaza Strip. The PLO also [[Israel–Palestine Liberation Organization letters of recognition|recognised Israel's right to exist]] and pledged an end to terrorism.{{sfn|Tessler|2009|p=729}} In 1994, the [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]] was signed, making Jordan the second Arab country to normalise relations with Israel. Arab public support for the Accords was damaged by the continuation of Israeli settlements and [[Israeli checkpoint|checkpoints]], and the deterioration of economic conditions. Israeli public support for the Accords waned after [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks|Palestinian suicide attacks]]. In November 1995, Rabin [[assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|was assassinated]] by [[Yigal Amir]], a far-right Jew who opposed the Accords.

During [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s premiership at the end of the 1990s, Israel [[Protocol Concerning the Redeployment in Hebron|agreed to withdraw]] from [[Hebron]],{{sfn|Bregman|2002|p=257}} though this was never ratified or implemented, and he signed the [[Wye River Memorandum]]. The agreement dealt with further redeployments in the West Bank and security issues. The memorandum was criticised by major international human rights organisations for its "encouragement" of human rights abuses.
[[Ehud Barak]], [[1999 Israeli general election|elected]] prime minister in 1999, withdrew forces from southern Lebanon and conducted negotiations with PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat and U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] at the [[2000 Camp David Summit]]. Barak offered a plan for the establishment of a [[Palestinian state]], including the entirety of the Gaza Strip and over 90% of the West Bank with Jerusalem as a shared capital.{{sfn|Gelvin|2005|p=240}} Each side blamed the other for the failure of the talks.

In late 2000, after a controversial visit by Sharon to the [[Temple Mount]], the [[Second Intifada]] began. The popular uprising faced disproportionate repression from the Israeli state. [[Palestinian suicide attacks|Palestinian suicide bombings]] eventually developed into a recurrent feature of the intifada. Some commentators contend that the intifada was pre-planned by Arafat after the collapse of peace talks. Sharon became prime minister in a [[2001 Israeli prime ministerial election|2001 election]]; he carried out his plan to [[Israeli disengagement from the Gaza Strip|unilaterally withdraw]] from the Gaza Strip and spearheaded the construction of the [[West Bank barrier]], ending the intifada. Between 2000 and 2008, 1,063 Israelis, 5,517 Palestinians and 64 foreign citizens were killed.

In July 2006, a Hezbollah artillery assault on Israel's northern border communities and a [[2006 Hezbollah cross-border raid|cross-border abduction]] of two Israeli soldiers precipitated the month-long [[2006 Lebanon War|Second Lebanon War]], including an Israeli invasion of Lebanon. The war wound down in August 2006 after the passage of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701]]; Israeli forces mostly withdrew from Lebanon by October 2006 but continued to occupy the Lebanese portion of [[Ghajar]] village. In 2007 the Israeli Air Force [[Operation Outside the Box|destroyed a nuclear reactor]] in Syria.

{{Main|Gaza–Israel conflict}}

In 2008, [[2008 Israel–Hamas ceasefire|a ceasefire]] between [[Hamas]] and Israel collapsed, resulting in the three-week [[Gaza War (2008–2009)|Gaza War]]. In what Israel described as a response to [[List of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel in 2012|over a hundred Palestinian rocket attacks]] on southern Israeli cities, Israel began [[2012 Gaza War|an operation in the Gaza Strip]] in 2012, lasting eight days. Israel started another [[2014 Gaza War|operation in Gaza]] following an escalation of rocket attacks by Hamas in July 2014. In May 2021, another [[2021 Israel–Palestine crisis|round of fighting]] took place in Gaza and Israel, lasting eleven days. By the 2010s, [[Arab–Israeli alliance|increasing regional cooperation]] between Israel and [[Arab League]] countries have been established, culminating in the signing of the [[Abraham Accords]]. The Israeli security situation shifted from the traditional [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] towards the [[Iran–Israel proxy conflict]] and [[Iran–Israel conflict during the Syrian civil war|direct confrontation with Iran during the Syrian civil war]].

On 7 October 2023, Palestinian militant groups from Gaza, led by Hamas, launched [[7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel|a series of coordinated attacks]] on Israel, leading to the start of the [[Gaza war]]. On that day, approximately 1,300 Israelis, predominantly civilians, were killed in communities near the Gaza Strip border and [[Re'im music festival massacre|during a music festival]]. [[Gaza war hostage crisis|Over 200 hostages]] were kidnapped and taken to the Gaza Strip. Studies modeling trauma exposure and assessing mental health outcomes estimated that approximately 5.3% of Israelis may develop PTSD, with national data showing that probable PTSD nearly doubled from 16.2% to 29.8% and rates of anxiety and depression also rising sharply.

After clearing militants from its territory, Israel launched [[Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip|one of the most destructive bombing campaigns in modern history]] and [[Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip|invaded Gaza]] on 27 October with the stated objectives of destroying Hamas and freeing hostages. The fifth war of the [[Gaza–Israel conflict]] since 2008, it has been the deadliest for Palestinians in the entire [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] and the most significant military engagement in the region since the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973. A [[Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People|United Nations Special Committee]], [[South Africa's genocide case against Israel|multiple governments]], and various experts and human rights organisations have concluded that Israel is committing [[Gaza genocide|genocide against the Palestinian people]] due to the harm and loss of life inflicted on civilians during the [[Gaza war|Gaza War]].

In April 2024, Israel initiated a wave of airstrikes to Iran, after Iranian strikes targeted Israel. In October 2024, Israel [[2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon|invaded Lebanon]] and exchanged missile barrages with Iran three weeks later, in response of Iranian strikes earlier in that month. After nearly a year of the [[Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present)|Israel–Hezbollah conflict]] from October 2023 due to Hezbollah shooting rockets at Israel to support Hamas in Gaza, Israel [[2024 Hezbollah headquarters strike|assassinated]] Hezbollah secretary general [[Hassan Nasrallah]] in September 2024. A November 2024 [[2024 Israel–Lebanon ceasefire agreement|ceasefire agreement]] instructed Israel to withdraw from Lebanon, which Israel mostly did by February 2025, but against the agreement Israeli forces stayed in five military outposts on highlands in Southern Lebanon. In June 2025, Israel launched a renewed series of missile strikes on Iran, which escalated into an [[Iran–Israel war|armed conflict]].
