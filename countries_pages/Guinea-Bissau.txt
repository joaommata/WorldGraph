{{Main|History of Guinea-Bissau}}

=== Pre-European contact ===

The deep history of what is now Guinea-Bissau is poorly understood by historians. The earliest inhabitants were the [[Jola people|Jola]], [[Papel people|Papel]], [[Manjak people|Manjak]], [[Balanta people|Balanta]], and [[Biafada people|Biafada]] peoples.{{cn|date=September 2024}} Later the [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] and [[Fula people|Fulani]] migrated into the region, in the 13th and 15th centuries, respectively. They pushed the earlier inhabitants towards the coast and onto the [[Bijagos islands]].{{rp|20}}

The Balanta and Jola had weak or non-existent institutions of kingship but emphasised decentralization, with power invested in heads of villages and families.{{rp|64}} The Mandinka, Fula, Papel, Manjak, and Biafada chiefs were vassals to kings. The customs, rites, and ceremonies varied, but nobles commanded all the major positions, including the judicial system.{{rp|66–67, 73, 227}} Social stratification was seen in the clothing and accessories of the people, in housing materials, and in transportation options.{{rp|77–8}} Trade was widespread between ethnic groups. Items traded included pepper and kola nuts from the southern forests; kola nuts, iron, and iron utensils from the savannah-forest zone; salt and dried fish from the coast; and Mandinka cotton cloth.{{rp|4}}

==== Kingdom of Bissau ====
According to oral tradition, the Kingdom of [[Bissau]] was founded by the son of the king of Quinara (Guinala), who moved to the area with his pregnant sister, six wives, and subjects of his father's kingdom. Relations between the kingdom and the Portuguese colonisers were initially warm, but deteriorated over time.{{rp|55}} The kingdom strongly defended its sovereignty against the Portuguese 'Pacification Campaigns', defeating them in 1891, 1894, and 1904. However, in 1915 the Portuguese under the command of Officer [[João Teixeira Pinto|Teixeira Pinto]] and warlord [[Abdul Injai]] fully absorbed the kingdom.

==== Biafada kingdoms ====
The [[Biafada people]] inhabited the area around the [[Rio Grande de Buba]] in three kingdoms: [[Biguba]], [[Guinala]], and Bissege.{{rp|65}} The former two were important ports with significant [[lançado]] communities.{{rp|63, 211}} They were subjects of the Mandinka mansa of Kaabu.{{rp|211}}

==== Bijagos Islands ====
In the [[Bijagos Islands]], people of different ethnic origins tended to settle in separate settlements. Great cultural diversity developed in the archipelago.{{rp|24}}{{rp|52}}

Bijago society was warlike. Men were dedicated to boatbuilding and raiding the mainland, attacking the coastal peoples as well as other islands. They believed that at sea they had no king. Women cultivated the land, constructed houses, and gathered and prepared foods. They could choose their husbands, and warriors with the best reputations ranked at the top of respected status. Successful warriors could have many wives and boats, and were entitled to one third of the spoils gained by warriors who used their boats in any expedition.{{rp|204–205}}

Bijago night raids on coastal settlements had significant effects on the societies attacked. Portuguese traders on the mainland tried to stop the raids, as they hurt the local economy. But the islanders also sold considerable numbers of villagers captured in raids as slaves to the Europeans. With colonisation underway in other parts of Africa and the Americas, demand for workers was high and the Europeans sometimes pushed for more captives to be taken.{{rp|205}}

The Bijagos were mostly safe from enslavement, as they were out of reach of mainland slave raiders. Europeans avoided having them as slaves. Portuguese sources say the children made good slaves but not the adults, who were likely to commit [[suicide]], lead rebellions aboard slave ships, or escape once reaching the [[New World]].{{rp|218–219}}

==== Kaabu ====
[[File:African slave trade.png|thumbnail|upright=1.2|States in medieval Africa]]
{{Main|Kaabu}}

[[Kaabu]] was established first as a province of [[Mali Empire|Mali]] through the conquest in the 13th century of the [[Senegambia]] by [[Tiramakhan Traore]], a general under [[Sundiata Keita]]. By the 14th century much of Guinea Bissau was under the administration of Mali. It was ruled by a ''farim kaabu'' (commander of Kaabu).

Mali declined gradually, beginning in the 14th century. By the early 16th century, the expanding power of [[Koli Tenguella]] cut off formerly secure Mali.

Kaabu became an independent federation of kingdoms.{{rp|13}} The ruling classes were composed of elite warriors known as the ''Nyancho'' (Ñaanco) who traced their patrilineal lineage to Tiramakhan Traore.{{rp|2}} The Nyancho were a [[warrior culture]], reputed to be excellent cavalry men and raiders.{{rp|6}} The Kaabu Mansaba was seated in Kansala, today known as [[Gabu (town)|Gabu]], in the eastern [[Gabú region]].{{rp|4}}

The slave trade dominated the economy, and the warrior classes grew rich with imported cloth, beads, metalware, and firearms.{{rp|8}} Trade networks with Arabs and others to North Africa were dominant up to the 14th century. In the 15th century, coastal trade with the Europeans began to increase.{{rp|3}} In the 17th and 18th centuries an estimated 700 slaves were exported annually from the region, many of them from Kaabu.{{rp|5}}

In the late 18th century, the rise of the [[Imamate of Futa Jallon]] to the east posed a powerful challenge to the animist Kaabu. During the first half of the 19th century, civil war erupted as local [[Fula people]] sought independence.{{rp|5–6}} This long-running conflict was marked by the 1867 [[Battle of Kansala]]; the [[Fuladu]] effectively defeated the Kaabu and dominated the area thereafter. But some smaller Mandinka kingdoms survived until their absorption into Portuguese colonies.{{cn|date=July 2025}}

=== European contact ===
{{main|British Guinea|Portuguese Guinea}}
[[File:Lesser coat of arms of Portuguese Guinea.svg|thumb|Lesser coat of arms of Portuguese Guinea-Bissau]]

==== 15th–16th centuries ====
The first Europeans to reach Guinea-Bissau were the Venetian explorer [[Alvise Cadamosto]] in 1455, Portuguese explorer [[Diogo Gomes]] in 1456, Portuguese explorer [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira|Duarte Pacheco Pareira]] in the 1480s, and Flemish explorer [[Eustache de la Fosse]] in 1479–1480.{{rp|7, 12–13, 16}}

Although the Portuguese authorities initially discouraged European settlement on the mainland, this prohibition was ignored by ''[[lançados]]'' and ''tangomãos'', who largely assimilated into indigenous culture and customs.{{rp|140}} They ignored Portuguese trade regulations that banned entering the region or trading without a royal licence, shipping out of unauthorised ports, or assimilating into the native community.{{rp|142}}

After 1520 trade and settlements increased on the mainland, populated by Portuguese and native traders, as well as some Spanish, [[Genoa|Genoese]], English, French, and Dutch.{{rp|145, 150}} The main ports were [[Cacheu]], [[Bissau]], and [[Guinala]]. Each river also had such trading centers as [[Farim|Toubaboudougou]] at their fall lines, the furthest navigable point. These posts traded directly with the peoples of the interior for resources such as [[gum arabic]], [[ivory]], hides, [[civet]], dyes, enslaved Africans, and gold.{{rp|153–160}} Local African rulers generally refused to allow Europeans into the interior, to ensure their own control of trade routes and goods.

Disputes became increasingly frequent and serious in the late 1500s as the foreign traders sought to influence the host societies to their benefit.{{rp|74}} Meanwhile, the Portuguese monopoly, always leaky, was being increasingly challenged. In 1580 the [[Iberian Union]] unified the crowns of Portugal and [[Spain]]. Spain's enemies launched attacks on Portuguese possessions in Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde. French, Dutch, and English ships increasingly came to trade with the natives and the independent-minded ''lançados''.{{rp|244–253}}

==== 17th–18th centuries ====

In the early 17th century the government attempted to force all Guinean trade to go through [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]], and to promote trade and settlement on the mainland, while restricting the sale of weapons to the locals. These efforts were largely unsuccessful.{{rp|243–4}}

With the end of the Iberian Union in 1640, King [[John IV of Portugal|João IV]] attempted to restrict the Spanish trade in Guinea that had flourished for the previous 60 years. Afro-Portuguese traders and colonists, however, were not in a position to deny the free trade that the African kings demanded, as they had come to rely on European products and goods as necessities.{{rp|261–3}}

The Portuguese were never able to maintain the monopoly they wanted; the economic interests of the native leaders and Afro-European traders and merchants never aligned with theirs. During this period the power of the [[Mali Empire]] in the region was dissipating. The ''[[farim]]'' of [[Kaabu]], the king of [[Kasa kingdom|Kassa]], and other local rulers began to assert their independence.{{rp|488}}

[[File:Flag of the Casa da Guiné.svg|thumb|left|Flag of the Portuguese [[Company of Guinea]]]]

In the early 1700s the Portuguese abandoned [[Bissau]] and retreated to Cacheu after the captain-major was captured and killed by the local king. They did not return until the 1750s. Meanwhile, the [[Cacheu and Cape Verde Company]] shut down in 1706.{{rp|xliii}}

For a brief period in the 1790s, the British tried to establish a foothold on [[Bolama Island]].

==== Slave trade ====

Guinea-Bissau was among the first regions whose people engaged in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. For centuries its warriors had sent captives as slaves to North Africa. While it did not produce the same number of enslaved people to export to the Americas as other regions, the effects were still significant.

In Cape Verde, Guinean slaves were instrumental in developing the labor-intensive [[plantation]] economy: they cultivated and processed, growing [[indigo]] and [[cotton]], and also wove the panos cloth that became a standard currency in West Africa. During the 17th and 18th centuries, thousands of captive Africans were taken from the region every year by Portuguese, French, and British companies. An average of 3000 persons were shipped every year from [[Guinala]] alone.{{rp|278}} Many of these captives were taken during the [[Fula jihads]] and, specifically, the wars between the [[Imamate of Futa Jallon]] and [[Kaabu]].{{rp|377}}

Wars were increasingly waged for the sole purpose of capturing slaves to sell to the Europeans in exchange for imported goods. They resembled man-hunts more than conflicts over territory or political power.{{rp|204, 209}} The nobles and kings benefited, while the common people bore the brunt of the raiding and insecurity. If a noble was captured, they were likely to be released, as the captors, whoever they were, would generally accept a ransom in exchange for freeing them.{{rp|229}} The relationship between kings and European traders was a partnership, with the two regularly making deals on how the trade was to be conducted, defining who could be enslaved and who could not, and the prices of the slaves. Contemporary chroniclers questioned multiple kings on their part in the slave trade, and noted that they recognised the trade as evil but participated because otherwise the Europeans would not buy any other goods from them.{{rp|230–4}}

Beginning in the late 18th century, European countries gradually began slowing and/or abolishing the slave trade. Portugal abandoned slavery in 1869 and [[Brazil]] in 1888, but a system of [[contract labor]] replaced it that was only barely better for the workers.{{rp|377}}

===Colonialism===
[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913-v2.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]
Up until the late 1800s, Portuguese control of their 'colony' outside of their forts and trading posts was a fiction. Guinea-Bissau became the scene of increased European colonial competition beginning in the 1860s. The dispute over the status of [[Bolama (town)|Bolama]] was resolved in Portugal's favor through the mediation of U.S. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in 1870, but French encroachment on Portuguese claims continued. In 1886 the [[Casamance]] region of what is now [[Senegal]] was ceded to them.

===Struggle for independence===
[[File:LG&CD - Guine Barro Jagudis 11.jpg|thumb|[[Portuguese Colonial War]] in [[Portuguese Guinea]], 1968]]

The [[Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde|African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC) was founded in 1956 under the leadership of [[Amílcar Cabral]]. Initially committed to peaceful methods, the 1959 [[Pidjiguiti massacre]] pushed the party towards more militarized tactics, leaning heavily on the political mobilization of the peasantry in the countryside. After years of planning and preparing from their base in [[Conakry]], the PAIGC launched the [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence]] on 23 January 1963.{{rp|289}}

Unlike guerrilla movements in other [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonies]], the PAIGC rapidly extended its control over large portions of the territory. Aided by the jungle-like terrain, it had easy access to borders with neighbouring allies and large quantities of arms from [[Cuba]], [[China]], the [[Soviet Union]], and left-leaning African countries. The PAIGC even managed to acquire a significant anti-aircraft capability in order to defend itself against aerial attack.{{rp|289–90}} By 1973, the PAIGC was in control of many parts of Guinea, although the movement suffered a setback in January 1973 when its founder and leader [[Amilcar Cabral]] was assassinated. After Cabral's death, party leadership fell to [[Aristides Pereira]], who would later become the first president of the [[Republic of Cape Verde]].

=== Independence (1973–2000) ===
[[File:Hastear da bandeira da Guiné Bissau após o arrear da de Portugal.jpg|thumb|[[PAIGC]] forces raise the [[flag of Guinea-Bissau]] in 1974.]]

Independence was unilaterally declared on 24 September 1973, which is now celebrated as the country's Independence Day, a [[Public holidays in Guinea-Bissau|public holiday]]. The country was formally recognized as independent on 10 September 1974. [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]'s [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] was the first country to formally recognise Guinea-Bissau and the first to sign agreements with the [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]].

Upon the nation's independence, it declared "[[Esta É a Nossa Pátria Amada]]" as its national anthem. Until 1996, this was shared with [[Cape Verde]], which later adopted its own official national anthem "[[Cântico da Liberdade]]".

[[Luís Cabral]], brother of Amílcar and co-founder of PAIGC, was appointed the first [[president of Guinea-Bissau]]. Independence had begun under the best of auspices. The Bissau-Guinean diaspora had returned to the country en masse. A system of access to school for all had been created. Books were free and schools seemed to have a sufficient number of teachers.{{cn|date=July 2025}} The education of girls, previously neglected, was encouraged and a new school calendar, more adapted to the rural world, was adopted.

In 1980, economic conditions deteriorated significantly, leading to general discontent with the government in power. On 14 November 1980, [[João Bernardo Vieira]], known as "Nino Vieira", overthrew President Luís Cabral. The constitution was suspended and a nine-member Military Council of the Revolution, chaired by Vieira, was established. Since then, the country has moved toward a liberal economy. Budget cuts have been made at the expense of the social sector and education.

The country was controlled by the military council until 1984. The first multi-party [[1994 Guinea-Bissau general election|elections]] were held in 1994. An army uprising in May 1998 led to the [[Guinea-Bissau Civil War]] and the president's ousting in June 1999. Elections were held again in 2000, and [[Kumba Ialá]] was elected president.

===21st century===
In September 2003, a military coup was conducted. The military arrested Ialá on the charge of being "unable to solve the problems". After being delayed several times, [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2004|legislative elections]] were held in March 2004. A mutiny in October 2004 over pay arrears resulted in the death of the head of the armed forces.

In June 2005, [[2005 Guinea-Bissau presidential election|presidential elections]] were held for the first time since the coup that deposed Ialá. Ialá returned as the candidate for the PRS, claiming to be the legitimate president of the country, but the election was won by former president [[João Bernardo Vieira]], deposed in the 1999 coup. Vieira beat [[Malam Bacai Sanhá]] in a run-off election. Sanhá initially refused to concede, claiming that [[electoral fraud|tampering]] and electoral fraud occurred in two [[constituencies]] including the capital, Bissau. [[Election monitoring|Foreign monitors]] described the elections as "calm and organized", despite some reports of arms entering the country prior to the election and few "disturbances during campaigning", including attacks on government offices by unidentified gunmen.

Three years later, Sanhá's PAIGC won a strong parliamentary majority, with 67 of 100 seats, in the parliamentary election held in November 2008. In November 2008, President Vieira's official residence was attacked by members of the armed forces, killing a guard but leaving the president unharmed.

On 2 March 2009, however, Vieira was assassinated by what preliminary reports indicated to be a group of soldiers avenging the death of the head of joint chiefs of staff, General [[Batista Tagme Na Waie|Batista Tagme Na Wai]], who had been killed in an explosion the day before. Vieira's death did not trigger widespread violence, but there were signs of turmoil in the country, according to the [[advocacy group]] [[Swisspeace]]. Military leaders in the country pledged to respect the constitutional order of succession. National Assembly Speaker [[Raimundo Pereira]] was appointed as an interim president until a nationwide [[Guinea-Bissau presidential election, 2009|election]] on 28 June 2009. It was won by Malam Bacai Sanhá, against [[Kumba Ialá]] as the presidential candidate of the PRS.

On 9 January 2012, President Sanhá died, and Pereira was again appointed as an interim president. On the evening of 12 April 2012, members of the country's military staged [[2012 Guinea-Bissau coup d'état|a ''coup d'état'']] and arrested the interim president and a leading presidential candidate. Former vice chief of staff, General [[Mamadu Ture Kuruma]], assumed control of the country in the transitional period and started negotiations with opposition parties.

The [[2014 Guinea-Bissau general election|2014 general election]] saw [[José Mário Vaz]] elected President of Guinea-Bissau. Vaz became the first elected president to complete his five-year mandate. At the same time, he was eliminated in the first round of the [[2019 Guinea-Bissau presidential election|2019 presidential elections]], ultimately seeing [[Umaro Sissoco Embaló]] emerge as the victor. Embaló, the first president to be elected without the backing of the PAIGC, took office in February 2020.

On 1 February 2022, there was [[2022 Guinea-Bissau coup attempt|an attempted coup d'état]] to overthrow President Umaro Sissoco Embaló. On 2 February 2022, state radio announced that four assailants and two members of the presidential guard had been killed in the incident. The [[African Union]] and [[Economic Community of West African States|ECOWAS]] both condemned the coup. Six days after the attempted coup d'état, on 7 February 2022, there was an attack on the building of Rádio Capital FM, a radio station critical of the Bissau-Guinean government; this was the second time the radio station suffered an attack of this nature in less than two years. A journalist working for the station recalled, while wishing to stay anonymous, that one of their colleagues had recognized one of the cars carrying the attackers as belonging to the presidency.

In 2022, Embaló became the first African ruler to visit Ukraine since the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russian invasion of the country]] in February, meeting with President of Ukraine [[Volodymyr Zelenskyy]].

[[File:Putin-Embalo meeting (2022-10-25) 02.jpg|thumb|Guinea-Bissau President [[Umaro Sissoco Embaló]] with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] in Moscow, Russia, 25 October 2022]]
In 2023, [[2023 Guinea-Bissau coup attempt|an attempted coup]] reportedly occurred in the capital, Bissau, leading Embaló to order the dissolution of the opposition-controlled parliament. On 11 September 2024, President Umaro Sissoco Embaló announced that he would not seek a second term in the upcoming presidential elections scheduled for November 2025. On 3 March 2025, President Umaro Sissoco Embaló said that he would run for a second term in November, contrary to his earlier vows to step down.
