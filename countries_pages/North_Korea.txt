The location of the commanderies has become a controversial topic in Korea in recent years. However, the location of the commanderies is not controversial outside of Korea.]]

According to [[Korean mythology]] in 2333 BC, the [[Old Chosŏn|Gojoseon]] Kingdom was established by the god-king [[Dangun]]. Following the end of the Three Kingdoms of Korea into Silla and Balhae in the late 7th century, Korea was subsequently ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) and the [[Joseon dynasty]] (1392–1897). In 1897, [[Gojong of Korea|King Gojong]] proclaimed the [[Korean Empire]], which was [[Korea under Japanese rule|annexed]] by the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1910.

According to Korea's [[Civil religion|founding mythology]], the history of Korea begins with the founding of Joseon (also known as "[[Old Chosŏn|Gojoseon]]", or "Old Joseon", to differentiate it from the 14th century dynasty) in 2333 BC by the legendary [[Dangun]]. Gojoseon was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century. Gojoseon expanded until it controlled the northern Korean Peninsula and parts of [[Manchuria]]. [[Gija Joseon]] was purportedly founded in the 12th century BC, but its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era. In 108 BC, the [[Han dynasty]] [[Gojoseon–Han War|defeated]] [[Wiman Joseon]] and installed [[Four Commanderies of Han|four commanderies]] in the northern Korean peninsula. Three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades. As [[Lelang Commandery]] was destroyed and rebuilt around this time, the place gradually moved toward Liaodong.{{Clarify|reason=Grammar and wording is a bit unusual; not sure of meaning|date=April 2023}} Thus, its force was diminished and only served as a trade center until it was conquered by Goguryeo in 313.

Beginning around 300 BC, the [[Japonic]]-speaking [[Yayoi people]] from the Korean Peninsula entered the Japanese islands and displaced or intermingled with the original [[Jōmon people|Jōmon]] inhabitants. The linguistic homeland of Proto-[[Koreans]] is located somewhere in southern [[Siberia]]/[[Manchuria]], such as the [[Liao River]] area or the [[Amur]] River area. Proto-Koreans arrived in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula at around 300 BC, replacing and assimilating Japonic-speakers and likely causing the [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] migration.

=== Three Kingdoms of Korea ===
During the [[Proto–Three Kingdoms period]], the states of [[Buyeo]], [[Okjeo]], [[Eastern Ye|Dongye]], and [[Samhan]] occupied the whole Korean peninsula and southern Manchuria. From them, the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] emerged: [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], and [[Silla]].

Goguryeo, the largest and most powerful among them, was a highly militaristic state and competed with various Chinese dynasties during its 700 years of history. Goguryeo experienced a golden age under [[Gwanggaeto the Great]] and his son [[Jangsu of Goguryeo|Jangsu]], who both subdued Baekje and Silla during their respective reigns, achieving a brief unification of the Three Kingdoms and becoming the most dominant power on the Korean Peninsula. In addition to contesting control of the Korean Peninsula, Goguryeo had many [[Military history of Goguryeo|military conflicts]] with various [[Dynasties of China|Chinese dynastie]]s, most notably the [[Goguryeo–Sui War]], in which Goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men.

Baekje was a maritime power, sometimes called the "[[Phoenicia]] of East Asia". Its maritime ability was instrumental in the dissemination of [[East Asian Buddhism|Buddhism throughout East Asia]] and spreading continental culture to Japan. Baekje was once a great military power on the Korean Peninsula, especially during the time of [[Geunchogo of Baekje|Geunchogo]], but was critically defeated by Gwanggaeto the Great and declined.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}} Silla was the smallest and weakest of the three, but used opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful Korean kingdoms, and eventually [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]], to its advantage.

[[File:History of Korea-Inter-country Age-830 CE.gif|thumb|[[Balhae]] (violet) and [[Unified Silla|Silla]] (blue), circa 830 AD]]

In 676, the unification of the Three Kingdoms by Silla led to the [[Northern and Southern States period]], in which [[Balhae]] controlled the northern parts of Goguryeo, and much of the Korean Peninsula was controlled by [[Unified Silla|Later Silla]]. Relationships between Korea and China remained relatively peaceful during this time. Balhae was founded by a [[Go of Balhae|Goguryeo general]] and formed as a successor state to Goguryeo. During its height, Balhae controlled most of Manchuria and parts of the Russian Far East and was called the "Prosperous Country in the East".

[[Late Silla]] was a wealthy country, and its metropolitan capital of [[Gyeongju]] grew to become the fourth largest city in the world. It experienced a golden age of art and culture, exemplified by monuments such as [[Hwangnyongsa]], [[Seokguram]], and the [[Bell of King Seongdeok|Emille Bell]]. It also carried on the maritime legacy and prowess of Baekje, and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of East Asia and the trade between China, Korea, and Japan, most notably during the time of [[Chang Pogo]]. In addition, Silla people made overseas communities in China on the [[Shandong Peninsula]] and the mouth of the [[Yangtze]] River. However, Silla was later weakened due to internal strife and the revival of successor states [[Later Baekje|Baekje]] and [[Taebong|Goguryeo]], which culminated into the [[Later Three Kingdoms]] period in the late 9th century.

Buddhism flourished during this time. Many [[Korean Buddhism|Korean Buddhists]] gained great fame among Chinese Buddhist circles and greatly contributed to [[Chinese Buddhism]]. Examples of significant Korean Buddhists from this period include [[Woncheuk]], [[Wonhyo]], [[Uisang]], [[Kim Hwasang|Musang]], and [[Kim Gyo-gak]]. Kim was a Silla prince whose influence made [[Mount Jiuhua]] one of the Four [[Sacred Mountains of China|Sacred Mountains]] of Chinese Buddhism.

=== Unified dynasties ===
In 936, the Later Three Kingdoms were united by [[Taejo of Goryeo|Wang Geon]], who established [[Goryeo]] as the successor state of Goguryeo. Balhae had fallen to the [[Khitan Empire]] in 926, and a decade later the [[Dae Gwang-hyeon|last crown prince of Balhae]] fled south to Goryeo, where he was warmly welcomed and included in the ruling family by Wang Geon, thus unifying the two successor nations of Goguryeo. Like Silla, Goryeo was a highly cultural state, and invented the metal movable type [[printing press]]. After defeating the Khitan Empire, which was the most powerful empire of its time, in the [[Goryeo–Khitan War]], Goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century, during which the [[Tripitaka Koreana]] was completed and significant developments in printing and publishing occurred. This promoted education and the dispersion of knowledge on philosophy, literature, religion, and science. By 1100, there were 12 universities that produced notable scholars.

However, the [[Mongol invasions of Korea|Mongol invasions]] in the 13th century greatly weakened the kingdom. Goryeo was never conquered by the Mongols, but exhausted after three decades of fighting, the Korean court sent its [[Wonjong of Goryeo|crown prince]] to the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] capital to swear allegiance to [[Kublai Khan]], who accepted and married one of his daughters to the Korean crown prince. Henceforth, Goryeo continued to rule Korea, though as a tributary ally to the Mongols for the next 86 years. During this period, the two nations became intertwined as all subsequent Korean kings married Mongol princesses, The first 200 years of the [[Joseon]] dynasty were marked by peace and saw great advancements in science and education, as well as the creation of [[Hangul]] by [[Sejong the Great]] to promote literacy among the common people. The prevailing ideology of the time was [[Korean Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism]], which was epitomized by the [[seonbi]] class: nobles who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity. Between 1592 and 1598, Japan under [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] launched [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|invasions of Korea]], but the advance was halted by Korean forces (most notably the [[Joseon Navy]] led by Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] and his renowned "[[turtle ship]]") with assistance from [[righteous army]] militias formed by Korean civilians, and [[Ming dynasty]] Chinese troops. Through a series of successful battles of attrition, the Japanese forces were eventually forced to withdraw, and relations between all parties became normalized. However, the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] took advantage of Joseon's war-weakened state and [[Manchu invasion of Korea|invaded in 1627 and 1637]] and then [[Transition from Ming to Qing|went on to conquer]] the destabilized Ming dynasty. After normalizing relations with the new [[Qing dynasty]], Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace. Kings [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]] and [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]] particularly led a new renaissance of the Joseon dynasty during the 18th century.

In the 19th century, Joseon began experiencing economic difficulties and widespread uprisings, including the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]]. The royal in-law families had gained control of the government, leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state.{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}} In addition, the strict isolationism of the Joseon government that earned it "the [[hermit kingdom]]" became increasing ineffective due to increasing encroachment from powers such as Japan, Russia, and the United States. This is exemplified by the [[Joseon–United States Treaty of 1882]], in which it was compelled to open its borders.

=== Japanese occupation and World War II ===
{{Main|Korea under Japanese rule}}
[[File:Map of Japan and Korea (1945), National Geographic.jpg|thumb|A 1945 [[National Geographic Maps|''National Geographic'']] map of Korea, showing Japanese place names and provincial boundaries.]]
In the late 19th century, Japan became a significant regional power after winning the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] against Qing China and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] against the [[Russian Empire]]. In 1897, King Gojong, the [[List of monarchs of Korea|last king of Korea]], proclaimed Joseon as the [[Korean Empire]]. However, Japan [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905|compelled Korea to become its protectorate]] in 1905 and [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910|formally annexed it]] in 1910. From 1910 to the [[End of World War II in Asia|end of World War II]] in 1945, Korea was [[Korea under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]]. What followed was a period of forced assimilation, in which Korean language, culture, and history were suppressed. This led to the [[March First Movement]] protests in 1919 and the subsequent foundation of resistance groups in exile, primarily in China. Among the resistance groups was [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]].

During the Japanese colonial period, most Koreans were peasants engaged in [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]]. In the 1930s, Japan developed mines, hydro-electric dams, steel mills, and manufacturing plants in northern Korea and neighboring [[Manchuria]]. The Korean industrial working class expanded rapidly, and many Koreans went to work in Manchuria. As a result, 65% of Korea's heavy industry was located in the north, but, due to the rugged terrain, only 37% of its agriculture.

Due to its rule by Japan, northern Korea had little exposure to modern, Western ideas. One partial exception was the penetration of religion. Since the arrival of missionaries in the late nineteenth century, the northwest of Korea, and Pyongyang in particular, had been a stronghold of Christianity. As a result, Pyongyang was called the "Jerusalem of the East". A Korean guerrilla movement emerged in the mountainous interior and in Manchuria, harassing the Japanese imperial authorities. One of the most prominent guerrilla leaders was the Communist Kim Il Sung.

===Division of Korea===
{{Main|Division of Korea}}
Towards the end of [[World War II]], the U.S. proposed dividing the Korean peninsula into two occupation zones: a [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|U.S. zone]] and a [[Soviet Civil Administration|Soviet zone]]. [[Dean Rusk]] and [[Charles H. Bonesteel III]] suggested the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] as the dividing line, as it placed Seoul under U.S. control. To the Americans' surprise, the Soviets accepted their proposal and agreed to divide Korea at that line.

After the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] at the end of World War II in 1945, [[Division of Korea|the Korean Peninsula was divided]] into two occupation zones along the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]], with the northern half of the peninsula [[Soviet Civil Administration|occupied by the Soviet Union]] and the southern half [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|by the United States]]. Negotiations on reunification failed. Soviet general [[Terentii Shtykov]] recommended the establishment of the [[Soviet Civil Administration]] in October 1945, and supported Kim Il Sung as chairman of the [[Provisional People's Committee of North Korea]], established in February 1946. In September 1946, South Korean citizens [[Autumn Uprising of 1946|rose up against the Allied Military Government]]. In April 1948, an [[Jeju uprising|uprising of the Jeju islanders]] was violently crushed. The South declared its statehood in May 1948 and two months later the ardent anti-communist [[Syngman Rhee]] became its ruler. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established in the North on 9 September 1948. Shtykov served as the first Soviet ambassador, while Kim Il Sung became premier.{{citation needed|date=January 2025}}

Soviet forces withdrew from the North in 1948, and most American forces withdrew from the South in 1949. Ambassador Shtykov suspected Rhee was planning to invade the North and was sympathetic to Kim's goal of Korean unification under socialism. The two successfully lobbied Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] to support a quick war against the South, which culminated in the outbreak of the Korean War.

===Korean War===
{{Main|Korean War}}
{{See also|Aftermath of the Korean War|Korean Demilitarized Zone|North Korea–South Korea relations}}
[[File:Korean war 1950-1953.gif|thumb|upright|Territory often changed hands early in the war, until the front stabilized.{{legend|#EF767E|North Korean, Chinese, and Soviet forces}}{{legend|#73AA73|South Korean, U.S., Commonwealth, and United Nations forces}}]]
The [[military of North Korea]] invaded the South on 25 June 1950, and swiftly overran most of the country. The [[United Nations Command]] (UNC) was subsequently established following the [[UN Security Council]]'s recognition of North Korean aggression against South Korea. The motion passed because the [[Soviet Union]], a close ally of North Korea and a member of the UN Security Council, was boycotting the UN over its recognition of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] rather than the People's Republic of China. The UNC, led by the United States, intervened to defend the South, and rapidly advanced into North Korea. As they neared the border with China, [[People's Volunteer Army|Chinese forces]] intervened on behalf of North Korea, shifting the balance of the war again. Fighting ended on 27 July 1953, with [[Korean Armistice Agreement|an armistice]] that approximately restored the original boundaries between North and South Korea, but no peace treaty was signed. Approximately 3 million people died in the Korean War, with a higher proportional civilian death toll than [[World War II]] or the [[Vietnam War]]. In both per capita and absolute terms, North Korea was the country most devastated by the war, which resulted in the death of an estimated 12–15% of the North Korean population ({{circa}} 10 million), "a figure close to or surpassing the proportion of [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|Soviet citizens killed in World War II]]", according to [[Charles K. Armstrong]]. As a result of the war, almost every substantial building in North Korea was destroyed.{{sfn|Jager|2013|pp=237–242}} Some have referred to the conflict as a civil war, with other factors involved.

A heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) still divides the peninsula, and an anti-communist and anti-North Korea sentiment remains in South Korea. Since the war, the United States has maintained a strong [[United States Forces Korea|military presence in the South]] which is depicted by the North Korean government as an imperialist occupation force.{{sfn|Abt|2014|pp=125–126}} It claims that the Korean War was caused by the United States and South Korea.

=== Leadership of Kim Il Sung ===
[[File:Chollima statue 05.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Chollima Statue|Statue]] of [[Chollima Movement]] in Pyongyang]]
The post-war 1950s and 1960s saw an ideological shift in North Korea, as Kim Il Sung sought to consolidate his power. Kim Il Sung was highly critical of Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and his [[de-Stalinization]] policies and critiqued Khrushchev as revisionist.{{sfn|Armstrong|2010|p=9}} During the 1956 [[August Faction Incident]], Kim Il Sung successfully resisted efforts by the Soviet Union and China to depose him in favor of [[Soviet Koreans faction|Soviet Koreans]] or the pro-Chinese [[Yan'an faction]]. Some scholars believe that the 1956 August incident was an example of North Korea demonstrating political independence. In United States policymaking, North Korea was considered among the [[Captive Nations]]. Despite its efforts to break out of the Soviet and Chinese spheres of influence, North Korea remained closely aligned with both countries throughout the Cold War.

Industry was the favored sector in North Korea. Industrial production returned to pre-war levels by 1957. In 1959, relations with Japan had improved somewhat, and North Korea began allowing the repatriation of Japanese citizens in the country. The same year, North Korea revalued the [[North Korean won]], which held greater value than its South Korean counterpart. Until the 1960s, economic growth was higher than in South Korea, and North Korean GDP per capita was equal to that of its southern neighbor as late as 1976.{{sfn|Country Study|2009|pp=xxxii, 46}} However, by the 1980s, the economy had begun to stagnate; it started its long decline in 1987 and almost completely collapsed after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, when all Soviet aid was suddenly halted.{{Sfn|French|2007|pp=97–99}}

An internal CIA study acknowledged various achievements of the North Korean government post-war: compassionate care for war orphans and children in general, a radical improvement in the status of women, free housing, free healthcare, and health statistics particularly in life expectancy and infant mortality that were comparable to even the most advanced nations up until the [[North Korean famine]]. Life expectancy in the North was 72 before the famine which was only marginally lower than in the South. The country once boasted a comparatively developed healthcare system; pre-famine North Korea had a network of nearly 45,000 family practitioners with some 800 hospitals and 1,000 clinics.

The relative peace between the North and South following the armistice was interrupted by border skirmishes, celebrity abductions, and assassination attempts. The North failed in several assassination attempts on South Korean leaders, such as [[Blue House raid|in 1968]], 1974, and the [[Rangoon bombing]] in 1983; tunnels were found under the DMZ and tensions flared over the [[Korean axe murder incident|axe murder incident]] at [[Panmunjom]] in 1976. For almost two decades after the war, the two states did not seek to negotiate with one another. In 1971, secret, high-level contacts began to be conducted culminating in the 1972 [[July 4 South–North Joint Statement]] that established principles of working toward peaceful reunification. The talks ultimately failed because in 1973, South Korea declared its preference that the two Koreas should seek separate memberships in international organizations.

=== Leadership of Kim Jong Il ===
The Soviet Union was [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] on 26 December 1991, ending its aid and support to North Korea. In 1992, as Kim Il Sung's health began deteriorating, his son Kim Jong Il slowly began taking over various state tasks. Kim Il Sung [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il Sung|died]] of a [[heart attack]] in 1994; Kim Jong Il declared a three-year period of national mourning, afterward officially announcing his position as the new leader.

Flooding in the mid-1990s exacerbated the economic crisis, severely damaging crops and infrastructure and leading to [[North Korean famine|widespread famine]] that the government proved incapable of curtailing, resulting in the deaths of between 240,000 and 420,000 people and leading to the flight of many North Koreans into China, South Korea and neighboring countries. In China, these illegal North Korea child immigrants are called the [[Kotjebi]]. In 1996, the government accepted UN food aid. Kim Jong Il instituted a policy called ''[[Songun]]'', or "military first". The international environment changed once [[George W. Bush]] became U.S. President in 2001, whose administration rejected South Korea's Sunshine Policy and the Agreed Framework. Bush included North Korea in his [[axis of evil]] in his [[2002 State of the Union Address]]. The U.S. government accordingly treated North Korea as a [[rogue state]], while North Korea redoubled its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Jager|2013|p=456}}{{sfn|Abt|2014|pp=55, 109, 119}} On 9 October 2006, North Korea announced it had conducted [[2006 North Korean nuclear test|its first nuclear weapons test]].[[File:Minister of Defence of Russian Federation takes part in solemn events dedicated to 70th anniversary of Day of Victory in Great Fatherland Liberation War 01.jpg|thumb|Kim Jong Un with Russian Defence Minister [[Sergei Shoigu]] during the ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of the end of the [[Korean War]] in Pyongyang, 27 July 2023]]
U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] adopted a policy of "strategic patience", resisting making deals with North Korea. Tensions with South Korea and the United States increased in 2010 with the [[ROKS Cheonan sinking|sinking of the South Korean warship ''Cheonan'']] and North Korea's [[2010 Yeonpyeongdo bombardment|bombardment of Yeonpyeongdo]].

=== Leadership of Kim Jong Un ===
On 17 December 2011, Kim Jong Il [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong Il|died]] from a heart attack. His youngest son [[Kim Jong Un]] was announced as his successor. In the face of international condemnation, North Korea continued to develop its nuclear arsenal, possibly including a [[hydrogen bomb]] and a missile capable of reaching the United States.

Throughout 2017, following [[Donald Trump]]'s ascension to the US presidency, relations between the United States and North Korea worsened, and there was a period of [[2017–2018 North Korea crisis|heightened tension]] between the two countries. The tensions substantially decreased in 2018, and a [[détente]] developed. A [[2018–19 Korean peace process|series of summits]] took place between North Korea, South Korea and the United States, though the talks ultimately broke down.
[[File:Putin motorcade in Pyongyang (2024).jpg|thumb|Motorcade transporting Russian President [[2024 North Korea–Russia summit|Vladimir Putin in Pyongyang]], 19 June 2024]]
On 30 December 2023, Kim Jong Un marked a significant departure from the longstanding position of mutual claims over the entire Korean Peninsula by both North and South Korea. In 2024, North Korea [[North Korean involvement in the Russian invasion of Ukraine|deployed a contingent of troops to Russia]] in support of Russia's [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|war against Ukraine]].
