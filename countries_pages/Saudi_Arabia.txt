=== Prehistory ===

There is evidence that human habitation in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] dates back to about 125,000 years ago. A 2011 study found that the first modern humans to spread east across Asia left [[Africa]] about 75,000 years ago across the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] connecting the [[Horn of Africa]] and Arabia. The Arabian Peninsula is regarded as central to the understanding of evolution and dispersals of humanity. Arabia underwent an extreme environmental fluctuation in the [[Quaternary]] that led to profound evolutionary and demographic changes. Arabia has a rich [[Lower Paleolithic]] record, and the quantity of [[Oldowan]]-like sites in the region indicate a significant role that Arabia had played in the early hominin colonization of Eurasia.

In the [[Neolithic]] period, prominent cultures such as [[Al-Magar]], whose centre lay in modern-day southwestern Najd, flourished. Al-Magar could be considered a "Neolithic Revolution" in human knowledge and handicraft skills. The culture is characterized as being one of the world's first to involve the widespread domestication of animals, particularly the horse. Al-Magar statues were made from local stone, and it seems that the statues were fixed in a central building that might have had a significant role in the social and religious life of the inhabitants.

In 2017, hunting scenes showing images of most likely domesticated dogs (resembling the [[Canaan Dog]]) were discovered in northwestern Saudi Arabia. These rock engravings date back more than {{gaps|8|000}} years, making them the earliest depictions of dogs in the world.

At the end of the 4th millennium BC, Arabia entered the [[Bronze Age]]; metals were widely used, and the period was characterized by its 2&nbsp;m high burials which were simultaneously followed by the existence of numerous temples that included many free-standing sculptures originally painted with red colours.

In May 2021, archaeologists announced that a 350,000-year-old [[Acheulean]] site named An Nasim in the [[Ḥaʼil Province|Hail region]] could be the oldest human habitation site in northern Saudi Arabia. [[Paleolithic]] artefacts are similar to material remains uncovered at the Acheulean sites in the [[An Nafud|Nefud Desert]].

The earliest sedentary culture in Saudi Arabia dates back to the [[Ubaid period]] at [[Dosariyah]]. Climatic change and the onset of aridity may have brought about the end of this phase of settlement, as little archaeological evidence exists from the succeeding millennium. The settlement of the region picks up again in the period of [[Dilmun]] in the early 3rd millennium. Known records from [[Uruk]] refer to a place called Dilmun, associated on several occasions with copper, and in later periods it was a source of imported woods in southern Mesopotamia. Scholars have suggested that Dilmun originally designated the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]], notably linked with the major Dilmunite settlements of Umm an-Nussi and Umm ar-Ramadh in the interior and Tarout on the coast. It is likely that [[Tarout Island]] was the main port and the capital of Dilmun. The capital of Midian was Qurayyah, it consists of a large, fortified citadel encompassing 35 hectares and below it lies a walled settlement of 15 hectares. The city hosted as many as 12,000 inhabitants. The Bible recounts [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]]'s [[Midian war|two wars]] with Midian, in the early 11th century BC. Politically, the Midianites were described as having a decentralized structure headed by five kings (Evi, Rekem, Tsur, Hur, and Reba); the names appear to be toponyms of important Midianite settlements. It is common to view that Midian designated a confederation of tribes, the sedentary element settled in the Hijaz while its nomadic affiliates pastured and sometimes pillaged as far away as [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The nomadic [[Midianites]] were one of the earliest exploiters of the domestication of camels that enabled them to navigate through the harsh terrains of the region.]]

At the end of the 7th century BC, an emerging kingdom appeared in north-western Arabia. It started as a sheikdom of Dedan, which developed into the kingdom of [[Lihyan]]. During this period, Dedan transformed into a kingdom that encompassed a much wider domain. The Lihyanites ruled over a large domain from [[Medina|Yathrib]] in the south and parts of the Levant in the north. In antiquity, Gulf of Aqaba used to be called Gulf of Lihyan, a testimony to the extensive influence that Lihyan acquired.

The Lihyanites fell into the hands of the [[Nabataeans]] around 65 BC upon their seizure of Hegra then marching to [[Tayma]], and to their capital Dedan in 9 BC. The Nabataeans ruled large portions of north Arabia until their domain was annexed by the [[Roman Empire]], which renamed it [[Arabia Petraea]], and remained under the rule of the Romans until 630.

=== Middle Ages and rise of Islam ===
{{Main|Caliphate}}
[[File:Umayyad750ADloc.png|thumb|left|At its greatest extent, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] (661–750) covered {{cvt|11100000|km2|sqmi|-5|comma=gaps}} and 62 million people (29 per cent of the world's population), making it one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]] in both area and proportion of the world's population. It was also larger than any previous empire in history.]]

Shortly before the advent of Islam, apart from urban trading settlements (such as Mecca and Medina), much of what was to become Saudi Arabia was populated by nomadic pastoral tribal societies. The Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca in about 570 [[Common Era|CE]]. In the early 7th century, [[Muhammad]] united the [[Tribes of Arabia|various tribes of the peninsula]] and created a single Islamic religious polity. Following his death in 632, his followers expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia, conquering territory in the Iberian Peninsula in the west, to parts of Central and South Asia in the east, in a matter of decades. Arabia became a more politically peripheral region of the Muslim world as the focus shifted to the newly conquered lands.

For much of the 10th century, the [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]]-Shi'ite [[Qarmatians]] were the most powerful force in the Persian Gulf. In 930, the Qarmatians pillaged Mecca, outraging the Muslim world, particularly with their theft of the [[Black Stone]]. In 1077–1078, an Arab sheikh named [[Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni]] defeated the Qarmatians in [[Eastern Arabia|Bahrain]] and [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|al-Hasa]] with the help of the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuq Empire]] and founded the [[Uyunid dynasty]]. The [[Uyunid Emirate]] later underwent expansion, with its territory stretching from Najd to the [[Syrian Desert]]. They were overthrown by the [[Usfurids]] in 1253. Usfurid rule was weakened after Persian rulers of [[Ormus|Hormuz]] captured Bahrain and [[Qatif]] in 1320. The vassals of Ormuz, the Shia [[Jarwanid dynasty]] came to rule eastern Arabia in the 14th century. The [[Jabrids]] took control of the region after overthrowing the Jarwanids in the 15th century and clashed with Hormuz for more than two decades over the region for its economic revenues, until finally agreeing to pay [[tribute]] in 1507. Their rule extended from Iraq to Oman at its height, and they too came under Ottoman suzerainty.

=== Ottoman Hejaz and Portuguese era ===
{{Main|Ottoman era in the history of Saudi Arabia|Mamluk–Portuguese conflicts|Ottoman–Portuguese confrontations}}

In the 16th century, the Ottomans added the Red Sea and Persian Gulf coast (the Hejaz, [[Aseer]] and [[Eastern Arabia|Al-Ahsa]]) to the empire and claimed suzerainty over the interior. One reason was to [[Ottoman–Portuguese conflicts (1538–1560)|thwart Portuguese attempts]] to attack the Red Sea (hence the Hejaz) and the Indian Ocean. The Ottoman degree of control over these lands varied over the next four centuries with the fluctuating strength or weakness of the empire's central authority.{{sfn|Bowen|2007|p=68}} These changes contributed to later uncertainties, such as the dispute with Transjordan over the [[Occupation of Ma'an|inclusion of the sanjak of Ma'an]], including the cities of [[Ma'an]] and [[Aqaba]].

=== Saud dynasty and unification ===
{{See also|Unification of Saudi Arabia}}

[[File:The First Saudi State Greatest Extent.png|thumb|Expansion of the [[Emirate of Diriyah|first Saudi State]] in 1810|left]]
The emergence of what was to become the Saudi royal family, known as the Al Saud, began at the town of [[Diriyah]] in central Arabia with the accession as [[emir]] of [[Muhammad bin Saud]] on 22 February 1727. In 1744 he joined forces with the religious leader [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]],{{sfn|Bowen|2007|p=69–70}} founder of the Wahhabi movement, a strict puritanical form of Sunni Islam. This alliance provided the ideological impetus to Saudi expansion and remains the basis of Saudi Arabian dynastic rule today.

The [[Emirate of Diriyah]] established in the area around Riyadh rapidly expanded and briefly controlled most of the present-day territory of Saudi Arabia, [[Wahhabi sack of Karbala|sacking Karbala]] in 1802, and [[Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia|capturing Mecca]] in 1803. In 1818, it was destroyed by the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammed Ali Pasha]]. The much smaller [[Emirate of Nejd]] was established in 1824. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the Al Saud contested control of the interior of what was to become Saudi Arabia with another Arabian ruling family, the [[Rashidi dynasty|Al Rashid]], who ruled the [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar]]. By 1891, the Al Rashid were victorious and the Al Saud were driven into exile in Kuwait. with the [[Sharif of Mecca]] having pre-eminence and ruling the Hejaz. In 1902, [[Abdul Rahman bin Faisal|Abdul Rahman]]'s son, Abdulaziz—later known as [[Ibn Saud]]—recaptured control of Riyadh bringing the Al Saud back to Nejd, creating the [[Emirate of Nejd and Hasa|third "Saudi state"]]. With the aid of the Ikhwan, Ibn Saud captured Al-Ahsa from the Ottomans in 1913.

In 1916, with the encouragement and support of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] (which was fighting the Ottomans in [[World War I]]), the Sharif of Mecca, [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein bin Ali]], led a pan-[[Arab Revolt]] against the Ottoman Empire to create a united Arab state. Although the revolt failed in its objective, [[Allies of World War I|the Allied]] victory in World War I resulted in the end of Ottoman suzerainty and control in Arabia, and Hussein bin Ali became [[Kingdom of Hejaz|King of Hejaz]].

Ibn Saud avoided involvement in the Arab Revolt and instead continued his struggle with the Al Rashid. Following the latter's final defeat, he took the title [[Sultanate of Nejd|Sultan of Nejd]] in 1921. With the help of the Ikhwan, the Kingdom of Hejaz was conquered in 1924–25, and on 10 January 1926, Ibn Saud declared himself king of Hejaz. For the next five years, he administered the two parts of his dual kingdom as separate units. On Ibn Saud's behalf, [[Faisal bin Abdulaziz al Saud|Prince Faisal]] declared the unification on 23 September 1932, and the two kingdoms of Hejaz and Nejd were unified as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

=== 20th century ===
{{Main|Modern history of Saudi Arabia}}
[[File:Dammam No. 7 on March 4, 1938.jpg|thumb|The oil well ''[[Dammam No. 7]]'' on March 4, 1938, the day it struck oil in commercial quantities, becoming the first in Saudi Arabia to do so]]
The new kingdom was reliant on limited agriculture and pilgrimage revenues. [[Dammam No. 7|In 1938, vast reserves of oil were discovered]] in the Al-Ahsa region along the coast of the Persian Gulf, and full-scale development of the oil fields began in 1941 under the US-controlled [[Saudi Aramco|Aramco (Arabian American Oil Company)]]. Oil provided Saudi Arabia with economic prosperity and substantial political leverage internationally. In 1973, Saudi Arabia led an [[1973 oil crisis|oil boycott]] against the Western countries that supported Israel in the [[Yom Kippur War]] against Egypt and Syria, leading to the quadrupling of oil prices.[[File:Nasser_and_Faisal.jpg|alt=Nasser and Faisal|thumb|230x230px|Faisal (left) with Egypt's President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] in Cairo, 1969]]
By 1976, Saudi Arabia had become the largest oil producer in the world. Khalid's reign saw economic and social development progress at an extremely rapid rate, transforming the infrastructure and educational system of the country; and had a long-term influence on Saudi foreign and domestic policy. The first was the [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian Islamic Revolution]]. It was feared that the country's [[Shi'a Islam in Saudi Arabia|Shi'ite minority]] in the Eastern Province (which is also the location of the oil fields) might rebel under the influence of their Iranian co-religionists. There were several anti-government uprisings in the region such as the [[1979 Qatif Uprising]]. The second event was the [[Grand Mosque Seizure]] in Mecca by Islamist extremists. The militants involved were in part angered by what they considered to be the corruption and un-Islamic nature of the Saudi government. Neither entirely succeeded as Islamism continued to grow in strength.

In 1980, Saudi Arabia bought out the American interests in Aramco. King Khalid died in 1982 and was succeeded by his brother, [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]]. Fahd continued to develop close relations with the United States and increased the purchase of American and British military equipment. however, Saudi Arabia condemned the [[invasion of Kuwait]] in 1990 and asked the United States to intervene. Many Saudis who did not support the Islamist terrorists were nevertheless deeply unhappy with the government's policies.

Islamism was not the only source of hostility to the government. Although extremely wealthy by the 21st century, Saudi Arabia's economy was near stagnant. High taxes and a growth in unemployment have contributed to discontent and have been reflected in a rise in civil unrest, and discontent with the royal family. In response, a number of limited reforms were initiated by King Fahd. In March 1992, he introduced the "[[Basic Law of Saudi Arabia|Basic Law]]", which emphasized the duties and responsibilities of a ruler. In December 1993, the Consultative Council was inaugurated. It is composed of a chairman and 60 members—all chosen by the King. Fahd made it clear that he did not have democracy in mind, saying: "A system based on elections is not consistent with our Islamic creed, which [approves of] government by consultation [shūrā]."

=== 21st century ===
Signs of discontent included, in 2003 and 2004, a series of bombings and armed violence in Riyadh, Jeddah, Yanbu and Khobar. In February–April 2005, [[2005 Saudi Arabian municipal elections|the first-ever nationwide municipal elections]] were held in Saudi Arabia. Women were not allowed to take part.

Since 2011, Saudi Arabia has been affected by its own [[2011–13 Saudi Arabian protests|Arab Spring protests]]. In response, King Abdullah announced on 22 February 2011 a series of benefits for citizens amounting to $36 billion, of which $10.7 billion was earmarked for housing. No political reforms were included, though some prisoners indicted for financial crimes were pardoned. Abdullah also announced a package of $93 billion, which included 500,000 new homes to a cost of $67 billion, in addition to creating {{gaps|60|000}} new security jobs. Although male-only [[Saudi Arabian municipal elections, 2011|municipal elections were held in 2011]], Abdullah allowed women to vote and be elected in the [[Saudi Arabian municipal elections, 2015|2015 municipal elections]], and also to be nominated to the [[Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia|Shura Council]].
