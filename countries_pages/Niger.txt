Stone tools, some dating as far back as 280,000 BC, have been found in [[Adrar Bous]], [[Bilma]] and [[Djado]] in the northern [[Agadez Region]]. Some of these finds have been linked with the [[Aterian]] and [[Mousterian]] tool cultures of the [[Middle Paleolithic]] period, which flourished in northern Africa circa 90,000 BC–20,000 BC.

The [[Neolithic]] era, beginning circa 10,000 BC, saw a number of changes such as the introduction of [[pottery]] (as evidenced at Tagalagal, Temet and Tin Ouffadene), the spread of cattle husbandry, and the burying of the dead in stone [[tumuli]]. Agriculture spread, including the planting of [[millet]] and [[sorghum]], and pottery production. The [[Kiffian culture|Kiffian]] (circa 8000–6000 BC) and later [[Tenerian culture|Tenerian]] (circa 5000–2500 BC) cultures, centred on [[Adrar Bous]] and [[Gobero]] where skeletons have been uncovered, flourished during this period.

Societies continued to grow with regional differentiation in agricultural and funerary practices. A culture of this period is the [[Bura culture]] (circa 200–1300 AD) named for the [[Bura archaeological site]] where a burial replete with iron and ceramic statuettes were discovered. The Neolithic era saw the flourishing of Saharan rock art, including in the [[Aïr Mountains]], Termit Massif, Djado Plateau, Iwelene, Arakao, Tamakon, Tzerzait, [[Iferouane]], Mammanet and [[Dabous Giraffes|Dabous]]; the art spans the period from 10,000 BC to 100 AD and depicts a range of subjects, from the varied fauna of the landscape to depictions of spear-carrying figures dubbed 'Libyan warriors'.

=== Empires and kingdoms in pre-colonial Niger ===
By at least the 5th century BC the territory of what is now Niger had become an area of trans-Saharan trade. Led by [[Tuareg]] tribes from the north, camels were used as a means of transportation through what is later a desert. This mobility which would continue in waves for centuries was accompanied with further migration to the south and intermixing between sub-Saharan African and North African populations, and the spread of [[Islam]]. From its heartland around the later Guinea-Mali border region, the empire expanded under successive kings and came to dominate the Trans-Saharan trade routes, reaching its greatest extent during the rule of [[Mansa Musa]] (r. 1312–1337).{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} At this point parts of what are now Niger's [[Tillabéri Region]] fell under Malian rule. The empire began "declining" in the 15th century due to a combination of internecine strife over the royal succession, weak kings, the shift of European trade routes to the coast, and rebellions in the empire's periphery by [[Mossi people|Mossi]], [[Wolof people|Wolof]], [[Tuareg]] and [[Songhai people|Songhai]] peoples. From 1000 to 1325, the Songhai Empire managed to maintain peace with the Mali Empire, its neighbour to the west. In 1325 Songhai was conquered by Mali until regaining its independence in 1375.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} Under king [[Sonni Ali]] (r. 1464–1492) Songhai adopted an expansionist policy which reached its apogee during the reign of [[Askia Mohammad I]] (r. 1493–1528); at this point the empire had expanded from its Niger-bend heartland, including to the east where most of later western Niger fell under its rule, including [[Agadez]] which was conquered in 1496. The empire was unable to withstand repeated attacks from the [[Saadi dynasty]] of [[Morocco]] and was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Tondibi]] in 1591; it then collapsed into a number of smaller kingdoms. The kingdom reached its greatest extent in the 1200s, partly due to the effort of ''Mai'' [[Dunama Dibbalemi]] (r. 1210–1259), and grew "richer" from its control of some Trans-Saharan trade routes; most of eastern and south-eastern Niger, including [[Bilma]] and [[Kaouar]], was under Kanem's control in this period. Islam had been introduced to the kingdom by Arab traders from the 11th century, gaining more converts over the following centuries. Bornu "prospered" during the rule of ''Mai'' [[Idris Alooma]] (r. circa 1575–1610) and re-conquered most of the "traditional lands" of Kanem, hence the designation 'Kanem–Bornu' for the empire. By the 17th century and into the 18th the Bornu kingdom had entered a "period of decline", shrinking back to its Lake Chad heartland. The Hausa are thought to be a mixture of autochthonous peoples and migrant peoples from the north and east, emerging as a distinct people sometime in the 900s–1400s when the kingdoms were founded. They gradually adopted Islam from the 14th century, and sometimes this existed alongside other religions, developing into syncretic forms; some Hausa groups such as the Azna resisted Islam altogether (the area of [[Dogondoutchi]] remains an animist stronghold). After conquering most of Hausaland (though not the Bornu Kingdom, which remained independent), he proclaimed the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] in 1809.

Other smaller kingdoms of the period include the [[Dosso Kingdom]], a [[Zarma people|Zarma]] polity founded in 1750, which resisted the rule of Hausa and Sokoto states. France then set about making a reality of their rule on the ground. In 1897, the French officer [[Marius Gabriel Cazemajou]] was sent to Niger. He reached the [[Sultanate of Damagaram]] in 1898, and stayed in [[Zinder]] at the court of Sultan Amadou Kouran Daga. He was later killed, as Daga feared he would ally with the Chad-based warlord Rabih az-Zubayr.

The French generally adopted a form of indirect rule, allowing existing native structures to continue to exist within the colonial framework of governance providing that they acknowledged French supremacy. While "largely successful" in subduing the "sedentary" populations of the south, the French faced "considerably more difficulty" with the Tuareg in the north (centered on the Sultanate of Aïr in Agadez), and France was unable to occupy Agadez until 1906. The French Union, which lasted from 1946 to 1958, conferred a limited form of French citizenship on the inhabitants of the colonies, with some decentralisation of power and limited participation in political life for local advisory assemblies. It was during this period that the [[Nigerien Progressive Party – African Democratic Rally|Nigerien Progressive Party]] (''Parti Progressiste Nigérien'', or PPN, originally a branch of the African Democratic Rally, or ''[[Rassemblement Démocratique Africain]]'' – RDA) was formed under the leadership of former teacher [[Hamani Diori]], as was the left-wing [[Mouvement Socialiste Africain-Sawaba]] (MSA), led by [[Djibo Bakary]]. Following the Overseas Reform Act (''Loi Cadre'') of 23 July 1956 and the establishment of the [[Fifth French Republic]] on 4 December 1958, Niger became an autonomous state within the [[French Community]]. On 18 December 1958, an autonomous Republic of Niger was officially created under the leadership of Hamani Diori. MSA was banned in 1959 for its perceived excessive anti-French stance. On 11 July 1960, Niger decided to leave the French Community and acquired full independence at midnight, local time, on 3 August 1960; Diori thus became the first [[List of Presidents of Niger|president]] of the country.

=== Post-colonial (1960–) ===
==== Diori years (1960–1974) ====

Diori's single party rule was characterised by "good" relations with the West and a preoccupation with foreign affairs.]]
For its first 14 years as an independent state, Niger was run by a single-party civilian regime under the presidency of Hamani Diori. The 1960s saw an expansion of the education system and some limited economic development and industrialisation. In the 1970s, a combination of economic difficulties, [[drought]]s and accusations of rampant corruption and mismanagement of food supplies resulted in a [[1974 Nigerien coup d'état|coup d'état]] that overthrew the Diori regime.

==== First military regime (1974–1991) ====
The coup had been masterminded by Col. [[Seyni Kountché]] and a military group under the name of the ''Conseil Militaire Supreme'', with Kountché going on to rule the country until his death in 1987. Whilst political prisoners of the Diori regime were released after the coup, political and individual freedoms in general deteriorated during this period. There were attempted coups (in 1975, 1976 and 1984) which were thwarted, their instigators being punished. In the 1980s, Kountché began cautiously loosening the grip of the military, with some relaxation of state censorship and attempts made to 'civilianise' the regime.

President Saibou's efforts to control political reforms failed in the face of trade union and student demands to institute a [[multi-party democracy|multi-party democratic system]]. On 9 February 1990, a violently repressed student march in Niamey led to the death of three students, which led to increased national and international pressure for further democratic reform. Following this, presidential [[1993 Nigerien parliamentary election|elections]] were held and [[Mahamane Ousmane]] became the first president of the Third Republic on 27 March 1993.

==== Second and third military regimes (1996–1999) ====
The governmental paralysis prompted the military to intervene; on 27 January 1996, Col. [[Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara]] led a [[1996 Nigerien coup d'état|coup]] that deposed President Ousmane and ended the Third Republic. Maïnassara headed a ''Conseil de Salut National'' (National Salvation Council) composed of military officials which carried out a six-month transition period, during which a constitution was drafted and adopted on 12 May 1996.

Maj. [[Daouda Malam Wanké]] then took over, establishing a transitional National Reconciliation Council to oversee the drafting of a constitution with a French-style [[semi-presidential system]]. This was adopted on 9 August 1999 and was followed by presidential and legislative [[1999 Nigerien general election|elections]] in October and November of the same year. The elections were generally found to be free and fair by international observers. Wanké then withdrew from governmental affairs. In August 2002, unrest within military camps occurred in [[Niamey]], [[Diffa]], and [[Nguigmi]], and the government was able to restore order within days. On 24 July 2004, municipal elections were held to elect local representatives, previously appointed by the government. These elections were followed by presidential elections, in which Mamadou was re-elected for a second term, thus becoming the first president of the republic to win consecutive elections without being deposed by military coups. The legislative and executive configuration remained somewhat similar to that of the first term of the president: [[Hama Amadou]] was reappointed as prime minister and [[Mahamane Ousmane]], the head of the CDS party, was re-elected as the president of the National Assembly (parliament) by his peers.

By 2007, the relationship between President Tandja Mamadou and his prime minister had "deteriorated", leading to the replacement of the latter in June 2007 by [[Seyni Oumarou]] following a successful vote of no confidence at the Assembly. The opposition boycotted the referendum and the constitution was adopted with 92.5% of voters and a 68% turnout, according to official results. The adoption of the constitution created a Sixth Republic, with a [[presidential system]], the suspension of the 1999 Constitution, and a three-year interim government with Tandja Mamadou as president. The events generated political and social unrest. The [[Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy]], headed by Djibo, carried out a one-year transition plan, drafted a constitution and held elections in 2011.

==== Seventh Republic (2010–2023) ====
[[File:Niger, Barkiawal Béri (04), vue aérienne avec RN25.jpg|thumb|Semi-arid Niger is threatened by further [[Desertification in Africa|desertification]].]]
Following the adoption of a constitution in 2010 and [[2011 Nigerien general election|presidential elections]] a year later, [[Mahamadou Issoufou]] was elected as the first president of the Seventh Republic; he was then [[2016 Nigerien general election|re-elected]] in 2016. The constitution restored the semi-presidential system which had been abolished a year earlier. An attempted coup against him in 2011 was thwarted and its ringleaders arrested. Issoufou's time in office was marked by threats to the country's security, stemming from the fallout from the [[Libyan Civil War]] and [[Northern Mali conflict]], [[jihadist insurgency in Niger|an insurgency in western Niger]] by [[al-Qaeda]] and [[Islamic State]], the spillover of Nigeria's [[Boko Haram insurgency]] into south-eastern Niger, and the use of Niger as a transit country for migrants (often organised by [[people-smuggling]] [[gang]]s). French and American forces assisted Niger in countering these threats.

On 10 December 2019, a large group of fighters belonging to the [[Islamic State in the Greater Sahara]] (IS-GS) [[Battle of Inates|attacked]] a military post in [[Inates]], killing over seventy [[Niger Armed Forces|soldiers]] and kidnapping others. The attack was the deadliest single incident Niger's military has ever experienced. On 9 January 2020, a large group of IS-GS militants [[Battle of Chinagodrar|assaulted]] a Nigerien military base at Chinagodrar, in Niger's [[Tillabéri Region]], killing at least 89 Nigerien soldiers.

On 27 December 2020, Nigeriens [[2020–21 Nigerien general election|went to the polls]] after Issoufou announced he would step down, paving the way to a [[peaceful transition of power]]. No candidate won an absolute majority in the vote: [[Mohamed Bazoum]] came closest with 39.33%. Per the constitution, a run-off election was held on 20 February 2021, with Bazoum taking 55.75% of the vote and opposition candidate (and former president) [[Mahamane Ousmane]] taking 44.25%, according to the electoral commission.

At the start of 2021 with the [[Tchoma Bangou and Zaroumdareye massacres]], IS-GS began killing civilians en masse. On 21 March 2021, the IS-GS militants [[Tillia massacres|attacked]] several villages around [[Tillia]], killing 141 people, mostly civilians.

On 31 March 2021, Niger's security forces thwarted an [[2021 Nigerien coup d'état attempt|attempted coup]] by a military unit in the capital, [[Niamey]]. Gunfire was heard in the presidential palace. The attack took place two days before newly elected president [[Mohamed Bazoum]] was due to be sworn into office. The Presidential Guard arrested some people during the incident. On 2 April 2021, Bazoum was sworn in as the [[President of Niger]].

==== Fifth military regime (2023–present) ====

[[File:Alliance of Sahel States.svg|thumb|upright|The [[Alliance of Sahel States]]]]
Late on 26 July 2023, a [[2023 Nigerien coup d'état|coup by the military]] overthrew Bazoum, putting an end to the Seventh Republic and the [[Ouhoumoudou Mahamadou's government|government]] of Prime Minister [[Ouhoumoudou Mahamadou]]. On 28 July, General [[Abdourahamane Tchiani]] was proclaimed as the ''de facto'' head of state of the country. Former finance minister [[Ali Lamine Zeine]] was declared the new [[Prime Minister of Niger]].

The coup was condemned by ECOWAS, which in the [[2023 Nigerien crisis]] threatened to use military intervention to reinstate the government of Bazoum if the coup leaders did not by 6 August. The deadline passed without military intervention, though ECOWAS imposed sanctions, including cuts of Nigerian energy exports to Niger which had previously provided 70–90% of Niger's power. In November 2023 the coup-led governments of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger formed the [[Alliance of Sahel States]] in opposition to potential military intervention. On 24 February 2024 several ECOWAS sanctions against Niger were dropped, reportedly for humanitarian and diplomatic reasons, and Nigeria agreed to resume electricity exports to Niger. though Wagner mercenaries were not known to have entered the country as a result.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}} In October the junta expelled French troops from the country, presenting the move as a step towards sovereignty from the former colonial power, and in December it suspended cooperation with the [[Francophonie]] alleging its promotion of French interests. UN resident coordinator [[Louise Aubin]] was also expelled in October after the junta alleged "underhanded maneuvers" by UN secretary-general António Guterres to prevent the country's participation in the UN General Assembly. In April 2024, Russian military trainers and equipment began to arrive in Niger under a new military agreement, and the U.S. agreed to withdraw troops from Niger following the termination of a Niger–U.S. agreement that had allowed US personnel to be stationed in the country.
