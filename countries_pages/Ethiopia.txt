[[File:Homo Sapiens Idaltu.JPG|thumb|A ''[[Herto Man|Homo sapiens idaltu]]'' hominid skull]]

Several important finds have propelled Ethiopia and the surrounding region to the forefront of&nbsp;[[Paleontology|palaeontology]]. The oldest [[Hominidae|hominid]] discovered to date in Ethiopia is the 4.2&nbsp;million-year-old ''[[Ardipithecus|Ardipithecus ramidus]]'' ([[Ardi]]) found by [[Tim D. White]] in 1994. The most well-known hominid discovery is ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' ([[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]]). Known locally as ''Dinkinesh'', the specimen was found in the [[Awash Valley]] of [[Afar Region]] in 1974 by [[Donald Johanson]], and is one of the most complete and best-preserved adult [[Australopithecus|Australopithecine]] fossils ever uncovered. Lucy's taxonomic name refers to the region where the discovery was made. This hominid is estimated to have lived 3.2&nbsp;million years ago.

Ethiopia is also considered one of the earliest sites of the emergence of [[Early modern human|anatomically modern humans]], ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]''. The oldest of these local fossil finds, the [[Omo remains]], were excavated in the southwestern [[Omo Kibish Formation|Omo Kibish]] area and have been dated to the [[Middle Paleolithic]], around 200,000 years ago. Additionally, skeletons of ''[[Herto Man|Homo sapiens idaltu]]'' were found at a site in the [[Middle Awash]] valley. Dated to approximately 160,000 years ago, they may represent an extinct subspecies of ''Homo sapiens'', or the immediate ancestors of anatomically modern humans. Archaic ''Homo sapiens'' fossils excavated at the [[Jebel Irhoud]] site in Morocco have since been dated to an earlier period, about 300,000 years ago, while Omo-Kibish I (Omo I) from southern Ethiopia is the oldest anatomically modern ''Homo sapiens'' skeleton currently known (196 ± 5 kya).

According to some anthropologists, the first [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations arrived in the region during the ensuing [[Neolithic]] era from the family's proposed [[Afroasiatic homeland|urheimat]] ("original homeland") in the [[Nile|Nile Valley]], or the [[Near East]]. The majority of scholars today propose that the Afroasiatic family developed in northeast Africa because of the higher diversity of lineages in that region, a telltale sign of linguistic origin.

In 2019, archaeologists discovered a 30,000-year-old [[Middle Stone Age]] rock shelter at the [[Fincha Habera, Ethiopia|Fincha Habera]] site in [[Bale Mountains]] at an elevation of {{convert|3469|m|abbr=off}} above sea level. At this high altitude, humans are susceptible both to [[Hypoxemia#Environmental oxygen|hypoxia]] and to extreme weather. According to a study published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', this dwelling is proof of the earliest permanent human occupation at high altitude yet discovered. Thousands of animal bones, hundreds of stone tools, and ancient fireplaces were discovered, revealing a diet that featured giant [[Spalacidae|mole rat]]s.

Evidence of some of the earliest known stone-tipped projectile weapons (a characteristic tool of ''Homo sapiens''), the stone tips of javelins or throwing spears, were discovered in 2013 at the Ethiopian site of [[Gademotta]], which date to around 279,000 years ago. In 2019, additional Middle Stone Age projectile weapons were found at Aduma, dated 100,000–80,000 years ago, in the form of points considered likely to belong to darts delivered by spear throwers.

===Antiquity===
{{Main|Dʿmt|Kingdom of Aksum}}
[[File:KingEndybisEthiopia227-235CE.jpg|thumb|[[Aksumite currency]] of the [[Axumite kings|Aksumite king]] [[Endybis]], 227–35, at the [[British Museum]]{{Efn|The inscriptions in [[Ancient Greek]] read {{lang|grc|ΑΞΩΜΙΤΩ ΒΑϹΙΛΕΥϹ}} ("King of Axum") and {{lang|grc|ΕΝΔΥΒΙϹ ΒΑϹΙΛΕΥϹ}} ("King Endybis"); Greek was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' by that time, so its use in coins simplified foreign trade.}}]]

In 980 BC, [[Dʿmt]] was established in present-day [[Eritrea]] and the northern part of Ethiopia in the Tigray region, and is widely believed to be the successor state to [[Land of Punt|Punt]]. This polity's capital was located at [[Yeha]] in what is now northern Ethiopia. Most modern historians consider this civilization to be a native Ethiopian one, although in earlier times many suggested it was [[Sabaeans|Sabaean]]-influenced because of the latter's hegemony of the [[Red Sea]].

Other scholars regard Dʿmt as the result of a union of Afroasiatic-speaking cultures of the Cushitic and Semitic branches; namely, local [[Agaw people]]s and Sabaeans from Southern Arabia. However, [[Geʽez|Ge'ez]], the ancient Semitic language of Ethiopia, is thought to have developed independently from the [[Sabaean language]]. As early as 2000 BC, other Semitic speakers were living in Ethiopia and Eritrea where Ge'ez developed. Sabaean influence is now thought to have been minor, limited to a few localities, and disappearing after a few decades or a century. It may have been a trading or military colony in alliance with the Ethiopian civilization of Dʿmt or some other proto-Axumite state. The Persian prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] listed Axum with Rome, Persia, and China as one of the four great powers of his era, during the 3rd century. It is also believed that there was a connection between Egyptian and Ethiopian churches. There is faint evidence that the Aksumites were associated with the [[Queen of Sheba]], via their royal inscription.

Around 316 AD, [[Frumentius]] and his brother Edesius from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] accompanied their uncle on a voyage to Ethiopia. When the vessel stopped at a Red Sea port, the natives killed all the travellers except the two brothers, who were taken to the court as [[Slavery in Ethiopia|slaves]]. They were given positions of trust by the monarch, and they converted members of the royal court to Christianity. Frumentius became the first bishop of Aksum. A coin dated to 324 shows that Ethiopia was the second country to officially adopt Christianity (after Armenia did so in 301), although the religion may have been at first confined to court circles; it was the first major power to do so. The Aksumites were accustomed to the Greco-Roman sphere of influence, but they embarked on significant cultural ties and trade connections between the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the Roman Empire via the [[Silk Road]], primarily exporting [[Ivory trade|ivory]], tortoise shell, gold and emeralds, and importing silk and spices. The country's gold production in 2015 is 9 metric tons.

===Middle Ages===
{{Main|Ethiopia in the Middle Ages}}

The kingdom adopted the name "Ethiopia" during the reign of [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] in the 4th century. After the conquest of [[Kingdom of Kush]] in 330, the Aksumite territory reached its peak between the 5th and 6th centuries. these factors likely caused the kingdom to decline in power as part of an important trade route. Aksum came to an end in 960 when [[Gudit|Queen Gudit]] defeated the last king of Aksum. In response, the remnant of the Aksumite population to shift into the southern region and establish the [[Zagwe dynasty]], changing its capital to [[Lalibela]]. Zagwe's rule ended when an [[Amhara people|Amhara]] noble man [[Yekuno Amlak]] revolted against King [[Yetbarak]] and established the [[Ethiopian Empire]] (known by exonym "Abyssinia").
[[File:Bete Medhane Alem in Lalibela.JPG|thumb|201x201px|[[Biete Medhane Alem]], built during [[Zagwe dynasty]] in the Middle Ages ]]
The Ethiopian Empire initiated territorial expansion under the leadership of [[Amda Seyon I]]. He launched campaigns against his Muslim adversaries to the east, resulting in a significant shift in the balance of power in favor of the Christians for the next two centuries. After Amda Seyon's successful eastern campaigns, most of the Muslim principalities in the [[Horn of Africa]] came under the suzerainty of the Ethiopian Empire. Stretching from [[Gojjam]] to the Somali Coast in [[Zeila|Zelia]]. Among these Muslim entities was the [[Sultanate of Ifat]]. During the reign of Emperor [[Zara Yaqob]], the Ethiopian Empire reached its pinnacle. His rule was marked by the consolidation of territorial acquisitions from earlier rulers, the oversight of the construction of numerous churches and monasteries, the active promotion of literature and art, and the strengthening of central imperial authority.{{sfn|Connel|Killion|2011|p=160}} Ifat's successor, the [[Adal Sultanate]], tried to conquer Ethiopia during the [[Ethiopian–Adal War]], but was ultimately defeated at the 1543 [[Battle of Wayna Daga]].

By the 16th century, an influx of migration by ethnic [[Oromo people|Oromo]] into northern parts of the region fragmented the empire's power. Embarking from present-day [[Guji Zone|Guji]] and [[Borena Zone]], the Oromos were largely motivated by several folkloric conceptions—beginning with ''Moggaasaa'' and ''Liqimssa''—many of whom related to their raids. This persisted until ''gada'' of Meslé.{{sfn|Pankhurst|1997|p=301}} According to [[Bahrey|Abba Bahrey]], the earliest expansion occurred under Emperor [[Dawit II]] ([[Luba Melbah|''luba'' Melbah]]), when they encroached to [[Bale Province, Ethiopia|Bale]] before invading Adal Sultanate.

Ethiopia saw major diplomatic contact with Portugal from the 17th century, mainly related to religion. Beginning in 1555, Portuguese Jesuits attempted to develop Roman Catholicism as the state religion. After several failures, they sent several missionaries in 1603, including the most influential, Spanish Jesuit [[Pedro Páez|Pedro Paez]]. Under Emperor [[Susenyos I]], Roman Catholicism became the state religion of the Ethiopian Empire in 1622. This decision caused an uprising by the Orthodox populace.

===Early Modern Period (1632–1855)===
{{Main|Gondarine period|Zemene Mesafint}}
[[File:Fasil Ghebbi IV (23869587160).jpg|thumb|Fasil Ghebbi, one of the key castles of the [[Gondarine period]]]]
In 1632, Emperor [[Fasilides]] halted Roman Catholic state administration, restoring [[Orthodox Tewahedo]] as the state religion. He reclaimed lands, and exiled [[Jesuits]] to [[Fremona]]. During his rule, Fasilides constructed the iconic royal fortress, [[Fasil Ghebbi]], built forty-four churches, and revived [[Ethiopian art]]. He is also credited with building seven stone bridges over the [[Blue Nile River]].

Gondar's power declined after the death of [[Iyasu I]] in 1706. Following [[Iyasu II]]'s death in 1755, Empress [[Mentewab]] brought her brother, [[Ras (title)|Ras]] Wolde Leul, to Gondar, making him Ras Bitwaded. This led to regnal conflict between Mentewab's ''Quaregnoch'' and the Wollo group led by Wubit. In 1767, Ras [[Mikael Sehul]], a regent in [[Tigray Province]], seized Gondar, killing the child [[Iyoas I]] in 1769, the reigning emperor, and installed 70-year-old [[Yohannes II]].

Between 1769 and 1855, Ethiopia witnessed the [[Zemene Mesafint]] or "Age of Princes," a period of isolation. Emperors became figureheads, controlled by regional lords and noblemen like ''Ras'' Mikael Sehul, Ras [[Wolde Selassie]] of Tigray, and by the [[Yejju]] Oromo dynasty of the [[Zemene Mesafint#Wara Sheh rulers (Yejju) (1784–1855)|Wara Sheh]], including Ras [[Gugsa of Yejju]]. Before the Zemene Mesafint, Emperor Iyoas I had introduced the Oromo language (''Afaan Oromo'') at court, replacing Amharic.

{{main|British expedition to Abyssinia|Menelik's Invasions|Egyptian–Ethiopian War|First Italo-Ethiopian War|Mahdist War}}Ethiopian isolationism ended following a British mission that concluded with an alliance between the two nations, but it was not until 1855 that the Amhara kingdoms of northern Ethiopia (Gondar, [[Gojjam]], and [[Shewa]]) were briefly united after the power of the emperor was restored beginning with the reign of [[Tewodros II]]. Tewodros II began a process of consolidation, centralisation, and state-building that would be continued by succeeding emperors. This process reduced the power of regional rulers, restructured the empire's administration, and created a professional army. These changes created the basis for establishing the effective sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Ethiopian state. In 1875 and 1876, Ottoman and Egyptian forces, accompanied by many European and American advisors, twice [[Egyptian–Ethiopian War|invaded Abyssinia]] but were initially defeated. From 1885 to 1889 (under [[Yohannes IV]]), Ethiopia joined the [[Mahdist War]] allied to Britain, the Ottomans, and Egypt against the Sudanese Mahdist State. In 1887, [[Menelik II]], king of [[Shewa]], invaded the [[Emirate of Harar]] after his victory at the [[Battle of Chelenqo]]. On 10 March 1889, Yohannes IV was killed by the Sudanese Khalifah Abdullah's army whilst leading his army in the [[Battle of Gallabat]].

Ethiopia, in roughly its current form, began under the reign of Menelik II, who was Emperor from 1889 until his death in 1913. From his base in the central province of Shewa, Menelik set out to annex territories to the south, east, and west — areas inhabited by the Oromo, [[Sidama people|Sidama]], Gurage, [[Welayta people|Welayta]], and other peoples. He achieved this with the help of ''Ras'' [[Gobana Dacche]]'s Shewan Oromo militia, which occupied lands that had not been held since [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]]'s war, as well as other areas that had never been under Ethiopian rule.

For his leadership, despite opposition from more traditional elements of society, Menelik II was heralded as a national hero. He had signed the [[Treaty of Wuchale]] with Italy in May 1889, by which Italy would recognize Ethiopia's sovereignty so long as Italy could control an area north of Ethiopia (now part of modern Eritrea). In return, Italy was to provide Menelik with weapons and support him as emperor. The Italians used the time between the signing of the treaty and its ratification by the Italian government to expand their territorial claims. This [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]] culminated in the [[Battle of Adwa]] on 1 March 1896, in which Italy's colonial forces were defeated by the Ethiopians. During this time, about a third of the population died in the [[Famines in Ethiopia|Great Ethiopian Famine]] (1888 to 1892), and the [[1890s African rinderpest epizootic|rinderpest]] swept through the area, destroying much of the herd economy. On 11 October 1897, Ethiopia adopted the [[Pan-African colours|colours of the pan-African flag]] with green, yellow and red stripes in representation of [[pan-Africanist]] ideology.

===Haile Selassie I era (1916–1974)===
{{main|Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian Ethiopia|Italian East Africa|Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea|Eritrean War of Independence}}

[[File:Emperor Haile Selassie I with President FDR.jpg|thumb|[[Haile Selassie|Emperor Haile Selassie I]] with U.S. president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during the end of World War II]]
The early 20th century was marked by the reign of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] (''Ras Tafari''). He came to power after [[Lij Iyasu]] was deposed, and undertook [[Modernization under Haile Selassie|a nationwide modernization campaign]] from 1916 when he was made a ''Ras'' and Regent (''Inderase'') for the [[Queen regnant|Empress Regnant]] [[Zewditu]], and became the ''de facto'' ruler of the Ethiopian Empire. Following Zewditu's death, on 2 November 1930, he succeeded her as emperor. In 1931, Haile Selassie endowed Ethiopia with [[1931 Constitution of Ethiopia|its first constitution]] in emulation of Imperial Japan's [[Meiji Constitution|1890 Constitution]].
The independence of Ethiopia was interrupted by the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], beginning when it was invaded by [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Italy]] in early October 1935, and by subsequent Italian rule of the country (1936–1941) after Italian victory in the war. Italy, however, never managed to secure the country in its totality, due to resistance from the [[Arbegnoch]]; this made Ethiopia, along with [[Liberia]], the only African countries to never be colonized. Following the entry of Italy into [[World War II]], [[British Empire]] forces, together with the Arbegnoch, liberated Ethiopia in the course of the [[East African campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]] in 1941. The country was placed under [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration (Ethiopia)|British military administration]], and then Ethiopia's full [[sovereignty]] was restored with the signing of the [[Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement]] in December 1944.

On 24 October 1945, Ethiopia became a founding member of the [[United Nations]]. In 1952, Haile Selassie orchestrated a [[Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea|federation with Eritrea]]. He dissolved this in 1962 and annexed Eritrea, resulting in the [[Eritrean War of Independence]]. Haile Selassie also played a leading role in the formation of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU). Opinion within Ethiopia turned against Haile Selassie, owing to the worldwide [[1973 oil crisis]] causing a sharp increase in gasoline prices starting on 13 February 1974, leading to student and worker protests. The feudal oligarchical cabinet of [[Aklilu Habte-Wold]] was toppled, and a new government was formed with [[Endelkachew Makonnen]] serving as Prime Minister.

===Derg era (1974–1991)===
{{see also|Ethiopian Revolution|Derg|People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia|Ethiopian Civil War|Red Terror (Ethiopia){{!}}Red Terror|1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia}}
[[File:Mengistu Haile Mariam 3.jpg|thumb|[[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] was sentenced to death [[Trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] for committing [[Red Terror (Ethiopia)|crimes during his rule]].|164x164px]]

Haile Selassie's rule ended on 12 September 1974, when he was [[1974 Ethiopian coup d'état|deposed]] by the [[Derg]], a committee made up of military and police officers. After the execution of [[Massacre of the Sixty|60 former government and military officials]], the new [[Provisional Military Administrative Council]] abolished the monarchy in March 1975 and established Ethiopia as a [[Marxist-Leninist state]]. The abolition of [[feudalism]], increased [[literacy]], [[nationalization]], and sweeping [[land reform]] including the [[Resettlement and villagization in Ethiopia|resettlement and villagization]] from the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] became priorities.

After a power struggle in 1977, [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] gained undisputed leadership of the Derg. In 1977, Somalia, which had previously been receiving assistance and arms from the [[USSR]], invaded Ethiopia in the [[Ogaden War]], capturing part of the [[Ogaden]] region. Ethiopia recovered it after it began receiving massive military aid from the Soviet bloc countries. By the end of the seventies, Mengistu presided over the second-largest army in all of [[sub-Saharan Africa]], as well as a formidable [[Ethiopian Air Force|air force]] and navy.

In 1976–78, up to 500,000 were killed as a result of the [[Red Terror (Ethiopia)|Red Terror]], a violent [[political repression]] campaign by the Derg against various opposition groups. In 1987, the Derg dissolved itself and established the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] (PDRE) upon the adoption of the [[1987 Constitution of Ethiopia]]. A [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia|1983–85 famine]] affected around 8 million people, resulting in 1 million dead. Insurrections against [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] rule sprang up, particularly in the northern regions of Eritrea and Tigray. The [[Tigray People's Liberation Front]] (TPLF) merged with other ethnically based opposition movements in 1989, to form the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF).

The collapse of [[Marxism–Leninism]] during the [[revolutions of 1989]] coincided with the Soviet Union stopping aid to Ethiopia altogether in 1990. EPRDF forces advanced on Addis Ababa in May 1991, and Mengistu fled the country and was granted asylum in Zimbabwe.

In July 1991, the EPRDF convened a National Conference to establish the [[Transitional Government of Ethiopia]] composed of an 87-member [[Council of Representatives of Ethiopia|Council of Representatives]] and guided by a national charter that functioned as a transitional constitution.{{sfn|Lyons|1996|pp=121–23}} In 1994, a new constitution was written that established a parliamentary republic with a bicameral legislature and a judicial system.

In April 1993, [[Eritrea]] gained independence from Ethiopia after a [[1993 Eritrean independence referendum|national referendum]]. In May 1998, a border dispute with Eritrea led to the [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War]], which lasted until June 2000 and cost both countries an estimated $1&nbsp;million a day. This had a negative effect on Ethiopia's economy, and a [[Eritrean–Ethiopian border conflict|border conflict]] between the two countries would continue [[2018 Eritrea–Ethiopia summit|until 2018]]. As of 2018, further [[Ethiopian civil conflict (2018–present)|civil war in Ethiopia]] continues, mainly due to destabilization of the country.

[[Human rights in Ethiopia#Ethnic violence|Ethnic violence rose]] during the late 2010s and early 2020s, with various clashes and conflicts leading to millions of Ethiopians being displaced.

The federal government decided that elections for 2020 (later being [[2021 Ethiopian general election|rescheduled to 2021]]) be cancelled, due to health and safety concerns about [[COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia|COVID-19]]. The [[Tigray Region]]'s TPLF opposed this, and [[2020 Tigray regional election|proceeded to hold elections]] anyway on 9 September 2020. Relations between the federal government and Tigray deteriorated rapidly, and in November 2020, Ethiopia began a military offensive in Tigray in response to [[Northern Command attacks (Ethiopia)|attacks on army units stationed]] there, marking the beginning of the [[Tigray war]]. By March 2022, as many as 500,000 people had died as a result of [[War crimes in the Tigray war|violence]] and [[Famine in northern Ethiopia (2020–present)|famine]]. After a number of [[Tigrayan peace process|peace and mediation proposals]] in the intervening years, Ethiopia and the Tigrayan rebel forces agreed to a [[Ethiopia–Tigray peace agreement|cessation of hostilities on 2 November 2022]]. Coupled with [[OLA insurgency]], the federal government relations with Fano militias, who previously allied to the government in the Tigray War, deteriorated in mid-2023, resulting in a [[War in Amhara|war in the Amhara Region]]. According to reports conducted by the [[Ethiopian Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC), mass human rights violations carried out by ENDF troops including door-to-door searches, extrajudicial killings, massacres and detentions. Notable incident includes the [[Merawi massacre]] in early 2024, which left 50 to 100 residents dead in [[Merawi, Ethiopia|Merawi]] town in Amhara.
