===Pre-colonial period===
{{Main|Pre-Columbian Antigua and Barbuda}}
[[Archaic period (North America)|Archaic-period]] hunter-gatherers called the [[Ciboney]] were the first culture present in Antigua and Barbuda. [[Radiocarbon dating|Carbon dating]] has established the earliest settlements started around 3100 BC. They were succeeded by the ceramic age pre-Columbian [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]]-speaking [[Saladoid]] people who migrated from the lower [[Orinoco River]]. They introduced agriculture, raising, among other crops, the famous [[Antigua Black Pineapple]] (''[[Ananas comosus]]''), [[maize|corn]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[chili pepper|chillies]], [[guava]], tobacco, and cotton. Later on the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] settled the island.

===European arrival and slavery===
[[Christopher Columbus]] was the first European to sight the islands in 1493.

The English settled on Antigua in 1632; [[Slavery]] was abolished in the British Empire in 1833, affecting the economy.

Part of the Leeward Islands colony, Antigua and Barbuda became part of the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]] from 1958 to 1962. Antigua and Barbuda subsequently became an associated state of the United Kingdom with full internal autonomy on 27 February 1967.

In 1995, [[Hurricane Luis]] caused severe damage on Barbuda.

The ABLP's dominance of Antiguan politics ended with the [[2004 Antiguan general election]], which was won by [[Winston Baldwin Spencer]]'s [[United Progressive Party (Antigua and Barbuda)|United Progressive Party]] (UPP). However the UPP lost the [[2014 Antiguan general election]], with the ABLP returning to power under [[Gaston Browne]]. ABLP won 15 of the 17 seats in the [[2018 Antiguan general election|2018 snap election]] under the leadership of incumbent Prime Minister Gaston Browne.

In 2016, [[Nelson's Dockyard]] was designated as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

Most of Barbuda was devastated in early September 2017 by [[Hurricane Irma]], which brought winds with speeds reaching 295&nbsp;km/h (185&nbsp;mph). The storm damaged or destroyed 95% of the island's buildings and infrastructure, leaving Barbuda "barely habitable" according to Prime Minister Gaston Browne. Nearly everyone on the island was evacuated to Antigua.
Amidst the following rebuilding efforts on Barbuda that were estimated to cost at least $100&nbsp;million, the government announced plans to revoke a century-old law of [[communal land|communal land ownership]] by allowing residents to buy land; a move that has been criticised as promoting "[[disaster capitalism]]".
