{{Main|History of Burundi|Ruanda-Urundi}}
Burundi is one of the few countries in Africa, along with its neighbour Rwanda among others (such as [[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], and [[Eswatini]]), to be a direct territorial continuation of a pre-colonial era African state. The early history of Burundi, and especially the role and nature of the country's three dominant ethnic groups, the Twa, Hutu and Tutsi, is highly debated amongst academics.

===Kingdom of Burundi===
{{Main|Kingdom of Burundi}}
The first evidence of the Burundian state dates back to the late 16th century where it emerged on the eastern foothills. Over the following centuries it expanded, annexing smaller neighbours. The Kingdom of Burundi or Urundi, in the Great Lakes region was a polity ruled by a traditional monarch with several princes beneath him; succession struggles were common. The king, known as the ''mwami'' (translated as ruler) headed a princely aristocracy (''ganwa'') which owned most of the land and required a tribute, or tax, from local farmers (mainly Hutu) and herders (mainly Tutsi). The Kingdom of Burundi was characterised by a hierarchical political authority and tributary economic exchange.

In the mid-18th century, the Tutsi royalty consolidated authority over land, production, and distribution with the development of the ubugabire—a patron-client relationship in which the populace received royal protection in exchange for tribute and land tenure. By this time, the royal court was made up of the Tutsi-Banyaruguru. They had higher social status than other pastoralists such as the Tutsi-Hima. In the lower levels of this society were generally Hutu people, and at the very bottom of the pyramid were the Twa. The system had some fluidity, however. Some Hutu people belonged to the nobility and in this way also had a say in the functioning of the state.

The classification of Hutu or Tutsi was not merely based on ethnic criteria alone. Hutu farmers that managed to acquire wealth and livestock were regularly granted the higher social status of Tutsi, some even made it to become close advisors of the ''Ganwa''. On the other hand, there are also reports of Tutsi that lost all their cattle and subsequently lost their higher status and were called Hutu. Thus, the distinction between Hutu and Tutsi was also a socio-cultural concept, instead of a purely ethnic one. There were also many reports of marriages between Hutu and Tutsi people. In general, regional ties and power struggles played a far more determining role in Burundi's politics than ethnicity. The German Empire stationed armed forces in Rwanda and Burundi during the late 1880s. The location of the present-day city of [[Gitega]] served as an administrative centre for the Ruanda-Urundi region.

During the [[World War I|First World War]], the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]] greatly affected the African Great Lakes region. The [[Belgian Congo|Belgian]] and [[British Empire|British]] colonial forces of the [[Allies of World War I|allied powers]] launched a [[Tabora offensive|coordinated attack]] on the German colony. The German army stationed in Burundi was forced to retreat by the numerical superiority of the Belgian army and by 17 June 1916, Burundi and Rwanda were occupied. The [[Force Publique]] and the British [[Lake Force]] then started a thrust to capture [[Tabora]], an administrative centre of central German East Africa. After the war, as outlined in the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Germany was forced to cede "control" of the Western section of the former German East Africa to Belgium.

On 20 October 1924, [[Ruanda-Urundi]], which consisted of modern-day Rwanda and Burundi, became a Belgian [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandate territory]], with [[Bujumbura|Usumbura]] as its capital. In practical terms it was considered part of the [[Belgian colonial empire]]. Burundi, as part of Ruanda-Urundi, continued its kingship [[dynasty]] despite the presence of European authorities.

The Belgians, however, preserved many of the kingdom's institutions; the Burundian monarchy succeeded in surviving into the post-colonial period. In the following months, Burundian political parties began to advocate for the end of Belgian colonial rule and the separation of Rwanda and Burundi.

Burundi's first [[Burundian legislative election, 1961|elections]] took place on 8 September 1961 and UPRONA, a multi-ethnic unity party led by [[Prince Louis Rwagasore]] won just over 80% of the electorate's votes. In the wake of the elections, on 13 October, the 29-year-old [[Prince Louis Rwagasore#Assassination in 1961|Prince Rwagasore was assassinated]], robbing Burundi of its most popular and well-known nationalist.

The country claimed independence on 1 July 1962, Burundi became a [[constitutional monarchy]] with Mwami Mwambutsa IV, Prince Rwagasore's father, serving as the country's king.

In 1963, King Mwambutsa appointed a Hutu prime minister, [[Pierre Ngendandumwe]], but he was assassinated on 15 January 1965 by a Rwandan Tutsi employed by the US Embassy. The assassination occurred in the broader context of the [[Congo Crisis]] during which [[Western world|Western]] anti-communist countries were confronting the communist [[People's Republic of China]] as it attempted to make Burundi a logistics base for communist insurgents battling in Congo. [[Burundian legislative election, 1965|Parliamentary elections in May 1965]] brought a majority of Hutu into the parliament, but when King Mwambutsa appointed a Tutsi prime minister, some Hutu felt this was unjust and ethnic tensions were further increased. In October 1965, an attempted [[1965 Burundian coup d'état|coup d'état]] led by the Hutu-dominated police was carried out but failed. The Tutsi dominated army, then led by Tutsi officer Captain [[Michel Micombero]] purged Hutu from their ranks and carried out reprisal attacks which ultimately claimed the lives of up to 5,000 people in a precursor to the [[Ikiza|1972 Burundian Genocide]].

King Mwambutsa, who had fled the country during the October coup of 1965, was deposed by a [[July 1966 Burundian coup d'état|coup in July 1966]] and his teenage son, [[Ntare V of Burundi|Prince Ntare V]], claimed the throne. In November that same year, the Tutsi Prime Minister, then-Captain Michel Micombero, carried out another [[November 1966 Burundian coup d'état|coup]], this time deposing Ntare, abolishing the monarchy and declaring the nation a [[republic]], though his one-party government was effectively a [[military dictatorship]]. The rebels attacked both Tutsi and any Hutu who refused to join their rebellion. During this initial Hutu outbreak, anywhere from 800 to 1200 people were killed. At the same time, King [[Ntare V of Burundi]] returned from exile, heightening political tension in the country. On 29 April 1972, the 24-year-old Ntare V was murdered. In subsequent months, the Tutsi-dominated government of [[Michel Micombero]] used the army to combat Hutu rebels and commit genocide, murdering targeted members of the Hutu majority. The total number of casualties was never established, but contemporary estimates put the number of people killed between 80,000 and 210,000. In addition, several hundred thousand Hutu were estimated to have fled the killings into [[Zaïre]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Tanzania]].

Following the civil war and genocide, Micombero became mentally distraught and withdrawn. In 1976, Colonel [[Jean-Baptiste Bagaza]], a Tutsi, led a [[1976 Burundian coup d'état|bloodless coup]] to topple Micombero and set about promoting reform. His administration drafted a new constitution in 1981, which maintained Burundi's status as a [[one-party state]].

Since Burundi's independence in 1962, two [[Burundi genocide (disambiguation)|genocides]] have taken place in the country: the 1972 mass killings of Hutus by the Tutsi-dominated army, and the mass killings of Tutsis in 1993 by the Hutu majority. Both were described as genocides in the final report of the International Commission of Inquiry for Burundi presented in 2002 to the [[United Nations Security Council]].

===First attempt at democracy and war between Tutsi National Army and Hutu population===
In June 1993, [[Melchior Ndadaye]], leader of the Hutu-dominated [[Front for Democracy in Burundi]] (FRODEBU), won the first democratic election. He became the first Hutu head of state, leading a pro-Hutu government. Though he attempted to smooth the country's bitter ethnic divide, his reforms antagonised soldiers in the Tutsi-dominated army, and he was assassinated amidst a failed military coup in October 1993, after only three months in office. The ensuing [[Burundian Civil War]] (1993–2005) saw persistent violence between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi majority army. It is estimated that some 300,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the years following the assassination.

In early 1994, the parliament elected [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]] (Hutu) to the office of president. He and [[Juvénal Habyarimana]], the president of Rwanda, both Hutus, died together [[Assassination of Habyarimana and Ntaryamira|when their airplane was shot down]] in April 1994. More refugees started fleeing to Rwanda. Speaker of Parliament, [[Sylvestre Ntibantunganya]] (Hutu), was appointed as president in October 1994. A coalition government involving 12 of the 13 parties was formed. A feared general massacre was averted, but violence broke out. A number of Hutu refugees in Bujumbura,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} the then-capital, were killed. The mainly Tutsi Union for National Progress withdrew from the government and parliament.

In 1996, [[Pierre Buyoya]] (Tutsi) again took power through a [[1996 Burundian coup d'état|coup d'état]]. He suspended the constitution and was sworn in as president in 1998. This was the start of his second term as president, after his first term from 1987 to 1993. In response to rebel attacks, the government forced much of the population to move to [[refugee camp]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}} Under Buyoya's rule, long peace talks started, mediated by [[South Africa]]. Both parties signed agreements in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Pretoria]], South Africa, to share power in Burundi. The agreements took four years to plan.

On 28 August 2000, a transitional government for Burundi was planned as a part of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement. The transitional government was placed on a trial basis for five years. After several aborted cease-fires, a 2001 peace plan and power-sharing agreement has been relatively successful. A cease-fire was signed in 2003 between the Tutsi-controlled Burundian government and the largest Hutu rebel group, CNDD-FDD (National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy).

In 2003, FRODEBU leader [[Domitien Ndayizeye]] (Hutu) was elected president.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}} In early 2005, ethnic quotas were formed for determining positions in Burundi's government. Throughout the year, elections for parliament and president occurred.

[[Pierre Nkurunziza]] (Hutu), once a leader of a rebel group, was elected president in 2005. {{As of|2008}}, the Burundian government was talking with the Hutu-led Palipehutu-National Liberation Forces (NLF) to bring peace to the country.

===Peace agreements===
African leaders began a series of peace talks between the warring factions following a request by the United Nations Secretary General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] for them to intervene in the humanitarian crisis. Talks were initiated under the aegis of former Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] in 1995; following his death, South African President [[Nelson Mandela]] took the helm. As the talks progressed, South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]] and United States President [[Bill Clinton]] also lent their respective weight.

The main objective was to transform the Burundian government and military structurally in order to bridge the ethnic gap between the Tutsi and Hutu. It was to take place in two major steps. First, a transitional power-sharing government would be established, with the presidents holding office for three-year terms. The second objective involved a restructuring of the armed forces, where the two groups would be represented equally.

As the protracted nature of the peace talks demonstrated, the mediators and negotiating parties confronted several obstacles. First, the Burundian officials perceived the goals as "unrealistic" and viewed the treaty as ambiguous, contradictory and confusing. Second, and perhaps most importantly, the Burundians believed the treaty would be irrelevant without an accompanying cease fire. This would require separate and direct talks with the rebel groups. The main Hutu party was skeptical of the offer of a power-sharing government; they alleged that they had been deceived by the Tutsi in past agreements.

In 2000, the Burundian President signed the treaty, as well as 13 of the 19 warring Hutu and Tutsi factions. Disagreements persisted over which group would preside over the nascent government, and when the ceasefire would begin. The spoilers of the peace talks were the hardliner Tutsi and Hutu groups who refused to sign the accord; as a result, violence intensified. Three years later at a summit of African leaders in Tanzania, the Burundian president and the main opposition Hutu group signed an accord to end the conflict; the signatory members were granted ministerial posts within the government. However, smaller militant Hutu groups – such as the Forces for National Liberation – remained active.

===UN involvement===

Between 1993 and 2003, many rounds of peace talks, overseen by regional leaders in Tanzania, South Africa and [[Uganda]], gradually established power-sharing agreements to satisfy the majority of the contending groups. Initially the South African Protection Support Detachment was deployed to protect Burundian leaders returning from exile. These forces became part of the [[African Union Mission in Burundi|African Union Mission to Burundi]], deployed to help oversee the installation of a transitional government. In June 2004, the UN stepped in and took over peacekeeping responsibilities as a signal of growing international support for the already markedly advanced peace process in Burundi.

The mission's mandate, under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]], has been to monitor cease-fire, carry out disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former military personnel, support humanitarian assistance and refugee and IDP return, assist with elections, protect international staff and Burundian civilians, monitor Burundi's troublesome borders, including halting illicit arms flows, and assist in carrying out institutional reforms including those of the Constitution, judiciary, armed forces and police. The mission has been allotted 5,650 military personnel, 120 civilian police and about 1,000 international and local civilian personnel. The mission has been functioning well. It has greatly benefited from the transitional government, which has functioned and is in the process of transitioning to one that will be popularly elected. This institutional design provides an original contribution from Burundian negotiators and constitution makers to institutional options to manage ethnic conflict.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}

===2006 to 2018===
[[File:BujumburaFromCathedral.jpg|thumb|alt=aerial view of highrise building and low rise red roofed buildings|View of the economic capital city Bujumbura in 2006]]
Reconstruction efforts in Burundi started to practically take effect after 2006. The UN shut down its peacekeeping mission and re-focused on helping with reconstruction. Toward achieving [[economic reconstruction]], Rwanda, [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|D.R.Congo]] and Burundi relaunched the regional [[Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries]]. In September 2007, rival FLN factions clashed in the capital, killing 20 fighters and causing residents to begin fleeing. Rebel raids were reported in other parts of the country. In late 2007 and early 2008, FLN combatants attacked government-protected camps where former combatants were living. The homes of rural residents were also pillaged.

The UN has attempted to evaluate the impact of its peace-building initiatives. In the early 2010s, the UN peacekeeping mission in Burundi sought to assess the success of its Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration program by counting the number of arms that had been collected, given the prevalence of arms in the country. However, these evaluations failed to include data from local populations, which are significant in impact evaluations of peacebuilding initiatives.

As of 2012, Burundi was participating in African Union peacekeeping missions, including the [[African Union Mission to Somalia|mission to Somalia]] against Al-Shabaab militants. In 2014, the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Burundi)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] was established, initially for four years and then extended for another four in 2018.

====2015 unrest====
{{Main|Burundian unrest (2015–2018)}}
In April 2015 protests broke out after the ruling party announced President [[Pierre Nkurunziza]] would seek a third term in office. Protestors claimed Nkurunziza could not run for a third term in office but the country's constitutional court agreed with Nkurunziza (although some of its members had fled the country at the time of its vote).

[[2015 Burundian coup d'état attempt|An attempted coup d'état on 13 May]] failed to depose Nkurunziza.

 He returned to Burundi, began purging his government, and arrested several of the coup leaders. Following the attempted coup, however, protests continued; over 100,000 people had fled the country by 20 May, causing a humanitarian emergency. There are reports of continued and widespread abuses of human rights, including unlawful killings, torture, disappearances, and restrictions on freedom of expression.

Despite calls by the [[United Nations]], the [[African Union]], the United States, France, [[South Africa]], Belgium, and various other governments to refrain, the ruling party [[Burundian legislative election, 2015|held parliamentary elections on 29 June]], but these were boycotted by the opposition.

On 30 September 2016, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] established the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi through resolution 33/24. Its mandate is to "conduct a thorough investigation into human rights violations and abuses committed in Burundi since April 2015, to identify alleged perpetrators and to formulate recommendations." On 29 September 2017 the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi called on Burundian government to put an end to serious [[human rights violations]]. It further stressed that, "The Burundian government has so far refused to cooperate with the Commission of Inquiry, despite the Commission's repeated requests and initiatives." The violations the Commission documented include [[arrests|arbitrary arrests]] and detentions, acts of [[torture]] and cruel, [[inhuman or degrading treatment]], [[extrajudicial execution]]s, [[enforced disappearances]], [[rape]] and other forms of sexual violence." However, much to the surprise of most observers, Nkurunziza later announced that he did not intend to serve another term, paving the way for a new president to be elected in the [[2020 Burundian general election|2020 general election]].

On 20 May 2020, [[Évariste Ndayishimiye|Evariste Ndayishimiye]], a candidate who was hand-picked as Nkurunziza's successor by the CNDD-FDD, won the election with 71.45% of the vote. Shortly after, on 9 June 2020, Nkurunziza died of a cardiac arrest, at the age of 55. As per the constitution, [[Pascal Nyabenda]], the president of the national assembly, led the government until Ndayishimiye's inauguration on 18 June 2020.

In November 2022, in challenges to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] and the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], Burundi's economic growth increased slightly to 3 percent, according to an assessment of the [[International Monetary Fund]].

Currently, Burundi remains as one of the poorest nations on Earth based on a [[Gross National Income]] (GNI) of $270 per capita.

The [[2025 Goma offensive|fall of Goma]] in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in January 2025 was the largest escalation of the [[Kivu conflict|conflict in Kivu]] since 2012 and raised concerns that the Rwandan-backed [[M23 campaign (2022–present)|M23 rebel campaign]] could turn into a larger regional war due to the presence of troops from Rwanda and Burundi in the [[Kivu]] provinces. Thousands of soldiers had been deployed to assist the [[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese army]] in [[South Kivu]] by Burundi, which has a Hutu-dominated government and previously accused Rwanda of backing a [[2015 Burundian coup attempt|2015 coup attempt]], adding to concern for the potential of a larger regional war.
