[[File:Codex aureus Epternacensis folio 24 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Text page from the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]], an important surviving codex, was produced in the [[Abbey of Echternach]] in the 11th century.]]

The first traces of settlement in what is now Luxembourg are dated back to the [[Paleolithic Age]], about 35,000 years ago. From the 6th century BC, [[Celtic tribes]] settled in the region between the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Meuse]].

Six centuries later the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] named the Celtic tribes inhabiting these exact regions collectively as the ''[[Treveri]]''. Many examples of archaeological evidence proving their existence in Luxembourg have been discovered, the most famous being the Oppidum of [[Titelberg]].

In around 58 to 51 BC, the Romans invaded the country when [[Julius Caesar]] [[Gallic Wars|conquered Gaul]] and part of [[Germania]] up to the Rhine border, thus the area of what is now Luxembourg became part of the [[Roman Empire]] for the next 450 years, living in relative peace under the [[Pax Romana]].

Similar to those in Gaul, the Celts of Luxembourg adopted Roman culture, language, morals and a way of life, effectively becoming what historians later described as [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman civilization]]. Evidence from that period includes the [[Dalheim Ricciacum]] and the [[Vichten|Vichten mosaic]], on display at the [[National Museum of History and Art]] in Luxembourg City.

The territory was infiltrated by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Franks]] from the 4th century, and was abandoned by Rome in AD 406,{{rp|page = 65}} after which it became part of the [[Kingdom of the Franks]]. The Salian Franks who settled in the area are often described as the ones having brought the Germanic language to present-day Luxembourg, since the [[Frankish language|old Frankish]] language spoken by them is considered by linguists to be a direct forerunner of the [[Moselle Franconian language|Moselle Franconian dialect]], which later evolved into, among others, the modern-day [[Luxembourgish|Luxembourgish language]].

The [[Christianization]] of Luxembourg is usually dated back to the end of the 7th century. The most famous figure in this context is [[Willibrord]], a [[Northumbria]]n missionary saint, who together with other monks established the [[Abbey of Echternach]] in AD 698, and is celebrated annually in the [[dancing procession of Echternach]]. For a few centuries the abbey would become one of northern Europe's most influential abbeys. The [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]], an important surviving codex written entirely in gold ink, was produced here in the 11th century.

=== Emergence and expansion (963–1312) ===
{{Main|County of Luxembourg}}

[[File:Charles IV-John Ocko votive picture-fragment.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], the 14th-century Holy Roman Emperor and King of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] from the [[House of Luxembourg]]]]

When the [[Carolingian Empire]] was divided many times starting with the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843, today's Luxembourgish territory became successively part of the [[Kingdom of Middle Francia]] (843–855), the [[Kingdom of Lotharingia]] (855–959) and finally of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] (959–1059), which itself had become a state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

The recorded history of Luxembourg begins with the acquisition of ''Lucilinburhuc'' (today [[Luxembourg Castle]]) situated on the [[Bock (Luxembourg)|Bock]] rock by [[Siegfried of Luxembourg|Siegfried, Count of the Ardennes]], in 963 through an exchange act with [[St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier]]. Around this [[Fortifications|fort]], a town gradually developed, which became the center of a state of great strategic value within the Duchy of Lorraine.

By the middle of the 13th century, the counts of Luxembourg had managed to gain considerable wealth and power and had expanded their territory from the river [[Meuse]] to the [[Moselle]]. By the time of the reign of [[Henry V, Count of Luxembourg|Henry V the Blonde]], [[Bitburg]], [[La Roche-en-Ardenne]], [[Durbuy]], [[Arlon]], [[Thionville]], [[Marville, Meuse|Marville]], [[Longwy]], and in 1264 the competing [[County of Vianden]] (and with it [[St Vith]] and [[Schleiden]]) had either been incorporated directly or become [[vassal states]] to the [[County of Luxembourg]]. The only major setback during their rise in power came in 1288, when [[Henry VI, Count of Luxembourg|Henry VI]] and his three brothers died at the [[Battle of Worringen]] while trying unsuccessfully to add the [[Duchy of Limburg]] to their realm. But despite the defeat, the Battle of Worringen helped the Counts of Luxembourg to achieve military glory, which they had previously lacked, as they had mostly enlarged their territory by means of inheritances, marriages and fiefdoms.

The ascension of the Counts of Luxembourg culminated when [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] became [[King of the Romans]], [[King of Italy]] and finally, in 1312, [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

=== Golden Age (1312–1443) ===

With the ascension of Henry VII as Emperor, the dynasty of the [[House of Luxembourg]] not only began to rule the [[Holy Roman Empire]], but rapidly began to exercise growing influence over other parts of Central Europe as well.

Henry's son, [[John the Blind]], in addition to being Count of Luxembourg, also became [[King of Bohemia]]. He remains a major figure in Luxembourgish history and [[folklore]] and is considered by many historians the epitome of [[chivalry]] in medieval times. He is also known for having founded the [[Schueberfouer]] in 1340 and for his heroic death at the [[Battle of Crécy]] in 1346. John the Blind is considered a [[Folk hero|national hero]] in Luxembourg.

In the 14th and early 15th centuries, three more members of the House of Luxembourg reigned as Holy Roman Emperors and Bohemian Kings: John's descendants [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] (who also was [[King of Hungary|King of Hungary and Croatia]]), and [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia|Wenceslaus IV]]. Charles IV created the long-lasting [[Golden Bull of 1356]], a decree which fixed important aspects of the constitutional structure of the Empire. Luxembourg remained an independent fief (county) of the Holy Roman Empire, and in 1354, Charles IV elevated it to the status of a [[duchy]] with his half-brother [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg|Wenceslaus I]] becoming the first [[Duke of Luxembourg]]. While his kin were occupied ruling and expanding their power within the Holy Roman Empire and elsewhere, Wenceslaus, annexed the [[County of Chiny]] in 1364, and with it, the territories of the new [[Duchy of Luxembourg]] reached its greatest extent.

During these 130 years, the House of Luxembourg was contending with the [[House of Habsburg]] for supremacy within the Holy Roman Empire and Central Europe. It all came to end in 1443, when the House of Luxembourg suffered a succession crisis, precipitated by the lack of a male heir to assume the throne. Since Sigismund and [[Elizabeth of Görlitz]] were both heirless, all possessions of the Luxembourg Dynasty were redistributed among the European aristocracy. The Duchy of Luxembourg become a possession of [[Philip the Good]], [[Duke of Burgundy]].

As the House of Luxembourg had become extinct and Luxembourg now became part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], this would mark the start of nearly 400 years of foreign rule over Luxembourg.

=== Habsburg rule and French invasions (1444–1794) ===
{{See also|Fortress of Luxembourg}}

In 1482, [[Philip the Handsome]] inherited all of what became then known as the [[Habsburg Netherlands]], and with it the Duchy of Luxembourg. For nearly 320 years Luxembourg would remain a possession of the mighty House of Habsburg, at first under Austrian rule (1506–1556), then under [[Spanish Netherlands|Spanish rule (1556–1714)]], before going back again to [[Austrian Netherlands|Austrian rule (1714–1794)]].<br />
With having become a Habsburg possession, the Duchy of Luxembourg became, like many countries in Europe at the time, heavily involved in the many conflicts for dominance of Europe between the Habsburg-held countries and the [[Kingdom of France]].

In 1542, the [[King of France]], [[Francis I of France|François I]], invaded Luxembourg twice, but the Habsburgs under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] managed to reconquer the Duchy each time.

Luxembourg became part of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in 1556, and when France and Spain [[Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659)|went to war in 1635]] it resulted in the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], in which [[Partitions of Luxembourg|the first partition of Luxembourg]] was decided. Under the Treaty, Spain ceded the Luxembourgish fortresses of [[Stenay]], Thionville, and [[Montmédy]], and the surrounding territory to France, effectively reducing the size of Luxembourg for the first time in centuries.

In context of the [[Nine Years' War]] in 1684, [[Siege of Luxembourg (1684)|France invaded Luxembourg again]], conquering and occupying the Duchy until 1697 when it was returned to the Spanish to garner support for the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] cause during the prelude to the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. When the war broke out in 1701 Luxembourg and the Spanish Netherlands were administered by the pro-French faction under the governor [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]] and sided with the Bourbons. The duchy was subsequently occupied by the pro-Austrian allied forces during the conflict and was awarded to Austria at its conclusion in 1714.

As the Duchy of Luxembourg repeatedly passed back and forth from Spanish and Austrian to French rule, each of the conquering nations contributed to strengthening and expanding the [[Fortress of Luxembourg|Fortress]] that the Castle of Luxembourg had become over the years. One example of this includes French military engineer [[Marquis de Vauban]] who advanced the fortifications around and on the heights of the city, fortification walls that are still visible today. However the Fortress of Luxembourg [[Siege of Luxembourg (1794–95)|resisted for nearly 7 months]] before the Austrian forces holding it surrendered. Luxembourg's long defence led [[Lazare Carnot]] to call Luxembourg "the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar", giving rise to the city's nickname ''the Gibraltar of the North''.

Luxembourg was annexed by France, becoming the [[Forêts|''département des forêts'']] (department of forests), and the incorporation of the former Duchy as a ''département'' into France was formalized at the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] in 1797. When the French Army introduced military duty for the local population, riots broke out which culminated in 1798 when Luxembourgish peasants started a rebellion.

However, many republican ideas of this era continue to have a lasting effect on Luxembourg; one of the many examples features the implementation of the Napoleonic [[Napoleonic Code|Code Civil]] which was introduced in 1804 and is still valid today.

=== National awakening (1815–1890) ===
{{See also|Luxembourg question}}
After the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|defeat]] of [[Napoleon]] in 1815, the [[Congress of Vienna]] decided to restore the Duchy of Luxembourg. However, as the territory had been part of the Holy Roman Empire as well as the Habsburgian Netherlands in the past, both the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the newly formed [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], which included both the present Kingdom of the Netherlands and Belgium, now claimed possession of the territory. Thus the great powers decided that Luxembourg would become a member state of the newly formed [[German Confederation]], but at the same time would be joined with the Netherlands in [[personal union]] under [[King William I of the Netherlands]], the son of the last Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic, William V, Prince of Orange. To satisfy Prussia, it was decided that not only would the [[Fortress of Luxembourg]] be manned by [[Prussian Army|Prussian troops]], but also that large parts of Luxembourgish territory (mainly the areas around Bitburg and St. Vith) would become Prussian possessions. This marked the second time that the Duchy of Luxembourg was reduced in size and is generally known as the [[Partitions of Luxembourg|Second Partition of Luxembourg]]. To compensate the Duchy for this loss, it was decided to elevate the Duchy to a [[Grand Duchy]], thus giving the Dutch monarchs the additional title of [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]. However, from 1816 to 1830, [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] ignored the Duchy's sovereignty, treating Luxembourg as a conquered nation while subjecting Luxembourg to high taxes.

After Belgium became an independent country following the victorious [[Belgian Revolution|Belgian Revolution of 1830–1831]], it claimed the entire Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg as being part of Belgium. However, neither the Dutch King, who was also Grand Duke of Luxembourg, nor Prussia wanted to lose their grip on the mighty fortress of Luxembourg and therefor did not agree with the Belgian claims. The dispute would be resolved at the [[Treaty of London (1839)|1839 Treaty of London]], where the [[Partitions of Luxembourg|Third Partition of Luxembourg]] was decided. This time the territory was reduced by more than half, as the predominantly [[francophone]] [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|western part of the country]] (but also the then Luxembourgish-speaking part of [[Arelerland]]) was transferred to the new Kingdom of Belgium under [[Leopold I of Belgium]], thereby giving Luxembourg its modern-day borders. The treaty of 1839 also established full independence of the remaining Germanic-speaking Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg.

In 1842, Luxembourg joined the German Customs Union (''[[Zollverein]]''). This resulted in the opening of the German market, the development of [[Steel industry in Luxembourg|Luxembourg's steel industry]], and expansion of [[Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois|Luxembourg's railway network]] from 1855 to 1875.

After the [[Luxembourg Crisis]] of 1866 nearly led to war between Prussia and France, as both were unwilling to see the other taking influence over Luxembourg and its mighty fortress, the Grand Duchy's independence and neutrality were reaffirmed by the [[Treaty of London, 1867|Second Treaty of London]] and Prussia was finally willing to withdraw its troops from the Fortress of Luxembourg under the condition that the fortifications would be dismantled. That happened the same year. At the time of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] in 1870, Luxembourg's neutrality was respected, and neither France nor Germany invaded the country.

As a result of the recurring disputes between the major European powers, the people of Luxembourg gradually developed a consciousness of independence and a national awakening took place in the 19th century. The people of Luxembourg began referring to themselves as ''[[Luxembourgers]]'', rather than being part of one of the larger surrounding nations. This consciousness of ''[[Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinn]]'' ("''We want to remain what we are")'' culminated in 1890, when the last step towards full independence was finally taken: due to a succession crisis the [[Dutch monarchy]] ceased to hold the title Grand-Duke of Luxembourg. Beginning with [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg]], the Grand-Duchy would have [[Nassau-Weilburg|its own monarchy]], thus reaffirming its full independence.

=== German occupations and interwar political crisis (1890–1945) ===
{{See also|German occupation of Luxembourg during World War I|German occupation of Luxembourg during World War II}}
[[File:Alsace-lorraine.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Frontier with Alsace-Lorraine from 1871 to 1918]]

In August 1914, during [[World War I]], [[Imperial Germany]] violated Luxembourg's [[Neutral country|neutrality]] by invading it to defeat France. Nevertheless, despite the [[German occupation of Luxembourg during World War I|German occupation]], Luxembourg was allowed to maintain much of its independence and political mechanisms. Unaware of the fact that Germany secretly planned to annex the Grand-Duchy in case of a German victory (the [[Septemberprogramm]]), the Luxembourgish government continued to pursue a policy of strict neutrality. However, the Luxembourgish population did not believe Germany had good intentions, fearing that it would annex Luxembourg. Around 1,000 Luxembourgers served in the French army; their sacrifices have been commemorated at the [[Gëlle Fra]].

After the war, Grand-Duchess [[Marie-Adélaïde, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Marie-Adélaïde]] was seen by many people (including the French and Belgian governments) as having collaborated with the Germans and calls for her abdication and the establishment of a Republic became louder. After the retreat of the [[German Imperial Army|German army]], communists in Luxembourg City and [[Esch-sur-Alzette]] tried to establish a [[Soviet republic (system of government)|soviet worker's republic]] similar to the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|ones emerging in Germany]], but these attempts lasted only 2 days.

France questioned the Luxembourgish government's, and especially Marie-Adélaïde's, neutrality during the war, and calls for an annexation of Luxembourg to either France or Belgium grew louder in both countries. In January 1919, a company of the [[Luxembourgish Army]] rebelled, declaring itself to be the army of the new republic, but French troops intervened and put an end to the rebellion. The same year, in a [[1919 Luxembourg referendum|popular referendum]], 77.8% of the Luxembourgish population declared in favour of maintaining monarchy and rejected the establishment of a republic. During this time, Belgium pushed for an annexation of Luxembourg. However, all such claims were ultimately dismissed at the [[Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)|Paris Peace Conference]], thus securing Luxembourg's independence.

In 1939, the Luxembourg army increased to 425 due to Nazi Germany presence. On May 9, 1940 Luxembourg closed the defensive [[Schuster Line|Schuster line]] with Germany; one day later, Luxembourg's neutrality was violated again when [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' [[Invasion of Luxembourg|entered the country]] "entirely without justification". In contrast to the First World War, under the [[German occupation of Luxembourg during World War II]], the country was treated as German territory and informally annexed to the adjacent province of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Gau Moselland]]. This time, Luxembourg did not remain neutral as Luxembourg's [[Luxembourg government-in-exile|government in exile]] based in London supported the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], sending a small group of volunteers who participated in the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]], and multiple [[Luxembourgish Resistance|resistance groups]] formed inside the occupied country.

With 2.45% of its prewar population killed, and a third of all buildings in Luxembourg being destroyed or heavily damaged (mainly due to the [[Battle of the Bulge]]), Luxembourg suffered the highest such loss in Western Europe, but its commitment to the Allied war effort was never questioned. Around 1,000–2,500 of Luxembourg's Jews were murdered in [[the Holocaust in Luxembourg|the Holocaust]].

=== Integration into NATO and European Union (1945–) ===

The Grand Duchy became a founding member of the United Nations in 1945. Luxembourg's neutral status under the [[Constitution of Luxembourg|constitution]] formally ended in 1948, and in April 1949 it also became a founding member of [[NATO]]. During the [[Cold War]], Luxembourg continued its involvements on the side of the [[Western Bloc]]. In the early fifties a small contingent of troops fought in the [[Korean War]].
Luxembourg troops have also deployed to Afghanistan, to support [[ISAF]].

In the 1950s, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the [[European Communities]], following the 1952 establishment of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], and subsequent 1958 creations of the [[European Economic Community]] and [[European Atomic Energy Community]]. In 1993, the former two of these were incorporated into the European Union. With [[Robert Schuman]] (one of the founding fathers of the EU), [[Pierre Werner]] (considered the father of the [[Euro]]), [[Gaston Thorn]], [[Jacques Santer]] and [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] (all former presidents of the [[European Commission]]), Luxembourgish politicians contributed substantially to the EU's formation and establishment. In 1999, Luxembourg joined the [[eurozone]]. Thereafter, the country was elected non-permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council]] (2013–14).

The [[steel industry]] exploiting the [[Red Lands]]' rich iron-ore grounds in the beginning of the 20th century drove Luxembourg's industrialization. After the decline of the steel industry in the 1970s, the country focused on establishing itself as [[Economy of Luxembourg|a global financial center]] and developed into the banking hub it is reputed to be. Since the beginning of the 21st century, its governments have focused on developing the country into a [[knowledge economy]], with the founding of the [[University of Luxembourg]] and a [[Luxembourg Space Agency|national space program]]. In 2020, Luxembourg became the first country in the world to provide [[free public transport]] at a national scale.

On 19 December 2023, Luxembourg's [[Chamber of Deputies (Luxembourg)|Chamber of Deputies]] adopted a law to modernize the current investment tax credit. It took effect less than two weeks later on 1 January 2024.
