Modern humans arrived in Japan around 38,000 years ago (~36,000 BC), marking the beginning of the [[Japanese Paleolithic]]. Around 14,500&nbsp;BC (the start of the [[Jōmon period]]), a [[Mesolithic]] to [[Neolithic]] semi-sedentary [[hunter-gatherer]] culture characterized by [[pit dwelling]] and rudimentary agriculture emerged. [[Jōmon pottery|Clay vessels]] from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery. The [[Japonic]]-speaking [[Yayoi people]] later entered the archipelago from the Korean Peninsula, The [[Yayoi period]] saw the introduction of innovative practices including [[Paddy field|wet-rice farming]], a new [[Yayoi pottery|style of pottery]], and metallurgy from China and Korea. According to legend, [[Emperor Jimmu]] (descendant of [[Amaterasu]]) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning [[Imperial House of Japan|a continuous imperial line]].

Japan first appears in written history in the Chinese ''[[Book of Han]]'', completed in 111 AD, where it is described as having a hundred small kingdoms. A century later, the ''[[Book of Wei]]'' records that the kingdom of [[Yamatai]] (which may refer to [[Yamato Kingship|Yamato]]) unified most of these kingdoms. Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like [[Prince Shōtoku]], and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the [[Asuka period]] (592–710).

In 645, the government led by [[Prince Naka no Ōe]] and [[Fujiwara no Kamatari]] devised and implemented the far-reaching [[Taika Reform]]s. The Reform began with land reform, based on Confucian ideas and [[Chinese philosophy|philosophies]] from [[China]]. It nationalized all land in Japan, to be [[Equal-field system|distributed equally]] among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation. These legal reforms created the {{transliteration|ja|[[ritsuryō]]}} state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.

The [[Nara period]] (710–784) marked the emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in [[Heijō Palace|Heijō-kyō]] (modern [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent [[Japanese literature|literary culture]] with the completion of the {{transliteration|ja|[[Kojiki]]}} (712) and {{transliteration|ja|[[Nihon Shoki]]}} (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and [[Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara|architecture]]. A [[735–737 Japanese smallpox epidemic|smallpox epidemic in 735–737]] is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population. In 784, [[Emperor Kanmu]] moved the capital, settling on [[Heian-kyō]] (modern-day [[Kyoto]]) in 794.

===Feudal era===

Japan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the [[samurai]]. In 1185, following the defeat of the [[Taira clan]] by the [[Minamoto clan]] in the [[Genpei War]], samurai [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] established a [[military government]] at [[Kamakura]]. After Yoritomo's death, the [[Hōjō clan]] came to power as regents for the {{transliteration|ja|shōgun}}. 

The [[Kamakura shogunate]] repelled [[Mongol invasions of Japan|Mongol invasions]] in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually [[Kenmu Restoration|overthrown]] by [[Emperor Go-Daigo]]. The succeeding [[Ashikaga shogunate]] failed to control the feudal warlords ({{transliteration|ja|daimyō}}) and [[Ōnin War|a civil war]] began in 1467, opening the century-long [[Sengoku period]] ("Warring States").

During the 16th century, Portuguese traders and [[Jesuit]] missionaries reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West (see [[Nanban trade]] and [[Nanban art]]). [[Oda Nobunaga]] used European technology and firearms to conquer many other {{transliteration|ja|daimyō}}; his consolidation of power began what was known as the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]]. After [[Honnō-ji Incident|the death of Nobunaga]] in 1582, his successor, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], unified the nation in the early 1590s and launched [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597]]. When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600. He was appointed {{transliteration|ja|shōgun}} by [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]] in 1603 and established the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] at [[Edo]] (modern Tokyo). The shogunate enacted measures including {{transliteration|ja|[[buke shohatto]]}}, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous {{transliteration|ja|daimyō}}, and in 1639 the isolationist {{transliteration|ja|[[sakoku]]}} ("closed country") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the [[Edo period]] (1603–1868). Modern Japan's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads ([[Kaidō]]) and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as [[futures contract]]s, banking and insurance of the [[Osaka rice brokers]]. The study of Western sciences ({{transliteration|ja|[[rangaku]]}}) continued through contact with the Dutch enclave in [[Nagasaki]].

The [[United States Navy]] sent Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] to force the opening of Japan to the outside world. Arriving at [[Uraga, Kanagawa|Uraga]] with four "[[Black Ships]]" in July 1853, the [[Perry Expedition]] resulted in the March 1854 [[Convention of Kanagawa]]. Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] organized the [[Privy Council (Japan)|Privy Council]], introduced the [[Meiji Constitution]] (November 29, 1890), and assembled the [[National Diet|Imperial Diet]]. 

During the [[Meiji period]] (1868–1912), the [[Empire of Japan]] emerged as the most developed state in [[Asia]] and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence. After victories in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–1895) and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of [[Sakhalin]], The Japanese population doubled from 35&nbsp;million in 1873 to 70&nbsp;million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization.

The early 20th century saw a period of [[Taishō period|Taishō democracy]] (1912–1926) overshadowed by increasing [[expansionism]] and [[Japanese militarism|militarization]]. [[Japan during World War I|World War I]] allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], to capture [[German colonial empire|German possessions]] in the [[Pacific]] and China in [[Treaty of Versailles|1920]]. 

This process accelerated in the 1930s, spawning several radical nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931, Japan [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invaded China and occupied Manchuria]], which led to the establishment of [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932; following [[Lytton Report|international condemnation of the occupation]], it resigned from the [[League of Nations]] in 1933. In 1936, Japan signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]]; the 1940 [[Tripartite Pact]] made it one of the [[Axis powers]]. In 1940, the Empire [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|invaded French Indochina]], after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan. On December 7–8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise [[attacks on Pearl Harbor]], as well as on British forces in [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Bombing of Singapore (1941)|Singapore]], and [[Battle of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], among others, beginning [[World War II in the Pacific]]. Throughout areas occupied by Japan during the war, [[Japanese war crimes|numerous abuses]] were committed against local inhabitants. Many women were forced into [[Comfort women|sexual slavery]].   

After [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victories during the next four years, which culminated in the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945, Japan agreed to [[Surrender of Japan|an unconditional surrender]]. The war cost Japan millions of lives and many of its [[Territorial conquests of the Empire of Japan|conquered territories]], including ''[[de jure]]'' parts of Japan such as [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]], [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan]], [[Karafuto]], and the [[Kurils]]. for [[Japanese war crimes]].

In 1947, Japan adopted [[Constitution of Japan|a new constitution]] emphasizing liberal democratic practices. and Japan was granted membership in the [[United Nations]] in 1956. In 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history—the [[Tōhoku earthquake]]—triggering the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]. On May 1, 2019, after the historic [[abdication of Emperor Akihito]], his son [[Naruhito]] became Emperor, beginning the {{Lang|ja-latn|[[Reiwa]]}} era (2019-).
