===Antiquity===
[[File:Excavated site on Al Khor Island.jpg|thumb|Excavation of a [[Kassites|Kassite]] dye site on [[Al Khor Island]]]]
Human habitation in Qatar dates back to 50,000 years ago. [[Mesopotamia]]n artifacts originating from the [[Ubaid period]] (c. 6500–3800 BC) have been discovered in abandoned coastal settlements. [[Al Da'asa]], a settlement located on the western coast of Qatar, is the most important Ubaid site in the country and is believed to have accommodated a small seasonal encampment.  Some historians have theorised that the Sumerians may have originated from this region.

[[Kassites|Kassite]] [[Babylonia]]n material dating back to the second millennium BC found in [[Al Khor Island]]s attests to trade relations between the inhabitants of Qatar and the Kassites in modern-day Bahrain. Among the findings were crushed snail shells and Kassite potsherds.

In 224 AD, the [[Sasanian Empire]] gained control over the territories surrounding the Persian Gulf. Qatar played a role in the commercial activity of the Sasanids, contributing at least two commodities: precious pearls and purple dye. Under the Sasanid reign, many of the inhabitants in eastern Arabia were introduced to [[Christianity]] following the eastward dispersal of the religion by Mesopotamian Christians. Monasteries were constructed and further settlements were founded during this era. During the latter part of the Christian era, Qatar comprised a region known as 'Beth Qatraye' ([[Syriac language|Syriac]] for "house of the Qataris"). The region was not limited to Qatar; it also included [[Bahrain]], [[Tarout Island]], Al-Khatt, and [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Hasa]].

In 628, the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] sent a Muslim envoy to a ruler in eastern Arabia named [[Munzir ibn Sawa Al-Tamimi]] and requested that he and his subjects accept Islam. Munzir obliged his request, and accordingly most of the Arab tribes in the region converted to Islam.{{better source needed|date=June 2017}} In the middle of the century, the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] resulted in the fall of the Sasanian Empire.

===Early and late Islamic period (661–1783)===
[[File:Abbasids850.png|thumb|left|[[Abbasid Caliphate]] at its greatest extent, {{Circa|850}}]]
Qatar was described as a famous horse and camel breeding centre during the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] period. In the 8th century, it started benefiting from its commercially strategic position in the Persian Gulf and went on to become a centre of pearl trading.
Substantial development in the pearling industry around the Qatari Peninsula occurred during the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] era. When the caliphate's prosperity declined in Iraq, so too did it in Qatar.
Qatar is mentioned in 13th-century Muslim scholar [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]]'s book, ''[[Mu'jam Al-Buldan]]'', which alludes to the Qataris' fine striped woven cloaks and their skills in improvement and finishing of spears.

Much of eastern Arabia was controlled by the [[Usfurids]] in 1253, but control of the region was seized by the prince of [[Ormus]] in 1320. Qatar's pearls provided the kingdom with one of its main sources of income. In 1515, [[Manuel I of Portugal]] vassalised the Kingdom of Ormus. [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] went on to seize a significant portion of eastern Arabia in 1521. In 1550, the inhabitants of [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Hasa]] voluntarily submitted to the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], preferring them to the Portuguese.

=== Portuguese era (1507–1650) ===
After the fall of the [[Jabrids|Jabrid]] Dynasty with the conquest of Bahrain by the Portuguese, the Arabian coast up to [[Uqair|Al Hassa]] came under the rule and influence of the Portuguese empire. Attempts by the Ottomans to dominate the region were eliminated with the reconquest of the castle of [[Tarout Castle|Tarout]] or [[Siege of Qatif (1551)|Al Qatif]] in 1551.

Archaeological finds are still being excavated from one of the Portuguese fortresses that served as a base to dominate the region as [[Ruwayda]]. The first representation of Qatar appears on the Portuguese map by Luis Lázaro in 1563, showing the "city of Qatar" as a fortress, possibly referring to the fort of Ruwayda. Having retained a negligible military presence in the area, the Ottomans were expelled by the [[Bani Khalid (tribe)|Bani Khalid]] tribe and [[Bani Khalid Emirate|their emirate]] in 1670.

===Bahraini and Saudi rule (1783–1868)===
[[File:Map of Catura (Qatar) 1794 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|A 1794 map by [[Samuel Dunn (mathematician)|Samuel Dunn]] depicting ''Catura'' (at centre) in the [[historical region of Bahrain]]]]
In 1766, members of the [[House of Khalifa|Al Khalifa]] family of the [[Utub]] tribal confederation migrated from [[Kuwait]] to [[Zubarah]] in Qatar. By the time of their arrival, the Bani Khalid exercised weak authority over the peninsula, notwithstanding the fact that the largest village was ruled by their distant kin. In 1783, Qatar-based [[Bani Utbah]] clans and allied Arab tribes [[Bani Utbah invasion of Bahrain|invaded]] and annexed [[Bahrain]] from the Persians. The Al Khalifa imposed their authority over Bahrain and retained their jurisdiction over Zubarah. Upon being made aware of the Egyptian advance on the western frontier in 1811, the Wahhabi amir reduced his garrisons in Bahrain and Zubarah in order to redeploy his troops. [[Said bin Sultan]], Sultan of [[Muscat and Oman]], capitalised on this opportunity and raided the Wahhabi garrisons on the eastern coast, setting fire to the fort in Zubarah. The Al Khalifa was effectively returned to power thereafter.

Although Qatar was considered a [[dependent territory|dependency]] of Bahrain, the Al Khalifa faced opposition from the local tribes. In 1867, the Al Khalifa, along with the ruler of [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi]], sent a massive naval force to [[Al Wakrah]] in an effort to crush the Qatari rebels. This resulted in the maritime [[Qatari–Bahraini War]] of 1867–68, in which Bahraini and Abu Dhabi forces sacked and looted Doha and Al Wakrah. The Bahraini hostilities were in violation of the [[Perpetual Truce of Peace and Friendship]] of 1861. The joint incursion, in addition to the Qatari counter-attack, prompted British Political Resident, Colonel [[Lewis Pelly]] to impose a settlement in 1868. His mission to Bahrain and Qatar and the resulting peace treaty were milestones because they implicitly recognised the distinctness of Qatar from Bahrain and explicitly acknowledged the position of Mohammed bin Thani. In addition to censuring Bahrain for its breach of agreement, Pelly negotiated with Qatari sheikhs who were represented by Mohammed bin Thani. The negotiations were the first stage in the development of Qatar as a sheikhdom.

===Ottoman period (1871–1915)===

Under military and political pressure from the governor of the Ottoman [[Vilayet of Baghdad]], [[Midhat Pasha]], the ruling Al Thani tribe submitted to Ottoman rule in 1871. The Ottoman government imposed reformist ([[Tanzimat]]) measures concerning taxation and land registration to fully integrate these areas into the empire. In addition, the Ottomans supported the Ottoman subject Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab who attempted to supplant Al Thani as [[kaymakam]] of Qatar in 1888. This eventually led Al Thani to rebel against the Ottomans, whom he believed were seeking to usurp control of the peninsula. He resigned as kaymakam and stopped paying taxes in August 1892.

In February 1893, Mehmed Hafiz Pasha arrived in Qatar in the interests of seeking unpaid taxes and accosting Jassim bin Mohammed's opposition to proposed Ottoman administrative reforms. Fearing that he would face death or imprisonment, Jassim retreated to Al Wajbah ({{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on|order=flip|disp=or}} west of Doha), accompanied by several tribe members. Mehmed's demand that Jassim disband his troops and pledge his loyalty to the Ottomans was met with refusal. In March, Mehmed imprisoned Jassim's brother and 13 prominent Qatari tribal leaders on the Ottoman [[corvette]] ''Merrikh'' as punishment for his insubordination. After Mehmed declined an offer to release the captives for a fee of 10,000 [[Turkish lira|liras]], he ordered a column of approximately 200 troops to advance towards Jassim's [[Al Wajbah Fort]] under the command of Yusuf Effendi, thus signalling the start of the [[Battle of Al Wajbah]]. Although Qatar did not gain full independence from the Ottoman Empire, the result of the battle forced a treaty that would later form the basis of Qatar's emerging as an autonomous country within the empire.

===British period (1916–1971)===
[[File:Zubarah Fort1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zubarah Fort]] built in 1938]]
By the [[Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913]], the Ottomans agreed to renounce their claim to Qatar and withdraw their garrison from Doha. With the outbreak of [[World War I]] however, nothing was done to carry this out, and the garrison remained in the fort at Doha, although its numbers dwindled as men deserted. In 1915, with the presence of British gunboats in the harbour, Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani (who was pro-British) persuaded the remainder to abandon the fort, and when British troops approached the following morning, they found it deserted.

Qatar became a British protectorate on 3 November 1916 when the United Kingdom signed a treaty with Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani to bring Qatar under its [[Trucial States|Trucial System of Administration]]. The treaty reserved foreign affairs and defence to the United Kingdom but allowed internal autonomy. While Abdullah agreed not to enter into any relations with any other power without the prior consent of the British government, the latter guaranteed the protection of Qatar from aggression by sea and provide its 'good offices' in the event of an attack by land. This latter undertaking was left deliberately vague.

On 5 May 1935, while agreeing an oil concession with the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]], Abdullah signed another treaty with the British government which granted Qatar protection against internal and external threats.

The focus of British interests in Qatar changed after the Second World War with the independence of India, the creation of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, and the development of oil in Qatar. In 1949, the appointment of the first British political officer in Doha, John Wilton, signified a strengthening of Anglo-Qatari relations. Oil exports began in 1949, and oil revenues became the country's main source of revenue; the pearl trade had gone into decline. These revenues were used to fund the expansion and modernisation of Qatar's infrastructure.

When Britain officially announced in 1968 that it would withdraw from the Persian Gulf in three years' time, Qatar joined talks with Bahrain and seven other Trucial States to create the [[Federation of Arab Emirates]]. Regional disputes, however, persuaded Qatar and Bahrain to withdraw from the talks and become independent states separate from the Trucial States, which went on to become the [[United Arab Emirates]].

=== Independence and later (1971–2000) ===

Under an agreement with the United Kingdom, [[Ahmad bin Ali Al Thani|Ahmad bin Ali]] was the emir of Qatar. He was [[1972 Qatari coup d'état|deposed]] on 22 February 1972 by [[Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani|Khalifa bin Hamad]].

In 1991, Qatar played a significant role in the [[Gulf War]], particularly during the [[Battle of Khafji]] in which Qatari tanks rolled through the streets of the town and provided fire support for the [[Saudi Arabian National Guard]] units that were engaging [[Iraqi Army]] troops. Qatar allowed coalition troops from Canada to use the country as an [[Canada Dry One|airbase]] to launch aircraft on [[combat air patrol]] duty and also permitted air forces from the United States and France to operate in its territories. Under Emir Hamad, Qatar experienced a moderate degree of liberalisation, including the launch of the [[Al Jazeera Media Network|Al Jazeera]] television station in 1996, the endorsement of [[women's suffrage]] or right to vote in municipal elections in 1999, participation of women in society in 2003, drafting its first written [[Constitution of Qatar|constitution]] in 2005 and inauguration of a Roman Catholic church in 2008. An [[1996 Qatari coup attempt|unsuccessful counter-coup]] was staged in 1996.

===21st century===
[[File:Corniche Doha Qatar.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional [[dhow]]s in front of the West Bay skyline as seen from the [[Doha Corniche]]]]Qatar's economy and status as a [[regional power]] rapidly grew in the 2000s. According to the UN, the nation's economic growth, measured by GDP, was the fastest in the world during this decade. The basis of this growth lay in the exploitation of [[natural gas]] in the North Field during the 1990s. At the same time, the population tripled between 2001 and 2011, mostly from an influx of foreigners.

In 2003, Qatar served as the [[United States Central Command]] headquarters and one of the main launching sites of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] to topple the government of [[Saddam Hussein]]. Shortly before the invasion, Qatari government offered sanctuary to Saddam. In March 2005, a [[suicide attack|suicide bombing]] killed a British teacher at the Doha Players Theatre, shocking the country, which had not previously experienced acts of terrorism. The bombing was carried out by Omar Ahmed Abdullah Ali, an Egyptian resident in Qatar who had suspected ties to [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]].

The increased influence of Qatar and its role during the [[Arab Spring]], especially during the [[Bahraini protests of 2011–2014|2011 uprisings]] in Bahrain against King [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]], [[Qatar–Saudi Arabia diplomatic conflict|worsened longstanding tensions with Saudi Arabia]], the neighbouring [[United Arab Emirates]], and Bahrain. In 2011, Qatar joined [[2011 military intervention in Libya|NATO operations in Libya]] and reportedly armed Libyan opposition groups against [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. It was also a major funder of weapons for [[Belligerents in the Syrian civil war#Syrian opposition and allies|rebel groups]] in the [[Syrian civil war]] against [[Bashar al-Assad]]. Qatar participated in the [[Saudi-led intervention in the Yemeni civil war|Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]] against the [[Houthis]] and forces loyal to former President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]]. 

In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt and Yemen [[Qatar diplomatic crisis|broke diplomatic ties]] with Qatar, accusing Qatar of [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|supporting terrorism]]. The crisis escalated a dispute over Qatar's support of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], which is considered a terrorist organisation by some Arab nations. Qatar was expelled from the anti-Houthi coalition. The diplomatic crisis ended in January 2021 with the signing of AlUla declaration.

On 2 December 2010, Qatar won the right to host the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], making it the first country in the Middle East to be selected to host the tournament. The awarding increased further investment and developments within the nation during the 2010s. In June 2013, Sheikh [[Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani]] became the emir of Qatar after his father handed over power. Sheikh Tamim has prioritised improving the domestic welfare of citizens, which includes establishing advanced healthcare and education systems, and expanding the country's infrastructure in preparation for the hosting of the 2022 World Cup. Qatar hosted the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] from 21 November to 18 December, becoming the first Arab and Muslim-majority country to do so, and the third Asian country to host it following the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] in Japan and South Korea.
