The oldest traces of human existence in the area that later became Liechtenstein date back to the [[Middle Paleolithic]] era. [[Neolithic]] farming settlements appeared in the valleys around 5300 BCE.

The [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and [[La Tène culture]]s flourished during the late [[Iron Age]], from around 450 BCE—possibly under some influence of both the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] civilisations. One of the most important tribal groups in the Alpine region was the [[Helvetii]]. In 58 BCE, at the [[Battle of Bibracte]], [[Julius Caesar]] defeated the Alpine tribes, thereby bringing the region under [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] subjugation. By 15 BCE, [[Tiberius]]—later the second Roman emperor—with his brother, [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]], conquered the entire Alpine area.

The lands that would later become known as Liechtenstein then became integrated into the [[Roman province]] of [[Raetia]]. The area was garrisoned by the [[Imperial Roman army|Roman army]], which maintained large legionary camps at [[Bregenz|Brigantium]] (Bregenz, Austria), near [[Lake Constance]], and at [[Maienfeld|Magia]] (Maienfeld, Switzerland). The Romans built and maintained a [[Roman road|road]] which ran through the territory. Around 260 CE Brigantium was destroyed by the [[Alemanni]], a [[Germanic people]] who later settled in the area around 450.

The area that later became Liechtenstein remained under Frankish hegemony ([[Merovingians|Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] dynasties) until the [[Treaty of Verdun]] divided the Carolingian empire in 843, following the death of [[Charlemagne]] in 814.

By 1200, dominions across the Alpine plateau were controlled by the Houses of [[House of Savoy|Savoy]], [[Zähringer]], [[Habsburg]], and [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]]. Other regions were accorded the [[Imperial immediacy]] that granted the empire direct control over the mountain passes. When the Kyburg dynasty fell in 1264, the Habsburgs under [[Rudolph I of Germany|King Rudolph I]], the Holy Roman Emperor in 1273, extended their territory to the eastern Alpine plateau.

=== Foundation of a dynasty ===
{{More sources|subsection|date=April 2025}}
The family from which Liechtenstein takes its name originally came from [[Liechtenstein Castle]] in Lower Austria, which they had possessed since at least 1140 until the 13th century, and again from 1807 onwards. The Liechtensteins acquired land, predominantly in [[Moravia]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Silesia]], and [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]]. As these territories were all held in [[Fee (feudal tenure)|feudal tenure]] from more senior feudal lords, particularly various branches of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]], the Liechtenstein dynasty was unable to meet a primary requirement to qualify for a seat in the Imperial Diet (parliament), the {{lang|de|[[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]]}}. Even though several Liechtenstein princes served several Habsburg rulers as close advisers, without any territory held directly from the Imperial throne, they held little power in the Holy Roman Empire.{{cn|date=November 2024}}

For this reason, the family sought to acquire lands that would be classed as {{lang|de|unmittelbar}}, or held without any intermediate feudal tenure, directly from the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. During the early 17th century, [[Karl I, Prince of Liechtenstein|Karl I of Liechtenstein]] was made a {{lang|de|Fürst}} (prince) by the Holy Roman Emperor [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] after siding with him in a political battle. [[Hans-Adam I, Prince of Liechtenstein|Hans-Adam I]] was allowed to purchase the minuscule [[Lordship of Schellenberg|{{lang|de|Herrschaft|nocat=y}} ('Lordship') of Schellenberg]] and the [[county of Vaduz]] (in 1699 and 1712, respectively) from the Hohenems. Tiny Schellenberg and Vaduz had exactly the political status required: no feudal superior ([[suzerain]]) other than the emperor. after the lands had been purchased, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], decreed that Vaduz and Schellenberg were united and elevated the newly formed territory to the dignity of {{lang|de|Reichsfürstentum}} ([[Prince of the Holy Roman Empire|imperial principality]]) with the name "Liechtenstein" in honour of "[his] true servant, [[Anton Florian, Prince of Liechtenstein|Anton Florian of Liechtenstein]]". On this date, Liechtenstein became a [[Landeshoheit|mostly-sovereign]] [[Imperial immediacy|immediate]] member state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

The Liechtenstein Army was abolished for financial reasons In addition, popular unrest caused from economic devastation in the war directly led to the [[November 1918 Liechtenstein putsch]], which created the process of a [[Constitution of Liechtenstein|new constitution]] based on [[constitutional monarchy]] being introduced in 1921.

In 1929, 75-year-old [[Franz I, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Franz I]] succeeded to the throne. He had just married [[Elisabeth von Gutmann]], a wealthy woman from Vienna whose father was a Jewish businessman from Moravia. Although Liechtenstein had no official [[Nazi party]], a Nazi sympathy movement arose within its National Union party. [[German National Movement in Liechtenstein|Local Liechtenstein Nazis]] identified Elisabeth as their Jewish "problem". Pro-Nazi agitation remained in Liechtenstein throughout the 1930s, with an [[1939 Liechtenstein putsch|attempted coup]] in March 1939 while [[Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Franz Joseph II]] was on a state visit to [[Berlin]].

In March 1938, just after the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany]], Franz named as regent his 31-year-old grandnephew and heir-presumptive, [[Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Franz Joseph]]. After making his grandnephew regent he moved to [[Valtice|Feldsberg]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and on 25 July, he died while at one of his family's castles, Castle Feldberg, and Franz Joseph formally succeeded him as the Prince of Liechtenstein.

During [[World War II]], Liechtenstein remained officially neutral, looking to neighbouring Switzerland for assistance and guidance, while family treasures from dynastic lands and possessions in [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], and [[Silesia]] were taken to Liechtenstein for safekeeping. [[Operation Tannenbaum]], the Nazi plan for conquest of Switzerland, also included Liechtenstein, and the Nazi "Pan German" dream of uniting all German-speakers in the Reich would have also included the population of Liechtenstein. However in 1944, the Nazis abandoned implementing this plan after the [[Normandy landings|Allied invasion of France]], and Liechtenstein was spared from enduring a Nazi occupation.{{cn|date=May 2025}}

At the close of the conflict, [[Third Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] and [[Provisional Government of National Unity|Poland]], acting to seize what they considered German possessions, expropriated all of the Liechtenstein dynasty's properties in those three regions. The expropriations (subject to [[Foreign relations of Liechtenstein#International dispute with Czechoslovakia, Czech Republic and Slovakia|modern legal dispute]] at the [[International Court of Justice]]) included over {{convert|1600|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of agricultural and forest land (most notably the UNESCO listed [[Lednice–Valtice Cultural Landscape]]), and several family castles and palaces.

Liechtenstein was in dire financial straits following the end of World War II. The Liechtenstein dynasty often resorted to selling family artistic treasures, including the portrait ''[[Ginevra de' Benci]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], which was purchased by the [[National Gallery of Art]] of the United States in 1967 for {{US$|link=yes}}5&nbsp;million (${{Inflation|US|5|1967}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars), then a record price for a painting.

Citizens of Liechtenstein were forbidden to enter Czechoslovakia during the [[Cold War]]. The diplomatic conflict revolving around the controversial postwar [[Beneš decrees]] resulted in Liechtenstein not having international relations with the [[Czech Republic]] or [[Slovakia]]. Diplomatic relations were established between Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic on 13 July 2009, and with Slovakia on 9 December 2009.

On 20 September 1990, Liechtenstein was admitted into the [[United Nations]] as 160th member state. As a member of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], the microstate is one of the few not to play a prominent role in [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|UN-specialized agencies]].{{cn|date=May 2025}}

The [[Constitution of Liechtenstein]] was [[Liechtenstein constitutional referendum, 2003|amended in March 2003]] to give additional powers to the monarch.

In 2004, Prince Hans-Adam II transferred day-to-day governmental duties to his eldest son [[Alois, Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein|Hereditary Prince Alois]] as [[regent]], as his father had done to him in 1984 to prepare him for the role of Prince.

In 2005, a government-commissioned investigation revealed that Jewish slave labourers from the [[Strasshof an der Nordbahn|Strasshof]] [[concentration camp]], provided by the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], had worked on estates in Austria owned by Liechtenstein's Princely House. The report indicated that though no evidence was found of the House's knowledge of the slave labour, the House bore responsibility.
