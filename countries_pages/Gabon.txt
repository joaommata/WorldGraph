=== Pre-colonisation ===
[[African Pygmies|Bambenga]] in the area were largely replaced and absorbed by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] tribes as they migrated. By the 18th century, a [[Myene language|Myeni]]-speaking kingdom known as the [[Orungu Kingdom|Kingdom of Orungu]] formed as a trading centre with the ability to purchase and sell slaves, and fell with the demise of the slave trade in the 1870s.

=== French rule and independence ===
Explorer [[Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza]] led his first mission to the Gabon-Congo area in 1875. He founded the town of [[Franceville]] and was later colonial governor. Some Bantu groups lived in the area when France officially occupied it in 1885.

In 1910, Gabon became a territory of [[French Equatorial Africa]], a federation that survived until 1958. In [[World War II]], the Allies [[Battle of Gabon|invaded]] Gabon to overthrow the pro-[[Vichy France]] colonial administration. On 28 November 1958, Gabon became an autonomous republic within the [[French Community]], and on 17 August 1960, it became fully independent.

=== M'ba rule ===
The first president of Gabon, elected in 1961, was [[Léon M'ba]], with [[Omar Bongo Ondimba]] as his vice president. After M'ba acceded to power, the press was suppressed, political demonstrations suppressed, [[freedom of expression]] curtailed, other political parties gradually excluded from power, and the Constitution changed along French lines to vest power in the Presidency, a post that M'ba assumed himself. When M'ba dissolved the [[National Assembly (Gabon)|National Assembly]] in January 1964 to institute one-party rule, [[1964 Gabonese coup d'état|an army coup sought to oust him from power]] and restore parliamentary democracy. French paratroopers flew in within 24 hours to restore M'ba to power. After days of fighting, the coup ended, and the opposition was imprisoned, with protests and riots ensuing.{{citation needed|date=May 2025}}

=== Bongo rule and PDG ===
When M'Ba died in 1967, Bongo replaced him as president. In March 1968, Bongo declared Gabon a one-party state by dissolving BDG and establishing a new party – the [[Parti Démocratique Gabonais]] (PDG). He invited all Gabonese, regardless of previous political affiliation, to participate. Bongo sought to forge a single national movement in support of the government's development policies, using PDG as a tool to submerge the regional and tribal rivalries that had divided Gabonese politics in the past. Bongo was elected president in February 1975; in April 1975, the position of vice president was abolished and replaced by the position of prime minister, who had no right to automatic succession. Bongo was re-elected President in December 1979 and November 1986 two 7-year terms.

Against this backdrop of political volatility, Gabon achieved significant milestones on the international stage. In June 2021, it became the first country to receive payments for reducing emissions resulting from deforestation and forest degradation. Additionally, in June 2022, Gabon, along with [[Togo]], joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], signalling its commitment to multilateral engagement and cooperation.

=== 2023 coup d'état ===
{{Main|2023 Gabonese coup d'état}}
In August 2023, following the announcement that Ali Bongo had won a third term in the [[2023 Gabonese general election|general election]], military officers announced that they had taken power in a [[2023 Gabonese coup d'état|coup d'état]] and cancelled the election results. They also dissolved state institutions, including the Judiciary, Parliament and the constitutional assembly.  On 31 August 2023, army officers who seized power, ending the Bongo family's 55-year hold on power, named Gen [[Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema|Brice Oligui Nguema]] as the country's transitional leader. On 4 September 2023, General Nguema was sworn in as interim president of Gabon.

As a consequence of the coup, on the 18 September, 2023, Gabon was partially suspended from the Commonwealth of Nations. The partial suspension excluded Gabon from the Councils of the Commonwealth, and the organization's meetings and events, such as the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]]. This was done as a potential preamble to a full suspension from the Commonwealth, unless "acceptable progress is not made within two years". Gabon was restored to a position of full membership within the Commonwealth on 15 July 2025, with the organization stating that the [[2025 Gabonese presidential election|Presidential election held on 12 April 2025]] “largely reflected the will of the people who voted and that it was conducted in a credible, transparent and inclusive manner".

In November 2024, a [[2024 Gabon constitutional referendum|referendum on a new constitution]] was approved, reforming the country's government. In April 2025, Brice Oligui Nguema won [[2025 Gabonese presidential election|presidential election]] with more than 90% of the vote, becoming the 4th President of Gabon.
