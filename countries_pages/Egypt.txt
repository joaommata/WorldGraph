Evidence of [[rock carvings]] along the [[Nile]] and in surrounding oases indicates early habitation. In the [[10th millennium BCE]], a culture of [[hunter-gatherer]]s and [[fishing|fishers]] was replaced by a [[cereal|grain]]-grinding culture. Climate changes or [[overgrazing]] around 8000 [[before common era|BCE]] began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt, forming the [[Sahara]]. Early [[tribal people]]s migrated to the Nile River where they developed a settled agricultural [[Economic system|economy]] and more centralised society.

By about 6000 BCE, a [[Neolithic]] culture took root in the Nile Valley. During the Neolithic era, several predynastic cultures developed independently in [[Upper and Lower Egypt]]. The [[Badarian]] culture and the successor [[Naqada]] series are generally regarded as precursors to [[Ancient Egypt|dynastic Egypt]]. The earliest known Lower Egyptian site, Merimda, predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years. Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years, remaining culturally distinct, but maintaining frequent contact through trade. The earliest known evidence of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian hieroglyphic]] inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery vessels, dated to about 3200 BCE.

===Ancient Egypt (3150 BCE–305 BCE)===
{{Main|Ancient Egypt}}
[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Giza Necropolis]] is the oldest of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|ancient Wonders]] and the only one still in existence.]]

Around {{circa|3150}} BCE, King [[Menes]] unified Egypt, establishing a succession of [[List of Egyptian dynasties|dynasties]] that ruled for three millennia. [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian civilisation]] thrived with distinctive achievements in [[Ancient Egyptian religion|religion]], [[Art of Ancient Egypt|art]], and [[Egyptian language|writing]]. The [[Old Kingdom]] ({{circa|2700–2200}} BCE) saw the construction of the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], including those at [[Giza Necropolis|Giza]]. A brief [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|interregnum]] followed, succeeded by the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] ({{circa|2040}} BCE), a phase of renewed stability and prosperity under rulers such as [[Amenemhat III]].

After the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]] and the [[Hyksos]] occupation, Egypt was reunified by [[Ahmose I]], founder of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] and the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] ({{circa|1550–1070}} BCE). This era marked Egypt's height as a major power in the region, extending influence into [[Nubia]] and the [[Levant]]. It produced many of Egypt's most renowned [[Pharaoh]]s, [[Hatshepsut]], [[Thutmose III]], [[Akhenaten]], [[Tutankhamun]], and [[Ramesses II]], and witnessed the rise of [[Atenism]], one of the earliest forms of [[monotheism]]. Despite later invasions by [[Ancient Libya|Libyans]], [[Kingdom of Kush|Nubians]], and [[Assyria]]ns, native dynasties eventually reasserted control.
[[File:BD Weighing of the Heart.jpg|thumb|The Weighing of the Heart from the ''[[Papyrus of Ani|Book of the Dead of Ani]]'']]
In 525 BCE, [[Cambyses II of Persia]] conquered Egypt, beginning the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] [[satrapy]] period (the [[Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-seventh Dynasty]]). Although several revolts occurred, Egypt remained under Persian control until briefly regaining independence before falling again in 343 BCE. The [[Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt|Thirtieth Dynasty]] was the last native royal house. Following renewed Persian domination, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Egypt in 332 BCE, after which his general [[Ptolemy I Soter]] established the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].

===Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt (305 BCE–641 CE)===
{{Main|Ptolemaic Kingdom|Roman Egypt}}

[[File:Denderah3 Cleopatra Cesarion.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|The Ptolemaic Queen [[Cleopatra VII]] and her son by Julius Caesar, [[Caesarion]], at the [[Dendera Temple complex|Temple of Dendera]]]]

The [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] was a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] state from southern Syria to [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] and south to Nubia, with [[Alexandria]] as its capital and a centre of [[Greeks|Greek]] culture and trade. The Ptolemies adopted pharaonic traditions to legitimize their rule, appearing on monuments in Egyptian style and participating in local religious life. The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]], built c. 280 BCE, was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], later destroyed by earthquakes. The last ruler, [[Cleopatra VII]], committed suicide after [[Octavian]] captured Alexandria, ending the dynasty and paving the way for Roman annexation. Native rebellions and dynastic disputes weakened the kingdom, facilitating its annexation by Rome.

Egypt was a wealthy imperial province of the [[Roman Empire]], supplying grain and hosting the major city of Alexandria. Governed with Roman administration and Hellenistic culture, its population primarily spoke [[Koine Greek|Greek]] in major cities and [[Coptic language|Coptic Egyptian]] in rural areas. Christianity reached Egypt in the 1st century, brought by [[Saint Mark the Evangelist]]. During [[Diocletian]]'s reign (284–305 CE), the [[New Testament]] had been translated into Egyptian and many Egyptian Christians were persecuted. By CE 451, a distinct [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] was firmly established.

The Byzantines regained control of Egypt after a brief [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanid Persian]] invasion early in the 7th century, until 639–42, when the country was conquered by Arab Muslim forces under [[Amr ibn al-As]]. The Arabs defeated the Byzantine armies, bringing [[Islam]] to Egypt. Alexandria briefly returned to Byzantine control in 645 but fell again to the Arabs in 646. In 654, an invasion fleet sent by [[Constans II]] was repulsed. The Arabs founded [[Fustat]], later replaced by Cairo in 969.

Under the [[Abbasid]] caliphate, Egypt was governed through deputies residing in Baghdad. Revolts occurred frequently, including the Egyptian revolt of 828 and the uprising of 831 when Copts joined Muslims against the government. Semi-independent dynasties arose, including the [[Tulunid dynasty]] (868–905) and [[Ikhshidid dynasty]] (935–969), which maintained Abbasid allegiance while exercising local authority.

The [[Fatimid Caliphate]] ruled Egypt from the 10th century, with [[Cairo]] as their capital. After the Fatimids, the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] governed until 1250, when the [[Mamluk]]s, a military caste of [[Turkic people|Turco]]-[[Circassians|Circassian]] origin, took control. The Mamluks ruled Egypt for the next three centuries and maintained control over parts of the Levant. By the late 13th century, Egypt linked trade routes connecting the Red Sea with India, Malaya, and the East Indies. The mid-14th century [[Black Death]] killed about 40% of Egypt's population.

=== Ottoman Egypt (1517–1867) ===
{{Main|Egypt Eyalet|History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty}}
Egypt was conquered by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1517, following the defeat of the [[Mamluk Sultanate]], and became a province of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Mamluks, who had dominated Egypt's military and political life for centuries, retained influence under Ottoman rule, creating a semi-autonomous power structure. The Ottomans faced repeated challenges in maintaining control, while plagues and famines weakened the economy and civil society. Between 1687 and 1731, Egypt experienced six major famines, including the 1784 famine that killed roughly one-sixth of the population.

In 1798, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] invaded Egypt, defeating the Mamluks at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]]. The French occupation was short-lived, but it destabilized the region and set the stage for Muhammad Ali Pasha's rise. After the French were expelled, power struggles ensued between the Ottomans, the Mamluks, and Albanian mercenaries in Ottoman service, leaving Egypt politically fragmented.

In 1805, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] seized power, massacring the remaining Mamluks and establishing a dynasty that would rule Egypt until 1952. He reorganized the army along European lines, introduced conscription, and developed a centralized administration. At the same time, he promoted cash-crop agriculture, especially long-staple cotton, to integrate Egypt into global markets. His successors, including [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]], [[Sa'id of Egypt|Sa'id]], and [[Isma'il Pasha of Egypt|Isma'il Pasha]], continued reforms in agriculture, science, and industry, and abolished slavery.

Muhammad Ali expanded Egypt's control over [[Northern Sudan]] (1820–1824), [[Syria]] (1833), and parts of [[Arabia]] and [[Anatolia]], but European powers intervened in 1841, forcing him to relinquish most of his conquests. He modernized Egypt's infrastructure, built factories and irrigation networks, and strengthened the military, while broader education remained largely limited to military and technical training. The centralization of power and focus on military and economic modernization laid the foundation for Egypt's transformation into a regional power.

=== Monarchical Egypt (1867–1952) ===
{{Main|Khedivate of Egypt {{!}} Khedivate of Egypt (1867–1914|Sultanate of Egypt {{!}} Sultanate of Egypt (1914–1922)|Kingdom of Egypt (1922–1953)}}

In 1867, Egypt was formally granted autonomous status as a [[Khedivate of Egypt|vassal state]] of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Suez Canal]], completed in 1869 with French assistance, became a key strategic and commercial asset. Financial mismanagement and mounting debts led Isma'il Pasha to sell Egypt's shares in the canal to Britain in 1875, increasing European influence. Rising discontent culminated in the [[Urabi revolt]], after which Britain occupied Egypt in 1882, establishing a de facto protectorate while maintaining nominal Ottoman sovereignty. The Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement of 1899 placed Sudan under joint Egyptian and British administration, though Britain retained real control. Incidents such as the [[Denshawai incident]] in 1906 intensified nationalist sentiment, laying the groundwork for political movements that challenged both Ottoman and European dominance.

[[File:Cairo-Demonstrations1919.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Female nationalists demonstrating in [[Cairo]], 1919|304x304px]]
In 1914, as the [[Ottoman Empire]] joined World War I alongside the Central Powers, Khedive [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas II]] declared support for the Ottoman side. In response, the British deposed him and installed his brother [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]], who assumed the title of [[Sultanate of Egypt|Sultan of Egypt]]. Egypt was formally declared independent from the Ottoman Empire but remained under British protection.

After [[World War I]], nationalist sentiments surged. [[Saad Zaghlul]] and the [[Wafd Party]] secured popular support, but the British exiled Zaghlul and his colleagues to Malta on 8 March 1919, prompting the [[Egyptian revolution of 1919|first modern revolution]]. This uprising pressured the UK to issue a [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|declaration of independence]] on 22 February 1922. Sultan [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] then assumed the title of King of Egypt. Despite nominal independence, Britain retained military presence and political influence.
[[File:Fuad I of Egypt, Edward VIII, & Mohamed Sa'id Paşa.jpg|thumb|[[Fuad I of Egypt]] with [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]], 1932|left|223x223px]]
In 1923, a new constitution established a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] government. The Wafd Party won a decisive victory in the 1923–24 elections, with [[Saad Zaghloul]] becoming prime minister. The [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|1936 treaty]] led to British troop withdrawal from most of Egypt, except the Suez Canal. The treaty left the status of [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] unresolved, as real control remained with Britain.

During [[World War II]], Egypt served as a strategic base for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] operations, particularly in [[North Africa]]. Although Egypt declared martial law and severed diplomatic relations with [[Axis powers]], the Egyptian army did not engage directly. Political tensions persisted, highlighted by the 1942 [[Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942|Abdeen Palace Incident]], in which British forces pressured King Farouk to install a Wafd-coalition government.
[[File:1stAlameinBritDefense.jpg|thumb|British infantry near [[First Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]], 17 July 1942|right|200x200px]]
After the war, nationalist and anti-British sentiments intensified. British troops largely withdrew in 1947, leaving a residual presence around the Suez Canal. Egypt's defeat in the [[First Arab-Israeli War]] fueled anti-monarchy feeling. The Wafd Party's 1950 election victory forced King Farouk to appoint [[Mostafa El-Nahas]] as prime minister. In 1951, Egypt unilaterally renounced the [[Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936|1936 treaty]] and demanded British troop withdrawal. The situation around the Suez Canal escalated, culminating in violent confrontations that led to the killing of 43 Egyptian policemen in 1952 by British troops. The Ismailia incident outraged Egypt and led to the subsequent [[Cairo fire|Black Saturday]] anti-British riots, which saw widespread destruction in Cairo.

These events precipitated the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|Free Officers Movement coup]] on 22–23 July 1952, led by [[Muhammad Naguib]] and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. King Farouk abdicated in favor of his infant son, [[Fuad II of Egypt|Fuad II]], but real power rested with the [[Egyptian Revolutionary Command Council]]. By 18 June 1953, the monarchy was formally abolished, the 1923 constitution suspended, and Egypt was declared a republic, with Naguib as president and Nasser as prime minister.

=== Republican Egypt under Nasser (1952–1970) ===
{{Main|History of republican Egypt|History of Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser}}
[[File:Port Said from air.jpg|thumb|Smoke rises from oil tanks beside the [[Suez Canal]] hit during the initial [[Suez Crisis|Anglo-French assault]] on Egypt, 5 November 1956.]]
Following the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|1952 Revolution]] led by the [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers Movement]], Egypt came under military control, and all political parties were banned. On 18 June 1953, the [[Republic of Egypt (1953–1958)|Republic of Egypt]] was officially declared, with [[Muhammad Naguib]] serving as the first President. His presidency lasted less than a year and a half, as [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], a [[Pan-Arabist]] and the principal architect of the 1952 movement, gradually consolidated power. Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 and placed under [[house arrest]]. The presidency remained vacant until Nasser was formally elected in 1956.

In October 1954, Egypt and the United Kingdom agreed to end the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement]] of 1899, granting Sudan full independence, which came into effect on 1 January 1956. In June 1956, Nasser assumed the presidency and immediately became the central figure in Egypt's domestic and foreign policy. British forces completed their withdrawal from the Suez Canal Zone on 13 June 1956. Later that year, on 26 July, Nasser [[nationalised]] the Suez Canal, provoking the [[Suez Crisis]] when Israel, with support from France and the United Kingdom, invaded the Sinai Peninsula and targeted the Canal. The conflict ended following diplomatic pressure from the United States and the Soviet Union, restoring the pre-war status quo.
[[File:Nasser in Mansoura, 1960.jpg|thumb|Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] in [[Mansoura, Egypt|Mansoura]], 1960]]
In 1958, Egypt formed a political union with Syria, creating the [[United Arab Republic]]. The union, also loosely connected with [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen|North Yemen]] in the [[United Arab States]], was short-lived; Syria seceded in 1961. During this period, Egypt became heavily involved in the [[North Yemen Civil War]], with military interventions and peace conferences ultimately leading to a prolonged stalemate.
In May 1967, tensions with Israel escalated after warnings from the Soviet Union, deployment of Egyptian forces to Sinai, expulsion of UN peacekeepers, and closure of the [[Straits of Tiran]]. These measures precipitated the [[Third Arab-Israeli War|Six-Day War]], during which Israel captured the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Gaza Strip]]. In response to the conflict, an [[Emergency law in Egypt|Emergency Law]] was enacted, greatly expanding police powers, restricting constitutional rights, and legalising censorship; it remained in force until 2012, except for a brief break in 1980–81.

Socially and economically, Nasser's policies transformed Egypt. At the time of the monarchy's fall, less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class, four million were middle class, and seventeen million were lower class or poor. Education was expanded, with school enrolment more than doubling from 1953 to 1966. Land reforms, industrial support, and growth in public-sector employment created a larger middle class, including doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, and journalists. However, by the late 1960s, the Egyptian economy faced stagnation, political freedoms had declined, and Nasser's personal popularity began to wane.

=== Egypt under Sadat and Mubarak (1971–2011) ===
{{Main|History of Egypt under Anwar Sadat|History of Egypt under Hosni Mubarak}}
[[File:Egyptian Armor.jpg|thumb|Egyptian tanks advancing in the Sinai desert during the [[Yom Kippur War]], 1973]]
After the death of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] in 1970, [[Anwar Sadat]] assumed the presidency of Egypt. Sadat consolidated his power by marginalising Nasserist and leftist factions, while controlling opposition both secular and religious. He shifted Egypt's Cold War alignment from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling Soviet advisors in 1972, and renamed the country the Arab Republic of Egypt in 1971. Sadat launched the [[Infitah]] ("open door") economic reforms. Some measures of this economic liberalization caused social tensions, most notably the removal of food subsidies in 1977 which sparked widespread [[1977 Egyptian bread riots|bread riots]].
[[File:Begin, Carter and Sadat at Camp David 1978.jpg|thumb|Celebrating the signing of the 1978 [[Camp David Accords]]: [[Menachem Begin]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Anwar Sadat]]]]
In 1973, Sadat coordinated with Syria in the [[Fourth Arab-Israeli War]] to reclaim the [[Sinai Peninsula]] from Israeli occupation. Though militarily mixed, the war restored Arab morale and strengthened Sadat's domestic legitimacy. His historic 1977 visit to Jerusalem led to the 1979 [[Egypt–Israel peace treaty|Egypt-Israel peace treaty]], with Israel withdrawing from Sinai and Egypt recognizing Israel as a sovereign state. This initiative provoked widespread controversy across the Arab world, resulting in Egypt's temporary expulsion from the [[Arab League]], but remained popular domestically. Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by an Islamic extremist opposed to his domestic policies and peace initiative.
[[File:Hosni Mubarak - Official Photo.JPG|left|thumb|222x222px|[[Hosni Mubarak]], president of Egypt from 1981 to 2011]]
[[Hosni Mubarak]] succeeded Sadat in a 1981 referendum in which he was the sole candidate. He maintained Egypt's peace treaty with Israel and improved relations with Arab neighbors. Domestically, he faced widespread poverty, high unemployment, and urban overcrowding. The 1986 Security Police riots, sparked by reports of extended military service, led to violent protests, destruction of businesses, and 107 deaths.

Terrorist attacks, particularly by Islamist groups like [[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]], targeted government officials, foreigners, and Christian [[Copts]], devastating tourism, Egypt's primary source of hard currency. The political scene was dominated by the [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|NDP]], which curtailed freedoms of association, expression, and political participation through laws such as the 1993 Syndicates Law, 1995 Press Law, and 1999 NGOs Law.
[[File:Cairo north.JPG|thumb|Cairo grew into a [[metropolitan area]] with a population of over 22 million.]]
In 1997, the [[Luxor massacre]] left 62 dead, mostly tourists, highlighting the continuing threat to security and the economy. In 2005, limited reforms allowed multi-candidate presidential elections, but restrictions on candidates and alleged government interference ensured Mubarak's easy reelection. Voter turnout was less than 25%, and opposition leader [[Ayman Nour]] was subsequently imprisoned.

[[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]] reported widespread human rights abuses, including torture, arbitrary detention, and the use of Egypt as an international "torture hub" in the context of the [[war on terror]]. Constitutional changes in 2007 further expanded presidential powers, restricted religious parties, and broadened police authority. Egypt remained under strong military influence, described by officials as a "pharaonic" system, with democracy as a distant aspiration.

On 25 January 2011, [[2011 Egyptian revolution|widespread protests]] erupted against President Hosni Mubarak's government, triggered by demands for political freedom, social justice, and the end of long-standing corruption. Demonstrations rapidly spread across major cities, particularly in [[Cairo]]'s [[Tahrir Square]], capturing global attention. After 18 days of escalating unrest, Mubarak resigned on 11 February 2011 and fled Cairo. The [[Egyptian military]] assumed control, with [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]], chairman of the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]], acting as interim head of state. On 13 February, the military dissolved parliament and suspended the constitution. A constitutional referendum followed on 19 March 2011. Later that year, Egypt held its first parliamentary elections since the previous regime, with high voter turnout and no major reported irregularities.

[[Mohamed Morsi]], affiliated with the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], won the [[2012 Egyptian presidential election|presidency]] on 24 June 2012 and was sworn in on 30 June. His cabinet, announced in August 2012, included significant representation from the Muslim Brotherhood, prompting liberal and secular groups to withdraw from the [[Constituent Assembly of Egypt]] over concerns of imposing strict Islamic law. In November 2012, Morsi issued a decree granting immunity to his decisions and protecting the constituent assembly's work, sparking [[2012–2013 Egyptian protests|mass protests and violent clashes]] across the country. Tensions escalated, with the largest confrontations between Islamist supporters and opponents since the 2011 revolution occurring on 5 December 2012. Morsi refused to cancel the December 2012 [[2012 Egyptian constitutional referendum|constitutional referendum]].

Following growing public discontent, the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|military removed Morsi]] on 3 July 2013, dissolved the [[Senate (Egypt)|Shura Council]], and installed [[Adly Mansour]], chief justice of the [[Supreme Constitutional Court (Egypt)|Supreme Constitutional Court]], as interim president. Authorities cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood, jailing thousands and conducting mass trials. Violence during [[Rabaa massacre|dispersals of pro-Morsi camps]] left hundreds dead. A new [[Constitution of Egypt|constitution]] was approved by referendum on 18 January 2014 with 98.1% voting in favour.

[[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] won the [[2014 Egyptian presidential election|presidential elections]] in June 2014 with 96.1% of the vote and was sworn in on 8 June. Under his rule, Egypt intensified security on the Gaza border, dismantled tunnels between Sinai and Gaza, and consolidated political power. Presidential terms were extended to six years in 2019, allowing El-Sisi to run for a third term in 2024. Parliamentary elections in 2020 confirmed a pro-El-Sisi majority for the [[Nation's Future Party|Mostaqbal Watan Party]]. The constitutional reforms and strengthened military authority under El-Sisi have been described as a return to authoritarianism.
