===Pre-history===

It is estimated that hominids lived in Botswana during the [[Pleistocene]] time period. Stone tools and animal remains indicate that all areas of the country were inhabited at least 400,000 years ago.

It was claimed to have been the birthplace of all [[Early modern human|modern humans]] from around 200,000 years ago. Evidence left by modern humans, such as cave paintings, is about 73,000 years old. The earliest known inhabitants of southern Africa are thought to have been the forebears of present-day [[San people|San]] ("Bushmen") and [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] peoples. Both groups speak [[Click consonant|click languages]] from the small [[Khoe-Kwadi]], [[Kx'a]] and [[Tuu languages|Tuu]] language families whose members hunted, gathered and traded over long distances. When cattle were first introduced into southern Africa about 2,000 years ago, pastoralism became a major feature of the economy since the region had large grasslands free of [[tsetse flies]].

It is unclear when [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples first moved into the country from the north, although AD 600 seems to be a consensus estimate. In that era, the ancestors of the modern-day [[Kalanga people|Kalanga]] moved into what is now the north-eastern area of the country. These proto-Kalanga were closely connected to states in Zimbabwe as well as to the Mapungubwe state. One notable remnant of this period is [[Domboshaba]] ruins, a cultural and heritage site in Botswana initially occupied towards the end of the Great Zimbabwe period (1250–1450), with stone walls that have an average height of 1.8 metres. The site is a respected place for the people living in the region, and it is believed that the chief lived on the top of the hill with his helpers or assistants. These states, located outside of current Botswana's borders, appear to have kept massive herds of cattle—apparently at numbers approaching modern cattle density—in what is now the Central District. This massive cattle-raising complex prospered until around 1300 and seems to have regressed following the collapse of Mapungubwe. During this era, the first Tswana-speaking groups, the [[Bakgalagadi]], moved into the southern areas of the [[Kalahari]]. These various peoples were connected to trade routes that ran via the [[Limpopo River]] to the Indian Ocean. Trade goods from Asia such as beads made their way to Botswana, most likely in exchange for ivory, gold and [[Rhinoceros|rhinoceros horn]].

The [[Toutswemogala Hill]] Iron Age settlement's radio-carbon dates range from the 7th to the late 19th century, indicating it was occupied for more than 1,000 years. The hill was part of the formation of early states in southern Africa, with cattle as a major source of economy. Around 1000 AD, the Toutswe people moved into Botswana.

However, agriculture also played a vital role in the longevity of Toutswemogala Hill's extended occupation, as many grain storage structures have also been found on the site. Many different stratified layers of housing floors further signalled continuous occupation over hundreds of years. The arrival of the Tswana speakers' ancestors who came to control the region has yet to be dated precisely. Members of the [[Bakwena]], a chieftaincy under a leader named Kgabo II, made their way into the southern Kalahari by AD 1500 at the latest, and his people drove the Bakgalagadi inhabitants west into the desert. Over the years, several offshoots of the Bakwena moved into adjoining territories. The [[Bangwaketse]] occupied areas to the west, while the [[Bangwato]] moved northeast into former Kalanga areas. Not long afterwards, a Bangwato offshoot known as the Batawana migrated into the [[Okavango Delta]], probably in the 1790s.

===Mfecane and Batswana-Boer Wars===

The first written records relating to modern-day Botswana appear in 1824. These records show that the Bangwaketse had become the predominant power in the region. Under the rule of Makaba II, the Bangwaketse kept vast herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas, and used their military prowess to raid their neighbours. By this time, other chiefdoms in the area had capitals of 10,000 or so and were fairly prosperous. This equilibrium came to end during the [[Mfecane]] period (1823–1843) when a succession of invading peoples from South Africa entered the country. Although the Bangwaketse were able to defeat the invading [[Kololo people|Bakololo]] in 1826, over time all the major chiefdoms in Botswana were attacked, weakened and impoverished. The Bakololo and [[Northern Ndebele people|AmaNdebele]] raided repeatedly and took large numbers of cattle, women and children from the Batswana – most of whom were driven into the desert or sanctuary areas such as hilltops and caves. Only after 1843, when the Amandebele moved into western Zimbabwe, did this threat subside.

During the 1840s and 1850s, trade with [[Cape Colony]]-based merchants opened up and enabled the [[Tswana people|Batswana]] chiefdoms to rebuild. The [[Bakwena]], Bangwaketse, Bangwato and Batawana cooperated to control the lucrative ivory trade and used the proceeds to import horses and guns, which in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now Botswana. This process was largely complete by 1880, and the Batswana thus subjugated the Bushmen, Kalanga, Bakgalagadi and other current minorities.

Following the [[Great Trek]], [[Afrikaners]] from the Cape Colony established themselves on the borders of Botswana in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. In 1852, a coalition of [[Tswana people|Tswana]] chiefdoms led by [[Sechele I]] defeated Afrikaner incursions at the [[Battle of Dimawe]] and, after about eight years of intermittent tensions and hostilities, eventually came to a peace agreement in [[Potchefstroom]] in 1860. From that point on, the modern-day border between South Africa and Botswana was agreed on, and the Afrikaners and Batswana traded and worked together comparatively peacefully.

In 1884, Batawana, a northern-based Tswana clan's cavalry under the command of Kgosi Moremi, fought and defeated the Ndebele's invasion of northern Botswana at the [[Tswana people|Battle of Khutiyabasadi]]. This was the start of the collapse of the Ndebele Kingdom in Zimbabwe, and it helped the Tswana speaking authority.

Due to newly peaceful conditions, trade thrived between 1860 and 1880. Christian [[missionaries]] were able to take advantage of this. The [[Lutherans]] and the [[London Missionary Society]] both became established in the country by 1856. By 1880, every major village had a resident missionary, and their influence slowly grew. [[Khama III]], who reigned from 1875 to 1923, was the first of the Tswana chiefs to make Christianity a state religion, and a great deal of Tswana customary law changed as a result. Christianity became the de facto official religion in all the chiefdoms by [[World War I]].

{{Main|Bechuanaland Protectorate}}
During the [[Scramble for Africa]], both the [[German Empire]] and Britain coveted the territory of Botswana. During the [[Berlin Conference]], Britain decided to annexe Botswana to safeguard the Road to the North and thus connect the Cape Colony to its territories further north. It unilaterally annexed Tswana territories in January 1885 and then sent the [[Warren Expedition]] north to consolidate control over the area and convince the chiefs to accept British overrule. Despite their misgivings, they eventually acquiesced to this ''fait accompli''.

In 1890, areas north of 22 degrees were added to the new Bechuanaland Protectorate. During the 1890s, the new territory was divided into eight different reserves, with fairly small amounts of land being left as freehold for white [[settler]]s. During the early 1890s, the British government decided to hand over the Bechuanaland Protectorate to the [[British South Africa Company]]. This plan, which was well on its way to fruition despite the entreaties of Tswana leaders who toured England in protest, was eventually foiled by the failure of the [[Jameson Raid]] in January 1896.

When the [[Union of South Africa]] was formed from the main British colonies in the region in 1910, the High Commission Territories—the Bechuanaland Protectorate, [[Basutoland]] (now [[Lesotho]]) and [[Swaziland]] (now [[Eswatini]])—were not included, but provision was made for their later incorporation. However, the UK began to consult with their inhabitants as to their wishes. Although successive South African governments sought to have the territories transferred to their jurisdiction, the UK kept delaying; consequently, it never occurred. The election of the [[National Party (South Africa)|Nationalist]] government in 1948, which instituted [[apartheid]], and South Africa's withdrawal from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1961, ended any prospect of the UK or these territories agreeing to incorporation into South Africa.

An expansion of British central authority and the evolution of native government resulted in the 1920 establishment of two advisory councils to represent both Africans and Europeans. The African Council consisted of the eight heads of the Tswana tribes and some elected members.[[File:Botswana Independence Talks, 1965 - 2.png|thumb|[[Seretse Khama]] ''(right)'' and [[Quett Masire]] ''(left)'' at independence talks in London, 1965]]

===Independence===
In June 1964, the United Kingdom accepted proposals for a democratic self-government in Botswana. An independence conference was held in London in February 1966. The seat of government was moved in 1965 from [[Mahikeng]] in South Africa, to the newly established [[Gaborone]], located near Botswana's border with South Africa. Based on the 1965 constitution, the country held its first general elections under universal suffrage and gained independence on 30 September 1966. [[Seretse Khama|Sir Seretse Khama]], a leader in the independence movement, was elected as the first president, and subsequently re-elected twice.

Khama died in office in 1980. The presidency passed to the sitting vice-president, [[Quett Masire]], who was elected in his own right in 1984 and re-elected in 1989 and 1994. Masire retired from office in 1998. He was succeeded by [[Festus Mogae]], who was elected in 1999 and re-elected in 2004. The presidency passed in 2008 to [[Ian Khama]] (son of the first president), who had been serving as Mogae's vice-president since resigning his position as Commander of the [[Botswana Defence Force]] in 1998 to take up this civilian role. On 1 April 2018, [[Mokgweetsi Masisi|Mokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe Masisi]] was sworn in as the fifth president of Botswana, succeeding Ian Khama. A long-running dispute over the northern border with [[Namibia]]'s [[Caprivi Strip]] was the subject of a ruling by the [[International Court of Justice]] in December 1999. It ruled that [[Kasikili Island]] belongs to Botswana.

The Botswana Democratic Party governed the country without interruption from the inaugural 1965 election until the [[2024 Botswana general election|2024 general election]], which was won by the [[Umbrella for Democratic Change]]. On 1 November 2024, [[Duma Boko]], the leader of the UDC, was sworn in as president of Botswana, becoming the first president not to represent the BDP.

In 2025, Botswana became scene to a [[2025 Botswana medical crisis|major medical crisis]].
