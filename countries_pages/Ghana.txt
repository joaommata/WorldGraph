The earliest kingdoms to emerge in Ghana were [[Bono state|Bonoman]] in the south and the [[Kingdom of Dagbon]] in the north, with Bonoman existing in the area during the 11th century. From the 17th century, different Akan states began to emerge from what is believed to have been the Bonoman area, mainly based on gold trading. These states included Bonoman (Brong-Ahafo region), [[Adansi]] and [[Asante Empire|Asante]] ([[Ashanti Region]]), [[Denkyira]] ([[Central Region (Ghana)|Western North region]]), [[Mankessim Kingdom]] ([[Western Region (Ghana)|Central region]]), [[Akyem]] and [[Akwamu]] [[Eastern Region (Ghana)|(Eastern region)]]. By the 19th century, the territory of the southern part of Ghana was included in the [[Ashanti Empire|Asante Kingdom]]. The government of the Ashanti Empire operated first as a loose network and eventually as a centralised kingdom with a specialised bureaucracy centred in the capital city of [[Kumasi]]. Prior to Akan contact with Europeans, the Akan people created an economy based on principally gold and [[gold bar]] precious metals, which were traded with other states in Africa.

The Ga-Dangme and Ewe migrated westward from south-western [[Nigeria]]. The Ewe, formerly known as Dogbo, migrated from Oyo area with their Gbe-speaking kinsmen (Adja, Fon, Phla/Phera and Ogun/Gun) and, in transition, settled at Ketou in Benin Republic, Tado in Togo, and Dogbo Nyigbo in Benin Republic, with Nortsie (a walled town in present-day Togo) as their final dispersal point. Their dispersal from Nortsie was necessitated by the high-handed rule of King Agorkorli (Agɔ Akɔli), who was the reigning monarch of the tribe at that time. The Ewe in Ghana speak three principal dialects: Anlo (along the coast), Tongu (along the Volta river) and Ewedome (in the hill country side). The [[Ga-Adangbe people|Ga-Dangme]] occupy the Greater Accra Region and parts of the Eastern Region, while the Ewe are found in the [[Volta Region]] as well as the neighbouring Togo, Benin Republic and Nigeria (around Badagry area).{{citation needed|date=April 2025}}

===European contact and colonialism===
{{See also|Slave Coast of West Africa|Dutch Slave Coast}}[[File:Elmina_slave_castle.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] established the [[Portuguese Gold Coast]] with the construction of [[Elmina Castle]] (''Castelo da Mina'') by [[Diogo de Azambuja]] in 1482, making it the oldest [[Portuguese colonial architecture|European building]] in Sub-Saharan Africa.]]
Akan trade with European states began after contact with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in the 15th century. European contact was by the [[Portuguese people]], who came to the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast region]] in the 15th century to trade. The Portuguese then established the [[Portuguese Gold Coast]] (Costa do Ouro), focused on the availability of gold. The Portuguese built a trading lodge at a coastal settlement called Anomansah (the perpetual drink), which they renamed [[Elmina|São Jorge da Mina]]. In 1481, King [[John II of Portugal]] commissioned [[Diogo de Azambuja]] to build the [[Elmina Castle]], which was completed in three years. By 1598, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] had joined the Portuguese in the gold trade, establishing the [[Dutch Gold Coast]] (''Nederlandse Bezittingen ter Kuste van Guinea'' – 'Dutch properties at the Guinea coast') and building forts at [[Fort Komenda]] and Kormantsi. In 1617, the Dutch captured the Elmina Castle from the Portuguese and [[Axim]] in 1642 ([[Fort Saint Anthony|Fort St Anthony]]).

European traders had joined in gold trading by the 17th century, including the [[Swedes]], establishing the [[Swedish Gold Coast]] (''Svenska Guldkusten''), and [[Denmark–Norway]], establishing the [[Danish Gold Coast]] (''Danske Guldkyst'' or ''Dansk Guinea''). European traders participated in the [[Atlantic slave trade]] in this area. More than 30 forts and castles were built by the merchants. The Germans established the [[Brandenburger Gold Coast]] or Groß Friedrichsburg. In 1874, Great Britain established control over some parts of the country, assigning these areas the status of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|British Gold Coast]]. [[Military]] engagements occurred between British colonial powers and Akan nation-states. The Kingdom of [[Ashanti Empire|Ashanti]] defeated the British some times in the 100-year-long [[Anglo-Ashanti wars]] and eventually lost with the [[War of the Golden Stool]] in 1900. In the late 19th century, cocoa cultivation spread through the tropical forests, with the British administration actively supporting the growth of the commercial cocoa industry.

In 1947, the newly formed [[United Gold Coast Convention]] led by [[The Big Six (Ghana)|"The Big Six"]] called for "self-government within the shortest possible time" following the [[1946 Gold Coast general election|1946 Gold Coast legislative election]]. [[Kwame Nkrumah]], a Ghanaian nationalist who led Ghana from 1957 to 1966 as the country's first [[Prime Minister of Ghana|prime minister]] and [[President of Ghana|president]], formed the [[Convention People's Party]] in 1949 with the motto "self-government now". The party initiated a "positive action" campaign involving non-violent protests, strikes and non-cooperation with the British authorities. Nkrumah was arrested and sentenced to one year imprisonment during this time. In the Gold Coast's [[1951 Gold Coast general election|1951 general election]], he was elected to Parliament and was released from prison. He became prime minister in 1952 and began a policy of Africanization.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}

At midnight on 6 March 1957, the Gold Coast, Ashanti, the Northern Territories, and [[British Togoland]] were unified as one single independent dominion within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] under the name Ghana. This was done under the [[Ghana Independence Act 1957]]. The current [[flag of Ghana]], consisting of the colours red, gold, green, and a black star, dates back to this unification. On 1 July 1960, following the [[1960 Ghanaian constitutional referendum|Ghanaian constitutional referendum]] and [[1960 Ghanaian presidential election|Ghanaian presidential election]], Nkrumah declared Ghana a republic and assumed the presidency. 6 March is the nation's [[Independence Day (Ghana)|Independence Day]], and 1 July is celebrated as [[Republic Day]].

[[Kwame Nkrumah|Nkrumah]] led an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime in Ghana, as he repressed political opposition and conducted elections that were not free and fair. In 1964, a [[1964 Ghanaian constitutional referendum|constitutional amendment]] made Ghana a [[one-party state]], with Nkrumah as [[president for life]] of both the nation and its party. Nkrumah was the first African head of state to promote the concept of [[Pan-Africanism]], which he had been introduced to during his studies at [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]], Pennsylvania in the United States, at the time when [[Marcus Garvey]] was known for his "Back to Africa Movement". He merged the teachings of Garvey, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and the naturalised Ghanaian scholar [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] into the formation of 1960s Ghana. Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, as he became known, played an instrumental part in the founding of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], and in establishing the [[Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute]] to teach his ideologies of [[communism]] and [[socialism]]. His life achievements were recognised by Ghanaians during his centenary birthday celebration, and the day was instituted as a [[Public holidays in Ghana|public holiday in Ghana]] ([[Founders' Day (Ghana)|Founders' Day]]).

===Operation Cold Chop and aftermath===
{{main|History of Ghana (1966–1979)}}
The government of Nkrumah was subsequently overthrown in a coup by the [[Ghana Armed Forces]], codenamed "Operation Cold Chop". This occurred while Nkrumah was abroad with [[Zhou Enlai]] in the People's Republic of China, on a mission to [[Hanoi]], Vietnam, to help end the [[Vietnam War]]. The coup took place on 24 February 1966, led by Colonel [[Emmanuel Kwasi Kotoka]] and Brigadier Akwasi Afrifa. The [[National Liberation Council]] was formed, chaired by Lieutenant General [[Joseph Arthur Ankrah|Joseph A. Ankrah]].

A series of alternating military and civilian governments, often affected by economic instabilities, ruled Ghana from 1966, ending with the ascent to power of [[Flight lieutenant|Flight Lieutenant]] [[Jerry Rawlings|Jerry John Rawlings]] of the [[Provisional National Defence Council]] in 1981. These changes resulted in the suspension of the [[Constitution of Ghana|constitution]] in 1981 and the banning of [[List of political parties in Ghana|political parties]]. The economy soon declined, so Rawlings negotiated a structural adjustment plan, changing many old economic policies, and growth recovered during the mid-1980s. A new constitution restoring [[multi-party system]] politics was promulgated in the [[1992 Ghanaian presidential election|presidential election of 1992]], in which Rawlings was elected, and again in the [[1996 Ghanaian general election|general election of 1996]].

In a [[Konkomba–Nanumba conflict|tribal war]] in [[Northern Region (Ghana)|Northern Ghana]] in 1994, between the [[Konkomba people|Konkomba]] and other ethnic groups, including the [[Nanumba people|Nanumba]], [[Dagomba people|Dagomba]] and [[Gonja people|Gonja]], between 1,000 and 2,000 people were killed and 150,000 people were displaced.

After the [[2000 Ghanaian general election|2000 general election]], [[John Kufuor]] of the [[New Patriotic Party]] became president of Ghana on 7 January 2001 and was [[2004 Ghanaian general election|re-elected in 2004]], thus also serving two terms (the term limit) as president of Ghana and marking the first time under the fourth republic that power was transferred from one legitimately elected head of state and head of government to another.

[[Nana Akufo-Addo]], the ruling party candidate, was defeated in a very close [[2008 Ghanaian general election|2008 general election]] by [[John Atta Mills]] of the [[National Democratic Congress (Ghana)|National Democratic Congress]]. Mills died of natural causes and was succeeded by Vice President [[John Mahama]] on 24 July 2012. Following the [[2012 Ghanaian general election|2012 general election]], Mahama became president in his own right, and Ghana was described as a "stable democracy". As a result of the [[2016 Ghanaian general election|2016 general election]], [[Nana Akufo-Addo]] became president on 7 January 2017. He was re-elected after a tightly contested [[2020 Ghanaian general election|election in 2020]]. Akufo-Addo's presidency finished in January 2025, and [[John Mahama]], the current president of Ghana, succeeded him.
