===Bantu migrations===
{{Further|Bantu expansion}}

[[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples migrated into Mozambique as early as the 4th century BC. It is believed between the 1st and 5th centuries AD, waves of migration from the west and north went through the [[Zambezi]] River valley and then gradually into the plateau and coastal areas of Southern Africa. They established agricultural communities or societies based on herding cattle. They brought with them the technology for smelting and smithing iron.

===Swahili Coast===

From the late first millennium AD, vast [[Indian Ocean trade]] networks extended as far south as present day [[Vilankulo]], as evidenced by the ancient port town of [[Chibuene]]. Beginning in the 9th century, a growing involvement in Indian Ocean trade led to the development of numerous port towns along the entire East African coast, including modern day Mozambique. Largely autonomous, these towns broadly participated in the incipient [[Swahili culture]]. Islam was often adopted by urban elites, facilitating trade. In Mozambique, [[Sofala]], [[Angoche]], and Mozambique Island were regional powers by the 15th century.

The towns traded with merchants from both the African interior and the broader Indian Ocean world. Particularly important were the gold and ivory caravan routes. Inland states like the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]] and [[Kingdom of Mutapa]] provided the coveted gold and ivory, which were then exchanged up the coast to larger port cities like [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] and [[Mombasa]].

=== Portuguese Mozambique (1498–1975) ===

The [[Island of Mozambique]], after which the country is named, is a small coral island at the mouth of Mossuril Bay on the [[Nacala]] coast of northern Mozambique, and was first explored by Europeans in the late 15th century.

When Portuguese explorers reached Mozambique in 1498, Arab-trading settlements had existed along the coast and outlying islands for several centuries. From about 1500, Portuguese trading posts and forts displaced the Arabic commercial and military hegemony, becoming regular ports of call on the new European sea route to the east,

The voyage of [[Vasco da Gama]] around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1498 marked the Portuguese entry into trade, politics, and society of the region. The Portuguese gained control of the Island of Mozambique and the port city of Sofala in the early 16th century, and by the 1530s, small groups of Portuguese traders and prospectors seeking gold penetrated the interior regions. Here they set up garrisons and trading posts at [[Sena, Mozambique|Sena]] and [[Tete, Mozambique|Tete]] on the Zambezi and tried to gain exclusive control over the gold trade. Slavery in Mozambique pre-dated European-contact. African rulers and chiefs dealt in enslaved people, first with Arab Muslim traders, who sent the enslaved to Middle East Asia cities and plantations, and later with Portuguese and other European traders. In a continuation of the trade, slaves were supplied by warring local African rulers, who raided enemy tribes and sold their captives to the ''prazeiros''. The authority of the ''prazeiros'' was exercised and upheld amongst the local population by armies of these enslaved men, whose members became known as ''[[Chikunda]]''.

By the early 20th century the Portuguese had shifted the administration of much of Mozambique to large private companies, like the [[Mozambique Company]], the [[Zambezia Company]] and the [[Niassa Company]], controlled and financed mostly by British financiers such as [[Solomon Joel]], which established railroad lines to their neighbouring colonies (South Africa and [[Rhodesia]]). Although slavery had been legally abolished in Mozambique, at the end of the 19th century the chartered companies enacted a forced labour policy and supplied cheap—often forced—African labour to the mines and [[plantation]]s of the nearby British colonies and South Africa.

Due to their unsatisfactory performance and the shift, under the [[corporatist]] [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|''Estado Novo'']] regime of [[Oliveira Salazar]], toward stronger state control of the [[Portuguese Empire]]'s economy, the companies' concessions were not renewed when they ran out. This was what happened in 1942 with the Mozambique Company, which, however, continued to operate in the agricultural and commercial sectors as a corporation, and had already happened in 1929 with the termination of the Niassa Company's concession. In 1951, the Portuguese overseas colonies in Africa were rebranded as Overseas Provinces of Portugal.

The [[Mueda massacre]] of 16 June 1960 resulted in the death of [[Makonde people|Makonde]] protestors, which provoked the struggle of independence from Portuguese rule of Mozambique.

===Mozambican War of Independence (1964–1975)===
{{Main|Mozambican War of Independence}}

As [[communism|communist]] and [[Decolonization|anti-colonial]] ideologies spread out across Africa, many clandestine political movements were established in support of Mozambican independence. These movements claimed that since policies and development plans were primarily designed by the ruling authorities for the benefit of Mozambique's Portuguese population, little attention was paid to Mozambique's tribal integration and the development of its native communities. According to the official guerrilla statements, this affected a majority of the indigenous population who suffered both state-sponsored discrimination and enormous social pressure. As a response to the guerrilla movement, the Portuguese government from the 1960s and principally the early 1970s initiated gradual changes with new socioeconomic developments and egalitarian policies.

The Front for the Liberation of Mozambique ([[FRELIMO]]) initiated a guerrilla campaign against Portuguese rule in September 1964. This conflict—along with the two others already initiated in the other Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] and [[Portuguese Guinea]]—became part of the so-called [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961–1974). From a military standpoint, the Portuguese regular army maintained control of the population centres while the guerrilla forces sought to undermine their influence in rural and tribal areas in the north and west. As part of their response to FRELIMO, the Portuguese government began to pay more attention to creating favourable conditions for social development and economic growth.

=== Independence (1975) ===
FRELIMO took control of the territory after ten years of sporadic warfare, as well as Portugal's own return to democracy after the fall of the authoritarian [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|''Estado Novo'']] regime in the [[Carnation Revolution]] of April 1974 and the failed [[coup of 25 November 1975]]. Within a year, most of the 250,000 Portuguese in Mozambique had left—some expelled by the government of the nearly independent territory, some left the country to avoid possible reprisals from the unstable government—and Mozambique became independent from Portugal on 25 June 1975. A law had been passed on the initiative of the relatively unknown [[Armando Guebuza]] of the FRELIMO party, ordering the Portuguese to leave the country in 24 hours with only {{convert|20|kg|lb|abbr=off}} of luggage. Unable to salvage any of their assets, most of them returned to Portugal penniless.

===Mozambican Civil War (1977–1992)===
{{Main|People's Republic of Mozambique|Mozambican Civil War}}

The [[People's Republic of Mozambique|new government]] under President [[Samora Machel]] established a [[one-party state]] based on [[Marxism|Marxist]] principles. It received diplomatic and some military support from [[Cuba]] and the [[Soviet Union]] and proceeded to crack down on opposition. Starting shortly after independence, the country was plagued from 1977 to 1992 by a long and violent civil war between the opposition forces of anti-communist Mozambican National Resistance ([[RENAMO]]) rebel militias and the FRELIMO regime. This conflict characterised the first decades of Mozambican independence, combined with sabotage from the neighbouring states of [[Rhodesia]] and South Africa, ineffective policies, failed central planning, and the resulting economic collapse. This period was also marked by the exodus of Portuguese nationals and Mozambicans of Portuguese heritage, a collapsed infrastructure, lack of investment in productive assets, and government nationalisation of privately owned industries, as well as widespread famine.

During most of the civil war, the FRELIMO-formed central government was unable to exercise effective control outside urban areas, many of which were cut off from the capital. The war was marked by mass human rights violations from both sides of the conflict, with both RENAMO and FRELIMO contributing to the chaos through the use of terror and indiscriminate targeting of civilians. The central government executed tens of thousands of people while trying to extend its control throughout the country and sent many people to "re-education camps" where thousands died. The FRELIMO regime also gave shelter and support to South African ([[African National Congress]]) and Zimbabwean ([[Zimbabwe African National Union]]) rebel movements, while the governments of Rhodesia and later Apartheid South Africa backed RENAMO in the civil war.

On 19 October 1986, Machel was on his way back from an international meeting in Zambia when his [[1986 Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 crash|plane crashed]] in the [[Lebombo Mountains]] near [[Mbuzini]] in South Africa. President Machel and thirty-three others died, including ministers and officials of the Mozambique government. The United Nations' Soviet delegation issued a minority report contending that their expertise and experience had been undermined by the South Africans. Representatives of the Soviet Union advanced the theory that the plane had been intentionally diverted by a false [[VHF omnidirectional range|navigational beacon]] signal, using a technology provided by military intelligence operatives of the South African government.

Machel's successor [[Joaquim Chissano]] implemented sweeping changes in the country, starting reforms such as changing from Marxism to capitalism and began peace talks with RENAMO. The new constitution enacted in 1990 provided for a [[multi-party system|multi-party political system]], a [[market economy|market-based economy]], and free elections. That same year, Mozambique abolished the people's republic as the country's official name. The civil war ended in October 1992 with the [[Rome General Peace Accords]], first brokered by the Christian Council of Mozambique (Council of Protestant Churches) and then taken over by [[Community of Sant'Egidio]]. Peace returned to Mozambique, under the supervision of the [[United Nations Operation in Mozambique|peacekeeping force of the United Nations]]. In 1995, Mozambique joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], becoming, at the time, the only member nation that had never been part of the [[British Empire]].

By mid-1995, over 1.7&nbsp;million refugees who had sought asylum in neighbouring countries had returned to Mozambique, part of the largest repatriation witnessed in sub-Saharan Africa. An additional four million [[internally displaced person]]s had returned to their homes.

In early 2000, a cyclone caused [[2000 Mozambique flood|widespread flooding]], killing hundreds and devastating the already precarious infrastructure. There were widespread suspicions that foreign aid resources had been diverted by powerful leaders of FRELIMO. [[Carlos Cardoso (journalist)|Carlos Cardoso]], a journalist investigating these allegations, was murdered, and his death was never satisfactorily explained.

Indicating in 2001 that he would not run for a third term, Chissano criticised leaders who stayed on longer than he had, which was generally seen as a reference to Zambian President [[Frederick Chiluba]] and Zimbabwean President [[Robert Mugabe]]. Presidential and National Assembly elections took place on 1–2 December 2004. FRELIMO candidate [[Armando Guebuza]] won with 64% of the popular vote, and Dhlakama received 32% of the popular vote. FRELIMO won 160 seats in Parliament, with a coalition of RENAMO and several small parties winning the 90 remaining seats. Guebuza was inaugurated as the President of Mozambique on 2 February 2005 and served two five-year terms. His successor, [[Filipe Nyusi]], became the fourth President of Mozambique on 15 January 2015.

From 2013 to 2019, a low-intensity [[RENAMO insurgency (2013–2021)|insurgency by RENAMO]] occurred, mainly in the country's central and northern regions. On 5 September 2014, Guebuza and Dhlakama signed the Accord on Cessation of Hostilities, which brought the military hostilities to a halt and allowed both parties to concentrate on the general elections to be held in October 2014. However, after the general elections, a new political crisis emerged. RENAMO did not recognise the validity of the election results and demanded the control of six provinces – Nampula, Niassa, Tete, Zambezia, Sofala, and Manica – where they claimed to have won a majority. About 12,000 refugees fled to [[Malawi]]. The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders]], and [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that government forces had torched villages and carried out [[summary execution]]s and [[Wartime sexual violence|sexual abuses]].

In October 2019, President Filipe Nyusi was re-elected after a landslide victory in [[2019 Mozambican general election|general election]]. FRELIMO won 184 seats, RENAMO got 60 seats and the MDM party received the remaining 6 seats in the National Assembly. Opposition did not accept the results because of allegations of fraud and irregularities. FRELIMO secured two-thirds majority in parliament which allowed FRELIMO to re-adjust the constitution without needing the agreement of the opposition.

Since 2017, the country has faced an [[Insurgency in Cabo Delgado|ongoing insurgency by Islamist groups]]. In September 2020, [[Islamic State|ISIL]] insurgents captured and briefly occupied [[Vamizi Island]] in the Indian Ocean. In March 2021, dozens of civilians were killed and 35,000 others were displaced after [[Battle of Palma|Islamist rebels seized]] the city of [[Palma, Mozambique|Palma]]. In December 2021, nearly 4,000 Mozambicans fled their villages after an intensification of jihadist attacks in [[Niassa Province|Niassa]].
