The islands of the Caribbean were first settled around 6,000 years ago by hunter-gatherer peoples originating from Central America or northern South America. The [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan-speaking]] ancestors of the [[Taíno]] moved into the Caribbean from South America during the 1st millennium BCE, reaching Hispaniola by around 600 CE. These Arawakan peoples engaged in farming, fishing, hunting and gathering, to 2 million.

By 1492, the island was divided into five Taíno chiefdoms. The Taíno name for the entire island was either ''Ayiti'' or ''Quisqueya''.

===European colonization===
[[File:Basílica Menor de Santa María SD RD 02 2017 1947.jpg|thumb|[[Catedral Santa María La Menor]] is the oldest cathedral built in the Americas]]
[[Christopher Columbus]] arrived on the island on December 5, 1492, during the first of his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|four voyages]] to the Americas. He claimed the land for Spain and named it ''La Española'', due to its diverse climate and terrain, which reminded him of the [[Spain|Spanish]] landscape. In 1496, [[Bartholomew Columbus]], Christopher's brother, built the city of [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Santo Domingo]], Western Europe's first permanent settlement in the "[[New World]]". The Spaniards created a [[plantation economy]].

Initially, after friendly relationships, the Taínos resisted the conquest, led by female Chief [[Anacaona]] of Xaragua and her ex-husband Chief [[Caonabo]] of Maguana, as well as Chiefs [[Guacanagaríx]], [[Guamá]], [[Hatuey]], and [[Enriquillo]]. The latter's successes gained his people an autonomous enclave on the island. Within a few years after 1492, the population of Taínos had declined drastically due to [[smallpox]], measles, and other diseases that arrived with the Europeans. African slaves were imported to replace the dwindling Taínos.

The last record of pure Taínos in the country was from 1864. Still, Taíno biological heritage survived due to intermixing. Census records from 1514 reveal that 40% of Spanish men in Santo Domingo were married to Taíno women, and some present-day Dominicans have Taíno ancestry.

In 1795, Spain ceded Santo Domingo to France by the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]] as a result of its defeat in the [[War of the Pyrenees]]. Saint-Domingue achieved independence as Haiti from France on January 1, 1804. In 1809, the French were expelled from the island and Santo Domingo returned to [[España Boba|Spanish rule]].{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=342}}

===Ephemeral independence and Haitian occupation===
{{Main|Republic of Spanish Haiti|Haitian occupation of Santo Domingo}}
[[File:LaTrinitaria.jpg|thumb|In 1838, [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] and others established a secret patriotic society called ''[[La Trinitaria (Dominican Republic)|La Trinitaria]]'', which helped undermine Haitian occupation.]]
After a dozen years of discontent and failed independence plots by various opposing groups, including a [[1812 Mendoza and Mojarra conspiracy|failed 1812 revolt]] led by [[Freedman|freedmen]], Santo Domingo's former Lieutenant-Governor (top administrator), [[José Núñez de Cáceres]], declared the colony's independence from the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]] as [[Republic of Spanish Haiti|Spanish Haiti]], on November 30, 1821. This period is also known as the Ephemeral independence.

The newly independent republic ended two months later, when it was occupied and annexed by Haiti, then under the leadership of [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]]. For twenty-two years, Haiti controlled Santo Domingo, which it called ''Partie de l'Est'', treating it as a colonial territory. The unpaid Haitian army sustained itself by taking resources from the Dominican people and land without compensation.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=343}}

===First Republic (1844–1861)===
[[File:Flag of the Dominican Republic (up to 1844).svg|thumb|Original [[flag of the Dominican Republic]] (up to 1849)]]
In 1838, [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] founded a secret society called [[La Trinitaria (Dominican Republic)|La Trinitaria]], which sought the complete independence of Santo Domingo without any foreign intervention.{{rp|p147–149}} Also [[Francisco del Rosario Sánchez]] and [[Ramon Matias Mella]], despite not being among the founding members of La Trinitaria, were decisive in the fight for independence. Duarte, Mella, and Sánchez are considered the Founding Fathers of the Dominican Republic.

On February 27, 1844, the members of ''La Trinitaria'' declared independence from Haiti. They were backed by [[Pedro Santana]], a wealthy cattle rancher, who became general of the army of the nascent republic. The decades that followed were filled with tyranny, factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of government, and exile for political opponents. Archrivals Santana and [[Buenaventura Báez]] held power most of the time, both ruling arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new nation to a major power. The Dominican Republic's first [[Constitution of the Dominican Republic|constitution]] was adopted on November 6, 1844, and its population  in 1845 was approximately 230,000 people (100,000 whites; 40,000 blacks; and 90,000 mulattoes).{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=343}}

In March 1844, Haiti invaded but the Dominicans put up stiff opposition and inflicted heavy casualties on the Haitians. By April 15, Dominican forces had defeated the Haitian forces on both land and sea.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=344}} In early July 1844, Duarte was urged by his followers to take the title of President of the Republic. Duarte agreed, but only if free elections were arranged. However, Santana's forces took Santo Domingo on July 12, and they declared Santana ruler of the Dominican Republic. Santana then put Mella, Duarte, and Sánchez in jail. On February 27, 1845, Santana executed [[María Trinidad Sánchez]], heroine of La Trinitaria, and others for conspiracy.

After defeating a third Haitian invasion in April 1849 at the [[Battle of Las Carreras]], Santana marched on Santo Domingo and deposed president [[Manuel Jimenes]] (who had ousted Santana as president) in a [[coup d'état]]. At his behest, Congress elected Buenaventura Báez as president, but Báez was unwilling to serve as Santana's puppet. In November–December 1849, Dominican seamen raided the Haitian coasts, plundered seaside villages, as far as [[Dame-Marie, Grand'Anse|Dame Marie]], and butchered crews of captured enemy ships. A fourth and final invasion by Haiti in November 1855 was defeated by Dominican forces by January 27, 1856, resulting in thousands of Haitian casualties.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=347}} Again Santana and Báez plotted against each other for political dominance, with Báez winning the first encounter and expelling Santana in 1857, and Santana winning the second and expelling Báez in 1859.

===Restoration republic===
[[File:Jura del gobernador y capitán general de Santo Domingo, don Pedro Santana (Museo del Prado).jpg|thumb|Pedro Santana is sworn in as governor-general of the new Spanish province.]]
In 1861, after imprisoning, exiling, and executing many of his opponents and due to political and economic reasons, Santana asked Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] to retake control of the Dominican Republic. Spain, which had not come to terms with the loss of its mainland American colonies 40 years earlier, [[Annexation of the Dominican Republic to Spain|annexed the country]]. The island was occupied by 30,000 Spanish troops bolstered by battalions of Cuban and Puerto Rican volunteers and 12,000 Dominicans who aligned themselves with the Spanish forces.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=347}} The Haitian rebel [[Sylvain Salnave]], fearful of the reestablishment of Spain as colonial power, gave refuge and logistics to revolutionaries seeking to reestablish the independent nation. The ensuing civil war, known as the ''War of Restoration'', killed more than 50,000.
[[File:665 of 'Anexion_y_guerra_de_Santo_Domingo ... Con un prólogo de D. C. Màrtos' (11167317435).jpg|thumb|Map of the capture of the trenches and camps held by the rebels in Puerto Plata on August 31, 1864, by the forces of [[José de la Gándara y Navarro]]]]
The war began on August 16, 1863. The Spanish garrison of Santiago was forced to abandon its fort and retreat to [[Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic|Puerto Plata]] by mid-September. The Dominicans bombarded the port of Puerto Plata and destroyed much of the town, including [[St. Philip the Apostle Cathedral, Puerto Plata|St. Philip the Apostle Cathedral]]. In the south, Spanish forces were successful in driving the rebels out of several towns and into Haiti. However, the capture of [[Azua, Dominican Republic|Azua]] proved to be a costly endeavor, with two months of fighting and a significant loss of lives for the Spanish. Spanish forces from Cuba attacked and captured [[Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic|Monte Cristi]] on the north coast, but sustained heavy casualties.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=348}}
[[File:Monumento a los Héroes de la Restauración 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|"Monument to the Heroes of the Restoration"]]
By 1865, the Dominican forces had confined the Spanish troops to Santo Domingo, and the Spaniards were afraid to venture outside the capital.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=349}} After nearly two years of fighting, Spain abandoned the island in July 1865. One military historian estimates Spanish casualties at 10,888 killed or wounded in action and thousands dead from [[yellow fever]], while the Dominican forces fighting for Spain suffered 10,000 casualties.{{sfn|Clodfelter|2017|p=306}} Another military historian estimates that Spain lost 18,000 dead, a figure that does not include the Dominicans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans fighting alongside them.{{sfn|Scheina|2003|p=349}} The Dominicans fighting for independence against Spain suffered more than 4,000 dead.

Political strife again prevailed in the following years; warlords ruled, military revolts were extremely common, and the nation amassed debt. It was now Báez's turn to act on his [[Proposed annexation of Santo Domingo|plan of annexing the country to the United States]], where two successive presidents were supportive. U.S. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] desired a naval base at [[Samaná Bay|Samaná]] and also a place for resettling newly freed African Americans. The treaty was defeated in the [[United States Senate]] in 1870. Báez was toppled in 1874, returned, and was toppled for good in 1878.

Relative peace came to the country in the 1880s, which saw the coming to power of General [[Ulises Heureaux]]. "Lilís", as the new president was nicknamed, put the nation deep into debt while using much of the proceeds for his personal use and to maintain his police state. In 1899, he was assassinated. However, the relative calm over which he presided allowed improvement in the Dominican economy. The sugar industry was modernized,{{rp|p10}} and the country attracted foreign workers and immigrants. Lebanese, Syrians, Turks, and Palestinians began to arrive in the country during the latter part of the 19th century. During the U.S. occupation of 1916–24, peasants from the countryside, called Gavilleros, would not only kill U.S. Marines, but would also attack and kill Arab vendors traveling through the countryside.

===20th century (1900–1930)===
[[File:Alejandro Woss y Gil.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Alejandro Woss y Gil]] taking office in 1903]]
From 1902 on, short-lived governments were again the norm, with their power usurped by caudillos in parts of the country. Furthermore, the national government was bankrupt and, unable to pay its debts to European creditors, faced the threat of military intervention by France, [[German Empire|Germany]], and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. United States President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sought to prevent European intervention, largely to protect the routes to the future [[Panama Canal]]. He made a small military intervention to ward off European powers, to proclaim his famous [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], and also to obtain his 1905 Dominican agreement for U.S. administration of Dominican customs, which was the chief source of income for the Dominican government. A 1906 agreement provided for the arrangement to last 50 years. The United States agreed to use part of the customs proceeds to reduce the immense foreign debt of the Dominican Republic and assumed responsibility for said debt. Wilson thus ordered the U.S. occupation of the Dominican Republic.

[[File:FortalezaPOP.jpg|thumb|[[Fortaleza San Felipe|Fort San Felipe]] was captured on June 1, 1916, by 133 U.S. Marines after a battle against 500 Dominican rebels, resulting in several U.S. casualties.{{sfn|Musicant|1990|p=249}}]]
[[File:USMC Fortaleza Ozama from river 1922 restored.jpg|thumb|The flag of the [[United States]] waving over [[Fortaleza Ozama|Ozama Fortress]] during the U.S. occupation of the Dominican Republic, {{Circa|1922}}]]
U.S. Marines landed on May 16, 1916, and seized the capital and other ports, while General Arias fell back to his inland Santiago stronghold.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=49}} A significant weaponry disparity led to Arias's defeat as his forces tried to block the Marines' advance on Santiago with trenches and black-powder rifles. The clashes with the U.S. Marines marked the first time the Dominicans had ever encountered a machine gun.{{sfn|Musicant|1990|p=252}} A peace delegation from Santiago surrendered the city on July 5, coinciding with General Arias' surrender to the Dominican governor. The military government established by the U.S. under the Navy and Marine Corps on November 29, led by Vice Admiral [[Harry Shepard Knapp]], was widely repudiated by the Dominicans, but organized resistance ceased.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=52}}

The occupation regime kept most Dominican laws and institutions and largely pacified the general population. The occupying government also revived the Dominican economy, reduced the nation's debt, built a road network that at last interconnected all regions of the country, and created a professional National Guard to replace the warring partisan units. The system of forced labour used by the [[United States occupation of Haiti|Marines in Haiti]] was largely absent in the Dominican Republic.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1978|p=17}}

The U.S. government's rule ended in October 1922, and elections were held in March 1924. This was accompanied most noticeably by absolute repression and the copious use of murder, torture, and terrorist methods against the opposition.

Several Dominicans were assassinated in [[New York City]] after taking part in anti-Trujillo activities. In October 1937, Dominican troops murdered 10,000 to 15,000 Haitian men, women, and children—mostly with machetes—along the Haitian-Dominican border under the orders of Trujillo. Between 1946 and 1949, the Dominican government purchased military aircraft and warships from the British government, which were used to defeat the invasion by air and sea.

On November 25, 1960, Trujillo's henchmen killed three of the four [[Mirabal sisters]], nicknamed ''Las Mariposas'' (The Butterflies). Along with their husbands, the sisters were conspiring to overthrow Trujillo in a violent revolt. The [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]] is observed on the anniversary of their deaths.

[[File:1960. Junio, 24. Atentado a Rómulo Betancourt en Los Próceres.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of the June 24, 1960, assassination attempt.]]
For a long time, the U.S. and the Dominican elite supported the Trujillo government. This support persisted despite the assassinations of political opposition, the [[parsley massacre|massacre of Haitians]], and Trujillo's plots against other countries. The U.S. finally broke with Trujillo in 1960, after Trujillo's agents attempted to assassinate the Venezuelan president [[Rómulo Betancourt]] with a car bomb, as he was a fierce critic of Trujillo. The assassination attempt in [[Caracas]] wounded the Venezuelan president and his Minister of Defense, and killed an air force colonel and a policeman. During Betancourt's earlier exile in Cuba, Trujillo's agents attempted to inject poison into him on a Havana street in broad daylight.

[[File:KMO 157030 03580 1 t236 204404.jpg|thumb|Trujillo's car following the May 30, 1961, assassination.]]
After its representatives confirmed Trujillo's complicity in the nearly successful assassination attempt, the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), for the first time in its history, decreed sanctions against a member state.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1978|p=28}} The OAS voted unanimously to condemn the Dominican Republic for its aggression and imposed an arms embargo.{{sfn|Scheina|2003b|p=256}} The United States severed diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic on August 26, 1960, and in January 1961 suspended the export of trucks, parts, crude oil, gasoline and other petroleum products. U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] also took advantage of OAS sanctions to drastically cut purchases of Dominican sugar, the country's major export. This action ultimately cost the Dominican Republic almost $22,000,000 in lost revenues at a time when its economy was in a rapid decline. Trujillo had become expendable, and dissidents inside the Dominican Republic argued that assassination was the only certain way to remove him.

On May 30, 1961, Trujillo was shot and killed by Dominican dissidents during a car chase. Balaguer remained in power as president for 12 years. His tenure was a period of repression of human rights and civil liberties. His rule was criticized for a growing disparity between rich and poor. It was, however, praised for an ambitious infrastructure program, which included construction of large housing projects, sports complexes, theaters, museums, aqueducts, roads, highways, and the massive [[Columbus Lighthouse]], completed in 1992 during a later tenure.

In 1978, Balaguer was succeeded to the presidency by opposition candidate [[Antonio Guzmán Fernández]], of the [[Dominican Revolutionary Party]] (PRD). [[Hurricane David]] hit the Dominican Republic in August 1979, which left upwards of 2,000 people dead and 200,000 homeless. The hurricane caused over $1 billion in damage. Another PRD win in 1982 followed, under [[Salvador Jorge Blanco]]. Balaguer regained the presidency in 1986 and was re-elected in 1990 and 1994, in the latter defeating PRD candidate [[José Francisco Peña Gómez]], a former mayor of Santo Domingo.<!--some info needs to be added about Balaguer's performance 1986-96--> The 1994 elections were flawed, bringing international pressure, to which Balaguer responded by scheduling another presidential contest in 1996. Balaguer was not a candidate. The PSRC candidate was his Vice President [[Jacinto Peynado Garrigosa]].

===1996–present===
In 1996, with the support of Joaquín Balaguer and the Social Christian Reform Party in a coalition called the Patriotic Front, [[Leonel Fernández]] achieved the first-ever win for the [[Dominican Liberation Party]] (PLD), which Bosch had founded in 1973 after leaving the PRD. Fernández oversaw a fast-growing economy: growth averaged 7.7% per year, unemployment fell, and exchange and inflation rates were stable. He was succeeded by the opposition candidate [[Luis Abinader]] in the [[2020 Dominican Republic general election|2020 election]] (weeks after [[2020 Dominican Republic protests|protests erupted in the country]] against Medina's government), marking the end to 16 years in power of the centre-left Dominican Liberation Party (PLD). In May 2024, President Luis Abinader won a second term in the [[2024 Dominican Republic general election|elections]]. His tough policies towards migration from neighbouring Haiti was popular among voters.
