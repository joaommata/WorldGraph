{{Main|History of Latvia}}
Around 3000 BC, the Proto-Baltic ancestors of the Latvian people settled on the eastern coast of the [[Baltic Sea]]. The [[Balts]] established trade routes to Rome and [[Byzantium]], trading local [[amber]] for precious metals. By 900 AD, four distinct Baltic tribes inhabited Latvia: [[Curonians]], [[Latgalians]], [[Selonians]], [[Semigallians]] (in Latvian: ''kurši'', ''latgaļi'', ''sēļi'' and ''zemgaļi''), as well as the Finnic tribe of [[Livonian people|Livonians]] (''lībieši'') speaking a Finnic language.

In the 12th century in the territory of Latvia, there were lands with their rulers: {{Interlanguage link|Vanema|lv|Vanema}}, {{Interlanguage link|Ventava (land)|lt=Ventava|lv|Ventava}}, [[Bandava]], [[Piemare]], {{Interlanguage link|Duvzare|lv|Duvzare}}, {{Interlanguage link|Selen (land)|lt=Selen|lv|Sēlija (zeme)}}, [[Principality of Koknese|Koknese]], [[Jersika]], [[Tālava]] and {{Interlanguage link|Atzele|lv|Atzele}}.

=== Medieval period ===
Although the local people had contact with the outside world for centuries, they became more fully integrated into the European socio-political system in the 12th century. The first missionaries, sent by the pope, sailed up the [[Daugava]] River in the late 12th century, seeking converts. The local people, however, did not convert to Christianity as readily as the church had hoped.

At the beginning of the 13th century, Germans ruled large parts of what is currently Latvia. Together with southern Estonia, these conquered areas formed the [[Crusader states|crusader state]] that became known as [[Terra Mariana]] ([[Medieval Latin]] for "Land of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]") or Livonia. In 1282, [[Riga]], and later the cities of [[Cēsis]], [[Limbaži]], [[Koknese]] and [[Valmiera]], became part of the [[Hanseatic League]]. The first German settlers were knights from northern Germany and citizens of northern German towns who brought their [[Low German]] language to the region, which shaped many loanwords in the Latvian language.

=== Reformation period and Polish and Swedish rule ===
{{Main|Swedish Livonia|Duchy of Courland and Semigallia|Duchy of Livonia|Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth}}
[[File:Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth at its maximum extent.svg|thumb|The [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] at its largest extent; modern-day boundaries are also shown.]]

After the [[Livonian War]] (1558–1583), Livonia (northern Latvia and southern Estonia) fell under the hegemony of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Though the duchy was a vassal state to the Lithuanian Grand Duchy and later of Poland–Lithuania, it retained a considerable degree of autonomy and experienced a golden age in the 16th century. [[Latgalia]], the easternmost region of Latvia, became a part of the [[Inflanty Voivodeship]] of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

In the 17th and early 18th centuries, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] struggled for supremacy in the eastern Baltic. After the [[Polish–Swedish War (1600–1611)|Polish–Swedish War]], northern Livonia (including Vidzeme) came under Swedish rule. Riga became the capital of [[Swedish Livonia]] and the largest city in the entire Swedish Empire. Fighting continued sporadically between Sweden and Poland until the [[Truce of Altmark]] in 1629. In Latvia, the Swedish period is generally remembered as positive; serfdom was eased, a network of schools was established for the peasantry, and the power of the regional [[baltic Germans|barons]] was diminished.

Several important cultural changes occurred during this time. Under Swedish and largely German rule, western Latvia adopted [[Lutheranism]] as its main religion. The ancient tribes of the Couronians, Semigallians, Selonians, Livs, and northern Latgallians assimilated to form the Latvian people, speaking one Latvian language. An actual Latvian state had not been established, so the borders and definitions of who fell within that group are largely subjective. Meanwhile, largely isolated from the rest of Latvia, southern Latgallians adopted [[Catholicism]] under Polish/[[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] influence. The native dialect remained distinct, although it acquired many Polish and Russian loanwords.

=== Livonia and Courland in the Russian Empire ===
During the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721), up to 40 percent of Latvians died from famine and plague. Half the residents of Riga were killed by [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague in 1710–1711]]. The [[capitulation of Estonia and Livonia]] in 1710 and the [[Treaty of Nystad]], ending the Great Northern War in 1721, gave Vidzeme to Russia (it became part of the [[Governorate of Livonia|Riga Governorate]]).  The Latgale region remained part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as Inflanty Voivodeship until 1772, when it was incorporated into Russia. The [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]], a vassal state of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, was annexed by Russia in 1795 in the [[Third Partition of Poland]], bringing all of what is now Latvia into the Russian Empire. All three Baltic provinces preserved local laws, German as the local [[official language]] and their own parliament, the [[Landtag]].

The emancipation of the serfs took place in Courland in 1817 and in Vidzeme in 1819. In practice, however, the emancipation was actually advantageous to the landowners and nobility, as it dispossessed peasants of their land without compensation, forcing them to return to work at the estates "of their own free will". During these two centuries Latvia experienced economic and construction boom – ports were expanded (Riga became the largest port in the Russian Empire), railways built; new factories, banks, and a university were established; many residential, public (theatres and museums), and school buildings were erected; new parks formed; and so on. Riga's boulevards and some streets outside the Old Town date from this period. [[Numeracy]] was also higher in the Livonian and Courlandian parts of the Russian Empire, which may have been influenced by the Protestant religion of the inhabitants.

During the 19th century, the social structure changed dramatically. A class of independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the peasants to repurchase their land, but many landless peasants remained. Many Latvians left for the cities and sought education and industrial jobs. The rise in use of the Latvian language in literature and society became known as the [[Latvian National Awakening|First National Awakening]]. Popular discontent exploded in the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|1905 Russian Revolution]], which took a nationalist character in the Baltic provinces.

=== Declaration of independence and interwar period ===
[[File:Janis Cakste.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[Jānis Čakste]] (1859–1927), the first [[president of Latvia]]]]

[[World War I]] devastated the territory and other western parts of the Russian Empire. Demands for [[self-determination]] were initially confined to [[autonomy]], until a power vacuum was created by the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, followed by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] between Russia and Germany in March 1918, then the Allied [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918]]. The [[People's Council of Latvia]] proclaimed the independence, and [[Kārlis Ulmanis]] was entrusted to set up a government and he took the position of prime minister. The general representative of Germany [[August Winnig]] formally handed over political power to the Latvian provisional government on 26 November, and he became its first prime minister.

The [[Latvian War of Independence|war of independence]] that followed was part of a general chaotic period of civil and new border wars in eastern Europe. By the spring of 1919, there were actually three governments: the provisional government headed by Ulmanis, supported by the [[Tautas padome]] and the [[Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control|Inter-Allied Commission of Control]]; the [[Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic|Latvian Soviet government]] led by [[Pēteris Stučka]], supported by the [[Red Army]]; and the provisional government headed by [[Andrievs Niedra]], supported by [[Freikorps in the Baltic|Baltic-German forces]] composed of the ''[[Baltische Landeswehr]]'' ("Baltic Defence Force") and the [[Freikorps]] formation ''[[Eiserne Division]]'' ("Iron Division"). Estonian and Latvian forces defeated the Germans at the [[Battle of Cēsis (1919)|Battle of Wenden]] in June 1919, and a massive attack by a predominantly German force—the [[West Russian Volunteer Army]]—under [[Pavel Bermondt-Avalov]] was repelled in November. Eastern Latvia was cleared of Red Army forces by Latvian and Polish troops in early 1920 (from the Polish perspective the [[Battle of Daugavpils]] was a part of the [[Polish–Soviet War]]).

A freely elected [[constituent assembly]] convened on 1 May 1920 and adopted a liberal constitution, the ''[[Constitution of Latvia|Satversme]]'', in February 1922. On 15 May 1934, Ulmanis staged [[1934 Latvian coup d'état|a bloodless coup]], establishing a nationalist dictatorship that lasted until 1940. After 1934, Ulmanis established [[government corporation]]s to buy up private firms with the aim of "Latvianising" the economy. The constitution was partly suspended by Ulmanis after his coup in 1934 but reaffirmed in 1990. Since then, it has been amended and is still in effect in Latvia today. With most of Latvia's industrial base evacuated to the interior of Russia in 1915, radical land reform was the central political question for the young state. In 1897, 61.2% of the rural population had been landless; by 1936, that percentage had been reduced to 18%.

=== Occupations, 1940–1990 ===

Early in the morning of 24 August 1939, the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]] signed a 10-year non-aggression pact, called the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. The pact contained a secret protocol, revealed only after Germany's defeat in 1945, according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet "[[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]". In the north, Latvia, Finland and Estonia were assigned to the Soviet sphere. Most of those who remained left for Germany in summer 1940, when a second resettlement scheme was agreed. The racially approved being resettled mainly in Poland, being given land and businesses in exchange for the money they had received from the sale of their previous assets.{{rp|46}}

On 5 October 1939, Latvia was forced to accept a "mutual assistance" pact with the Soviet Union, granting the Soviets the right to station between 25,000 and 30,000 troops on Latvian territory. State administrators were murdered and replaced by Soviet cadres. Elections were held with single pro-Soviet candidates listed for many positions. The resulting people's assembly immediately requested admission into the USSR, which the Soviet Union granted. The Soviet Union incorporated Latvia on 5 August 1940, as the ''[[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic]].''

The Soviets dealt harshly with their [[Enemy of the people#Soviet Union|perceived opponents]]&nbsp;– prior to [[Operation Barbarossa]], in less than a year, at least 34,250 Latvians were [[June deportation|deported]] or killed. Most were deported to Siberia where deaths were estimated at 40 percent. There were some spontaneous uprisings by Latvians against the Red Army which helped the Germans. By 29 June [[Riga]] was reached and with Soviet troops killed, captured or retreating, Latvia was left under the control of German forces by early July. Latvian paramilitary and [[Arajs Kommando|Auxiliary Police]] units established by the occupation authority participated in [[the Holocaust]] and other atrocities. An extensive program to impose [[bilingualism]] was initiated in Latvia, limiting the use of Latvian language in official uses in favor of using Russian as the main language. All of the minority schools (Jewish, Polish, Belarusian, Estonian, Lithuanian) were closed down leaving only two media of instructions in the schools: Latvian and Russian. An influx of new colonists, including laborers, administrators, military personnel and their dependents from Russia and other Soviet republics started. By 1959 about 400,000 Russian settlers arrived and the ethnic Latvian population had fallen to 62%.

Since Latvia had maintained a well-developed infrastructure and educated specialists, Moscow decided to base some of the Soviet Union's most advanced manufacturing in Latvia. New industry was created in Latvia, including a major [[Riga Autobus Factory|machinery factory RAF]] in [[Jelgava]], electrotechnical factories in [[Riga]], chemical factories in [[Daugavpils]], [[Valmiera]] and [[Olaine]]—and some food and oil processing plants. Latvia manufactured trains, ships, minibuses, mopeds, telephones, radios and hi-fi systems, electrical and diesel engines, textiles, furniture, clothing, bags and luggage, shoes, musical instruments, home appliances, watches, tools and equipment, aviation and agricultural equipment and long list of other goods. Latvia had its own film industry and musical records factory (LPs). However, there were not enough people to operate the newly built factories.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} To maintain and expand industrial production, skilled workers were migrating from all over the Soviet Union, decreasing the proportion of ethnic Latvians in the republic. The population of Latvia reached its peak in 1990 at just under 2.7 million people.

In the second half of the 1980s, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] started to introduce political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union that were called [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]]. In the summer of 1987, the first large demonstrations were held in Riga at the [[Freedom Monument]]—a symbol of independence. In the summer of 1988, a national movement, coalescing in the [[Popular Front of Latvia]], was opposed by the [[International Front of the Working People of Latvia|Interfront]]. The Latvian SSR, along with the other [[Baltic states|Baltic Republics]] was allowed greater autonomy, and in 1988, the old pre-war [[Flag of Latvia]] flew again, replacing the Soviet Latvian flag as the official flag in 1990. In 1989, the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] adopted a resolution on the ''[[Occupation of the Baltic states]]'', in which it declared the occupation "not in accordance with law", and not the "will of the Soviet people". Pro-independence Popular Front of Latvia candidates gained a two-thirds majority in the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia|Supreme Council]] in the [[1990 Latvian Supreme Soviet election|March 1990 democratic elections]].

On 4 May 1990, the Supreme Council adopted the [[Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia]], and the Latvian SSR was renamed Republic of Latvia.

However, the central power in Moscow continued to regard Latvia as a Soviet republic in 1990 and 1991. In January 1991, Soviet political and military forces unsuccessfully tried to overthrow the Republic of Latvia authorities by occupying the central publishing house in Riga and establishing a Committee of National Salvation to usurp governmental functions. During the transitional period, Moscow maintained many central Soviet state authorities in Latvia. Children born to non-nationals or stateless persons after the re-establishment of independence on 21 August 1991 are automatically entitled to citizenship.

The Republic of Latvia declared the end of the transitional period and restored full independence on 21 August 1991, in the aftermath of the failed [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|Soviet coup attempt]]. Latvia resumed diplomatic relations with Western states, including Sweden. The [[Saeima]], Latvia's parliament, was again elected in 1993. Russia ended its military presence by completing its troop withdrawal in 1994 and shutting down the [[Skrunda-1]] radar station in 1998.

The major goals of Latvia in the 1990s, to join [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], were achieved in 2004. The [[NATO Summit 2006]] was held in Riga. [[Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga]] was [[President of Latvia]] from 1999 until 2007. She was the first female head of state in the former Soviet bloc state and was active in Latvia joining both NATO and the European Union in 2004. Latvia signed the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen agreement]] on 16 April 2003 and started its implementation on 21 December 2007.

Approximately 72% of Latvian citizens are Latvian, while 20% are Russian. The government denationalized private property confiscated by the Soviets, returning it or compensating the owners for it, and [[privatization|privatized]] most state-owned industries, reintroducing the [[Latvian lats|prewar currency]]. Albeit having experienced a difficult transition to a liberal economy and its re-orientation toward Western Europe, Latvia is one of the fastest growing economies in the European Union. In November 2013, [[Zolitūde shopping centre roof collapse|the roof collapsed]] at a shopping center in Riga, causing Latvia's worst post-independence disaster with the deaths of 54 rush hour shoppers and rescue personnel.

In late 2018 the National Archives of Latvia released a full alphabetical index of some 10,000 people recruited as agents or informants by the Soviet KGB. 'The publication, which followed two decades of public debate and the passage of a special law, revealed the names, code names, birthplaces and other data on active and former KGB agents as of 1991, the year Latvia regained its independence from the Soviet Union.'

In May 2023, the parliament elected [[Edgars Rinkēvičs]] as new [[President of Latvia]], making him the European Union's first openly gay head of state. After years of debates, Latvia ratified the EU ''Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence'', otherwise known as the [[Istanbul Convention]] in November 2023.
