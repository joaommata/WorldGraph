Kazakhstan has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic]] era. The [[Botai culture]] (3700–3100 BC) is credited with the first domestication of horses. The Botai population derived most of their ancestry from a deeply European-related population known as [[Ancient North Eurasian]]s, while also displaying some [[Genetic history of East Asians|Ancient East Asian]] admixture. [[Pastoralism]] developed during the [[Neolithic]]. The population was [[Caucasian race|Caucasoid]] during the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]] period.

The Kazakh territory was a key constituent of the Eurasian trading [[Steppe Route]], the ancestor of the terrestrial [[Silk Road UNESCO World Heritage Sites|Silk Roads]]. Archaeologists believe that humans first [[domestication of the horse|domesticated the horse]] in the region's vast steppes. During recent prehistoric times, Central Asia was inhabited by groups such as the possibly Indo-European [[Afanasievo culture]], later early [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] cultures such as [[Andronovo culture|Andronovo]], and later Indo-Iranians such as the [[Saka]] and [[Massagetae]]. Other groups included the nomadic [[Scythians]] and the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the southern territory of the modern country. The Andronovo and [[Srubnaya culture]]s, precursors to the peoples of the [[Scythian cultures]], were found to harbor mixed ancestry from the [[Yamnaya culture|Yamnaya]] [[Western Steppe Herders|Steppe herders]] and peoples of the Central European Middle Neolithic.

In 329 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] and his [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] army fought in the [[Battle of Jaxartes]] against the [[Scythians]] along the Jaxartes River, now known as the [[Syr Darya]] along the southern border of modern Kazakhstan.

=== Turkic Khaganate ===
{{main|Turkic migration|First Turkic Khaganate}}

The main [[Turkic migration|migration]] of [[Turkic peoples]] occurred between the 5th and 11th centuries when they spread across most of Central Asia. The Turkic peoples slowly replaced and assimilated the previous [[Iranian languages|Iranian]]-speaking locals, turning the population of Central Asia from largely [[Indo-Iranians|Iranian]], into primarily of East Asian descent.

The [[First Turkic Khaganate]] was founded by [[Bumin Qaghan|Bumin]] in 552 on the Mongolian Plateau and quickly spread west toward the Caspian Sea. The [[Göktürks]] drove before them various peoples: [[Xionites]], [[Uar (tribe)|Uar]], [[Onogurs|Oghur]]s, and others. These seem to have merged into the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Old Great Bulgaria|Bulgars]]. Within 35 years, the [[Eastern Turkic Khaganate|eastern half]] and the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]] were independent. The Western Khaganate reached its peak in the early 7th century.

=== Cuman-Kipchak and the Golden Horde ===

The [[Cuman people|Cumans]] entered the steppes of modern-day Kazakhstan around the early 11th century, where they later joined with the [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] and established the vast Cuman-Kipchak confederation. While ancient cities [[Taraz]] (Aulie-Ata) and [[Hazrat-e Turkestan]] had long served as important way-stations along the [[Silk Road]] connecting Asia and Europe, true political consolidation began only with the Mongol rule of the early 13th century. Under the [[Mongol Empire]], the first strictly structured administrative districts (Ulus) were established. After the [[division of the Mongol Empire]] in 1259, the land that would become modern-day Kazakhstan was ruled by the [[Golden Horde]], also known as the Ulus of Jochi. During the Golden Horde period, a [[Turco-Mongol tradition]] emerged among the ruling elite wherein [[Turkification|Turkicised]] descendants of [[Genghis Khan]] followed [[Islam]] and continued to reign over the lands.

=== Kazakh Khanate ===
{{Main|Kazakh Khanate}}

In 15th century, the [[Kazakh Khanate]] emerged as a result of the dissolution of the [[Golden Horde]]. Established by [[Janibek Khan]] and [[Kerei Khan]], it continued to be ruled by the [[Chinggisids|Chingissid]] clan of [[Töre (dynasty)|Tore]] ([[Jochi]]d dynasty). The Kazakh Khanate was a successor state of the left (eastern) wing of Ulus Of Jochi.

In the early 16th century, Kazakhs transformed [[Kazakh Khanate|the Khanate]] into a [[nomadic empire]] stretching across the steppes east of the Caspian Sea and north of the [[Aral Sea]] as far as the upper [[Irtysh|Irtysh River]] and the western approaches to the [[Altai Mountains]]. During the reigns of [[Burunduk Khan]] (ruled 1488–1509) and [[Kasym Khan]] (1509–18), the Kazakhs were the masters of virtually the entire steppe region, reportedly able to bring 200,000 cavalry into the field and feared by all their neighbours. Many historians consider Kasym Khan's leadership the starting point of a distinct and sovereign Kazakh state. His influence extended Kazakh authority from the southeastern regions of modern Kazakhstan to the [[Ural Mountains]].

During the reign of the three sons of [[Kasym Khan]], the authority of the khan weakened somewhat, leading to the eventual fragmentation of the Kazakh Khanate into three distinct "hordes": the Great Horde in southeastern Kazakhstan north of the Tien Shan, the Middle Horde in the central steppe near the Aral Sea, and the Little Horde between the Aral Sea and the Ural River. In these regions, the khan’s power was often constrained by tribal leaders, known as sultans, and even more so by the beys and batyrs, heads of the clan-based communities. Although the khans nominally commanded a formidable military, their authority relied heavily on the loyalty of these local leaders.

{{blockquote|Akhnazar, having established himself as khan, greatly expanded his power, not only ruling over the Nogais and the Bashkirs, but also conquering the Kazan, Siberian, and Astrakhan kingdoms, as well as Bukhara, Khiva, Tashkent, and many other cities, bringing them under his control and extracting tribute from them. Before his rule, the Bashkirs were governed by various regional khans: Kucum Khan of Siberia to the east, the Kazan khans controlling the lands by the Belaya and Yaik rivers, and the Nogai khans in the southern mountains. Akhnazar, however, brought them all under his dominion, consolidating power and reducing them to subjugation. He took note of their instability, disorder, and various acts of theft, relentlessly exhausting their resources and rendering them powerless. He limited them to only a single cooking pot for every three households, seized their livestock, goods, and even their children, and prohibited them from owning land or crossing the Belaya River. Those who hunted for fur were forced to pay him tribute in the form of one fox, one beaver, and one marten for each person. This constant exploitation eventually led the people to the brink of utter poverty and destitution.

During the 17th century, the Kazakhs fought the [[Oirats]], a federation of western [[Mongols|Mongol]] tribes, including the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]]. The beginning of the 18th century marked the zenith of the Kazakh Khanate. During this period the Little Horde participated in the 1723–1730 [[Kazakh-Dzungar Wars|war against the Dzungar Khanate]], following their "Great Disaster" invasion of Kazakh territory. Under the leadership of [[Abul Khair Khan]], the Kazakhs won major victories over the Dzungar at the Bulanty River in 1726 and at the [[Battle of Añyraqai]] in 1729.

[[File:Abulkhair_Khan.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Abul Khair Khan|Abulkhair Khan]], Khan of the Little Horde]]

[[Ablai Khan]] participated in the most significant battles against the Dzungars from the 1720s to the 1750s, for which he was declared a "''batyr''" ("hero") by the people. He later became the last khan whose authority was recognised across the Kazakh steppe, ruling the Middle Zhuz from 1771 to 1781. In 1740, Ablai had accepted Russian suzerainty, while pursuing a policy of balancing between [[Russian Empire]] and [[Qing dynasty]], which for a time allowed the Kazakh Khanate to preserve relative autonomy. After his death, his son Vali Khan (1781–1819) abandoned an independent policy and acknowledged [[Russian Empire|Russian]] authority. to prevent Kazakh and Oirat raids into Russian territory. In the late 18th century the Kazakhs took advantage of [[Pugachev's Rebellion]], which was centred on the Volga area, to raid Russian and [[Volga Germans|Volga German]] settlements. In the 19th century, the [[Russian Empire]] began to expand its influence into Central Asia. The "[[Great Game]]" period is generally regarded as running from approximately 1813 to the [[Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907]]. The [[tsar]]s effectively ruled over most of the territory belonging to what is now the Republic of Kazakhstan.

The Russian Empire introduced an administrative system and built military garrisons and barracks in its effort to establish a presence in Central Asia in the so-called "Great Game" for dominance in the area against the [[British Empire]], which was extending its influence from the south in India and Southeast Asia. Russia built its first outpost, [[Orsk]], in 1735. Russia introduced the Russian language in all schools and governmental organisations.

Russia's efforts to impose its system aroused the resentment of the Kazakhs, and, by the 1860s, some Kazakhs resisted its rule. Russia had disrupted the traditional nomadic lifestyle and livestock-based economy, and people were suffering from starvation, with some Kazakh tribes being decimated. The Kazakh national movement, which began in the late 19th century, sought to preserve the native language and identity by resisting the attempts of the Russian Empire to assimilate and stifle Kazakh culture.

Due to its incorporation into the Russian Empire, Kazakh intellectuals led a cultural renaissance that surpassed those of other Central Asian peoples. Russian schooling brought modern ideas to the steppe, and figures like [[Shoqan Walikhanov]] and [[Abai Qunanbaiuly|Abay Kunanbayev]] adapted these ideas to the specific needs of Kazakh society, creating a secular culture unparalleled in other parts of Asian Russia. [[Vasile Balabanov]] was the administrator responsible for the resettlement during much of this time.

The competition for land and water that ensued between the Kazakhs and the newcomers caused great resentment against colonial rule during the final years of the [[Russian Empire]]. The most serious uprising, the [[Central Asian revolt of 1916|Central Asian revolt]], occurred in 1916. The Kazakhs attacked Russian and [[Cossacks|Cossack]] settlers and military garrisons. The revolt resulted in a series of clashes and in brutal massacres committed by both sides. Both sides resisted the communist government until late 1919.

In the wake of the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Alash Autonomy|Alash Orda]] government was formed in 1917 as an attempt to secure Kazakh autonomy. Although it existed only in name, Alash Orda represented the Kazakh push for self-rule. The Bolshevik Red Army eventually defeated White Russian forces in the region by 1920, and Kazakhstan was incorporated into the Soviet Union. During the 1930s, some members of the Kazakh intelligentsia were executed – as part of the [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|policies of political reprisals]] pursued by the Soviet government in Moscow.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

On 5 December 1936, the [[Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] (whose territory by then corresponded to that of modern Kazakhstan) was detached from the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR) and made the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]], a full [[Republics of the Soviet Union|union republic]] of the USSR, one of eleven such republics at the time, along with the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]].

The republic was one of the destinations for exiled and convicted persons, as well as for mass resettlements, or deportations affected by the central USSR authorities during the 1930s and 1940s, such as approximately 400,000 [[Volga Germans]] deported from the [[Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] in September–October 1941, and then later the [[Greeks in Kazakhstan|Greeks]] and [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatars]]. Deportees and prisoners were interned in some of the biggest [[Gulag|Soviet labour camps]] (the Gulag), including [[Akmol|ALZhIR]] camp outside Astana, which was reserved for the wives of men considered "enemies of the people". Many moved due to the policy of [[population transfer in the Soviet Union]] and others were forced into [[involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union]].

The [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Soviet-German War]] (1941–1945) led to an increase in industrialisation and [[mineral extraction]] in support of the war effort. At the time of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death in 1953, however, Kazakhstan still had an overwhelmingly agricultural economy. In 1953, Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] initiated the [[Virgin Lands Campaign]] designed to turn the traditional pasturelands of Kazakhstan into a major grain-producing region for the Soviet Union. The Virgin Lands policy brought mixed results. However, along with later modernisations under Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] (in power 1964–1982), it accelerated the development of the agricultural sector, which remains the source of livelihood for a large percentage of Kazakhstan's population. Because of the decades of privation, war and resettlement, by 1959 the [[Kazakhs]] had become a minority, making up 30% of the population. Ethnic [[Russians]] accounted for 43%.

In 1947, the USSR, as part of its [[Soviet atomic bomb project|atomic bomb project]], founded an [[Semipalatinsk Test Site|atomic bomb test site]] near the north-eastern town of [[Semey|Semipalatinsk]], where the [[RDS-1|first Soviet nuclear bomb]] test was conducted in 1949. Hundreds of nuclear tests were conducted until 1989 with adverse consequences for the nation's environment and population. The [[Anti-nuclear movement in Kazakhstan]] became a major political force in the late 1980s.

In April 1961, [[Baikonur]] became the springboard of [[Vostok 1]], a spacecraft with Soviet cosmonaut [[Yuri Gagarin]] being the first human to enter space.

In December 1986, mass demonstrations by young ethnic Kazakhs, later called the [[Jeltoqsan]] riot, took place in Almaty to protest the replacement of the [[General Secretary|First Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan|Communist Party]] of the Kazakh SSR [[Dinmukhamed Konayev]] with [[Gennady Kolbin]] from the [[Russian SFSR]]. Governmental troops suppressed the unrest, several people were killed, and many demonstrators were jailed. In the waning days of Soviet rule, discontent continued to grow and found expression under Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' ("openness").

=== <span class="anchor" id="Independence"></span> Independence ===
Kazakhstan declared its [[sovereignty]] within the Soviet Union on 25 October 1990. Following the failed August 1991 [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|coup attempt]] in Moscow, the country proclaimed full independence on 16 December 1991, becoming the last Soviet republic to do so. Ten days after Kazakhstan's declaration, the Soviet Union itself dissolved. This period marked a significant turning point in Kazakhstan's history, as it embarked on a new political and economic path separate from Moscow's control.

[[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], the communist-era leader of Kazakhstan, became the country's first president. Under his leadership, Kazakhstan transitioned from a Soviet-era planned economy to a market economy, focusing on privatization and foreign investments. The emphasis on economic reform, particularly in the oil sector, helped Kazakhstan become one of Central Asia's most economically powerful nations. By 2006, Kazakhstan contributed around 60% of the region's GDP, primarily through its oil exports. However, political reforms lagged behind these economic strides, and Nazarbayev maintained an authoritarian rule throughout his presidency. a decision that symbolized the government's desire to modernize and assert control over the country's vast territories. The capital city change was part of broader efforts to establish a new national identity and shift the political center from former Soviet-era heartlands.

Kazakhstan's political landscape during Nazarbayev's rule was characterized by limited political pluralism. In the 2004 parliamentary elections, the pro-government Otan Party, led by Nazarbayev, dominated the Majilis (the lower house of parliament). Other parties sympathetic to the president, such as the agrarian-industrial bloc AIST and the Asar party (founded by Nazarbayev's daughter), secured most of the remaining seats, while opposition parties struggled to gain representation. International observers, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, criticized the elections for not meeting democratic standards.

Despite claims of progress toward democracy, Kazakhstan's political system remained authoritarian well into the 21st century. In 2010, the country was still ranked as an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian regime]] on ''[[The Economist]]'''s [[The Economist Democracy Index|Democracy Index]]. His successor, [[Kassym-Jomart Tokayev]], won the 2019 presidential election and took office on 12 June 2019. Tokayev's first official act was to rename the capital city to Nur-Sultan, in honor of Nazarbayev's legacy.

However, Tokayev's presidency faced significant challenges. In January 2022, Kazakhstan was gripped by [[2022 Kazakh unrest|large-scale protests]] following a sharp rise in fuel prices. The unrest quickly escalated, and Tokayev responded decisively by assuming control of the country's Security Council, removing Nazarbayev from the post and consolidating his own power. This marked a dramatic shift in Kazakhstan's political dynamics, with Tokayev signaling a departure from the old Nazarbayev-era system. In September 2022, the capital's name was reverted back to Astana, a move seen as part of the broader efforts to distance the country from the former president's influence.
