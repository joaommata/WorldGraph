===Prehistory and Classical era===
{{Main|Pre-colonial Timor}}
Cultural remains at [[Jerimalai]] on the eastern tip of Timor-Leste have been dated to 42,000 years ago. The first known inhabitants are those who arrived during the [[Australo-Melanesian]] migration through the region, likely bringing the precursors to today's [[Papuan languages]]. A later migration of [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]]-speakers is suspected, although no such languages remain. The arrival of [[Austronesian peoples]] brought [[Austronesian languages|new languages]], and merged with existing cultures on the island. Timorese origin myths recount settlers sailing around the eastern end of the island before landing in the south. These people are sometimes noted as being from the [[Malay Peninsula]] or the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] highlands of [[Sumatra]]. [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] migration to Timor may be associated with the development of agriculture on the island.

While information is limited about the political system of Timor during this period, the island had developed an interconnected series of polities governed by customary law. Small communities, centred around a particular sacred house, were part of wider ''sucos'' (or principalities), which were themselves part of larger kingdoms led by a ''liurai''. Authority within these kingdoms was held by [[Dyad (sociology)|two individuals]], with the worldly power of the ''liurai'' balanced by the spiritual power of a ''rai nain'', who was generally associated with the primary sacred house of the kingdom. These polities were numerous and saw shifting alliances and relations, but many were stable enough that they survived from initial European documentation in the 16th century until the end of Portuguese rule. honey, and wax. The island was recorded by the [[Majapahit]] Empire as a source of tribute.{{rp|89}} It was sandalwood that attracted European explorers to the island in the early sixteenth century. Early European presence was limited to trade, with the first Portuguese settlement being on the nearby island of [[Solor]]. A definitive [[Indonesia–Timor-Leste border|border]] between the Dutch and Portuguese parts of the island was established by the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in 1914 and remains the international boundary between the successor states Indonesia and Timor-Leste, respectively.

For the Portuguese, East Timor remained little more than a neglected trading post, with minimal investment in infrastructure and education, until the late nineteenth century. Even when Portugal established actual control over the interior of its colony, investment remained minimal.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, a faltering domestic economy prompted the Portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies, which was met with East Timorese resistance. The Japanese eventually drove the last of the Australian and Allied forces out in early 1943. Portuguese control resumed, however, after Japanese surrender at the end of World War II.

Portugal began investment in the colony in the 1950s, funding education and promoting coffee exports, but the economy did not improve substantially and infrastructure improvements were limited. Following the [[Carnation Revolution|1974 Portuguese revolution]], Portugal effectively abandoned its colony in Timor, and civil war between East Timorese political parties broke out in 1975.

The [[Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor]] (Fretilin) resisted a [[Timorese Democratic Union]] (UDT) coup attempt in August 1975, and [[East Timorese declaration of independence|unilaterally declared independence]] on 28 November 1975. Fearing a communist state within the Indonesian Archipelago, the Indonesian military launched an [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion of East Timor]] on 7 December 1975. Indonesia declared [[East Timor (province)|East Timor its 27th province]] on 17 July 1976. The [[United Nations Security Council]] opposed the invasion, and the territory's nominal status in the UN remained as "non-self-governing territory under Portuguese administration".

[[Fretilin]] resisted the invasion, initially as an army, holding territory until November 1978, and then as a guerrilla resistance. The [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian occupation]] of Timor was marked by violence and brutality. A detailed statistical report prepared for the [[Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor]] cited a minimum of 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period between 1974 and 1999, including approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 [[excess death]]s from hunger and illness. The total number of conflict-related deaths during this period is difficult to determine due to a lack of data. One estimate based on Portuguese, Indonesian, and Catholic Church data suggests it may have been as high as 200,000. Repression and restrictions counteracted improvements in health and education infrastructure and services, meaning there was little overall improvement in living standards; economic growth mostly benefited immigrants from elsewhere in Indonesia.

The [[Santa Cruz massacre|1991 massacre]] of more than 200 demonstrators by the Indonesian military was a turning point for the independence cause, and brought increased international pressure on Indonesia. Following the [[Fall of Suharto|resignation of Indonesian President Suharto]], A UN-sponsored agreement between Indonesia and Portugal allowed for a UN-supervised popular [[East Timorese independence referendum, 1999|referendum]] in August 1999. A clear vote for independence was met with [[1999 East Timorese crisis|a punitive campaign of violence]] by East Timorese [[pro-Indonesia militia|pro-integration militias]] supported by elements of the Indonesian military. In response, the Indonesian government allowed a multinational peacekeeping force, [[International Force East Timor|INTERFET]], to restore order and aid East Timorese refugees and internally displaced persons. On 25 October 1999, the administration of East Timor was taken over by the UN through the [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor]] (UNTAET). INTERFET deployment ended in February 2000 with the transfer of military command to the UN.

On 30 August 2001, the East Timorese voted in their first election organised by the UN to elect members of the Constituent Assembly. On 22 March 2002, the Constituent Assembly approved the Constitution. On 20 May 2002, the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste came into force and Timor-Leste was [[East Timor independence|recognised as independent]] by the UN. The Constituent Assembly was renamed the National Parliament, and [[Xanana Gusmão]] was elected as the country's first president. On 27 September 2002 the country became a UN member state.

In 2006, [[2006 East Timorese crisis|a crisis of unrest and factional fighting]] forced 155,000 people to flee their homes; the United Nations sent in security forces to restore order. The following year, Gusmão declined to run for another term. While there were minor incidents in the build-up to the [[East Timorese presidential election, 2007|mid-year presidential elections]], the process was peaceful overall and [[José Ramos-Horta]] was elected president. In June 2007, Gusmão ran in the [[East Timorese parliamentary election, 2007|parliamentary elections]] and became prime minister at the head of the [[National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction]] (CNRT) party. In February 2008, Ramos-Horta was critically injured in [[2008 East Timorese assassination attempts|an attempted assassination]]; Prime Minister Gusmão also faced gunfire separately but escaped unharmed. Australian reinforcements were immediately sent to help keep order. In March 2011, the UN handed over operational control of the police force to the Timor-Leste authorities. The United Nations ended its peacekeeping mission on 31 December 2012. The leader of Fretilin, [[Mari Alkatiri]], formed a coalition government after the July 2017 parliamentary election. This government soon fell, leading to a second general election in May 2018. In June 2018, former president and independence fighter, [[Taur Matan Ruak]], became the new prime minister. [[José Ramos-Horta]] again became president on 20 May 2022 after winning the April 2022 [[2022 East Timorese presidential election|presidential election]] runoff against Francisco Guterres. Following ratification by the National Parliament, the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]] came into force for Timor-Leste on 22 September, making the use of nuclear weapons in the country illegal.{{Citation needed|date=October 2025}}
