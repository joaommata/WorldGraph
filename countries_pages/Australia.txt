[[Indigenous Australians]] comprise two broad groups:
* [[Aboriginal Australians]], who are the various [[Indigenous peoples]] of the Australian mainland and many of its islands, including [[Aboriginal Tasmanians|Tasmania]]
* [[Torres Strait Islanders]], who are a distinct [[Melanesia]]n people of [[Torres Strait Islands]]

Human habitation of the Australian continent is estimated to have begun 50,000 to 65,000 years ago, The [[Madjedbebe]] rock shelter in [[Arnhem Land]] is possibly the oldest site showing the presence of humans in Australia. The oldest human remains found are the [[Lake Mungo remains]], which have been dated to around 42,000 years ago.

Aboriginal Australian culture is one of the oldest continuous cultures on Earth. At the time of first European contact, Aboriginal Australians belonged to wide range of societies, with diverse economies spread across at least [[Australian Aboriginal languages|250 different language groups]]. Aboriginal Australians cultures were (and remain) deeply connected with the land and the environment, with stories of [[The Dreaming]] maintained through [[oral tradition]], [[Songline|songs]], dance and paintings. Certain groups engaged in [[fire-stick farming]], [[fish farming]], and built [[Indigenous architecture#Australia|semi-permanent shelters]]. These practices have variously been characterised as "[[hunter-gatherer]]", "[[Agriculture|agricultural]]", "natural cultivation" and "intensification".

Torres Strait Islander people first settled their islands at least 2,500 years ago. Culturally and linguistically distinct from mainland Aboriginal peoples, they were seafarers and obtained their livelihood from seasonal horticulture and the resources of their reefs and seas. Agriculture also developed on some islands and villages appeared by the 1300s.

===European exploration and colonisation===

[[File:Landing of Lieutenant James Cook at Botany Bay, 29 April 1770 (painting by E Phillips Fox).jpg|alt=Landing of Lieutenant James Cook at Botany Bay, 29 April 1770|left|thumb|Landing of [[James Cook]] at [[Botany Bay]] on 29 April 1770]]
The [[Dutch East India Company]] ship, ''[[Duyfken]]'', captained by [[Willem Janszoon]], made the first documented European landing in Australia in 1606. Later that year, [[Luís Vaz de Torres]] sailed to the north of Australia through [[Torres Strait]], along New Guinea's southern coast. [[Abel Tasman]]'s voyage of 1642 was the first known European expedition to reach [[Van Diemen's Land]]. On his second voyage of 1644, he mapped the north coast of Australia south of New Guinea. Following Tasman's voyages, the Dutch were able to make almost complete maps of Australia's northern and western coasts and much of its southern and south-eastern Tasmanian coasts. They named the continent [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]''.''

In 1770, Captain [[James Cook]] sailed along and mapped the east coast, which he named "[[New South Wales]]" and claimed for Great Britain. in 1786, the British government announced its intention to establish a [[penal colony]] in New South Wales. On 26 January 1788, the [[First Fleet]] commanded by Captain [[Arthur Phillip]], arrived at [[Sydney Cove]], Port Jackson. A camp was established and the [[Union Jack|Union Flag]] raised. The date later became [[Australia Day|Australia's national day]].

Most early settlers were [[convicts in Australia|convicts]], [[penal transportation|transported]] for petty crimes and [[convict assignment|assigned]] as labourers or servants to "free settlers" (willing immigrants). Once [[emancipist|emancipated]], convicts tended to integrate into colonial society. Aboriginal resistance, convict rebellions and [[Bushranger|bushranging]] were sometimes suppressed under martial law. The 1808 [[Rum Rebellion]], carried out by officers of the [[New South Wales Corps|New South Wales Corp]], led to a temporary [[military junta]]. During the next two decades, social and economic reforms, together with the establishment of a [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] and [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Supreme Court]], saw the penal colony transition to a civil society.

<!-- Please take note of talk page discussion (archive 21, Colonial expansion, treaties and land rights) before editing -->The indigenous population declined for 150 years following European settlement, mainly due to infectious disease. British colonial authorities did not sign any treaties with [[Aboriginal Australians#Groups and sub-groups|Aboriginal groups]]. As settlement expanded, tens of thousands of Indigenous people and thousands of settlers were killed in [[Australian frontier wars|frontier conflicts]], which many historians argue included acts of [[Genocide of Indigenous Australians|genocide]] by settlers. Settlers dispossessed surviving Indigenous peoples of most of their land. and in 1813, [[Gregory Blaxland]], [[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]] and [[William Wentworth]] [[1813 crossing of the Blue Mountains|crossed the Blue Mountains]] west of Sydney, opening the interior to European settlement. The British claim was extended to the whole Australian continent in 1827 when Major [[Edmund Lockyer]] established a settlement on [[King George Sound]] (modern-day [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]). The [[Swan River Colony]] (present-day [[Perth]]) was established in 1829, evolving into the largest Australian colony by area, [[History of Western Australia|Western Australia]]. Separate colonies were carved from New South Wales: Tasmania in 1825, [[British colonisation of South Australia|South Australia]] in 1836, [[Colony of Victoria|Victoria]] in 1851, and [[Colony of Queensland|Queensland]] in 1859. South Australia and Victoria were founded as free colonies—they never accepted transported convicts. Growing [[Australasian Anti-Transportation League|opposition to the convict system]] culminated in its abolition in the eastern colonies by the 1850s. Initially a free colony, Western Australia accepted convicts from 1850 to 1868.

The six colonies individually gained [[responsible government]] between 1855 and 1890, managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the [[British Empire]]. The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs. The colonial parliaments progressively extended voting rights to adult men from 1856, with [[women's suffrage]] on equal terms following between the 1890s and 1900s. Some colonies introduced racial restrictions on voting from 1885.

In the mid-19th century, explorers such as [[Burke and Wills expedition|Burke and Wills]] charted Australia's interior. A [[Australian gold rushes|series of gold rushes]] beginning in the early 1850s led to an influx of new migrants from [[Chinese Australians|China]], North America and continental Europe, as well as outbreaks of [[bushranger|bushranging]] and civil unrest; the latter peaked in 1854 when [[Ballarat]] miners launched the [[Eureka Rebellion]] against gold licence fees. The 1860s saw the rise of [[blackbirding]], where [[South Sea Islanders]] were coerced or abducted into [[indentured labour]], mainly by Queensland colonists.

From 1886, Australian colonial governments began [[Stolen Generations|removing many Aboriginal children]] from their families and communities, justified on the grounds of child protection and [[forced assimilation]] policies. The [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902) marked the largest overseas deployment of [[colonial forces of Australia|Australia's colonial forces]].

===Federation to the World Wars===

[[File:Opening of the first parliament.jpg|thumb|''[[The Big Picture (painting)|The Big Picture]]'', a painting by [[Tom Roberts]], depicts the opening of the first Australian Parliament in 1901.]]
On 1 January 1901, [[Federation of Australia|federation of the colonies]] was achieved after a decade of planning, [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)|constitutional conventions]] and [[1898–1900 Australian constitutional referendums|referendums]], resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia as a nation under the new [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]].

From 1901, Australia was a self-governing [[dominion]] within the British Empire. It was one of the founding members of the [[League of Nations]] in 1920, and the [[Member states of the United Nations|United Nations]] in 1945. The ''[[Statute of Westminster 1931]]'' ended the ability of the UK to legislate for Australia at the federal level without Australia's consent. Australia [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942|adopted it]] in 1942, but it was backdated to 1939 to confirm the validity of legislation passed during World War II.

The [[Australian Capital Territory]] was formed in 1911 as the location for the future federal capital of [[Canberra]]. While it was being constructed, [[Melbourne]] served as the temporary capital from 1901 to 1927. The [[Northern Territory]] was transferred from the control of South Australia to the Commonwealth in 1911. Australia took over the administration of the [[Territory of Papua]] (which had previously been a British colony) in 1905 and of the [[Territory of New Guinea]] (formerly [[German New Guinea]]) in 1920. The two were unified as the [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]] in 1949 and gained independence from Australia in 1975.

[[File:Darwin 42.jpg|thumb|The 1942 [[Bombing of Darwin]], the first of more than 100 [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–1943|Japanese air raids on Australia]] during [[World War II]]]]
In 1914, Australia joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in the First World War, and took part in the fighting on several fronts. Of the 324,000 men who served overseas, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were wounded. Many Australians regard the defeat of the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZAC) at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] in 1915 as the "baptism of fire" that forged the [[Anzac spirit|new nation's identity]]. The [[Landing at Anzac Cove|beginning of the campaign]] is commemorated annually on [[Anzac Day]], a date which rivals [[Australia Day]] as the nation's most important.

From 1939 to 1945, Australia joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in fighting the Second World War. Australia's [[Australian Defence Force|armed forces]] fought in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]], [[European Theatre of World War II|European]] and [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]] [[List of theaters and campaigns of World War II|theatres]]. The shock of Britain's [[fall of Singapore|defeat in Singapore]] in 1942, followed soon after by the [[bombing of Darwin]] and [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|other Japanese attacks on Australian soil]], led to a widespread belief in Australia that [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|a Japanese invasion was imminent]], and a shift from the United Kingdom to the [[Australia–United States relations|United States]] as Australia's principal ally and security partner. Since 1951, Australia has been allied with the United States under the [[ANZUS]] treaty.

===Post-war and contemporary eras===
{{Main|History of Australia (1945–present)}}

[[File:Dutch Migrant 1954 MariaScholte=50000thToAustraliaPostWW2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Post-war immigration to Australia|Postwar migrants]] from Europe arriving in Australia in 1954]]
In the three decades following World War II, Australia experienced significant increases in living standards, leisure time and suburban development. Governments encouraged a [[Post-war immigration to Australia|large wave of immigration from across Europe]] and called these migrants "[[New Australians]]". High immigration was justified to Australians using the slogan "populate or perish," and from the 1960s the [[white Australia policy]] was gradually relaxed.

A member of the [[Western Bloc]] during the [[Cold War]], Australia participated in the [[Australia in the Korean War|Korean War]] and the [[Military history of Australia during the Malayan Emergency|Malayan Emergency]] during the 1950s and the [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]] from 1962 to 1973. Tensions over communist influence in society led to [[1951 Australian Communist Party ban referendum|unsuccessful attempts]] by the [[Menzies Government (1949–1966)|Menzies Government]] to ban the [[Communist Party of Australia]], and a [[Australian Labor Party split of 1955|bitter split]] in the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] in 1955.

As a result of a [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]], the federal government gained the power to legislate with regard to Aboriginal Australians, and Aboriginal Australians were fully included in the [[Census in Australia|census]]. [[Aboriginal title|Pre-colonial land interests]] (referred to as [[Native title in Australia|native title]] in Australia) was recognised in law for the first time when the [[High Court of Australia]] held in ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]]'' that Australia was not ''[[terra nullius]]'' ({{Gloss|land belonging to no one}}) at the time of European settlement.

Following the abolition of the last vestiges of the [[White Australia policy]] in 1973, Australia's demography and culture transformed as a result of a large and ongoing wave of non-European immigration, mostly from Asia. The late 20th century also saw an increasing focus on foreign policy ties with other [[Asia–Pacific|Asia{{En dash}}Pacific]] nations. The [[Australia Acts]] of 1986 severed the remaining constitutional ties between Australia and the United Kingdom while maintaining the monarch in her independent capacity as [[Queen of Australia]]. In a [[1999 Australian republic referendum|1999 constitutional referendum]], 55% of voters rejected [[Republicanism in Australia|abolishing the monarchy]] and becoming a republic.

Following the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States, Australia joined the United States in fighting the [[Military history of Australia during the War in Afghanistan|Afghanistan War]] from 2001 to 2021 and the [[Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]] from 2003 to 2009. The nation's trade relations also became increasingly oriented towards East Asia in the 21st century, with China becoming the nation's [[List of the largest trading partners of Australia|largest trading partner]] by a large margin.

In response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Australia|COVID-19 pandemic]], from March 2020 [[COVID-19 lockdowns|lockdowns]] and other restrictions on public gatherings and movement across the national and state borders were implemented by the Federal, state and territory governments. Following the rollout of vaccines in 2021, these restrictions were gradually eased. In October 2023, Australia declared that COVID-19 was no longer a communicable disease incident of national significance.
