The Indonesian archipelago has been inhabited since the time of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' or "[[Java Man]]," with fossils dating back 2 million to 500,000 BCE. Fossils of ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'', found on Flores, date around 700,000 to 60,000 BCE, while ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' arrived around 50,000 BCE. Sulawesi and Borneo are home to the world's oldest known [[cave painting]]s, dating back 40,000 to 60,000 years, and megalithic sites such as western Java's ''[[Gunung Padang]]'', Sulawesi's ''[[Lore Lindu National Park|Lore Lindu]]'', as well as Sumatra's Nias and Sumba reflect early human settlements and ceremonial practices.

Around 2,000 BCE, [[Austronesian peoples]] began arriving in Southeast Asia from the island of [[Taiwan]], gradually displacing native [[Melanesians]] to the far eastern part of the archipelago as they spread east,{{sfn|Taylor|2003|pp=5–7}} and would eventually form the majority of Indonesia's modern population. Favourable agricultural conditions and advancements like [[Paddy field|wet-field rice cultivation]] by the 8th century BCE{{sfn|Taylor|2003|pp=8–9}} enabled the growth of villages and kingdoms by the first century CE. The archipelago's strategic location fostered inter-island and international exchange with civilisations from the Indian subcontinent and mainland China, profoundly influencing Indonesian history and culture through trade.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|pp=3, 9–11, 13–15, 18–20, 22–23}}{{sfn|Vickers|2005|pp=18–20, 60, 133–134}}{{sfn|Taylor|2003|pp=15–18}}

By the 7th century CE, the [[Srivijaya]] naval kingdom thrived on trade, adopting Hindu and Buddhist influences. The 8th to 10th centuries saw the rise and decline of the Buddhist [[Sailendra]] and Hindu [[Mataram Kingdom|Mataram]] dynasties, leaving monumental legacies like the [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]] temples. After the failed [[Mongol invasion of Java]] in the late 13th century, the Hindu [[Majapahit]] kingdom rose to dominate much of the archipelago under [[Gajah Mada]]'s leadership—a period often called the "Golden Age" of Indonesian history. Islam [[Spread of Islam in Indonesia|arrived]] in the 13th century in northern Sumatra,{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=3–14}} and following gradual adoption in other islands, it became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the 16th century, blending with pre-existing traditions to form a distinct Islamic culture, particularly in Java.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=12–14}}

In 1512, Europeans began arriving in the archipelago, led by Portuguese traders under [[Francisco Serrão]], to [[Portuguese Empire in the Indonesian Archipelago|seek a monopoly]] of the lucrative [[spice trade]] in the [[Maluku Islands]].{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=22–24}} Dutch and British traders soon followed, with the former establishing the [[Dutch East India Company]] (''Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', VOC) in 1602, which eventually became the dominant European power for almost two centuries. After the VOC's dissolution in 1799 during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]],

During [[World War II]], the [[Dutch East Indies campaign|Japanese invasion]] and [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|occupation of the Indies]] ended Dutch rule and encouraged Indonesia's independence movement. Only two days after [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] in August 1945, [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta]] issued the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence]], and they became the country's first president and vice-president, along with [[Sutan Sjahrir]] as Prime Minister.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=325}}{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=325}} The Netherlands attempted to re-establish their rule, prompting the start of [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesia's war of independence against the Dutch]]. The conflict lasted until 1949, when the Dutch recognised Indonesian independence in the [[Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference]] following international pressure.{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=35}}{{sfn|Bevins|2020|pp=168, 185}} The PKI was blamed for the coup and destroyed,{{sfn|Friend|2003|pp=107–109}}{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=280–283, 284, 287–290}} weakening Sukarno's power. Suharto [[Transition to the New Order|capitalised on this]], becoming President in 1968 and establishing a US-backed [[New Order (Indonesia)|"New Order"]] military dictatorship,{{sfn|Melvin|2018|pp=9-10}}{{sfn|Vickers|2005|p=163}} which fostered [[foreign direct investment]]{{sfn|Robinson|2018|p=206}}{{sfn|Bevins|2020|pp=167–168}} and drove three decades of substantial economic growth.

In 1975, Indonesia's [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] and subsequent [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]] of former Portuguese colony [[Democratic Republic of East Timor (1975)|East Timor]] drew international condemnation. Indonesia was the country worst affected by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], which brought out [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia#Background|widespread discontent]] with the New Order's corruption and political suppression and ultimately [[Fall of Suharto|ended Suharto's rule]].{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p={{page needed|date=October 2020}}}}{{sfn|Vickers|2005|p={{page needed|date=October 2020}}}}{{sfn|Schwarz|1994|p={{page needed|date=October 2020}}}} In 1999, East Timor [[1999 East Timorese independence referendum|seceded]] after a 24-year military occupation that some scholars classified as [[East Timor genocide|genocide]]. Political, economic and social instability and [[Terrorism in Indonesia|terrorism]] were persistent in the 2000s. The economy has performed strongly since 2007, although [[Corruption in Indonesia|corruption]] remains a chronic issue. Relations among the diverse population are mostly harmonious, but sectarian discontent and violence remain problematic in some areas. A political settlement to a separatist [[insurgency in Aceh]] was achieved in 2005.
