{{Main|History of the Gambia}}

=== Muslim and Portuguese influence (9th–16th centuries) ===
[[Arab]] traders provided the first written accounts of The Gambia area in the ninth and tenth centuries. During the tenth century, Muslim merchants and scholars established communities in several West African commercial centres. Both groups established trans-Saharan trade routes. They carried out a large export trade of local people taken captive in raids and sold as [[slaves]]. Gold and ivory were also exported, and the trade routes were used to import manufactured goods to these areas.

By the 11th or 12th century, the rulers of kingdoms such as [[Takrur]] (a monarchy centred on the [[Senegal River]] just to the north), ancient Ghana and [[Gao]] had converted to Islam. They had appointed to their courts Muslims who were literate in the [[Arabic language]]. At the beginning of the 14th century, most of what is today called The Gambia was part of the [[Mali Empire]]. The Portuguese reached this area by sea in the mid-15th century and began to dominate overseas trade.

=== English and French administration (17th–19th centuries) ===
In 1588, the claimant to the [[Portuguese throne]], [[António, Prior of Crato]], sold exclusive trade rights on the [[Gambia River]] to English merchants. [[Letters patent]] from [[Queen Elizabeth I]] confirmed the grant. In 1618, King [[James I of England]] granted a charter to an English company for trade with The Gambia and the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]]). Between 1651 and 1661, some parts of The Gambia – St. Andrew's Island in the Gambia River, including Fort Jakob, and St. Mary Island (modern day Banjul) and [[Fort Jillifree]] – came under the rule of the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]], a vassal state of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in what is now [[Latvia]], having been bought by Prince [[Jacob Kettler]]. The colonies were formally ceded to England in 1664.

During the late 17th century and throughout the 18th century, the [[British Empire]] and the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] struggled continually for political and commercial supremacy in the regions of the Senegal River and the Gambia River. The British Empire occupied The Gambia when an expedition led by [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Augustus Keppel]] landed there following the [[capture of Senegal]] in 1758. The 1783 [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] gave Great Britain possession of the Gambia River, but the French retained a tiny enclave at [[Albreda]] on the river's north bank. This was finally ceded to the United Kingdom in 1856.

==== Slavery ====
Slave ships intercepted by the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[West Africa Squadron]] in the Atlantic were also returned to The Gambia, with people who had been slaves released on [[MacCarthy Island]] far up The Gambia River where they were expected to establish new lives. The British established the military post of Bathurst (now [[Banjul]]) in 1816.

=== Gambia Colony and Protectorate (1821–1965) ===

In the ensuing years, Bathurst (now [[Banjul]]) was at times under the jurisdiction of the British Governor-General in [[Sierra Leone]]. In 1888, The Gambia became a separate colony.

An agreement between Britain and [[French Republic|France]] in 1889 established the boundaries of the colony. In 1891, a joint Anglo-French Boundary Commission faced resistance from local leaders whose lands would be divided. The Gambia became a [[British Crown colony]] called [[Gambia Colony and Protectorate|British Gambia]], divided for administrative purposes into the colony (city of Banjul and the surrounding area) and the protectorate (remainder of the territory). The Gambia received its own executive and legislative councils in 1901, and it gradually progressed toward self-government. Slavery was abolished in 1906 and following a brief conflict between the British colonial forces and indigenous Gambians, British colonial authority was firmly established. In 1919, a romantic relationship between Travelling Commissioner J. K. McCallum and Wolof woman [[Fatou Khan]] scandalized the administration.

During World War II, some soldiers fought with the [[Allies of World War II]]. Though these soldiers fought mostly in [[Burma Campaign|Burma]], some died closer to home and a [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] cemetery is in Fajara (close to Banjul). Banjul contained an [[airstrip]] for the [[US Army Air Forces]] and a port of call for Allied naval convoys.

After World War II, the pace of constitutional reform increased. Following general elections in 1962, the United Kingdom granted full internal self-governance in the following year. President Sir Dawda Jawara was re-elected five times.

[[1981 Gambian coup attempt|An attempted coup]] on 29 July 1981 followed a weakening of the economy and allegations of corruption against leading politicians. In 1997 the {{Official website|url=https://iec.gm/|name=Independent Electoral Commission - IEC- The Gambia}} was established to replace the PIEC, responsible for the registration of voters and for the conduct of elections and referendums. President Yahya Jammeh, who was elected to continue in the position he had assumed during the coup, took the oath of office again on 21 December 2001. Jammeh's [[Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction]] (APRC) maintained its strong majority in the National Assembly, particularly after the main opposition [[United Democratic Party (The Gambia)|United Democratic Party]] (UDP) boycotted the legislative elections.

On 2 October 2013, The Gambian Interior Minister announced that The Gambia would leave [[Commonwealth of Nations|the Commonwealth]] with immediate effect, ending 48 years of membership of the organisation. The Gambian government said it had "decided that The Gambia will never be a member of any Neo-Colonial institution and will never be a party to any institution that represents an extension of colonialism".

On 11 December 2015, President Jammeh (without any legal authority) unilaterally declared The Gambia an [[Islamic Republic]], calling it a break from the country's colonial past, although the constitution remained secular.

The months leading up to the [[2016 Gambian presidential election|2016 presidential election]] were tense. The youth leader of the main opposition [[United Democratic Party (The Gambia)|UDP]], Solo Sandeng, died in detention at the notorious [[State Intelligence Services (The Gambia)|National Intelligence Agency]]. [[Ousainou Darboe]], the leader of the UDP, and many senior members of his party were sent to jail for demanding the release of Solo Sandeng dead or alive. President Jammeh faced opposition leaders Adama Barrow from the Independent Coalition of parties and Mamma Kandeh from The Gambia Democratic Congress party.  The high court of the Gambia sentenced main opposition leader and human rights advocate [[Ousainou Darboe]] to 3 years in prison in July 2016, disqualifying him from running in the presidential election. This gave Adama Barrow to contest under the UDP ticket.

Following the 1 December 2016 elections, the elections commission declared [[Adama Barrow]] the winner. Jammeh, who had ruled for 22 years, first announced he would step down after losing the 2016 election before declaring the results void and calling for a new vote, sparking a [[Gambian presidential election, 2016|constitutional crisis]] and leading to an [[Invasion of the Gambia|invasion]] by an [[Economic Community of West African States|ECOWAS]] coalition. On 20 January 2017, Jammeh announced that he had agreed to step down and would leave the country. [[Boris Johnson]], who became the first British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|foreign secretary]] to visit The Gambia since the country gained independence in 1965, The Gambia officially rejoined the Commonwealth on 8 February 2018. On 28 February 2018, [[Jaha Dukureh]], a women's rights activist was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for her work in combating [[female genital mutilation]].

On 4 December 2021, Adama Barrow won re-election in the [[2021 Gambian presidential election|presidential election]]. On 20 December 2022, a supposed [[2022 Gambian coup attempt|coup attempt by the Gambian army was foiled]], with four soldiers arrested. The Gambian [[Gambia Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] have denied that any attempt at a coup was made.<ref name="BBC-2022" /> Barrow's use of foreign troops for his security and for protection of some infrastructure has hurt his popularity.<ref name="BBC-2022"/>
