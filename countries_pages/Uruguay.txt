=== Prehistory ===
Human presence in the region now known as Uruguay dates back approximately 13,000 years, with evidence of [[hunter-gatherer]] communities. It is estimated that at the time of the first contact with Europeans in the 16th century, there were about 9,000 [[Charrúa]] and 6,000 [[Chaná people|Chaná]] and some [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] island settlements.

There is an extensive archeological collection of man-made [[tumulus|tumuli]] known as "''[[Cerritos de Indios]]''" in the eastern part of the country, some of them dating back to 5,000 years ago. Very little is known about the people who built them as they left no written record, but evidence has been found in place of indigenous agriculture and of extinct [[Native American dogs|indigenous]] woolly dogs.

=== Colonial rule ===

The [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese were]] the first Europeans to enter the region of present-day Uruguay in 1512. The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] arrived in present-day Uruguay in 1515 but were the first to set foot in the area, claiming it for the crown. The indigenous peoples' fierce resistance to [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|conquest]], combined with the absence of valuable resources, limited European settlement in the region during the 16th and 17th centuries.

[[Montevideo]], the current capital of Uruguay, was founded by the Spanish in 1726 as a military stronghold. Its natural harbor soon developed into a commercial area competing with [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Río de la Plata]]'s capital, [[Buenos Aires]]. Montevideo was occupied by British forces from February to September 1807.

As a result, Artigas broke with Buenos Aires and besieged Montevideo, taking the city in early 1815. The nation's [[Constitution of Uruguay|first constitution]] was adopted on 18 July 1830. In 1843, an Argentine army overran Uruguay on Oribe's behalf but failed to take the capital. The [[Uruguayan Civil War#The Great Siege|siege of Montevideo]] began in February 1843 and lasted nine years.

In 1845, Britain and France intervened against Rosas to restore commerce to normal levels in the region. Their efforts proved ineffective, and by 1849, tired of the war, both withdrew after signing a treaty favorable to Rosas.

The first railway line was assembled in Uruguay in 1867, and a branch consisting of a horse-drawn train was opened. The present-day [[State Railways Administration of Uruguay]] maintains {{convert|2900|km|abbr=on}} of extendable railway network.

The constitutional government of General [[Lorenzo Batlle y Grau]] (1868–72) suppressed the [[Revolution of the Lances]] by the [[National Party (Uruguay)|Blancos]]. This establishment of the policy of co-participation represented the search for a new formula of compromise based on the coexistence of the party in power and the opposition party. This division of power lasted until President [[Jose Batlle y Ordonez]] instituted his political reforms, which caused the last uprising by Blancos in 1904 that ended with the [[Battle of Masoller]] and the death of Blanco leader [[Aparicio Saravia]].

Between 1875 and 1890, the military became the center of power. After the [[Uruguayan Civil War|Guerra Grande]], there was a sharp rise in the number of immigrants, primarily from Italy and Spain. By 1879, the total population of the country was over 438,500.

=== 20th century ===

The Colorado leader [[José Batlle y Ordóñez]] was elected president in 1903. The following year, the Blancos led a rural revolt, and eight bloody months of fighting ensued before their leader, [[Aparicio Saravia]], was killed in battle. Government forces emerged victorious, leading to the end of the co-participation politics that had begun in 1872.

In 1938, general elections were held, and Terra's brother-in-law, General [[Alfredo Baldomir]], was elected president. Under pressure from organized labor and the National Party, Baldomir advocated free elections, freedom of the press, and a new constitution.

In 1945, Uruguay formally signed the [[Declaration by United Nations|Declaration by the United Nations]] and entered [[World War II]], leading the country to declare war on [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Following the end of the war, it became a founding member of the [[United Nations]].

An armed group of [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] urban guerrillas, known as the [[Tupamaros]], emerged in the 1960s, engaging in activities such as bank robbery, kidnapping, and assassination, in addition to attempting an overthrow of the government.

=== Civic-military dictatorship ===
[[File:Museo de la Memoria - 2022 03.jpg|thumb|Garments worn by prisoners during the dictatorship, exhibited at the [[Museo de la Memoria (Uruguay)|Museum of Memory]]]]

President [[Jorge Pacheco Areco|Jorge Pacheco]] declared a state of emergency in 1968, followed by a further suspension of civil liberties in 1972. In 1973, amid increasing economic and political turmoil, the armed forces, asked by President [[Juan María Bordaberry]], disbanded Parliament and established a [[Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay|civilian-military regime]].

According to one source, around 180 Uruguayans are known to have been killed and disappeared, with thousands more illegally detained and tortured during the 12-year civil-military rule from 1973 to 1985. Most were killed in Argentina and other neighboring countries, with 36 of them having been killed in Uruguay. According to Edy Kaufman (cited by David Altman), Uruguay at the time had the highest per capita number of political prisoners in the world. "Kaufman, who spoke at the U.S. Congressional Hearings of 1976 on behalf of [[Amnesty International]], estimated that one in every five Uruguayans went into exile, one in fifty were detained, and one in five hundred went to prison (most of them tortured)." Social spending was reduced, and many state-owned companies were privatized. However, the economy did not improve and deteriorated after 1980; the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) fell by 20%, and unemployment rose to 17%. The state intervened by trying to bail out failing companies and banks.{{rp|45}}

=== Return to democracy (1984–present) ===

A new constitution, drafted by the military, was rejected in a November 1980 referendum. Both presidents continued the economic structural reforms initiated after the reinstatement of democracy.

The 1999 national elections were held under a new electoral system established by a 1996 constitutional amendment. Colorado Party candidate [[Jorge Batlle]], aided by the support of the National Party, defeated [[Broad Front (Uruguay)|Broad Front]] candidate [[Tabaré Vázquez]]. The formal coalition ended in November 2002, when the Blancos withdrew their ministers from the cabinet,

In 2004, Uruguayans elected [[Tabaré Vázquez]] as president while giving the Broad Front a majority in both houses of Parliament. Vázquez stuck to economic orthodoxy. As commodity prices soared and the economy recovered from the recession, he tripled foreign investment, cut poverty and unemployment, cut [[Government debt|public debt]] from 79% of GDP to 60%, and kept inflation steady. In 2009, [[José Mujica]], a former left-wing guerrilla leader (Tupamaros) who spent almost 15 years in prison during the country's military rule, emerged as the new president as the Broad Front won the election for a second time. [[Abortion in Uruguay|Abortion]] was legalized in 2012, followed by [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|same-sex marriage]] and [[Legality of cannabis in Uruguay|cannabis]] in the following year, making Uruguay the first country in the modern era to legalize cannabis.

In 2014, Tabaré Vázquez was elected to a non-consecutive second presidential term, which began on 1 March 2015. In 2020, after 15 years of left-wing rule, he was succeeded by [[Luis Alberto Lacalle Pou]], a member of the conservative [[National Party (Uruguay)|National Party]], as the 42nd President of Uruguay. On 1 March 2025, [[Yamandú Orsi|Yamandu Orsi]] took office as Uruguay's new president, as the left-wing coalition of the Broad Front returned to power after a five-year interruption.
