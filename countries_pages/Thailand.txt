=== Prehistory and origins ===
{{main|Prehistoric Thailand}}
{{see also|History of Thailand|Tai peoples}}
There is evidence of continuous human habitation in present-day Thailand from 20,000 years ago to the present day.{{rp|4}} The earliest evidence of rice growing is dated at 2,000 BCE.{{rp|4}} Areas comprising what is now Thailand participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archeological research. The trading network existed for 3,000 years, between 2000 BCE to 1000 CE. Bronze appeared {{circa|1,250}}–1,000 BCE. Iron appeared around 500 BCE.

The [[Thai people]] are of the [[Tai peoples|Tai ethnic group]], characterised by common linguistic roots.{{rp|2}} Chinese chronicles first mention the Tai peoples in the 6th century BCE. While there are many assumptions regarding the origin of Tai peoples, [[David K. Wyatt]], a historian of Thailand, argued that their ancestors who at present inhabit Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, India, and China came from the [[Điện Biên Phủ]] area between the 5th and the 8th century. Thus Thai culture was influenced by Indian, Mon, and Khmer cultures.{{rp|203}} Tai people intermixed with various ethnic and cultural groups in the region, resulting in many groups of present-day Thai people.{{efn-lr|See ''{{section link|#Ethnic groups}}''.}} Genetic evidences suggested that ethnolinguistics could not accurately predict the origins of the Thais.

According to French historian [[George Cœdès]], "The Thai first enter history of [[Farther India]] in the eleventh century with the mention of ''Syam'' slaves or prisoners of war in [[Champa]] epigraphy", and "in the twelfth century, the [[bas-relief]]s of [[Angkor Wat]]" where "a group of warriors" are described as ''Syam'', The origins and ethnicity of the ''Syam'' remain unclear, with some literature suggesting that ''Syam'' refers to the [[Shan people]], the [[Bru people]], or the [[Brau people]]. However, mainland Southeast Asian sources from before the fourteenth century primarily used the word ''Syam'' as an [[ethnonym]], referring to those who belonged to a separate cultural category different from the Khmer, Cham, Bagan, or Mon. This contrasts with the Chinese sources, where ''Xian'' was used as a [[toponym]]. However, after several bloody centuries against [[China|Chinese]] influence in [[Guangxi]] between 333 BCE and the 11th century, hundreds of thousands of Tais were killed,{{rp|5}}{{rp|193, 239–249}} thus, [[Tai people]] began to move southwestward along the rivers and over the lower passes into the mountain north of [[Southeast Asia]] and river valleys in present-day [[Assam]] of [[India]].{{sfn|Baker|Phongpaichit|2017|p= 26}} Some evidence indicates that the ancestors of Tai people migrated en masse southwestwards out of Yunnan only after the 1253 [[Uriyangkhadai#Invasion of Yunnan and Tibet|Mongol invasion of Dali]]; however, it is not generally accepted.{{rp|38}}

Tais defeated [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous tribes]] and emerged as the new power in the new region. As a result, several Tai city-states were established, scattered from [[Điện Biên Phủ]] in present-day northwestern [[Vietnam]] and highland [[Southeast Asia]] to [[northeastern India]].

According to the ''Simhanavati legend'' given in several chronicles, the first Tai city-state in northern Thailand, [[Singhanavati]], was founded around the 7th century.{{rp|5, 9}} However, several modern [[geology]] and [[archaeology]] studies found that its centre, Yonok Nahaphan, dates from 691 BCE–545 CE; this roughly coincides with the establishment of [[Shan people#History|Shan States]], another Tai's federated principalities in the present-day northeast [[Myanmar]]. as well as [[Muang Sua]] ([[Luang Prabang]]) in the east.

After Singhanavati was submerged below [[Chiang Saen Lake]] due to an [[earthquake]] in 545, the survivors then founded a new seat at {{ill|Wieng–Prueksha|th|เวียงปรึกษา}}. The kingdom lasted for another 93 years.

In addition to [[Singhanavati]], another northern principality probably related to the Tai people, [[Ngoenyang]], was established as the successor of Singhanavati in 638 by {{ill|Lavachakkaraj|th|ปู่เจ้าลาวจก}}, also centred in {{ill|Wieng–Prueksha|th|เวียงปรึกษา}} (present-day [[Mae Sai District]], [[Chiang Rai province|Chiang Rai]]).{{rp|208}}

In the late tenth century, Tai people began to migrate further south to the present-day upper [[central Thailand]].{{rp|46–9, 83–6}} Around the 1100s period, several cities in this area, such as Songkwae, Sawankhalok, and Chakangrao, were ruled by the Tai people, eventually launching several battles against the pre-existing [[Mon people|Mon]] of [[Lavo Kingdom|Lavo]], who had been falling under [[Chenla]] and [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] influences since the 7th century, thus bringing the establishment of the Tai people's independent state, [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], in the upper [[Chao Phraya River]] valley in 1238. [[Phrom]] also marched the troops south to occupy [[Kamphaeng Phet province|Chakangrao]] from the enemy as well as founding the city of [[Phitsanulok|Songkwae]]. In contrast, [[Tai people]] instead established relationships with Mon via [[royal intermarriage]]s. Samuel Beal discovered the polity among the Chinese writings on Southeast Asia as "Duoluobodi". During the early 20th century, archaeological excavations led by [[George Coedès]] found [[Nakhon Pathom Province]] to be a centre of Dvaravati culture. The two most important sites were Nakorn Pathom and U Thong (in modern [[Suphan Buri Province]]). The inscriptions of Dvaravati were in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Mon language|Mon]] using the script derived from the [[Pallava alphabet]] of the [[South India]]n Pallava dynasty.

It is believed that the Dvaravati borrowed [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] through its contacts with Sri Lanka, while the ruling class participated in [[Hindu]] rites. [[Dvaravati art]], including the Buddha sculptures and [[stupa]]s, showed strong similarities to those of the [[Gupta Empire]] of India. The eastern parts of the Chao Phraya valley were subjected to a more Khmer and Hindu influence as the inscriptions are found in Khmer and Sanskrit.

Dvaravati was a network of city-states paying tribute to more powerful ones according to the [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala political model]]. Dvaravati culture expanded into [[Isan]] as well as south as far as the [[Kra Isthmus]]. Dvaravati culture lost its influence around the tenth century when they submitted to the more unified Lavo-Khmer polity.

Around the tenth century, the city-states of Dvaravati merged into the mandalas of: [[Lavo]] (modern [[Lopburi]]) and [[Suvarnabhumi]] (modern [[Suphan Buri]]). According to a legend in the Northern Chronicles, in 903, a king of [[Tambralinga]] invaded and took Lavo and installed a Malay prince on the Lavo throne. The Malay prince was married to a Khmer princess who had fled an Angkorian dynastic bloodbath. The son of the couple contested the Khmer throne and became [[Suryavarman I]] (1006–1050), thus bringing Lavo under Khmer domination through marital union. Suryavarman I also expanded into the [[Khorat Plateau]] (later styled "Isan"), constructing many temples.

[[File:ปราสาทปรางค์สามยอด2.jpg|thumb|240px|Wat [[Phra Prang Sam Yod]], a 13th-century Angkorian temple in [[Lopburi]].]]
After the [[Angkor]] lost Lavo to [[Suphannabhum]] princes in 1052, the younger prince [[Chandrachota]] claimed the throne. His son, [[Narai I]], moved Lavo's seat to [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya (city)|Ayodhya]] in the 1080s. This resulted in the throne of Lavo's Lavaburi being vacant from 1087 to 1106 (or ruled by unknown kings), [[Si Satchanalai]] king, [[Kesariraja]] who is of [[Mon people|Mon]]'s [[Mueang Chaliang|Chaliang]] and [[Tai people|Tai]]'s [[Chiang Saen]] lineages, took over the seat. An attempt to re-expand influence to Lavo by the Angkor occurred in 1181 when [[Jayavarman VII]] appointed his lineage Narupatidnavarman to govern Lavapura. Due to this political pressure, a Tai ruler Sri Thammasokkarat
({{lang|th|ศรีธรรมโศกราช}}), who was also from Si Satchanalai, fled to [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom|Nakhon Si Thammarat]].{{rp|38–39}} Sri Thammasokkarat married to princess of Dhanyapura (Dong Mae Nang Mueang in the present-day [[Nakhon Sawan province]]), and their descendants ruled [[Tambralinga]] until the late 13th century.{{rp|290–2}} The [[The Customs of Cambodia]] of [[Zhou Daguan]], as an official delegation sent by the [[Yuan dynasty]] to [[Angkor]] from 1296 to 1297, says the Siamese people exerted significant influence over Lavo's [[Lopburi|Lavapura]] and appeared in huge numbers in the Angkorian capital of [[Yaśodharapura]].

[[Phra Prang Sam Yot|Prang Sam Yot]] was built during this period.{{rp|120}}

All of the turmoil, as mentioned earlier, also led to the independence declaration of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] in 1238.

==== The earliest evidence mentioning the Siamese ====
The earliest evidence to mention the Siam people are stone inscriptions found in [[Angkor Borei]] of [[Funan]] (K.557 and K.600), dated 661 CE, the slave's name is mentioned as "Ku Sayam" meaning "Sayam female slaves" (Ku is a prefix used to refer to female slaves in the pre-Angkorian era), and the Takéo inscriptions (K.79) written in 682 during the reign of [[Bhavavarman II]] of [[Chenla]] also mention Siam Nobel: ''Sāraṇnoya Poña Sayam'', which was transcribed into English as: ''the rice field that was given to the poña (noble rank) who was called Sayam (Siam)''.

The [[Song Huiyao Jigao]] (960–1279) indicate Siamese people settled in the west [[central Thailand]] and their state was called ''Xiān guó'' ({{lang-zh|暹國}}), while the eastern plain belonged to the Mon of [[Lavo Kingdom|Lavo]] ({{lang-zh|羅渦國}}), who later fell under the [[Chenla]] and [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] hegemony around the 7th–9th centuries. Those Mon political entities, which also included [[Haripuñjaya]] in the north and several city-states in the [[northeastern Thailand|northeast]], are collectively called [[Dvaravati]].

However, the states of Siamese and Lavo were later merged via the [[royal intermarriage]] and became [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] in the mid-14th century, The remaining principal city-states in [[Isan]] region became [[Lan Xang]] around 1353 after the twin cities of [[Muang Sua]] ([[Luang Prabang]]) and ''Vieng Chan Vieng Kham'' ([[Vientiane]]) became independent following the death of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] king [[Ram Khamhaeng]].{{rp|51}}

According to the Wat Kud Tae inscription (K.1105), dated c. 7th century, during the period that the eastern Mon entity, [[Lavo Kingdom|Lavo]], was strongly influenced by the [[Chenla]], the Siamese in the west also established a [[royal intermarriage]] with [[Chenla]] as Sri Chakatham, prince of Sambhuka (ศามภูกะ, in the present-day [[Ratchaburi province]]), married to a princess of [[Isanavarman I]], and two [[Mandala (political model)|mandala]]s then became an ally. After [[Chenla]] sieged [[Funan]] and moved the centre to [[Angkor]], both Siamese and the Angkorian eventually marched the troops to attack [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]] of [[Champa]] in 1201 during the reign of [[Jayavarman VII]], as recorded in the Cho-Dinh inscription (C.3).

After the decline of the Khmer Empire and [[Pagan Kingdom|Kingdom of Pagan]] in the early 13th century, various states thrived in their place. The domains of Tai people existed from the northeast of present-day India to the north of present-day Laos and to the [[Malay Peninsula]].{{rp|355}} Its initial expansion was through conquest and political marriage.

Before the end of the 15th century, Ayutthaya invaded the Khmer Empire three times and sacked its capital [[Angkor]].{{rp|26}} Ayutthaya then became a regional power in place of the Khmer. Constant interference of Sukhothai effectively made it a vassal state of Ayutthaya and it was finally incorporated into the kingdom. [[Borommatrailokkanat]] brought about bureaucratic reforms which lasted into the 20th century and created a system of social hierarchy called ''[[sakdina]]'', where male commoners were conscripted as [[corvée]] labourers for six months a year.{{rp|107}} Ayutthaya was interested in the [[Malay Peninsula]] but failed to conquer the [[Malacca Sultanate]], which was supported by the Chinese [[Ming dynasty]]. The Portuguese were followed in the 17th century by the French, Dutch, and English. Rivalry for supremacy over Chiang Mai and the Mon people pitted Ayutthaya against the Burmese Kingdom. Several wars with its ruling [[Taungoo dynasty]] starting in the 1540s in the reign of [[Tabinshwehti]] and [[Bayinnaung]] were ultimately ended with the [[Burmese–Siamese War (1568–70)|capture of the capital in 1570]].{{rp|11}}

Ayutthaya sought to improve relations with European powers for many successive reigns. The kingdom especially prospered during cosmopolitan [[Narai]]'s reign (1656–1688), when some European travellers regarded Ayutthaya as an Asian great power, alongside China and India.{{rp|250}} The Burmese under the new [[Alaungpaya]] dynasty quickly rose to become a new local power by 1759. After a 14-month siege, the capital city's walls fell and the city was burned in April 1767.{{RP|218}}

=== Thonburi Kingdom (1767–1782) ===
{{main|Thonburi Kingdom}}
[[File:KingTaksin's coronation.jpg|thumb|right|[[Taksin the Great]] enthroned himself as a Thai king in 1767.]]
The capital and many of its territories lay in chaos after the war. The former capital was occupied by the [[Burma|Burmese]] garrison army and five local leaders declared themselves overlords, including the lords of Sakwangburi, [[Phitsanulok]], [[Pimai]], [[Chanthaburi]], and [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]]. [[Taksin|Chao Tak]], a capable military leader, proceeded to make himself a lord by [[right of conquest]], beginning with the legendary sack of [[Chanthaburi]]. Based at Chanthaburi, Chao Tak raised troops and resources, and sent a fleet up the [[Chao Phraya]] to take the fort of [[Thonburi]]. In the same year, Chao Tak was able to retake Ayutthaya from the Burmese only seven months after the fall of the city.

Chao Tak then crowned himself as [[Taksin]] and proclaimed [[Thonburi]] as temporary capital in the same year. He also quickly subdued the other warlords. His forces engaged in wars with Burma, Laos, and Cambodia, which successfully [[Burmese–Siamese War (1774–1775)|drove the Burmese out of Lan Na]] in 1775,

Under [[Rama I]] (1782–1809), Rattanakosin successfully defended against Burmese attacks and put an end to Burmese incursions. He also created suzerainty over large portions of Laos and Cambodia. In 1821, Briton [[John Crawfurd]] was sent to negotiate a new trade agreement with Siam – the first sign of an issue which was to dominate 19th century Siamese politics. Bangkok signed the [[Burney Treaty]] in 1826, after the British victory in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]]. The unexpected death of Mongkut from [[malaria]] led to the reign of underage King [[Chulalongkorn]], with [[Somdet Chaophraya Sri Suriwongse]] (Chuang Bunnag) acting as regent. in part because Britain and France agreed in 1896 to make the [[Chao Phraya]] valley a [[buffer state]]. Not until the 20th century could Siam renegotiate every unequal treaty dating from the Bowring Treaty, including [[extraterritoriality]]. The advent of the ''monthon'' system marked the creation of the modern Thai nation-state.

The Thai government then declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom.{{rp|66}} The [[Free Thai Movement]] was launched both in Thailand and abroad to oppose the Thai government and Japanese occupation.

Field Marshal [[Sarit Thanarat]] took power by coup in 1957, and he proceeded to reverse Phibun's democratic reforms and ban the Khana Ratsadon party from politics. His rule from 1959 to 1963 was autocratic; he built his legitimacy around the god-like status of the monarch and by channelling the government and public's loyalty to the king. The aftermath of the event marked a short-lived parliamentary democracy,

Military figure [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] was appointed Prime Minister from in 1980. He oversaw the beginning of a period of significant economic growth and democratization throughout the 1980s. Prem's premiership was often referred to as "premocracy" because it involved [[Semi-democracy|semi-democratic]] practices such as a Parliament composed of an all-elected House and an all-appointed Senate. Prem's [[Constitutionalism|constitutionalist]] political approach aided with a transition away from military rule and a negotiated end to the Communist insurgency by 1983. He maintained political stability via a close relationship with [[Bhumibol Adulyadej|King Bhumibol]], who helped to foil two military coups in attempts against Prem in [[1981 Thai military rebellion|1981]] and in [[1985 Thai coup d'état attempt|1985]].

In 1988, Thailand saw its first freely-elected prime minister since the 1976 coup. [[Chatichai Choonhavan]] ruled for 3 years before being overthrown in a coup that ushered in two years of military rule under the [[National Peace Keeping Council]]. One of the coup leaders, [[Suchinda Kraprayoon]], was nominated as prime minister for the majority coalition government after the [[March 1992 Thai general election|March 1992 general election]]. This caused a popular demonstration in Bangkok, which ended with a bloody military crackdown known as [[Black May (1992)|Black May]]. The King intervened in the event, granting amnesty to the belligerents and forcing the resignation of Suchinda.

Free elections were once again held in September 1992, bringing the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] to power. Power passed between various neoliberal parties throughout the decade, who all had a hand in drafting the [[1997 constitution of Thailand|1997 "People's Constitution."]] Spurred on by the events of Black May, the constitution explicitly acknowledged several [[human rights]] and established several government and electoral accountability measures, including the creation of a fully-elected [[bicameral legislature]].

=== Shinawatra Era (2001–present) ===
{{Main|History of Thailand (2001–present)}}
The neoliberal government's attempt to [[Currency peg|peg]] the [[Thai baht]] to the [[United States dollar]] induced the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], crashing regional economies and ending nearly 40 years of uninterrupted economic growth in Thailand.{{rp|3}} To cover a shortage of foreign currency and investments, which had come primarily from Japan, [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]]'s government took out a $17 billion [[International Monetary Fund]] loan in US dollars. To satisfy the conditions of the loan, Thailand underwent a series of [[Austerity|austerity measures]] until the loan was repaid in 2003.

The crisis brought on the ascendancy of the populist [[Thai Rak Thai party]], whose base consisted primarily of indebted rural workers. Its prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] governed from 2001 until 2006. His policies were successful in reducing rural poverty and providing [[universal healthcare]]. However, Thaksin was viewed by opponents among the Thai upper and upper middle classes as a corrupt populist who was destroying the middle class in order to favour himself and the rural poor. Additionally, his rural poverty policies directly conflicted with King Bhumibol's recommendations, drawing the ire of royalists, a powerful faction in Thailand. Thaksin also faced crises in the form of the [[South Thailand insurgency]], which escalated starting from 2004, and the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] which claimed around 8,000 lives in Thailand.

Massive protests against Thaksin led by the [[reactionary]] [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] (PAD) started in his second term as prime minister, and the monarchy and the military eventually agreed to oust him. The [[2005–2006 Thai political crisis|crisis]] peaked in 2005 with a series of controversies surrounding Buddhist and monarchic institutions, and the army dissolved Thaksin's party with [[2006 Thai coup d'état|a coup d'état in 2006]] and banned over a hundred of its executives from politics. After the coup, a military government was installed for one year.''''''
[[File:2010_09_19_red_shirt_protest_bkk_09.JPG|right|thumb|[[United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship]], Red Shirts, [[2010 Thai political protests|protest]] in 2010]]
The military government faced significant resistance, with protesters frequently storming government buildings and elements within the military threatening yet another coup.'''

After [[2011 Thai general election|the general election of 2011]], the [[Populism|populist]] [[Pheu Thai Party]] won a majority. [[Yingluck Shinawatra]], Thaksin's younger sister, became prime minister. The [[People's Democratic Reform Committee]] organised another anti-Shinawatra protest after the ruling party proposed an amnesty bill which would benefit Thaksin. Yingluck dissolved parliament and [[2014 Thai general election|a general election]] was scheduled, but her decision was invalidated by the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]]. The [[2013–2014 Thai political crisis|crisis]] ended with [[2014 Thai coup d'état|another coup d'état in 2014]].

The ensuing [[National Council for Peace and Order]], a military junta led by General [[Prayut Chan-o-cha]], led the country until 2019. Civil and political rights were restricted, and the country saw a surge in ''[[Lèse-majesté in Thailand|lèse-majesté]]'' cases. Political opponents and dissenters were sent to "attitude adjustment" camps; this was described by academics as indicating the return of fascism to Thailand. Bhumibol, the longest-reigning Thai king, [[Death and funeral of Bhumibol Adulyadej|died in 2016]], and his son [[Vajiralongkorn]] ascended to the throne. The referendum and adoption of Thailand's current constitution happened under the junta's rule.{{efn-lr|The [[2016 Thai constitutional referendum]] was held on 7 August 2016. Its ratification was held on 6 April 2017.}} The junta bound future governments to a 20-year national strategy 'road map' it laid down, effectively locking the country into [[Guided democracy|military-guided democracy]].

In 2019, the junta agreed to schedule [[2019 Thai general election|a general election]]. An extended two-year period of [[2020–2021 Thai protests|pro-democracy protests]] were subsequently triggered by distrust in the election as well as increasing [[royal prerogative]], democratic and economic regression under monarchy-supported military rule, retaliatory dissolution of the pro-democracy [[Future Forward Party]], regressive policies on political issues like women's and labour rights, forced disappearances and deaths of political activists like [[Wanchalearm Satsaksit]], and various political corruption scandals including [[1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal|1MDB]]. The protests brought forward unprecedented demands to reform the monarchy and the highest sense of [[republicanism]] in the country's history.

In May 2023, Thailand's reformist opposition - the progressive [[Move Forward Party]] (MFP) and Thaksin's populist Pheu Thai Party - won the [[2023 Thai general election|general election]], ending 9 years of royalist-military rule under Prayut. On 22 August 2023, [[Srettha Thavisin]] of the Pheu Thai party became Thailand's new prime minister, while the ex-PM and party figurehead Thaksin Shinawatra returned to Thailand after years in self-imposed exile from the military regime. Thavisin was later dismissed from his prime ministerial role on 14 August 2024 by the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]] for "gross ethics violations". He was succeeded by Thaksin's daughter [[Paetongtarn Shinawatra]], who spent a year in office before the Constitutional Court ordered her removal over a controversial phone call with Cambodia's president. The Court then ordered the arrest of Thaksin in September 2025.
