=== Ancient antiquity ===
{{More sources|section|date=April 2025}}[[File:Tell Halaf Raubvogel Seitenansicht.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Reconstructed sculpture of a bird from [[Tell Halaf]]]]
The [[Natufian culture]] was the first to become sedentary around the 11th millennium BC and became one of the centers of [[Neolithic]] culture (known as [[PPNA|Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]]), where agriculture and cattle breeding first began to appear. The site of [[Tell Qaramel]] has several round stone towers dated to 10650 BC, making them the oldest structures of this kind in the world. The Neolithic period ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]) is represented by rectangular houses of [[Mureybet]] culture. At the time, people used containers made of stone, gyps, and burnt lime ([[White Ware|Vaisselle blanche]]). The discovery of [[obsidian]] tools from [[Anatolia]] are evidence of early trade. The ancient cities of [[Hamoukar]] and [[Emar]] played an important role during the late Neolithic and Bronze Age. Archaeologists have demonstrated that civilization in Syria was one of the most ancient on earth, perhaps preceded by only that of [[Mesopotamia]].

[[File:Ishqi-Mari (dark background).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ishqi-Mari]], king of the Second Kingdom of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], circa 2300 BC]]The earliest recorded indigenous civilization in the region was the Kingdom of [[Ebla]] near present-day [[Idlib]], northern Syria. Ebla appears to have been founded around 3500 BC and gradually built its fortune through trade with the Mesopotamian states of [[Sumer]], [[Assyria]], and [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], as well as with the [[Hurrian]] and [[Hattians|Hattian]] peoples to the northwest, in [[Asia Minor]]. Gifts from [[Pharaoh]]s, found during excavations, confirm Ebla's contact with [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. One of the earliest written texts from Syria is a trading agreement between Vizier [[Ibrium]] of Ebla and an ambiguous kingdom called [[Abarsal]] {{c.|2300 BC}}. This is known as the [[Treaty between Ebla and Abarsal]]. Scholars believe the [[Eblaite language|language of Ebla]] to be among the oldest known written [[Semitic languages]] after [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. Recent classifications of the Eblaite language have shown that it was an [[East Semitic language]], closely related to the [[Akkadian language]]. Ebla was weakened by a long war with [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], and the whole of Syria became part of the Mesopotamian [[Akkadian Empire]] after [[Sargon of Akkad]] and his grandson [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]]'s conquests ended Eblan domination over Syria in the first half of the 23rd century BC.

By the 21st century BC, Hurrians settled in the northern east parts of Syria while the rest of the region was dominated by the [[Amorites]]. Syria was called the Land of the Amurru (Amorites) by their Assyro-Babylonian neighbors. The Northwest Semitic [[Amorite language]] is the earliest attested of the [[Canaanite languages]]. [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] reemerged during this period until conquered by [[Hammurabi]] of Babylon. [[Ugarit]] also arose during this time, circa 1800 BC, close to modern [[Latakia]]. [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] was a Semitic language loosely related to the Canaanite languages and developed the [[Ugaritic alphabet]], considered to be the world's earliest known alphabet. The Ugaritic kingdom survived until its destruction at the hands of the marauding Indo-European [[Sea Peoples]] in the 12th century BC in what was known as the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]].

[[Aleppo]] and Damascus are among the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world]]. [[Yamhad]] (modern Aleppo) dominated northern Syria for two centuries, although eastern Syria was occupied in the 19th and 18th centuries BC by the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] ruled by the Amorite dynasty of [[Shamshi-Adad I]], and by the [[Babylonian Empire]] which was founded by Amorites. Yamhad was described in the tablets of Mari as the mightiest state in the near east and as having more vassals than Hammurabi. [[Qatna]], the Hurrians states, and the [[Euphrates]] valley down to the borders with Babylon. The army of Yamhad campaigned as far away as [[Der (Sumer)|Dēr]] on the border of [[Elam]] (modern Iran). Yamhad was conquered and destroyed, along with Ebla, by the [[Hittites]] from [[Asia Minor]] circa 1600 BC. From this time, Syria became a battle ground for various foreign empires, these being the [[Hittite Empire]], [[Mitanni]] Empire, [[Egyptian Empire]], [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], and to a lesser degree [[Babylonia]]. The Egyptians initially occupied much of the south, while the Hittites and the Mitanni occupied much of the north. However, Assyria eventually gained the upper hand, destroying the Mitanni Empire and annexing huge swathes of territory previously held by the Hittites and Babylon.

Around the 14th century BC, various [[Semitic people]] appeared in the area, such as the semi-nomadic [[Suteans]] who came into an unsuccessful conflict with Babylonia to the east, and the [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] speaking [[Arameans]] who subsumed the earlier Amorites. They too were subjugated by Assyria and the Hittites for centuries. The Egyptians fought the Hittites for control over western Syria; the fighting reached its zenith in 1274 BC with the [[Battle of Kadesh]]. The west remained part of the Hittite empire until its destruction {{c.|1200 BC}}, while eastern Syria largely became part of the Middle Assyrian Empire, who also annexed much of the west during the reign of [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] 1114–1076 BC. With the destruction of the Hittites and the decline of Assyria in the late 11th century BC, the Aramean tribes gained control of much of the interior, founding states such as [[Bit Bahiani]], [[Aram-Damascus]], [[Hamath]], [[Aram-Rehob]], [[Aram-Naharaim]], and [[Luhuti]]. From this point, the region became known as [[Aramea]] or [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]. There was also a synthesis between the Semitic Arameans and the remnants of the Indo-European Hittites, with the founding of a number of [[Syro-Hittite]] states centered in north central Aram (Syria) and south central Asia Minor (modern Turkey), including [[Palistin]], [[Carchemish]] and [[Sam'al]].

[[File:Amrit01.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Amrit]] Phoenician Temple]]
A [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] group known as the [[Phoenicians]] came to dominate the coasts of Syria, (and also Lebanon and northern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]) from the 13th century BC, founding [[city states]] such as [[Amrit]], [[Simyra]], [[Arwad]], [[Arab al-Mulk|Paltos]], [[Latakia#Ancient settlement and founding|Ramitha]], and [[Tell Sukas|Shuksi]]. From these coastal regions, they eventually spread their influence throughout the [[Mediterranean]], including building colonies in [[Malta]], Sicily, the [[Iberian peninsula]], and the coasts of North Africa and most significantly, founding the major city-state of [[Carthage]] in the 9th century BC, which was much later to become the center of a major empire, rivaling the [[Roman Republic]].

Syria and the western half of [[Near East]] then fell to the vast [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (911 BC – 605 BC). The Assyrians introduced [[Imperial Aramaic]] as the [[lingua franca]] of their empire. This language was to remain dominant in Syria and the entire [[Near East]] until after the [[Islamic]] conquest in the 7th and 8th centuries AD, and was to be a vehicle for the spread of Christianity. The Assyrians named their colonies of Syria and Lebanon [[Eber-Nari]]. Assyrian domination ended after the Assyrians greatly weakened themselves in a series of brutal internal civil wars, followed by attacks from: the [[Medes]], [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]]. During the fall of Assyria, the [[Scythians]] ravaged and plundered much of Syria. The last stand of the Assyrian army was at [[Carchemish]] in northern Syria in 605 BC. The Assyrian Empire was followed by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (605 BC – 539 BC). During this period, Syria became a battle ground between Babylonia and another former Assyrian colony, that of Egypt. The Babylonians, like their Assyrian relations, were victorious over Egypt.

[[File:The story of the ancient nations - a text-book for high schools (1912) (14766210391).jpg|thumb|[[Antioch]] in Syria became the capital of the Hellenistic [[Seleucid Empire]] in 240 BC]]
Lands that constitute modern-day Syria were part of the Neo-Babylonian Empire and had been annexed by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 539 BC. Led by [[Cyrus the Great]], the Achaemenid Persians retained [[Imperial Aramaic]] as one of the diplomatic languages of their empire, as well as the Assyrian name for the new [[satrapy]] of Aram/Syria [[Eber-Nari]]. Syria was conquered by the [[Macedonian Empire]] which was ruled by [[Alexander the Great]] {{c.|330 BC}} and consequently became [[Coele-Syria]] province of the [[Seleucid Empire]] (323 BC – 64 BC), with the Seleucid kings styling themselves "King of Syria" and the city of Antioch being its capital starting from 240 BC. Thus, it was the Greeks who introduced the name "Syria" to the region. Originally an Indo-European corruption of "Assyria" in northern Mesopotamia (Iraq), the Greeks used this term to describe not only Assyria itself but also the lands to the west which had for centuries been under Assyrian dominion. The Aramaic language has been found as far afield as [[Hadrian's Wall]] in [[Roman Britain]], with an inscription written by a Palmyrene emigrant at the site of Fort [[Arbeia]]. Control of Syria eventually passed from the Romans to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] with the split in the Roman Empire.

[[File:Apamea 02.jpg|thumb|left|The ancient city of [[Apamea, Syria|Apamea]], an important commercial center and one of Syria's most prosperous cities in classical antiquity]]

Syrians held considerable power during the [[Severan dynasty]]. The matriarch of the family and empress of Rome as wife of emperor [[Septimius Severus]] was [[Julia Domna]], a Syrian from the city of [[Emesa]] (modern day [[Homs]]), [[Royal family of Emesa|whose family]] held hereditary rights to the priesthood of the god [[El-Gabal]]. Her great nephews, also Arabs from Syria, would also become Roman emperors, the first being [[Elagabalus]] and the second his cousin [[Alexander Severus]]. Another Roman emperor who was a Syrian was [[Philip the Arab]] (Marcus Julius Philippus), who was born in [[Arabia Petraea|Roman Arabia]]. He was emperor from 244 to 249 where he ordered his followers to invade Duma, because Muhammad received intelligence that some tribes there were involved in highway robbery and were preparing to attack [[Medina]]. [[William Montgomery Watt]] claims that this was the most significant expedition Muhammad ordered at the time, even though it received little notice in the primary sources. [[Dumat Al-Jandal]] was {{convert|500|mi|km|order=flip}} from Medina, and Watt says that there was no immediate threat to Muhammad, other than the possibility that his communications to Syria and supplies to Medina would be interrupted. Watt says "It is tempting to suppose that Muhammad was already envisaging something of the expansion which took place after his death", and that the rapid march of his troops must have "impressed all those who heard of it". [[William Muir]] also believes that the expedition was important as Muhammad followed by 1,000 men reached the confines of Syria, where distant tribes had learnt his name, while the political horizon of Muhammad was extended.|210x210px]]
[[File:Arabischer Maler um 730 002.jpg|thumb|Umayyad [[fresco]] from [[Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbî]], built in the early 7th century]]
By 640, Syria [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|was conquered]] by the [[Rashidun army]] led by [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]]. In the mid-7th century, the [[Umayyad dynasty]] placed the capital of the empire in Damascus. The country's power declined during later Umayyad rule; this was mainly through totalitarianism, corruption and the resulting revolutions. The Umayyad dynasty was overthrown in 750 by the [[Abbasid dynasty]], which moved the capital of empire to [[Baghdad]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] – made official under Umayyad rule – became the dominant language, replacing [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] of the Byzantine era. In 887, the Egypt-based [[Tulunids]] annexed Syria from the Abbasids and were later replaced by the Egypt-based [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshidids]] and then by the [[Hamdanid]]s originating in Aleppo founded by [[Sayf al-Dawla]].

Sections of Syria were held by French, English, Italian and German overlords between 1098 and 1189 during the [[Crusades]] and were known collectively as the [[Crusader states]], among which the primary one in Syria was the [[Principality of Antioch]]. The coastal mountainous region was occupied in part by the [[Nizaris|Nizari Ismailis]], the so-called [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], who had intermittent confrontations and truces with the Crusader States. Later in history when "the Nizaris faced renewed Frankish hostilities, they received timely assistance from the Ayyubids." After a century of Seljuk rule, Syria was largely conquered (1175–1185) by the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] liberator [[Saladin|Salah ad-Din]], founder of the [[Ayyubid]] dynasty of Egypt. [[Siege of Aleppo (1260)|Aleppo fell]] to the [[Mongols]] of [[Hulegu]] in January 1260; Damascus fell in March, but then Hulegu was forced to break off his attack to return to China to deal with a succession dispute.

A few months later, the [[Mamluk]]s arrived with an army from Egypt and defeated the Mongols in the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in [[Galilee]]. The Mamluk leader, [[Baibars]], made Damascus a provincial capital. When he died, power was taken by [[Qalawun]]. In the meantime, an emir named [[Sunqur al-Ashqar]] had tried to declare himself ruler of Damascus, but he was defeated by Qalawun on 21 June 1280 and fled to northern Syria. Al-Ashqar, who had married a Mongol woman, appealed for help from the Mongols. The Mongols of the [[Ilkhanate]] took Aleppo in October 1280, but Qalawun persuaded Al-Ashqar to join him, and they fought against the Mongols on 29 October 1281 in the [[Second Battle of Homs]], which was won by the Mamluks. In 1400, the Muslim [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turco-Mongol]] conqueror [[Tamurlane]] invaded Syria, in which he [[Sack of Aleppo (1400)|sacked Aleppo]] and [[Siege of Damascus (1400)|captured Damascus]] after defeating the Mamluk army. The city's inhabitants were massacred, except for the artisans who were deported to [[Samarkand]]. Tamurlane conducted massacres of the Assyrian Christian population, greatly reducing their numbers. By the end of the 15th century, the discovery of a sea route from Europe to the [[Far East]] ended the need for an [[Silk Road|overland trade route]] through Syria.

=== Ottoman Syria ===

[[File:Gustav Bauernfeind - The Gate Of The Great Umayyad Mosque, Damascus.jpg|thumb|"The Gate Of The Great [[Umayyad Mosque]], Damascus" by [[Gustav Bauernfeind]], 1890]]
In 1516, the [[Ottoman Empire]] invaded the [[Mamluk Sultanate|Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt]], conquering Syria and incorporating it into its empire. The Ottoman system was not burdensome to Syrians because the Turks respected Arabic as the language of the [[Quran]] and accepted the mantle of defenders of the faith. Damascus was made the major entrepot for [[Mecca]], and as such it acquired a holy character to Muslims, because of the beneficial results of the countless pilgrims who passed through on the [[hajj]].

Ottoman administration followed a system that led to peaceful coexistence. Each ethno-religious minority—Arab [[Shia Muslim]], Arab [[Sunni Muslim]], [[Syriac Orthodox]], [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Maronite Christians]], [[Assyrian Christians]], [[Armenians]], [[Kurds]] and [[Jews]]—constituted a [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]. The religious heads of each community administered all personal status laws and performed certain civil functions as well. In the midst of World War I, two [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] diplomats (Frenchman [[François Georges-Picot]] and [[British people|Briton]] [[Mark Sykes]]) secretly agreed on the post-war division of the Ottoman Empire into respective zones of influence in the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] of 1916. Initially, the two territories were separated by a border that ran in an almost straight line from Jordan to Iran. However, the discovery of oil in the region of [[Mosul]] just before the end of the war led to yet [[1918 Clemenceau–Lloyd George Agreement (Middle East)|another negotiation with France in 1918]] to cede this region to the British zone of influence, which was to become Iraq. The fate of the intermediate province of Zor was left unclear; its [[Occupation of Zor|occupation by Arab nationalists resulted in its attachment to Syria]]. This border was recognized internationally when Syria became a [[League of Nations]] mandate in 1920 and has not changed to date.

=== French Mandate ===
{{Main|Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Mandatory Syrian Republic}}
[[File:Hashim Atassi Inauguration 1936.jpg|thumb|The inauguration of President [[Hashim al-Atassi]] in 1936]]
In 1920, a short-lived independent [[Arab Kingdom of Syria|Kingdom of Syria]] was established under [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal I]] of the [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] family. However, his rule over Syria ended after only a few months, following the [[Battle of Maysalun]]. French troops occupied Syria later that year after the [[San Remo conference]] proposed that the [[League of Nations]] put Syria under a French mandate. General Gouraud had according to his secretary de Caix two options: "Either build a Syrian nation that does not exist... by smoothing the rifts which still divide it" or "cultivate and maintain all the phenomena, which require our arbitration that these divisions give". De Caix added "I must say only the second option interests me". This is what Gouraud did.

In 1925, [[Sultan al-Atrash]] led [[Great Syrian Revolt|a revolt]] that broke out in the [[Jabal al-Druze|Druze Mountain]] and spread to engulf the whole of Syria and parts of Lebanon. Al-Atrash won several battles against the French, notably the [[Battle of al-Kafr]] on 21 July 1925, the [[Battle of al-Mazraa]] on 2–3 August 1925, and the battles of Salkhad, [[al-Musayfirah]] and Suwayda. France sent thousands of troops from Morocco and Senegal, leading the French to regain many cities, although resistance lasted until the spring of 1927. The French sentenced al-Atrash to death, but he had escaped with the rebels to Transjordan and was eventually pardoned. He returned to Syria in 1937 after the signing of the Syrian-French Treaty.

[[File:Ghouta rebels in 1925.jpg|thumb|Syrian rebels in [[Ghouta]] during the [[Great Syrian Revolt]] against French colonial rule in the 1920s|left]]
Syria and France negotiated a [[Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence (1936)|treaty of independence]] in September 1936, and [[Hashim al-Atassi]] was the first president to be elected under the first incarnation of the modern republic of Syria. However, the treaty never came into force because the French Legislature refused to ratify it. With the fall of France in 1940 during [[World War II]], Syria came under the control of [[Vichy France]] until the British and Free French occupied the country in the [[Syria-Lebanon campaign]] in July 1941. Continuing pressure from Syrian nationalists and the British [[Levant Crisis|forced the French]] to evacuate their troops in April 1946, leaving the country in the hands of a republican government that had been formed during the mandate.

=== Independent Syrian Republic ===
{{Main|Second Syrian Republic|United Arab Republic|1963 Syrian coup d'état}}
Upheaval dominated Syrian politics from independence through the late 1960s. In May 1948, Syrian forces invaded [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], together with other Arab states, and immediately [[Battles of the Kinarot Valley|attacked Jewish settlements]]. President [[Shukri al-Quwatli|Shukri al-Quwwatli]] instructed his troops in the front, "to destroy the Zionists". The invasion purpose was to prevent the establishment of the state of Israel. Toward this end, the Syrian government engaged in an active process of recruiting former [[Nazism|Nazis]], including several former members of the [[Schutzstaffel]], to build up their armed forces and military intelligence capabilities. Defeat in this war was one of several trigger factors for the [[March 1949 Syrian coup d'état]] by Colonel [[Husni al-Za'im]], described as the first military overthrow of the [[Arab World]] Syria signed a pact with the [[Soviet Union]]. This gave a foothold for communist influence within the government in exchange for military equipment.

=== United Arab Republic ===
[[File:Nasser addresses Aleppo, 1960.jpg|thumb|[[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] at [[Aleppo]], 1960]]
On 1 February 1958, Syrian President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] and Egypt's Nasser announced the merging of Egypt and Syria, creating the [[United Arab Republic]], and all Syrian political parties, as well as the communists therein, ceased overt activities. Despite high levels of inequality in land ownership these reforms allowed for more progress in redistribution of land from 1958 to 1961 than any other reforms in Syria's history, since independence.

The first law passed (Law 134; passed 4 September 1958) was in response to concern about peasant mobilization and expanding peasants' rights. This was designed to strengthen the position of sharecroppers and agricultural laborers in relation to land owners. Furthermore, it obligated landlords to honor both written and oral contracts, established collective bargaining, contained provisions for workers' compensation, health, housing, and employment services. Ba'athists took control over country's politics, education, culture, religion and surveilled all aspects of civil society through its powerful ''[[Military Intelligence Directorate (Syria)|Mukhabarat]]'' (secret police). [[Syrian Arab Armed Forces|Syrian Arab Armed forces]] and secret police were integrated with the Ba'ath party apparatus; after the purging of traditional civilian and military elites by the regime.

The 1963 Ba'athist coup marked a "radical break" in [[History of Syria#Modern history|modern Syrian history]], after which Ba'ath party monopolised power in the country to establish a [[one-party state]] and shaped a socio-political order by enforcing its [[neo-Ba'athism|state ideology]]. On 23 February 1966, the neo-Ba'athist Military Committee carried out an [[1966 Syrian coup d'état|intra-party rebellion]] against the Ba'athist Old Guard ([[Michel Aflaq|Aflaq]] and [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar|Bitar]]), imprisoned President [[Amin al-Hafiz]] and designated a regionalist, civilian Ba'ath government on 1 March. when he was deposed by [[Hafez al-Assad]], who at the time was Minister of Defense. When the [[Six-Day War]] broke out between Egypt and Israel, Syria joined the war and attacked Israel as well. In the final days of the war, Israel turned its attention to Syria, capturing two-thirds of the [[Golan Heights]] in under 48 hours. The defeat caused a split between Jadid and Assad over what steps to take next. Disagreement developed between Jadid, who controlled the party apparatus, and Assad, who controlled the military. The 1970 retreat of Syrian forces sent to aid the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] led by [[Yasser Arafat]] during the "[[Black September]] (also known as the Jordan Civil War of 1970)" hostilities with Jordan reflected this disagreement.[[File:General Hafez al-Assad (1930-2000), the new president of Syria in November 1970.png|thumb|upright|[[Hafez al-Assad]], president of Syria (1970–2000)]]The power struggle culminated in the November [[Corrective Revolution (Syria)|1970 Syrian Corrective movement]], a bloodless military coup that installed Hafez al-Assad as the strongman of the government. Assad transformed a Ba'athist party state into a dictatorship marked by his pervasive grip on the party, [[Syrian Arab Armed Forces|armed forces]], [[Military Intelligence Directorate (Syria)|secret police]], media, education sector, religious and cultural spheres and all aspects of civil society. He assigned [[Alawites|Alawite]] loyalists to key posts in the military forces, bureaucracy, [[Military Intelligence Directorate (Syria)|intelligence]] and the ruling elite. A cult of personality revolving around Hafez and his family became a core tenet of [[Assadism|Ba'athist ideology]], which espoused that [[Assad family|Assad dynasty]] was destined to rule perennially. 

On 6 October 1973, Syria and Egypt initiated the [[Yom Kippur War]] against Israel. The [[Israel Defense Forces]] reversed the initial Syrian gains and pushed deeper into Syrian territory. The village of [[Quneitra]] was largely destroyed by the Israeli army. 

In the late 1970s, an [[Islamist uprising in Syria|Islamist uprising]] by the [[Muslim Brotherhood in Syria|Muslim Brotherhood]] was aimed against the government. Islamists attacked civilians and off-duty military personnel, leading security forces to also kill civilians in retaliatory strikes. The uprising had reached its climax in the 1982 [[1982 Hama massacre|Hama massacre]], when more than 2,000 to 25,000{{sfnp|Carré|Michaud|1983|page=159}}-40,000 people (Islamist and civilians) were killed by [[Syrian Armed Forces|Syrian military]] troops and Ba'athist paramilitaries. It has been described as the "single deadliest act" of violence perpetrated by any state upon its own population in [[Modern Middle East|modern Arab history]]

==== Involvement of Lebanese war ====
{{Main|Syrian occupation of Lebanon}}
Hafez al-Assad died on 10 June 2000. His son, [[Bashar al-Assad]], was elected president in [[Syrian presidential election, 2000|an election]] in which he ran unopposed. Instead, reforms have been limited to some market reforms. 

On 5 October 2003 Israel [[Ain es Saheb airstrike|bombed a site near Damascus]], claiming it was a terrorist training facility for members of [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]]. In March 2004, [[Syrian Kurds]] and Arabs [[2004 Al-Qamishli riots|clashed]] in [[al-Qamishli]]. Signs of rioting were seen in Qamishli and [[Al-Hasakah|Hasakeh]]. In 2005, Syria ended its military presence in Lebanon. [[Killing of Rafic Hariri|Assassination]] of [[Rafic Hariri]] in 2005 led to international condemnation and triggered a popular ''[[Cedar Revolution|Intifada]]'' in [[Lebanon]], known as "the Cedar Revolution", which forced the [[Assad regime]] to end its 29-year-old [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|military occupation in Lebanon]]. On 6 September 2007, foreign jet fighters, suspected as Israeli, reportedly carried out [[Operation Orchard]] against a suspected nuclear reactor under construction by [[North Korea]]n technicians.

==== Syrian Revolution and Civil War ====
{{Main|Syrian Revolution|Syrian Civil War}}
[[File:Syrian civil war 01 12 2015.png|thumb|Military situation in December 2015. [[Islamic State]]-[[Territory of the Islamic State|controlled territory]] is in grey.]]
Nepotism of ruling elites and [[authoritarian]] regime caused [[Syrian Revolution]] as part of the wider [[Arab Spring]]. Public demonstrations across Syria began on 26 January 2011 and developed into a nationwide uprising. Protesters demanded the resignation of Assad, the overthrow of his government, and an end to nearly five decades of Ba'ath Party rule. Since spring 2011, the Syrian government deployed the Syrian Army to quell the uprising, and several cities were besieged, though the unrest continued. According to some witnesses, soldiers, who refused to open fire on civilians, were summarily executed by the Syrian Army. The Syrian government denied reports of defections, and blamed armed gangs for causing trouble. Since early autumn 2011, civilians and army defectors began forming fighting units, which began an [[Syrian Civil War|insurgency campaign]] against the Syrian Army. The insurgents unified under the banner of the [[Free Syrian Army]] and fought in an increasingly organized fashion; however, the civilian component of the armed opposition lacked an organized leadership.

[[File:Pro-government Syrians demonstration in Damascus after US missile strike 06.jpg|left|thumb|Pro-Assad demonstration in the capital Damascus after [[April 2018 missile strikes against Syria|US-led missile strikes]] in April 2018]]
The [[Arab League]], the United States, the European Union states, the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Cooperation Council states]], and other countries have condemned the use of violence against the protesters. The Arab League suspended Syria's membership over the government's response to the crisis, but sent an [[Arab League Monitors in Syria|observer mission]] in December 2011, as part of its [[Syrian conflict peace proposals|proposal for peaceful resolution]] of the crisis. with pro-Assad forces causing more than 90% of the [[Casualties of the Syrian civil war|total civilian casualties]].{{efn|Sources:}} Between March 2011 and March 2021, more than 306,000 civilians were killed in the civil war.'''''' The war led to a [[Refugees of the Syrian civil war|massive refugee crisis]], with an estimated 7.6 million [[Forced displacement|internally displaced people]] (July 2015 [[UNHCR]] figure) and over 5 million refugees (July 2017 registered by [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]]). The war has also worsened economic conditions, with more than 90% of the population living in poverty and 80% facing food insecurity.{{Efn|}}{{Efn|Sources:

==== Rise and fall of Islamic State and factional escalation ====

Taking an advantage of ongoing civil war, the [[Islamic State|Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]] (ISIS) won many battles against the rebel factions and the Syrian government in 2014. ISIS was able to seize control of large parts of Eastern Syria, prompting a United States-led coalition to launch an [[War against the Islamic State|aerial bombing campaign]] against ISIS, while providing [[US intervention in the Syrian civil war|ground support]] and supplies to the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] (SDF), a Kurdish-dominated coalition led by the [[People's Defense Units]] (YPG).

In August 2016, Turkey launched a [[Turkish involvement in the Syrian civil war|multi-pronged invasion]] of northern Syria, in response to the creation of the Kurdish-led [[Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria|Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria]], also known as Rojava, while also fighting ISIS and government forces in the process. During this time, Turkey helped establish the [[Syrian National Army]] (SNA) out of remnants of the Free Syrian Army. [[Iranian intervention in the Syrian civil war|Iran]] and later Russia also [[Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war|intervened]] in the civil war on behalf of the Assad government to help defeat ISIS and attack both SDF and SNA. The ISIS eventually lost its territory after the [[Fall of Mosul|fall of IS in Mosul]] and increasingly resorted to more terror bombings and insurgency operations that continues in present.

==== Rebel offensive and fall of the Ba'athist regime ====

In December 2024, violence flared up once again. Rebel factions, led by the Islamist group [[Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham]] (HTS), [[Battle of Aleppo (2024)|took control of Aleppo]] in a lightning offensive, prompting a retaliatory airstrike campaign by Syrian regime forces, supported by [[Russian Aerospace Forces|Russian aviation assets]]. The strikes, which targeted population centers and several hospitals in [[Idlib insurgency|rebel-held]] city of [[Idlib]], resulted in at least 25 deaths according to the White Helmets rescue group. NATO issued a joint statement calling for the protection of civilians and critical infrastructure to prevent further displacement and ensure humanitarian access. They stressed the urgent need for a Syrian-led political solution, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2254, which advocates for dialogue between the Syrian government and opposition forces.

The [[2024 Syrian opposition offensives|rebel offensive]], which had begun on 27 November, continued its [[2024 Hama offensive|advance into Hama province]] following their capture of Aleppo. On 30 November, Brigadier General [[Hossam Louka]], director of the [[General Intelligence Directorate (Syria)|General Security Directorate]], attempted to stage a coup in Damascus while Bashar al-Assad was in Moscow, but would be foiled by Bashar's younger brother [[Maher al-Assad|Maher]]. On 4 December, fierce clashes erupted in Hama province as the Syrian army engaged rebel forces in a bid to halt their advance on the key city of [[Hama]]. Government forces claimed to have launched a counteroffensive with air support, pushing back rebel factions, including HTS, around six miles from the city. However, despite reinforcements, the rebels captured the city on 5 December. The fighting led to widespread displacement, with nearly 50,000 people fleeing the area and over 600 casualties reported, including 104 civilians.

Rebel forces reached the outskirts of [[Homs]] on 5 December, beginning a [[2024 Homs offensive|three-day battle]] for the city. Simultaneously, an HTS-coordinated [[Southern Syria offensive (2024)|mass uprising]] led by a [[Southern Operations Room|coalition of Druze tribes and opposition forces]] captured the southern cities of [[Suwayda]] and [[Daraa insurgency|Daraa]] by 6 December, and rapidly advanced northwards to encircle Damascus over the following day. Homs was captured by rebel forces by the early morning of 8 December, leaving no major regime strongholds between the rebel advance and Damascus itself.

Cut off from the [[Alawites|Alawite]] heartland of [[Tartus Governorate|Tartus]] and [[Latakia Governorate|Latakia]] governorates, faced with a rebel pincer from both north and south bearing down on Damascus, and with no hope of foreign intervention from the regime's Russian and Iranian benefactors, Assadist authority over remaining regime-held territories rapidly disintegrated. The [[Syrian Arab Armed Forces]] melted away as its soldiers abandoned their weapons and uniforms, many [[Desertion|deserting]] across the border to [[Iraq]] and [[Lebanon]]. Opposition forces [[Fall of Damascus (2024)|captured]] the capital Damascus on 8 December, toppling Bashar al-Assad's government and ending the Assad family's 53-year-long rule over the country.

=== Interim Period ===

Following the [[fall of the Assad regime]], Assad's ninth prime minister [[Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali]], with support from the opposition and [[Ahmed al-Sharaa]], remained at his post in a caretaker capacity until a [[Syrian caretaker government|caretaker government]] led by [[Mohammed al-Bashir]] was formed the following day. Al-Jalali called for fresh elections so that the Syrian people may choose their new leaders. Shortly after the fall of the Assad regime, [[Israeli invasion of Syria (2024–present)|Israel commenced a ground invasion]] of the [[Purple Line (ceasefire line)|Purple Line]] buffer zone near the Golan Heights, as well as commencing a series of airstrikes against Syrian military depots and naval bases. The [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli Defense Forces]] claims that it is destroying Ba'athist military infrastructure, including chemical weapons plants, so that the rebels cannot use them. In February 2025, the SDF, the [[Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria|Autonomous Administration]], and the [[Syrian Democratic Council]] decided in a meeting that SDF would merge with the [[Syrian Armed Forces]]. The [[Operation Inherent Resolve|International Coalition against ISIS]] voiced support for continued dialogue between the SDF and the new Syrian government as well.

The prime minister of the transitional government, Mohammed al-Bashir, has promised to allow Christians and other minorities to continue practicing their religion without interference. However, this has been met with doubts as many rebel forces had previous connections to [[al-Qaeda]] and the [[Islamic State]]. The use of a variation of the [[Islamic flag|''Tawhid'' flag]] by the new government alongside [[Flag of Syria|the opposition flag]] also raised worries, as it implies that the new state may be [[Islam and secularism|less secular]]. [[Aisha al-Dibs]] was appointed as the Minister of Women's Affairs on 22 December 2024.

On 12 December 2024, a spokesman of the transitional government speaking to [[Agence France-Presse]] said that during the government's three-month term, the [[Constitution of Syria|constitution]] and [[People's Assembly of Syria|parliament]] would be suspended and that a 'judicial and human rights committee' would be established to review the constitution, prior to making amendments.

On 29 January 2025, during the [[Syrian Revolution Victory Conference]] in [[People's Palace of Syria|Presidential Palace]], the Syrian General Command appointed [[Ahmed al-Sharaa]] as president for the transitional period after he had served as the ''[[de facto]]'' leader following the fall of the Assad regime. 

In March 2025, the UK-based [[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights|SOHR]] reported that Syrian security forces and pro-government fighters had committed a [[2025 massacres of Syrian Alawites|massacre of more than 1500 Alawite civilians]] during [[March 2025 Western Syria clashes|clashes in western Syria]]. 

On 10 March 2025, the SDF agreed to merge with the Syrian Armed Forces after SDF leader [[Mazloum Abdi]] met with al-Sharaa. Three days later al-Sharaa signed an [[2025 Interim Constitution of Syria|interim constitution]] covering a five-year transitional period.

On 29 March 2025, the [[Syrian transitional government]] was announced by Syrian President [[Ahmed al-Sharaa]] at a ceremony at the [[People's Palace of Syria|Presidential Palace]] in [[Damascus]], in which the new ministers were sworn in and delivered speeches outlining their agendas. The government replaced the [[Syrian caretaker government]], which was formed following the fall of the Assad regime on 8 December 2024. Since then, a number of Western governments have lifted the [[International sanctions against Syria|sanctions on Syria]], most notably the United States and the United Kingdom.
