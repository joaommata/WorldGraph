The first human traces are supported by the presence of [[Acheulean]] tools, generally close to the [[obsidian]] outcrops more than 1 million years ago. The most recent and important excavation is at the [[Nor Geghi|Nor Geghi 1]] [[Stone Age]] site in the [[Hrazdan (river)|Hrazdan river]] valley. Thousands of 325,000 year-old artifacts may indicate that this stage of human technological innovation occurred intermittently throughout the Old World, rather than spreading from a single point of origin (usually hypothesized to be Africa), as was previously thought.

Many early [[Bronze Age]] settlements were built in Armenia (Valley of Ararat, Shengavit, Harich, Karaz, Amiranisgora, Margahovit, Garni, etc.). One of the important sites of the Early Bronze Age is [[Shengavit (site)|Shengavit settlement]]. It was located on the site of today's capital of Armenia, [[Yerevan]].

===Antiquity===

[[File:Arshakuni Armenia 150-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Historical Armenia, 150 BC]]
Armenia lies in the highlands surrounding the mountains of [[Mount Ararat|Ararat]]. There is evidence of an early civilisation in Armenia in the Bronze Age and earlier, dating to about 4000 BC. Archaeological surveys in 2010 and 2011 at the [[Areni-1 cave]] complex have resulted in the discovery of [[Areni-1 shoe|the world's earliest known leather shoe]], skirt, and [[Areni-1 winery|wine-producing facility]].

Several Bronze Age cultures and states flourished in the area of Greater Armenia, including the [[Trialeti culture|Trialeti-Vanadzor culture]], [[Hayasa-Azzi]], and [[Mitanni]] (located in southwestern historical Armenia), all of which are believed to have had Indo-European populations. The [[Nairi]] confederation and its successor, [[Urartu]], successively established their sovereignty over the [[Armenian Highlands]]. Each of the aforementioned nations and confederacies participated in the ethnogenesis of the [[Armenians]]. A large cuneiform lapidary inscription found in [[Yerevan]] established that the modern capital of Armenia was founded in the summer of 782&nbsp;BC by King [[Argishti I of Urartu|Argishti I]]. Yerevan is one of the world's [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously inhabited cities]].{{sfn|Bournoutian|2006|p=12}}

[[File:Darius I the Great's inscription.jpg|thumb|[[Behistun Inscription|Behistun Inscription of Darius I]] mentioning Armenia. 6th century BC.]]
After the fall of the state of [[Urartu]] at the beginning of the 6th century BC, the [[Armenian highlands]] were for some time under the hegemony of the [[Medes]], and after that they were part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Armenia was part of the Achaemenid state from the second half of the 6th century BC until the second half of the 4th century BC divided into two satrapies: XIII (western part, with the capital in [[Melitene]]) and XVIII (northeastern part). During the late 6th century BC, the [[Satrapy of Armenia|first geographical entity that was called Armenia]] by neighbouring populations was established under the [[Orontid dynasty]].

The kingdom became fully sovereign from the sphere of influence of the [[Seleucid Empire]] in 190 BC under King [[Artaxias I]] and begun the rule of the [[Artaxiad dynasty]].{{sfn|Hewsen|2001|p=34}} Armenia reached its height between 95 and 66&nbsp;BC under [[Tigranes the Great]], becoming the most powerful kingdom of its time east of the [[Roman Republic]].
In the next centuries, Armenia was in the [[Persian Empire]]'s sphere of influence during the reign of [[Tiridates I of Armenia|Tiridates I]], the founder of the [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia]], which was a branch of the [[Parthian Empire]]. Throughout its history, the kingdom of Armenia enjoyed both periods of independence and periods of autonomy subject to contemporary empires. Its strategic location between two continents has subjected it to invasions by many peoples, including [[Assyria]] (under [[Ashurbanipal]], at around 669–627 BC, the boundaries of Assyria reached as far as Armenia and the [[Caucasus Mountains]]), Medes, Achaemenid Empire, [[Greeks]], Parthians, [[ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Sasanian Empire]], [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Arabs]], [[Seljuk Empire]], [[Mongols]], [[Ottoman Empire]], the successive [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]], [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]], and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties of Iran, and the Russians.

[[File:Garni Temple 02.JPG|thumb|The pagan [[Garni Temple]], probably built in the first century, is the only "Greco-Roman [[colonnade]]d building" in the [[Post-Soviet states|post-Soviet space]].]]
Religion in ancient Armenia was historically related to a set of beliefs that, in Persia, led to the emergence of [[Zoroastrianism]]. It particularly focused on the worship of [[Mithra]] and also included a pantheon of gods such as [[Aramazd]], [[Vahagn]], [[Anahit]], and [[Astghik]]. The country used the solar [[Armenian calendar]], which consisted of 12 months.

Christianity first appeared in Armenia in the 1st century AD, with the arrival of two of [[Jesus]]'s twelve [[Apostles in the New Testament|apostles]] – [[Jude the Apostle|Thaddaeus]] and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]].{{sfn|Hacikyan|Basmajian|Franchuk|Ouzounian|2000|pp=75-76}}{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=24}} Under the influence of [[Gregory the Illuminator]], King [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]] proclaimed Christianity as the [[state religion]] in 301,{{sfn|Hacikyan|Basmajian|Franchuk|Ouzounian|2000|pp=77-79}} partly in defiance of the [[Sasanian Empire]]. Armenia thus became the first officially Christian state. Prior to this, during the latter part of the Parthian era, Armenia was a predominantly Zoroastrian country.

Another major cornerstone of Armenian identity – the [[Armenian alphabet]] – was invented a century later by [[Mesrop Mashtots]] {{circa|405}}.{{sfn|Hacikyan|Basmajian|Franchuk|Ouzounian|2000|p=87}} After the fall of the Armenian Arsacids in 428, most of Armenia was incorporated as a [[Sasanian Armenia|''marzpanate'' within Sasanian Persia]]. Following the [[Battle of Avarayr]] in 451, Christian Armenians maintained their religion, and Armenia gained autonomy in the [[Treaty of Nvarsak]] in 484.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|pp=47-48}}

===Middle Ages===

[[File:Etchmiadzin cathedral.jpg|thumb|The [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral]], Armenia's Mother Church traditionally dated 303 AD, is considered the oldest cathedral in the world.]]

The Sassanid Empire was conquered by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in the mid 7th century, reuniting Armenian lands previously taken by the Byzantine Empire, and Armenia subsequently emerged as [[Arminiya]], an autonomous principality under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. The principality was ruled by the Prince of Armenia, and recognised by the [[Caliphate|Caliph]] and the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]]. It was part of the administrative division/emirate ''Arminiya'' created by the Arabs, which also included parts of Georgia and [[Caucasian Albania]], and had its centre in the Armenian city [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]]. Arminiya lasted until 884, when it regained its independence from the weakened [[Abbasid Caliphate]] under [[Ashot I of Armenia]].{{Sfn|Canard|Cahen|1960}}

The reemergent Armenian kingdom was ruled by the [[Bagratuni dynasty]] and lasted until 1045. In time, several areas of the [[Bagratid Armenia]] separated as independent kingdoms and principalities such as the Kingdom of [[Vaspurakan]] ruled by the House of [[Artsruni]] in the south, Kingdom of [[Syunik Province|Syunik]] in the east, or [[Kingdom of Artsakh]] on the territory of modern [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], while still recognising the supremacy of the Bagratid kings.{{sfn|Payaslian|2007|p=52}}

In 1045, the Byzantine Empire conquered Bagratid Armenia. Soon, the other Armenian states fell under Byzantine control as well. The Byzantine rule was short-lived, as in 1071 the [[Seljuk Empire]] defeated the Byzantines and conquered Armenia at the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. To escape death or servitude at the hands of those who had assassinated his relative, [[Gagik II of Armenia|Gagik II]], King of [[Ani]], an Armenian named [[Ruben I, Prince of Armenia]], went with some of his countrymen into the gorges of the [[Taurus Mountains]] and then into [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] of [[Cilicia]]. The Byzantine governor of the palace gave them shelter where the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] was eventually established on 6 January 1198 under [[Leo I, King of Armenia]], a descendant of Prince Ruben.

Cilicia was a strong ally of the [[Crusades|European Crusaders]] and saw itself as a bastion of [[Christendom]] in the East. Cilicia's significance in Armenian history and statehood is also attested by the transfer of the seat of the [[Catholicos]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the spiritual leader of the Armenian people, to the region.

In the early 12th century, Armenian princes of the [[Zakarid dynasty|Zakarid family]] drove out the Seljuk Turks and established a semi-independent principality in northern and eastern Armenia known as [[Zakarid Armenia]], which lasted under the patronage of the [[History of Georgia (country)|Georgian Kingdom]]. The [[Orbelian dynasty]] shared control with the Zakarids in various parts of the country, especially in [[Syunik Province|Syunik]] and [[Vayots Dzor Province|Vayots Dzor]], while the [[House of Hasan-Jalalyan]] controlled provinces of [[Artsakh (historical province)|Artsakh]] and [[Utik]] as the [[Kingdom of Artsakh]].

===Early modern era===

[[File:Map Safavid persia.png|thumb|In 1501–02, most of the [[Eastern Armenia]]n territories, including Yerevan, were conquered by the emerging [[Safavid dynasty]] of Iran led by Shah [[Ismail I]].]]
During the 1230s, the [[Mongol Empire]] conquered Zakarid Armenia and then the remainder of Armenia. The Mongolian invasions were soon followed by those of other Central Asian tribes, such as the [[Kara Koyunlu]], [[Timurid dynasty]] and [[Ağ Qoyunlu]], which continued from the 13th century until the 15th century. After incessant invasions, each bringing destruction to the country, with time Armenia became weakened.

In the 16th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Safavid dynasty]] of Iran divided Armenia. From the early 16th century, both [[Western Armenia]] and [[Eastern Armenia]] fell to the Safavids. Owing to the century long [[Ottoman–Safavid relations|Turco-Iranian geopolitical rivalry]] that would last in West Asia, significant parts of the region were frequently fought over between the two rivalling empires during the [[Ottoman–Persian Wars]]. From the mid 16th century with the [[Peace of Amasya]], and decisively from the first half of the 17th century with the [[Treaty of Zuhab]] until the first half of the 19th century, Eastern Armenia was ruled by the successive Safavid, [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties, while Western Armenia remained under Ottoman rule. From 1604, [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I of Iran]] implemented a "[[scorched earth]]" policy in the region to protect his north-western frontier against any [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1603–1618)|invading Ottoman forces]], a policy that involved a [[History of Armenia#Persian Armenia|forced resettlement]] of masses of Armenians outside of their homelands.

[[File:Siege of Erivan Fortress on 1 October 1827.jpg|thumb|[[Capture of Erivan]] fortress by Russian troops in 1827 during the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–28)]] by [[Franz Roubaud]]]]
The 18th century saw the first foray of the [[Russian Empire]] into the region, with [[Peter the Great]] and his alliance with the Armenian [[melik]]s of [[Syunik (historical province)|Syunik]] and [[Melikdoms of Karabakh|Artsakh]] during the [[Russo-Persian War (1722–1723)]].{{sfn|Hewsen|2001|pp=163-165}} Despite the setbacks of Peter's campaign, this initial move encouraged the meliks in their [[Artsakh liberation struggle (1724–1731)|resistance struggle]] against the Safavids and the Ottomans.{{sfn|Hewsen|2001|pp=163-165}} However, it was not until the early 19th century that Eastern Armenia formally passed to Russian control, following the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–1813)]] and the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)]].{{sfn|Badalyan Riegg|2020|pp=55, 91}} In the 1813 [[Treaty of Gulistan]] and the 1828 [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]], Qajar Iran ceded to Russia the [[Karabakh Khanate|Karabakh]], [[Erivan Khanate|Erivan]], and [[Nakhichevan Khanate]]s.{{sfn|Bournoutian|2018|pp=6-7}}{{sfn|Tsutsiev|2014|pp=15-17}} The [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] resulted in further gains for [[Russian Armenia]], notably the regions of [[Kars]] and [[Ardahan]].{{sfn|Panossian|2006|p=120}}{{sfn|Badalyan Riegg|2020|p=164}}

Most of Western Armenia, however, remained under Ottoman rule. Within the Ottoman ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]'' system, Armenians lived in relative harmony with other groups, including the ruling Turks. However, as Christians under a strict Muslim [[social structure]], Armenians faced pervasive discrimination. In response to the [[1894 Sasun rebellion]], Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] organised state-sponsored massacres against the Armenians between 1894 and 1896, resulting in close to 200,000 deaths.{{sfn|Kévorkian|2011|p=11}} The [[Hamidian massacres]], as they came to be known, gave Abdul Hamid international infamy as the "Bloody Sultan"{{sfn|Suny|1993|p=99}} or the "Red Sultan".{{sfn|Kévorkian|2011|p=67}}

[[File:ErevanKhanate.gif|thumb|The [[Armenian Oblast]] (1828–1840) included the territory of the former Erivan (marked in yellow) and Nakhichevan (marked in light green) khanates.]]

During the 1890s, the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]], commonly known as the ''Dashnaktsutyun'', became active within the Ottoman Empire with the aim of unifying the various small groups in the empire that were advocating for reform and defending Armenian villages from massacres that were widespread in some of the Armenian-populated areas of the empire. Dashnaktsutyun members also formed [[Armenian fedayi]] groups that defended Armenian civilians through armed resistance.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=177}} The Dashnaks also worked for the wider goal of creating a "free, independent and unified" Armenia, although they sometimes set aside this goal in favour of a more realistic approach, such as advocating autonomy.{{sfn|Suny|1993|p=100}}

The Ottoman Empire began to collapse, and in 1908, the [[Young Turk Revolution]] overthrew the government of Sultan Hamid. In April 1909, the [[Adana massacre]] occurred in the [[Adana Vilayet]] resulting in the deaths of as many as 20,000–30,000 Armenians. The Armenians living in the empire hoped that the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] would change their second-class status. The [[Armenian reform package]] (1914) was presented as a solution by appointing an [[inspector general]] over Armenian issues.

===World War I and the Armenian genocide===
[[File:Morgenthau336.jpg|thumb|[[Armenian genocide]] victims in 1915]]
The outbreak of World War I led to confrontation between the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire in the [[Caucasus campaign|Caucasus]] and [[Persian campaign (World War I)|Persian campaign]]s. The new government in [[Istanbul]] began to look on the Armenians with distrust and suspicion because the [[Imperial Russian Army]] contained a contingent of [[Armenian volunteer units|Armenian volunteers]]. On 24 April 1915, [[Deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915|Armenian intellectuals were arrested by Ottoman authorities]] and, with the [[Temporary Law of Deportation|Tehcir Law]] (29 May 1915), eventually a large proportion of Armenians living in [[Anatolia]] perished in what has become known as the [[Armenian genocide]].

The genocide was implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly and infirmed on [[death march]]es leading to the [[Syrian desert]]. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre.{{sfn|Walker|1990|pp=200-203}} There was local [[Armenian resistance during the Armenian genocide|Armenian resistance]] in the region, developed against the activities of the Ottoman Empire. The events of 1915 to 1917 are regarded by Armenians and the vast majority of Western historians to have been state-sponsored mass killings, or genocide.

Turkish authorities deny the genocide took place to this day. The Armenian genocide is acknowledged to have been one of the first modern genocides.{{sfn|Suny|1993|p=106}} According to the research conducted by [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], an estimated 600,000 Armenians died during deportation from 1915 to 1916. This figure, however, accounts for solely the first year of the genocide and does not take into account those who died or were killed after the report was compiled on 24 May 1916. The [[International Association of Genocide Scholars]] places the death toll at "more than a million". The total number of people killed has been most widely estimated at between 1 and 1.5 million. Armenia and the Armenian diaspora have been campaigning for [[Armenian genocide recognition|official recognition]] of the events as genocide for over 30&nbsp;years. These events are traditionally commemorated yearly on 24 April, the Armenian Martyr Day, or the Day of the Armenian genocide.

===First Republic of Armenia===
[[File:First Republic of Armenia.png|thumb|{{legend|#FF7F00|Territory held by [[First Republic of Armenia|Armenia]] and the [[Karabakh Council]] at some point}} {{legend|beige|Area given to Armenia by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], which was never enforced}}]]
The [[Caucasus Army (Russian Empire, 1914–1917)|Imperial Russian Caucasus Army]], commanded by [[Nikolai Yudenich]], and the Armenian volunteer units, led by [[Andranik Ozanian]] and [[Tovmas Nazarbekian]], succeeded in gaining much of Western Armenia during World War I. However, their gains were lost with the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. At the time, Russian-controlled Eastern Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan attempted to bond together in the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]]. This federation, however, lasted from only February to May 1918, when all three parties decided to dissolve it. As a result, the Dashnak-dominated government of Eastern Armenia declared its independence on 28 May as the [[First Republic of Armenia]] under the leadership of [[Aram Manukian]].
[[File:Government-House-of-Republic-of-Armenia-1918-1920.jpg|thumb|upright|The Government house of the [[First Republic of Armenia]] (1918–1920)]]
The First Republic's short-lived independence was fraught with war, territorial disputes, [[Muslim uprisings in Kars and Sharur–Nakhichevan|ethnic unrest]], [[May Uprising|Bolshevik rebellions]], and a mass influx of refugees from Western Armenia, bringing with them disease and starvation. The [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] sought to help the newly founded Armenian state through relief funds and other forms of support.

At the end of the war, the victorious powers sought to divide up the Ottoman Empire. Signed between the Allied Powers and the Ottoman Empire at [[Sèvres]] on 10 August 1920, the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] promised to maintain the existence of the Armenian republic and to attach the former territories of Western Armenia to it.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|pp=247-248}} Because the new borders of Armenia were to be drawn by United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]], Western Armenia was also referred to as "[[Wilsonian Armenia]]". In addition, just days prior on 5 August, [[Mihran Damadian]] of the Armenian National Union, the de facto Armenian administration in Cilicia, declared the independence of Cilicia as an Armenian autonomous republic under French protectorate. There was even consideration of making Armenia a [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] under the protection of the United States. The treaty, however, was rejected by the [[Turkish National Movement]] and never came into effect.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|pp=247-248}}

In 1920, Turkish nationalist forces [[Turkish invasion of Armenia|invaded]] the fledgling Armenian republic from the east. Under the command of [[Kâzım Karabekir]], they captured the Armenian territories that Imperial Russia had annexed in 1878 and occupied Alexandropol (today [[Gyumri]]). Hostilities finally concluded with the [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] on 2 December 1920. The treaty forced Armenia to disarm most of its military forces and to cede all former Ottoman territory granted to it by the Treaty of Sèvres. Simultaneously, the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|11th Red Army]], led by [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]], invaded Armenia at Karavansarai (today [[Ijevan]]) on 29 November. By early December, Ordzhonikidze's forces entered Yerevan and the short-lived Armenian republic collapsed.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1996b|pp=389–390}}

After the fall of the First Republic, the [[war communism]] policies of the new [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenian government]] led to the [[February Uprising]] of 1921.{{sfn|Hovannisian|1996b|pp=405–406}} Following the defeat of that revolt, Armenian forces under the command of [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] established the [[Republic of Mountainous Armenia]] and continued to fight Soviet forces in the southern region of [[Zangezur]].{{sfn|Saparov|2015|pp=104-106}} To end the rebellion, Soviet authorities pledged to include the [[Syunik Province]] within Armenia's borders.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|p=259}} The Red Army soon took control of the region, driving the leaders of the revolt out of Armenia, across the [[Aras (river)|Araks River]] into Iran on 15 July 1921.{{sfn|Saparov|2015|pp=104-106}}

===Soviet Armenia===

[[File:Emblem of the Armenian SSR.svg|thumb|The [[Emblem of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|state emblem]] of [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]] depicting [[Mount Ararat]]]]

====Sovietization to Stalinism====
Following Armenia's [[Soviet invasion of Armenia|Sovietization]], the Treaty of Alexandropol was superseded by the [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|Treaty of Moscow]] and the [[Treaty of Kars]]. In these agreements, Turkey renounced its claims on [[Batumi]] to [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Georgia]] in exchange for the provinces of [[Kars oblast|Kars]], [[Ardahan okrug|Ardahan]], and [[Surmalu uezd|Surmalu]], all of which had been under Turkish military control since the Turkish invasion of Armenia in 1920. The territory ceded to Turkey included the medieval Armenian capital [[Ani]] and [[Mount Ararat]], the national symbol of the Armenian people.{{sfn|Tsutsiev|2014|pp=74–76, 79}} Together with Soviet Georgia and [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Azerbaijan]], Soviet Armenia officially entered the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] as part of the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] (TSFSR) in March 1922.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|p=246}} The TSFSR later split into three separate republics in December 1936 – the Armenian SSR, the Azerbaijan SSR, and the Georgian SSR.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|p=266}}

[[Vladimir Lenin]], who "favored a moderate policy in Armenia,"{{sfn|Shakarian|2025|p=49}} appointed [[Alexander Miasnikian]], an experienced administrator, to oversee affairs in the republic.{{sfn|Saparov|2015|p=103}} During the era of the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), Armenia enjoyed a period of stability and cultural revival within the USSR, in contrast to the turbulent years of the First Republic.{{sfn|Suny|1993|p=140}} However, after the [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|death of Lenin]] and the [[Joseph Stalin's rise to power|rise]] of [[Joseph Stalin]] to the Soviet leadership, the situation changed significantly. Armenians suffered greatly during [[Armenian victims of the Great Purge|Stalin's Great Purge]], with [[Lavrentiy Beria]] playing an especially conspicuous role, beginning with the death of the popular Soviet Armenian leader [[Aghasi Khanjian]] in 1936.{{sfn|Shakarian|2025|pp=14-15}}{{sfn|Suny|1993|pp=156-157}} The repressions claimed the lives of major Armenian intellectual figures like [[Yeghishe Charents]], [[Axel Bakunts]], and [[Vahan Totovents]].{{sfn|Suny|1993|p=155}} The Armenian Church also suffered in this period, culminating in the murder of the Armenian Catholicos [[Khoren I of Armenia|Khoren I]], an act for which Beria is usually held responsible.

====Great Patriotic War and post-war period====
[[File:ArmenianStamps-066-069.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Armenian [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]]s and [[Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union|Admiral]] of World War II on stamps: [[Ivan Bagramyan|Bagramyan]], [[Ivan Isakov|Isakov]], [[Hamazasp Babadzhanian|Babadzhanian]], [[Sergei Khudyakov|Khudyakov]]]]

Armenia was not the scene of any battles in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]] of [[World War II]]. Nevertheless, an estimated 500,000 Armenians (nearly a third of the population) served in the [[Red Army]] during the war, and 175,000 died. A total of 117 citizens of Soviet Armenia, including 10 non-Armenians, were awarded [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. Six special military divisions were formed in Armenia in 1941–42. Five of them, the [[89th Rifle Division|89th]], [[409th Rifle Division|409th]], [[408th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|408th]], [[390th Rifle Division|390th]], and [[76th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|76th]] Divisions, would have a distinguished war record, while the sixth was ordered to stay in Armenia to guard the republic's western borders against a possible incursion by neighboring Turkey. The 89th Tamanyan Division, composed of ethnic Armenians, fought in the [[Battle of Berlin]]. Over 60 Armenians were promoted to the rank of general, while one attained the rank of [[Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union|Admiral]] ([[Ivan Isakov]]) and three achieved the rank of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] ([[Ivan Bagramyan]], [[Hamazasp Babadzhanian]], and [[Sergei Khudyakov]]).

After the [[State funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Stalin]] in 1953, Armenia experienced a new period of liberalization under [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[Khrushchev Thaw|Thaw]]. In March 1954, two years before Khrushchev [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|denounced Stalin]], his close ally, the Armenian statesman [[Anastas Mikoyan]], flew to Yerevan and called for the [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]] of Charents and the republication of the writers [[Raphael Patkanian]] and [[Raffi (novelist)|Raffi]].{{sfn|Shakarian|2025|pp=34-35}} During the Thaw, life in Soviet Armenia soon began to see rapid improvement with greater investment in housing and the consumer economy. The Armenian Church, which was limited under Stalin, was revived when [[Catholicos of All Armenians|Catholicos]] [[Vazgen I]] assumed the duties of his office in 1955.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|p=352}} In 1962, the massive statue of Stalin that towered over Yerevan was pulled down from its pedestal by troops and replaced with that of [[Mother Armenia]] in 1967.{{sfn|Panossian|2006|p=349}} That same year, a memorial to the victims of the Armenian genocide was built at the [[Tsitsernakaberd]] hill above the Hrazdan gorge in [[Yerevan]].{{sfn|Panossian|2006|p=349}} This occurred after [[1965 Yerevan demonstrations|mass demonstrations]] took place on the tragic event's fiftieth anniversary in 1965.

====Glasnost and perestroika====
[[File:Karabakh movement demonstration at Yerevan Opera square (4).jpg|thumb|Armenians gather at [[Freedom Square, Yerevan|Theater Square]] in central [[Yerevan]] to claim unification of [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] with the [[Armenian SSR]], 1988.]]

Following the [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] era, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms of ''[[glasnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]'' witnessed a major national revival in Armenia with the rise of the [[Karabakh movement]]. Taking advantage of the new political climate, the Armenians of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO) of Soviet Azerbaijan began to demand unification with Soviet Armenia, citing [[Forced assimilation in Azerbaijan|discrimination by Baku]].{{sfn|Suny|1993|pp=192-194}} Peaceful protests in Armenia supporting the Karabakh Armenians became common. By the beginning of 1988, nearly one million Armenians from several regions of the republic engaged in these demonstrations, centered on Yerevan's Theater Square (today [[Freedom Square, Yerevan|Freedom Square]]). However, in neighboring Azerbaijan, [[Sumgait pogrom|violence against Armenians]] erupted in the city of [[Sumgait]].{{sfn|Saparov|2015|p=166}} Ethnic rioting soon broke out between Armenians and Azeris, preventing any peaceful resolution from taking place.{{sfn|Tsutsiev|2014|p=113}} Compounding Armenia's problems was a [[1988 Armenian earthquake|devastating earthquake]] in 1988 with a [[surface-wave magnitude]] of 6.8. Another major [[Baku pogrom|pogrom against Armenians]] in [[Baku]] in January 1990 forced almost all of the 200,000 Armenians in the Azerbaijani capital to flee to Armenia.

Gorbachev's inability to alleviate any of Armenia's problems created disillusionment among the Armenians and fed a growing hunger for independence. On 23 August 1990, Armenia declared its sovereignty on its territory. On 17 March 1991, Armenia, along with the [[Baltic states]], Georgia and [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldova]], boycotted a nationwide [[1991 Soviet Union referendum|referendum]] in which 78% of all voters voted for the retention of the Soviet Union in a reformed form.

===Post-Soviet independence===

On 21 September 1991, Armenia officially declared its [[statehood]] after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|failed August coup]] in [[Moscow]] in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]]. [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]], who rose to prominence during the Karabakh movement, was [[1991 Armenian presidential election|popularly elected]] the first president of the newly independent Republic of Armenia in October 1991.{{sfn|Payaslian|2007|p=198}} The Soviet Union formally [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] following the [[Belovezha Accords]] in December 1991 and Armenia's independence was recognised.

Ter-Petrosyan led Armenia alongside defence minister [[Vazgen Sargsyan]] through the [[First Nagorno-Karabakh War]] with neighbouring Azerbaijan. The initial post-Soviet years were marred by economic difficulties and a [[1990s Armenian energy crisis|severe energy crisis]]. The latter was rooted in the early years of the Karabakh conflict when the [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party|Azerbaijani Popular Front]] managed to pressure the Azerbaijan SSR to instigate a railway and air [[Turkish–Azeri blockade of Armenia|blockade against Armenia]]. This move effectively debilitated Armenia's economy as 85% of its cargo and goods arrived through rail traffic. In 1993, Turkey joined the [[Turkish–Azeri blockade of Armenia (1989–ongoing)|blockade]] against Armenia in support of Azerbaijan.

The first Karabakh war ended after a Russian-brokered [[ceasefire]] was concluded in 1994. The war was a success for the Karabakh Armenian forces who managed to capture practically the entire territory of the former NKAO as well as most of [[Armenian-occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh|seven adjacent districts of Azerbaijan]].{{sfn|Tsutsiev|2014|p=114}} The Armenian backed forces remained in control of almost all of that territory until 2020. By the time both Azerbaijan and Armenia had finally agreed to a ceasefire in 1994, an estimated 30,000 people had been killed and over a million had been displaced.

===21st century===
In the 21st century, Armenia continued to face many hardships. The [[2018 Armenian revolution|2018 Armenian Revolution]] was a series of anti-government protests in Armenia from April to May 2018 staged by various political and civil groups led by a member of the Armenian parliament — [[Nikol Pashinyan]] (head of the [[Civil Contract (Armenia)|Civil Contract]] party). Protests and marches took place initially in response to [[Serzh Sargsyan]]'s third consecutive term as President of Armenia and later against the [[Republican Party of Armenia|Republican Party]] controlled government in general. Pashinyan declared the movement, which led to Sargsyan's resignation, a "[[velvet revolution]]".

In March 2018, the Armenian parliament elected [[Armen Sarkissian]] as the new President of Armenia. The controversial constitutional reform to reduce presidential power was implemented, while the authority of the prime minister was strengthened. In May 2018, parliament elected opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan as the new prime minister. His predecessor Serzh Sargsyan resigned two weeks earlier following [[2018 Armenian revolution|widespread anti-government demonstrations]].

On 27 September 2020, a full-scale war erupted due to the unresolved [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]]. Both the armed forces of Armenia and Azerbaijan reported military and civilian casualties. The [[2020 Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement|Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement]] to end the six-week [[2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war|war between Armenia and Azerbaijan]] was seen by many as Armenia's defeat and capitulation. The year-long [[2020–2021 Armenian protests|March of Dignity]] protests forced early elections.

On 20 June 2021, Pashinyan's Civil Contract party won an early parliamentary [[2021 Armenian parliamentary election|election]]. Acting Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan was officially appointed to the post of prime minister by Armenia's President Armen Sarkissian. In January 2022, Armenian President Armen Sarkissian resigned from office, stating that the constitution no longer gives the president sufficient powers or influence. On 3 March 2022, [[Vahagn Khachaturyan]] was elected as the fifth president of Armenia in the second round of parliamentary vote. The next month [[2022 Armenian protests|yet more protests broke out]].

==== 2023 Azerbaijani offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh ====

{{See also|Flight of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians}}

Between 19 and 20 September 2023, [[Azerbaijan]] launched a large-scale military offensive against the [[Political status of Nagorno-Karabakh|self-declared]] breakaway state of [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]], a move seen by the European Parliament as a violation of the [[2020 Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement|2020 ceasefire agreement]]. The offensive took place in the disputed region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], which is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but populated by [[Armenians]]. The attacks occurred in the midst of an escalating crisis caused by Azerbaijan [[Blockade of the Republic of Artsakh (2022–present)|blockading Artsakh]], which resulted in significant scarcities of essential supplies such as food, medicine, and other goods in the affected region.

One day after the offensive started, on 20 September, a [[2023 Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement|ceasefire agreement]] was reached at the mediation of the [[Peacekeeping operations in Nagorno-Karabakh|Russian peacekeeping command]] in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan held a meeting with representatives of the Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians on 21 September in [[Yevlakh]], to be followed by another meeting in October. Ceasefire violations by Azerbaijan were nonetheless reported by both Artsakhi residents and officials.

Human rights organisations and experts in genocide prevention issued multiple alerts, stating that the region's Armenian population was at risk or actively [[Flight of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians|being subjected to ethnic cleansing and genocide]]. [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]], a former [[prosecutor of the International Criminal Court]], warned that another [[Armenian genocide]] could take place, and attributed the inaction of the international community to encouraging Azerbaijan that it would face no serious consequences.

On 8 August 2025, Armenian Prime Minister [[Nikol Pashinyan]] and Azerbaijani President [[Ilham Aliyev]] signed a joint declaration at the [[White House]], committing to a [[Armenia–Azerbaijan peace agreement|peace deal]] facilitated by the [[Second presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] that would end nearly four decades of conflict between the two countries.
