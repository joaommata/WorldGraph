=== Early history ===
[[File:Indo-European migrations.jpg|thumb|300px|Early [[Indo-European migrations]] from the [[Pontic steppes]] of present-day Ukraine and Russia|left]]

Evidence for the earliest securely dated hominin presence in Europe comes from 1.4 million-year-old stone tools from [[Korolevo]], in western Ukraine. Settlement by [[modern humans]] in Ukraine and its vicinity dates back to 32,000 BC, with evidence of the [[Gravettian culture]] in the [[Crimean Mountains]]. By 4,500 BC, the [[Neolithic]] [[Cucuteni–Trypillia culture]] was flourishing in wide areas of modern Ukraine, including [[Trypillia]] and the entire [[Dnieper]]-[[Dniester]] region. Ukraine is a probable location for the first [[domestication of the horse]]. The [[Kurgan hypothesis]] places the Volga-Dnieper region of Ukraine and southern Russia as the [[linguistic homeland]] of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. Early [[Indo-European migrations]] from the Pontic steppes in the 3rd millennium BC spread [[Yamnaya culture|Yamnaya]] [[Western Steppe Herders|Steppe pastoralist]] ancestry and [[Indo-European languages]] across large parts of Europe. During the [[Iron Age]], the land was inhabited by [[Eastern Iranian languages|Iranian]]-speaking [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], and [[Sarmatians]]. Between 700&nbsp;BC and 200&nbsp;BC it was part of the [[Scythia]]n kingdom.

From the 6th&nbsp;century BC, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] colonies were established on the north-eastern shore of the [[Black Sea]], such as at [[Tyras]], [[Olbia, Ukraine|Olbia]], and [[Chersonesus]]. These thrived into the 6th&nbsp;century AD. The [[Goths]] stayed in the area, but came under the sway of the [[Huns]] from the 370s. In the 7th&nbsp;century, the territory that is now eastern Ukraine was the centre of [[Old Great Bulgaria]]. At the end of the century, the majority of Bulgar tribes migrated in different directions, and the [[Khazars]] took over much of the land.

In the 5th and 6th centuries, the [[Antes (people)|Antes]], which some relate as an [[early Slavs|early Slavic]] people, lived in Ukraine. Migrations from the territories of present-day Ukraine throughout the [[Balkans]] established many [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] nations. Northern migrations, reaching almost to [[Lake Ilmen]], led to the emergence of the [[Ilmen Slavs]] and [[Krivichs]]. Following an [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] raid in 602 and the collapse of the Antes Union, most of these peoples survived as separate tribes until the beginning of the second millennium.

=== Golden Age of Kyiv ===
<!-- 800–1349 -->
{{Main|Kievan Rus'|Principality of Kiev|Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia}}
[[File:Principalities of Kievan Rus' (1054-1132).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The furthest extent of [[Kievan Rus']], 1054–1132]]

The establishment of the state of [[Kievan Rus']] remains obscure and uncertain. The state included much of present-day Ukraine, Belarus and the western part of [[European Russia]]. According to the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', the [[Rus' people]] initially consisted of [[Varangian]]s from [[Scandinavia]]. In 882, the pagan [[Oleg of Novgorod|Prince Oleg]] (Oleh) conquered [[Kyiv]]<!--See [[Talk:Kiev/naming]] re Kiev/Kyiv. --> from [[Askold and Dir]] and proclaimed it as the new capital of the Rus'. [[Anti-Normanism|Anti-Normanist]] historians however argue that the East Slavic tribes along the southern parts of the [[Dnieper River]] were already in the process of forming a state independently. The Varangian elite, including the ruling [[Rurik dynasty]], later assimilated into the Slavic population.

During the 10th and 11th&nbsp;centuries, Kievan Rus' became the largest and most powerful state in Europe, a period known as its Golden Age. It began with the reign of [[Vladimir the Great]] (980–1015), who [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|introduced Christianity]]. During the reign of his son, [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–1054), Kievan Rus' reached the zenith of its cultural development and military power. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the nomadic confederacy of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking [[Cumans]] and [[Kipchaks]] was the dominant force in the [[Pontic steppe]] north of the Black Sea.

The [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasions]] in the mid-13th century devastated Kievan Rus'; following the [[Siege of Kyiv (1240)|Siege of Kyiv in 1240]], the city was destroyed by the Mongols. In the western territories, the principalities of [[Principality of Halych|Halych]] and [[Principality of Volhynia|Volhynia]] had arisen earlier, and were merged to form the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia|Principality of Galicia–Volhynia]]. [[Daniel of Galicia]], son of [[Roman the Great]], re-united much of south-western Rus', including [[Volhynia]], [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], as well as Kyiv. He was subsequently crowned by a [[Pope|papal]] envoy as the first [[King of Ruthenia|king of Galicia–Volhynia]] (also known as the Kingdom of [[Ruthenia]]) in 1253.

In 1349, in the aftermath of the [[Galicia–Volhynia Wars]], the region was partitioned between the [[Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. From the mid-13th century to the late 1400s, the [[Republic of Genoa]] founded numerous [[colonies]] on the northern coast of the Black Sea and transformed these into large commercial centres headed by the consul, a representative of the Republic. In 1430, the region of [[Podolia]] was incorporated into Poland, and the lands of modern-day Ukraine became increasingly settled by [[Polish people|Poles]]. In 1441, [[Genghisid]] prince [[Haci I Giray]] founded the [[Crimean Khanate]] on the [[Crimean Peninsula]] and the surrounding steppes; the Khanate orchestrated [[Tatars|Tatar]] [[Crimean–Nogai slave raids in Eastern Europe|slave raids]]. Over the next three centuries, the [[Crimean slave trade]] would enslave an estimated two million in the region.

In 1569, the [[Union of Lublin]] established the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and most of the Ukrainian lands were transferred from Lithuania to the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]], becoming ''[[de jure]]'' Polish territory. Under the pressures of [[Polonisation]], many landed gentry of Ruthenia converted to [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]] and joined the circles of the [[Polish nobility]]; others joined the newly created [[Ruthenian Uniate Church]].

=== Cossack Hetmanate ===
{{main|Cossack Hetmanate|Zaporozhian Sich}}
Deprived of native protectors among the Ruthenian nobility, the peasants and townspeople began turning for protection to the emerging [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]]. In the mid-17th&nbsp;century, a Cossack military quasi-state, the [[Zaporozhian Host]], was formed by [[Dnieper Cossacks]] and Ruthenian peasants. Poland exercised little real control over this population, but found the Cossacks to be useful against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] and Tatars, and at times the two were allies in [[Ottoman wars in Europe|military campaigns]]. However, the continued harsh [[serf|enserfment]] of Ruthenian peasantry by Polish [[szlachta]] (many of whom were Polonised [[Ruthenian nobility|Ruthenian nobles]]) and the suppression of the Orthodox Church alienated the Cossacks.

[[File:Hondius Bohdan Khmelnytsky.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman]] [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] established an independent [[Cossack Hetmanate|Cossack state]] after the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|1648 uprising]] against Poland]]
In 1648, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] led the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|largest of the Cossack uprisings]] against the Commonwealth and the [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish king]], which enjoyed wide support from the local population. Khmelnytsky founded the [[Cossack Hetmanate]], which existed until 1764 (some sources claim until 1782). After Khmelnytsky suffered a crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Berestechko]] in 1651, he turned to the [[List of Russian monarchs|Russian tsar]] for help. In 1654, Khmelnytsky was subject to the [[Pereiaslav Agreement]], forming a military and political alliance with Russia that acknowledged loyalty to the Russian monarch.

After his death, the Hetmanate went through a devastating 30-year war amongst Russia, Poland, the Crimean Khanate, the Ottoman Empire, and [[Cossacks]], known as "[[The Ruin (Ukrainian history)|The Ruin]]" (1657–1686), for control of the Cossack Hetmanate. The [[Treaty of Perpetual Peace (1686)|Treaty of Perpetual Peace]] between Russia and Poland in 1686 divided the lands of the Cossack Hetmanate between them, reducing the portion over which Poland had claimed sovereignty to Ukraine west of the Dnieper river. In 1686, the [[Metropolitanate of Kyiv]] was [[Annexation of the Metropolitanate of Kyiv by the Moscow Patriarchate|annexed by the Moscow Patriarchate]] through a synodal letter of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Dionysius IV of Constantinople|Dionysius IV]], thus placing the [[Metropolitanate of Kyiv#Orthodox Church of Ukraine|Metropolitanate of Kyiv]] under the authority of [[Moscow]]. An attempt to reverse the decline was undertaken by Cossack Hetman [[Ivan Mazepa]] (1639–1709), who ultimately defected to the [[Sweden|Swedes]] in the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721) in a bid to get rid of Russian dependence, but Hetmanate's capital city [[Baturyn]] was [[Sack of Baturyn|sacked]] (1708) and they were crushed in the [[Battle of Poltava]] (1709). After the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|annexation of Crimea by Russia]] in 1783, the newly acquired lands, now called [[Novorossiya]], were opened up to settlement by Russians. The [[tsarist autocracy]] established a policy of [[Russification]], suppressing the use of the [[Ukrainian language]] and curtailing the Ukrainian national identity. The western part of present-day Ukraine was subsequently split between Russia and [[Habsburg]]-ruled [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] after the [[Partitions of Poland|fall]] of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795.

Following the [[Peace of Riga]] signed on 18 March 1921, Poland took control of modern-day western Ukraine while Soviets took control of eastern and central Ukraine]]

The 19th century saw the rise of Ukrainian nationalism. With growing urbanisation and modernisation and a cultural trend toward [[romantic nationalism]], a Ukrainian [[intelligentsia]] committed to national rebirth and social justice emerged. The serf-turned-national-poet [[Taras Shevchenko]] (1814–1861) and political theorist [[Mykhailo Drahomanov]] (1841–1895) led the growing nationalist movement. While conditions for its development in Austrian [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]] under the [[Habsburgs]] were relatively lenient, the Russian part (historically known as "[[Little Russia]]" or "South Russia") faced severe restrictions, going as far as [[Ems Ukaz|banning virtually all books from being published in Ukrainian]] in 1876.

Ukraine, like the rest of the Russian Empire, joined the [[Industrial Revolution]] [[Industrialization in the Russian Empire|later]] than most of Western Europe{{failed verification|date=December 2022}} due to the maintenance of [[Serfdom in Russia|serfdom]] until 1861.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} Other than near the newly discovered coal fields of the [[Donbas]], and in some larger cities such as [[Odesa]] and Kyiv, Ukraine largely remained an agricultural and resource extraction economy. The Austrian part of Ukraine [[Poverty in Austrian Galicia|was particularly destitute]], which forced hundreds of thousands of peasants into emigration, who created the backbone of an extensive [[Ukrainian diaspora]] in countries such as [[Ukrainian Canadians|Canada]], the [[Ukrainian Americans|United States]] and [[Ukrainian Brazilians|Brazil]]. Some of the Ukrainians settled in the Far East, too. According to the [[1897 census]], there were 223,000 ethnic Ukrainians in [[Siberia]] and 102,000 in [[Central Asia]]. An additional 1.6 million emigrated to the east in the ten years after the opening of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] in 1906. [[Russian Far East|Far Eastern]] areas with an ethnic Ukrainian population became known as [[Green Ukraine]].

Ukraine plunged into turmoil with the beginning of [[World War I]], and fighting on Ukrainian soil persisted until late 1921. Initially, the Ukrainians were split between Austria-Hungary, fighting for the [[Central Powers]], though the vast majority served in the [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Imperial Russian Army]], which was part of the [[Triple Entente]], under Russia. As the Russian Empire collapsed, the conflict evolved into the [[Ukrainian War of Independence]], with Ukrainians fighting alongside, or against, the [[Red Army|Red]], [[White Army|White]], [[Makhnovshchina|Black]] and [[Green armies]], with the Poles, Hungarians (in [[Transcarpathian Rus'|Transcarpathia]]), and Germans also intervening at various times.

[[File:Ukrainian national costumes 04.jpg|thumb|Youth in national Ukrainian dress during a ceremony commemorating the 22nd January 1919 "Act of Reunification of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the Western Ukrainian People's Republic", which is honoured yearly across 22 cities of Ukraine]]
An attempt to create an independent state, the left-leaning [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR), was first announced by [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], but the period was plagued by an extremely unstable political and military environment. It was first deposed in a [[coup d'état]] led by [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]], which yielded the [[Ukrainian State]] under the German protectorate, and the attempt to restore the UNR under the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] ultimately failed as the Ukrainian army was regularly overrun by other forces. The short-lived [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] and [[Hutsul Republic]] also failed to join the rest of Ukraine.

The result of the conflict was a partial victory for the [[Second Polish Republic]], which annexed the Western Ukrainian provinces, as well as a larger-scale victory for the pro-Soviet forces, which succeeded in dislodging the remaining factions and eventually established the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Soviet Ukraine). Meanwhile, modern-day [[Bukovina]] was occupied by [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] was admitted to [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] as an autonomous region.

The conflict over Ukraine, a part of the broader [[Russian Civil War]], devastated the whole of the former Russian Empire, including eastern and central Ukraine. The fighting left over 1.5 million people dead and hundreds of thousands homeless in the former Russian Empire's territory. [[Russian famine of 1921–1922|Famine in 1921]] further hit the eastern provinces.

=== Inter-war period ===
{{See also|Holodomor}}
[[File:GolodomorKharkiv.jpg|thumb|right|Starved peasants on a street in [[Kharkiv]], 1933. [[Collectivisation]] of crops and their confiscation by Soviet authorities led to a major famine in Soviet Ukraine known as the [[Holodomor]]]]
[[File:Les Kurbas Portrait.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Les Kurbas]], one of the lead figures of the [[Executed Renaissance]], was executed by the Soviet authorities, as many other Ukrainian intellectuals However, this approach was abandoned after Piłsudski's death in 1935, due to continued unrest among the Ukrainian population, including assassinations of Polish government officials by the [[Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists]] (OUN); with the Polish government responding by restricting rights of people who declared Ukrainian nationality. In consequence, the underground [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian nationalist]] and militant movement, which arose in the 1920s gained wider support.

Meanwhile, the recently constituted Soviet Ukraine became one of the founding republics of the [[Soviet Union]]. During the 1920s, under the Ukrainisation policy pursued by the national Communist leadership of [[Mykola Skrypnyk]], Soviet leadership at first encouraged a national renaissance in [[Culture of Ukraine|Ukrainian culture]] and language. [[Ukrainisation]] was part of the Soviet-wide policy of [[Korenisation]] (literally ''indigenisation''), which was intended to promote the advancement of native peoples, their language and culture into the governance of their respective republics.

Around the same time, Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] instituted the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), which introduced a form of [[market socialism]], allowing some private ownership of small and medium-sized productive enterprises, hoping to reconstruct the post-war Soviet Union that had been devastated by both WWI and later the civil war. The NEP was successful at restoring the formerly war-torn nation to pre-WWI levels of production and agricultural output by the mid-1920s, much of the latter based in Ukraine. These policies attracted many prominent former UNR figures, including former UNR leader Hrushevsky, to return to Soviet Ukraine, where they were accepted, and participated in the advancement of Ukrainian science and culture. In July 1922, arrests and [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportations]] of Ukrainian intellectuals (e.g. university professors) began in Soviet Ukraine and continued throughout the 1920s.

This period was cut short when [[Joseph Stalin]] became the leader of the USSR following Lenin's death. Stalin did away with the NEP in what became known as the [[Great Break (USSR)|Great Break]]. Starting from the late 1920s and now with a [[planned economy|centrally planned economy]], Soviet Ukraine took part in an [[Industrialization in the USSR|industrialisation scheme]] which quadrupled its industrial output during the 1930s.

Nevertheless, Stalin sought to prevent the Ukrainians aspirations for the independence of Ukraine and took severe measures to eliminate Ukrainian peasantry and elite Ukrainian intellectuals and culturists. As a consequence of Stalin's new policy, the Ukrainian peasantry suffered from the [[Collectivization in the USSR|programme of collectivisation]] of agricultural crops. Collectivisation was part of the [[First five-year plan (Soviet Union)|first five-year plan]] and was enforced by regular troops and the secret police known as [[Cheka]]. Those who resisted were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|arrested and deported]] to [[gulag]]s and work camps. As members of the collective farms were sometimes not allowed to receive any grain until unrealistic quotas were met, millions starved to death in a [[Droughts and famines in Russia and the Soviet Union|famine]] known as the [[Holodomor]] or the "Great Famine", which was recognised by some countries as an act of [[genocide]] perpetrated by Joseph Stalin and other Soviet notables.

Following on the Russian Civil War and collectivisation, the [[Great Purge]], while killing Stalin's perceived political enemies, resulted in a profound loss of a new generation of Ukrainian intelligentsia, known today as the [[Executed Renaissance]].

=== World War II ===
<!-- 1939–1945 -->
{{See also|Eastern Front (World War II)|Reichskommissariat Ukraine|The Holocaust in Ukraine}}

Following the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, [[Nazi Germany|German]] and [[Soviet Army|Soviet]] troops divided the territory of Poland. Thus, Eastern Galicia and Volhynia with their Ukrainian population became part of Ukraine. For the first time in history, the nation was united. Further territorial gains were secured in 1940, when the Ukrainian SSR incorporated the northern and southern districts of [[Bessarabia]], [[Northern Bukovina]], and the [[Hertsa region]] from the territories the USSR [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|forced Romania to cede]], though it handed over the western part of the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] to the newly created [[Moldavian SSR]]. These territorial gains of the USSR were internationally recognised by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaties of 1947]].

[[File:Маршал Советского Союза Герой Советского Союза Семён Константинович Тимошенко.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Marshal [[Semyon Timoshenko]] (born in the [[Budjak]] region) commanded numerous fronts throughout the war, including the [[Southwestern Front (Soviet Union)|Southwestern Front]] east of Kyiv in 1941.]]
[[Wehrmacht|German armies]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941, initiating nearly four years of [[total war]]. The [[Axis Powers|Axis]] initially advanced against desperate but unsuccessful efforts of the Red Army. In the [[Battle of Kyiv (1941)|battle of Kyiv]], the city was acclaimed as a "[[Hero City (Soviet Union)|Hero City]]", because of its fierce resistance. More than 600,000 Soviet soldiers (or one-quarter of the [[Soviet Western Front]]) were killed or taken captive there, with many suffering [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|severe mistreatment]]. After its conquest, most of the Ukrainian SSR was organised within the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]], with the intention of exploiting its resources and eventual German settlement. Some western Ukrainians, who had only joined the Soviet Union in 1939, hailed the Germans as liberators, but that did not last long as the Nazis made little attempt to exploit dissatisfaction with Stalinist policies. Instead, the Nazis preserved the collective-farm system, carried out [[Mass graves in the Soviet Union|genocidal policies]] against [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Jews]], [[OST-Arbeiter|deported millions of people to work in Germany]], and began a depopulation programme to prepare for German colonisation.

Although the majority of Ukrainians fought in or alongside the Red Army and [[Soviet partisans|Soviet resistance]], in Western Ukraine an independent [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] movement arose (UPA, 1942). It was created as the armed forces of the underground [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists]] (OUN). Both organisations, the OUN and the UPA, supported the goal of an [[Declaration of Ukrainian Independence, 1941|independent Ukrainian state]] on the territory with a Ukrainian ethnic majority. Although this brought conflict with Nazi Germany, at times the [[Melnykites|Melnyk wing of the OUN]] allied with the Nazi forces. From mid-1943 until the end of the war, the UPA carried out [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia|massacres of ethnic Poles]] in the Volhynia and [[Eastern Galicia]] regions, killing around 100,000 Polish civilians, which brought reprisals. These organised massacres were an attempt by the OUN to create a homogeneous Ukrainian state without a Polish minority living within its borders, and to prevent the post-war Polish state from asserting its sovereignty over areas that had been part of pre-war Poland. After the war, the UPA continued to fight the USSR until the 1950s. At the same time, the [[Ukrainian Liberation Army]], another nationalist movement, fought alongside the Nazis.

[[File:Ruined Kiev in WWII.jpg|thumb|[[Kyiv]] suffered significant damage during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], and was occupied by the [[Wehrmacht|Germans]] from 19 September 1941 until 6 November 1943]]

In total, the number of ethnic Ukrainians who fought in the ranks of the Soviet Army is estimated from 4.5&nbsp;million{{Efn|name=fn1|These figures are likely to be much higher, as they do not include Ukrainians of other nationalities or Ukrainian Jews, but only [[ethnic]] Ukrainians, from the Ukrainian SSR.}} half of the [[Soviet Partisans|Pro-Soviet partisan]] guerrilla resistance units, which counted up to 500,000 troops in 1944, were also Ukrainian. Generally, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army's figures are unreliable, with figures ranging anywhere from 15,000 to as many as 100,000 fighters.

The vast majority of the fighting in World War II took place on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. The [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|total losses]] inflicted upon the Ukrainian population during the war are estimated at 6 million, including an estimated one and a half million Jews killed by the [[Einsatzgruppen]], sometimes with the help of local collaborators. Of the estimated 8.6 million Soviet troop losses, 1.4&nbsp;million were ethnic [[Ukrainians]].

=== Post–war Soviet Ukraine ===

The republic was heavily damaged by the war, and it required significant efforts to recover. More than 700 cities and towns and 28,000 villages were destroyed. The situation was worsened by a [[famine]] in 1946–1947, which was caused by a drought and the wartime destruction of infrastructure, killing at least tens of thousands of people. part of a special agreement at the [[Yalta Conference]], and, alongside Belarus, had voting rights in the UN even though they were not independent. Moreover, Ukraine once more expanded its borders as it annexed [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]], and the population became much more homogenised due to post-war population transfers, most of which, as in the case of [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950)|Germans]] and [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatars]], were forced. As of 1 January 1953, Ukrainians were second only to Russians among adult "[[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|special deportees]]", comprising 20% of the total.

Following the death of Stalin in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became the new leader of the USSR, who began the policies of [[De-Stalinization|de-stalinisation]] and the [[Khrushchev Thaw]]. During his term as head of the Soviet Union, [[Crimean Oblast|Crimea]] was [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] from the [[Russian SFSR]] to the [[Ukrainian SSR]], formally as a friendship gift to Ukraine and for economic reasons. This represented the final extension of Ukrainian territory and formed the basis for the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine to this day. Many top positions in the Soviet Union were occupied by Ukrainians, including notably [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] from 1964 to 1982. However, it was he and his [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|appointee in Ukraine]], [[Volodymyr Shcherbytsky]], who presided over the extensive [[Russification of Ukraine|Russification]] of Ukraine and who were instrumental in repressing a new generation of Ukrainian intellectuals known as the [[Sixtiers]].

By 1950, the republic had fully surpassed pre-war levels of industry and production. Soviet Ukraine soon became a European leader in industrial production and an important centre of the Soviet [[arms industry]] and high-tech research, though heavy industry still had an outsided influence. The Soviet government invested in hydroelectric and nuclear power projects to cater to the energy demand that the development carried. On 26 April 1986, however, a reactor in the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] exploded, resulting in the [[Chernobyl disaster]], the worst [[nuclear reactor]] accident in history.

[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] pursued a policy of limited liberalisation of public life, known as ''[[perestroika]],'' and attempted to reform a [[Era of Stagnation|stagnating economy]]. The latter failed, but the democratisation of the Soviet Union fuelled nationalist and separatist tendencies among the ethnic minorities, including Ukrainians. As part of the so-called [[parade of sovereignties]], on 16 July 1990, the newly elected [[Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] adopted the [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine]]. It was approved by 92% of the Ukrainian electorate in a [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|referendum]] on 1 December. Ukraine's new [[President of Ukraine|President]], Leonid Kravchuk, went on to sign the [[Belavezha Accords]] and made Ukraine a founding member of the much looser [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS), though Ukraine never became a full member of the latter as it did not ratify the agreement founding CIS. These documents sealed the fate of the Soviet Union, which formally voted itself out of existence on 26 December.

Ukraine was initially viewed as having favourable economic conditions in comparison to the other regions of the Soviet Union, though it was one of the poorer Soviet republics by the time of the dissolution. However, during its transition to the market economy, the country experienced deeper economic slowdown than almost all of the other [[former Soviet Republics]]. During the recession, between 1991 and 1999, Ukraine lost 60% of its GDP and suffered from [[hyperinflation]] that peaked at 10,000% in 1993. The situation only stabilised well after the new currency, the [[hryvnia]], fell sharply in late 1998 partially as a fallout from the [[Russian debt default]] earlier that year. The legacy of the economic policies of the nineties was the mass privatisation of state property that created a class of extremely powerful and rich individuals known as the [[Ukrainian oligarch|oligarchs]]. and finally, the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|full-scale invasion]] by Russia in starting from 24 February 2022. Ukraine's economy in general underperformed since the time independence came due to pervasive [[Corruption in Ukraine|corruption]] and mismanagement, which, particularly in the 1990s, led to protests and organised strikes. The war with Russia impeded meaningful economic recovery in the 2010s, while efforts to combat the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine|COVID-19 pandemic]], which arrived in 2020, were made much harder by [[COVID-19 vaccine|low vaccination rates]] and, later in the pandemic, by the ongoing invasion.

[[File:Euromaidan Kyiv 1-12-13 by Gnatoush 009.jpg|thumb|[[Euromaidan]] protest in Kyiv, December 2013]]
From the political perspective, one of the defining features of the [[politics of Ukraine]] is that for most of the time, it has been divided along two issues: the relation between Ukraine, the [[Western world|West]] and Russia, and the classical [[Left–right political spectrum|left-right]] divide. The first two presidents, Kravchuk and [[Leonid Kuchma]], tended to balance the competing visions of Ukraine, though [[Yushchenko]] and [[Yanukovych]] were generally pro-Western and pro-Russian, respectively. There were two major protests against Yanukovych: the [[Orange Revolution]] in 2004, when tens of thousands of people went in protest of [[election rigging]] in his favour (Yushchenko was eventually elected president), and another one in the winter of 2013/2014, when more gathered on the [[Euromaidan]] to oppose Yanukovych's refusal to sign the [[European Union–Ukraine Association Agreement]]. By the end of the protests on 21 February 2014, he fled from Ukraine and was removed by the parliament in what is termed the [[Revolution of Dignity]], but Russia refused to recognise the interim pro-Western government, calling it a ''[[Military junta|junta]]'' and denouncing the events as a coup d'état sponsored by the United States.

Despite the signing of the [[Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances|Budapest memorandum]] in 1994, in which Ukraine agreed to hand over [[Ukraine and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons]] in exchange for guarantees of security and territorial integrity, Russia reacted violently to these developments and [[Russo-Ukrainian War|started a war]] against its western neighbour. In late February and early March 2014, it [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexed Crimea]] using its [[Russian Navy|Navy]] in [[Sevastopol Naval Base|Sevastopol]] as well as the so- called [[Little green men (Russo-Ukrainian War)|little green men]]; after this succeeded, it then launched a [[War in Donbas (2014–2022)|proxy war in the Donbas]] via the breakaway [[Donetsk People's Republic]] and [[Luhansk People's Republic]]. The first months of the conflict with the Russian-backed separatists were fluid, but Russian forces then started an open invasion in Donbas on 24 August 2014. Together they pushed back Ukrainian troops to the frontline established in February 2015, i.e. after Ukrainian troops [[Battle of Debaltseve|withdrew from Debaltseve]]. The conflict remained in a sort of [[Frozen conflict|frozen state]] until the early hours of 24 February 2022, when Russia [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|invaded]]. A year later, Russian troops controlled about 17% of Ukraine's internationally recognised territory, which constitutes 94% of [[Luhansk Oblast]], 73% of [[Kherson Oblast]], 72% of [[Zaporizhzhia Oblast]], 54% of [[Donetsk Oblast]] and all of Crimea, though Russia failed with its initial plan, with Ukrainian troops recapturing some territory in counteroffensives.

The military conflict with Russia shifted the government's policy towards the West. Shortly after Yanukovych fled Ukraine, the country signed the EU association agreement in June 2014, and its citizens were granted visa-free travel to the European Union three years later. In January 2019, the [[Orthodox Church of Ukraine]] was recognised as independent of Moscow, which reversed the 1686 decision of the patriarch of Constantinople and dealt a further blow to Moscow's influence in Ukraine. Finally, amid a full-scale war with Russia, Ukraine was granted [[Potential enlargement of the European Union|candidate status]] to the European Union on 23 June 2022. A broad anti-corruption drive began in early 2023 with the resignations of several deputy ministers and regional heads during a reshuffle of the government.
