[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|left|The [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial possessions]] of [[British colonization of the Americas|Britain]] (the Thirteen Colonies in pink and others in purple), [[New France|France]] (in blue), and [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]] (in orange) in North America, 1750|upright=1.3]]

[[Christopher Columbus]] began exploring the [[Caribbean]] for Spain in 1492, leading to [[Spanish Empire|Spanish-speaking settlements and missions]] from what are now [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] to [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|New Mexico]] and [[Alta California|California]]. The first Spanish colony in the present-day continental United States was [[Spanish Florida]], chartered in 1513. After several settlements failed there due to hunger and disease, Spain's first permanent town, [[Saint Augustine, Florida|Saint Augustine]], was founded in 1565. 

France established its own settlements in [[French Florida]] in 1562, but they were either abandoned (Charlesfort, 1578) or destroyed by Spanish raids ([[Fort Caroline]], 1565). [[New France|Permanent French settlements]] were founded much later along the [[Great Lakes]] ([[Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit|Fort Detroit]], 1701), the [[Mississippi River]] (Saint Louis, 1764) and especially the [[Gulf of Mexico]] ([[New Orleans]], 1718). Early European colonies also included the thriving Dutch colony of [[New Nederland]] (settled 1626, present-day New York) and the small Swedish colony of [[New Sweden]] (settled 1638 in what became Delaware). [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonization]] of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] began with the [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia Colony]] (1607) and the [[Plymouth Colony]] (Massachusetts, 1620).

The [[Mayflower Compact]] in Massachusetts and the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]] established precedents for local representative [[self-governance]] and [[constitutionalism]] that would develop throughout the American colonies. While European settlers in what is now the United States experienced conflicts with Native Americans, they also engaged in trade, exchanging European tools for food and animal pelts.{{efn|From the late 15th century, the [[Columbian exchange]] had been catastrophic for native populations throughout the Americas. It is estimated [[Virgin soil epidemic|that up to 95 percent of the Indigenous populations]], especially in the Caribbean, [[Native American disease and epidemics|perished from infectious diseases during the years following European colonization]]; remaining populations were often displaced by European expansion.{{sfn|Joseph|2016 |page=590}}}} Relations ranged from close cooperation to warfare and massacres. The colonial authorities often pursued policies that forced Native Americans to adopt European lifestyles, including conversion to Christianity. Along the eastern seaboard, settlers [[Slavery in the colonial history of the United States|trafficked African slaves]] through the [[Atlantic slave trade]].

The original [[Thirteen Colonies]]{{efn|[[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Province of New Jersey|New Jersey]], [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware Colony|Delaware]], [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], [[Province of North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]]}} that would later found the United States were administered as possessions of the [[British Empire]] by Crown-appointed governors, though [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|local governments held elections open to most white male property owners]]. The colonial population grew rapidly from Maine to Georgia, eclipsing Native American populations; by the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas. The colonies' distance from Britain facilitated the entrenchment of self-governance, and the [[First Great Awakening]], a series of [[Christian revival]]s, fueled colonial interest in guaranteed [[Freedom of religion|religious liberty]].

===American Revolution and the early republic (1765&ndash;1800)===
{{Main|History of the United States (1776–1789)|History of the United States (1789–1815)|American Revolution|Founding Fathers of the United States}}
[[File:Declaration independence.jpg|alt=See caption|thumb|The ''[[Declaration of Independence (painting)|Declaration of Independence]]'' portrait depicts the 
[[Committee of Five]] presenting [[United States Declaration of Independence|the Declaration]] to the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] on June 28, 1776, in [[Philadelphia]].]]
Following their victory in the [[French and Indian War]], Britain began to assert greater control over local colonial affairs, resulting in [[American Revolution|colonial political resistance]]; one of the primary colonial grievances was a denial of their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]], particularly the right to [[No taxation without representation|representation in the British government that taxed them]]. To demonstrate their dissatisfaction and resolve, the [[First Continental Congress]] met in 1774 and passed the [[Continental Association]], a colonial boycott of British goods enforced by local "[[Committee of safety (American Revolution)|committees of safety]]" that proved effective. The British attempt to then disarm the colonists resulted in the 1775 [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], igniting the [[American Revolutionary War]]. At the [[Second Continental Congress]], the colonies appointed [[George Washington]] commander-in-chief of the [[Continental Army]], and created [[Committee of Five|a committee]] that named [[Thomas Jefferson]] to draft the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Two days after passing the [[Lee Resolution]] to create an independent nation the Declaration was adopted on July 4, 1776. The [[American Enlightenment|political values of the American Revolution]] included [[liberty]], [[Natural rights and legal rights|inalienable individual rights]]; and the [[Popular sovereignty|sovereignty of the people]]; supporting [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] and rejecting [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]], and all hereditary political power; [[civic virtue]]; and vilification of [[political corruption]]. The [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], who included Washington, Jefferson, [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Jay]], [[James Madison]], [[Thomas Paine]], and many others, were inspired by [[Classical republicanism#Classical antecedents|Classical]], [[Renaissance philosophy|Renaissance]], and [[Age of Enlightenment#Politics|Enlightenment]] philosophies and ideas.

Though in practical effect since its drafting in 1777, the [[Articles of Confederation]] was ratified in 1781 and formally established a decentralized government that operated until 1789. After the British surrender at the [[siege of Yorktown]] in 1781, American sovereignty was internationally recognized by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] (1783), through which the U.S. gained territory stretching west to the Mississippi River, north to present-day Canada, and south to [[Spanish Florida]]. The [[Northwest Ordinance]] (1787) established the precedent by which the country's territory would expand with the [[Admission to the Union|admission of new states]], rather than the expansion of existing states. 

The [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] was drafted at the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] to overcome the limitations of the Articles. It went into effect in 1789, creating a [[federal republic]] governed by [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|three separate branches]] that together formed a system of [[checks and balances]].{{sfn|Foner|2020|p=524}} George Washington [[1788–89 United States presidential election|was elected]] the country's first president under the Constitution, and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] was adopted in 1791 to allay skeptics' concerns about the power of the more centralized government.{{sfn|Foner|2020|pp=538-540}} [[George Washington's resignation as commander-in-chief|His resignation as commander-in-chief]] after the Revolutionary War and his later refusal to run for a third term as the country's first president established a precedent for the supremacy of civil authority in the United States and the [[Peaceful transition of power|peaceful transfer of power]].

===Westward expansion and Civil War (1800&ndash;1865)===
{{Main||History of the United States (1815–1849)|History of the United States (1849–1865)}}
[[File:U.S. Territorial Acquisitions.png|upright=1.3|thumb|[[Territorial evolution of the United States|Territorial expansion of the United States]]|alt=Historical territorial expansion of the United States]]
In the late 18th century, American settlers began to [[Territorial evolution of the United States|expand westward]] in larger numbers, many with a sense of [[manifest destiny]].{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=41–46}} The [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803 from France nearly doubled the territory of the United States. [[Origins of the War of 1812|Lingering issues with Britain remained]], leading to the [[War of 1812]], which was fought to a draw. [[Adams–Onís Treaty|Spain ceded Florida]] and its Gulf Coast territory in 1819.

The [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820, which admitted [[Missouri]] as a [[Slave states and free states|slave state]] and [[Maine#Statehood|Maine]] as a free state, attempted to balance the desire of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery into new territories with that of southern states to extend it there. Primarily, the compromise prohibited slavery in all other lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the [[parallel 36°30′ north|36°30′ parallel]].

As Americans expanded further into territory inhabited by Native Americans, the [[Federal Indian Policy|federal government implemented policies]] of [[Indian removal]] or [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilation]]. The most significant such legislation was the [[Indian Removal Act|Indian Removal Act of 1830]], a key policy of President [[Andrew Jackson]]. It resulted in the [[Trail of Tears]] (1830–1850), in which an estimated 60,000 Native Americans living east of the [[Mississippi River]] were forcibly removed and displaced to lands far to the west, causing 13,200 to 16,700 deaths along the forced march.{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=45}} Settler expansion as well as this influx of Indigenous peoples from the East resulted in the [[American Indian Wars]] west of the Mississippi.

During the colonial period, [[Slavery in the colonial history of the United States|slavery became legal in all the Thirteen colonies]], but by 1770 it provided the main labor force in the [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|large-scale]], [[Antebellum South#Economic structure|agriculture-dependent economies]] of the [[Southern Colonies]] from Maryland to Georgia. The practice began to be significantly questioned during the American Revolution, {{sfnm|1a1=Walker Howe|1y=2007|1p=52–54|2a1=Wright|2y=2022}} and spurred by an active [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist movement]] that had reemerged in the 1830s, states in [[Northern United States|the North]] enacted laws to prohibit slavery within their boundaries.{{sfnm|1a1=Walker Howe|1y=2007|1p=52–54|2a1=Rodriguez|2y=2015|2p=XXXIV|3a1=Wright|3y=2022}} At the same time, [[Pro-slavery ideology in the United States|support for slavery had strengthened in Southern states]], with widespread use of inventions such as the [[cotton gin]] (1793) having made slavery immensely profitable for [[Planter class|Southern elites]].{{sfn|Walker Howe|2007|p=478, 481–482, 587–588}} 

The United States [[Texas annexation|annexed the Republic of Texas]] in 1845, and the 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]] led to U.S. control of the present-day [[Northwestern United States|American Northwest]]. Dispute with Mexico over Texas led to the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846&ndash;1848). After the victory of the U.S., Mexico recognized U.S. sovereignty over Texas, [[New Mexico]], and [[California]] in the 1848 [[Mexican Cession]]; the cession's lands also included the future states of [[Nevada]], [[Colorado]] and [[Utah]]. The [[California gold rush]] of 1848–1849 spurred a huge migration of white settlers to the Pacific coast, leading to even more confrontations with Native populations. One of the most violent, the [[California genocide]] of thousands of Native inhabitants, lasted into the mid-1870s. Additional western territories and states were created.

[[File:US SlaveFree1858.gif|thumb|upright=1.3|left|[[Slave states and free states]] in 1858]]

Throughout the 1850s, the [[Slave states and free states|sectional conflict regarding slavery]] was further inflamed by national legislation in the U.S. Congress and decisions of the Supreme Court. In Congress, the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] mandated the forcible return to their owners in the South of slaves taking refuge in non-slave states, while the [[Kansas&ndash;Nebraska Act]] of 1854 effectively gutted the anti-slavery requirements of the Missouri Compromise. In its [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott decision]] of 1857, the Supreme Court ruled against a slave brought into non-slave territory, simultaneously declaring the entire Missouri Compromise to be unconstitutional. These and other [[Origins of the American Civil War|events exacerbated tensions between North and South]] that would culminate in the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865).

Beginning with [[South Carolina]], 11 slave-state governments voted to [[Secession in the United States|secede from the United States]] in 1861, joining to create the [[Confederate States of America]]. All other state governments remained loyal to [[Union (American Civil War)|the Union]].{{efn|The Confederate States of America was formed by the following states, each state government of which formally declared its [[Secession in the United States|secession]] from the United States: [[South Carolina in the American Civil War|South Carolina]], [[Mississippi in the American Civil War|Mississippi]], [[Florida in the American Civil War|Florida]], [[Alabama in the American Civil War|Alabama]], [[Georgia in the American Civil War|Georgia]], [[Louisiana in the American Civil War|Louisiana]], [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]], [[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]], [[Arkansas in the American Civil War|Arkansas]], [[Tennessee in the American Civil War|Tennessee]], and [[North Carolina in the American Civil War|North Carolina]].}}{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|p=236}} War broke out in April 1861 after the Confederacy [[Battle of Fort Sumter|bombarded Fort Sumter]].{{Sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=273–274}} Following the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on January 1, 1863, many freed slaves joined the [[Union army]]. The war [[Turning point of the American Civil War|began to turn in the Union's favor]] following the 1863 [[Siege of Vicksburg]] and [[Battle of Gettysburg]], and the Confederates surrendered in 1865 after the Union's victory in the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House]].

=== Reconstruction, Gilded Age, and Progressive Era (1863&ndash;1917) ===
{{Main|History of the United States (1865–1917)}}
[[File:Emigrants (i.e. immigrants) landing at Ellis Island -.webm|thumb|An [[Edison Studios]] film showing immigrants arriving at [[Ellis Island]] in [[New York Harbor]], a major point of entry for European [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries]]

Efforts toward [[Reconstruction era|reconstruction in the secessionist South]] had begun as early as 1862,{{sfn|Dubois|1935|p=163}} but it was only after [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln's assassination]] that the three [[Reconstruction Amendments]] to the Constitution were ratified [[Civil rights movement (1865–1896)|to protect civil rights]]. The amendments codified nationally the abolition of slavery and involuntary servitude except as punishment for crimes, promised equal protection under the law for all persons, and prohibited discrimination on the basis of race or previous enslavement.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=66-7, 251-261, 446-449}} As a result, African Americans took an active political role in ex-Confederate states in the decade following the Civil War.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=xxv}}{{sfn|Dubois|1935|p=381-727}} The former Confederate states were readmitted to the Union, beginning with Tennessee in 1866 and ending with Georgia in 1870.

National infrastructure, including [[First transcontinental telegraph|transcontinental telegraph]] and [[First transcontinental railroad|railroads]], spurred growth in the [[American frontier]]. This was accelerated by the [[Homestead Acts]], through which nearly 10 percent of the total land area of the United States was given away free to some 1.6 million homesteaders. From 1865 through 1917, an unprecedented stream of [[immigrants]] arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe. Most came through the [[Port of New York and New Jersey|Port of New York]], and New York City and other large cities on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] became home to large [[History of the Jews in the United States|Jewish]], [[Irish Americans|Irish]], and [[Italian Americans|Italian]] populations. Many [[Northern Europe|Northern Europeans]] as well as significant numbers of [[German Americans|Germans]] and other [[Central Europe|Central Europeans]] moved to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. At the same time, about one million [[French-Canadian Americans|French Canadians]] migrated from [[Quebec]] to [[New England]]. During the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], millions of African Americans [[Jim Crow economy|left the rural South]] for urban areas in the North. [[Alaska Purchase|Alaska was purchased]] from [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1867.

The [[Compromise of 1877]] is generally considered the end of the Reconstruction era, as it resolved the electoral crisis following the [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]] and led President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] to reduce the role of federal troops in the South.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=xxvii, 575-587}} Immediately, the [[Redeemers]] began evicting the [[Carpetbaggers]] and quickly regained local control of Southern politics in the name of [[white supremacy]]. African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the [[nadir of American race relations]]. A series of Supreme Court decisions, including ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', emptied the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]s of their force, allowing [[Jim Crow laws]] in the South to remain unchecked, [[sundown town]]s in the Midwest, and [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation in communities across the country]], which would be reinforced by the policy of [[redlining]] later adopted by the federal [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]].

[[Second Industrial Revolution|An explosion of technological advancement]] accompanied by the exploitation of cheap immigrant labor led to [[Gilded Age|rapid economic expansion during the late 19th and early 20th centuries]], allowing the United States to outpace the economies of England, France, and Germany combined. This fostered the amassing of power by [[Robber baron (industrialist)|a few prominent industrialists]], largely by their formation of [[Trust (business)|trusts]] and [[Monopoly|monopolies]] to prevent competition. [[Tycoon]]s led the nation's expansion in the [[History of rail transportation in the United States|railroad]], [[History of the petroleum industry in the United States|petroleum]], and [[History of the steel industry (1850–1970)|steel]] industries. The United States emerged as a pioneer of the [[Automotive industry in the United States|automotive industry]]. These changes resulted in significant increases in [[economic inequality]], [[How the Other Half Lives|slum conditions]], and [[List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States|social unrest]], creating the environment for [[Labor history of the United States|labor unions]] and [[History of the socialist movement in the United States|socialist movements]] to begin to flourish. This period eventually ended with the advent of the [[Progressive Era]], which was characterized by significant reforms.

Pro-American elements in Hawaii [[Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom|overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy]]; the islands [[Newlands Resolution|were annexed]] in 1898. That same year, [[Puerto Rico]], [[the Philippines]], and [[Guam]] were ceded to the U.S. by Spain after the latter's defeat in the [[Spanish–American War]]. (The Philippines was granted full independence from the U.S. on July 4, 1946, following World War II. Puerto Rico and Guam have remained U.S. territories.) [[American Samoa]] was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the [[Second Samoan Civil War]]. The [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]] were purchased from [[Denmark]] in 1917.

The United States [[American entry into World War I|entered World War I]] alongside the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in 1917 helping to turn the tide against the [[Central Powers]]. In 1920, [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|a constitutional amendment]] granted nationwide [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]]. During the 1920s and 1930s, radio for [[mass communication]] and early television transformed communications nationwide.{{sfn|Winchester|2013|pp=410–411}} The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] triggered the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], to which President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] responded with the [[New Deal]] plan of "reform, recovery and relief", a series of unprecedented and sweeping [[Alphabet agencies|recovery programs]] and [[Works Progress Administration|employment relief projects]] combined with [[Regulatory economics|financial reforms and regulations]].

[[United States non-interventionism before entering World War II|Initially neutral]] during [[Military history of the United States during World War II|World War II]], the U.S. began [[Lend-Lease|supplying war materiel]] to the [[Allies of World War II]] in March 1941 and [[American entry into World War II|entered the war]] in December after [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The U.S. [[Manhattan Project|developed the first nuclear weapons]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|used them against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in August 1945, ending the war. The United States was one of the "[[Four Policemen]]" who met to plan the [[Aftermath of World War II|post-war world]], alongside the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]].{{sfn|Hoopes|Brinkley|1997|p=100}}{{sfn|Gaddis|1972|p=25}} The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater [[economic power]] and [[Sphere of influence|international political influence]].

The end of [[World War II]] in 1945 left the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union]] as [[superpower]]s, each with its own political, military, and economic [[sphere of influence]]. Geopolitical tensions between the two superpowers soon led to the [[Cold War]]. The U.S. utilized the policy of [[containment]] to limit the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, engaged in [[United States involvement in regime change#1945–1991: Cold War|regime change]] against governments perceived to be aligned with the Soviets, and prevailed in the [[Space Race]], which culminated with the [[Apollo 11|first crewed Moon landing]] in 1969.

Domestically, the U.S. [[Post–World War II economic expansion|experienced economic growth]], [[Urbanization in the United States|urbanization]], and [[Mid-20th century baby boom|population growth following World War II]].{{sfn|Winchester|2013|pp=305–308}} The [[civil rights movement]] emerged, with [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s. The [[Great Society]] plan of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s administration resulted in groundbreaking and broad-reaching laws, policies and [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|a constitutional amendment]] to counteract some of the worst effects of lingering [[institutional racism]].

The [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture movement]] in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes toward [[recreational drug use]] and [[Sexual revolution|sexuality]]. It also encouraged [[Draft evasion in the Vietnam War|open defiance of the military draft]] (leading to the [[Conscription in the United States|end of conscription]] in 1973) and [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|wide opposition]] to [[United States in the Vietnam War|U.S. intervention in Vietnam]], with the U.S. totally withdrawing in 1975. [[Women's liberation movement in the United States|A societal shift in the roles of women]] was significantly responsible for the large increase in female paid labor participation during the 1970s, and by 1985 the majority of American women aged 16 and older were employed.

The [[Revolutions of 1989|Fall of Communism]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] from 1989 to 1991 marked the [[end of the Cold War]] and [[Superpower#After the Cold War|left the United States as the world's sole superpower]]. This cemented the United States' global influence, reinforcing the concept of the "[[American Century]]" as the U.S. dominated international political, cultural, economic, and military affairs.

The [[Human Genome Project]] was formally launched in 1990, while [[Nasdaq]] became the first stock market in the United States to trade online in 1998.
 
In the [[Gulf War]] of 1991, [[Coalition of the Gulf War|an American-led international coalition of states]] expelled an [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraqi]] invasion force that had occupied neighboring [[Kuwait]]. The [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States in 2001 by the [[Pan-Islamism|pan-Islamist]] militant organization [[al-Qaeda]] led to the [[war on terror]] and subsequent [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)|military interventions in Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|in Iraq]].
