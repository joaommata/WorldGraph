Sweden's prehistory begins in the [[Allerød oscillation]], a warm period around 12,000 BC, with Late [[Palaeolithic]] [[reindeer]]-hunting camps of the [[Bromme culture]] at the edge of the ice in what is now the country's southernmost province, [[Scania]]. This period was characterised by small clans of [[hunter-gatherer]]s who relied on [[flint]] technology.

Sweden and its people were first described by the Roman historian [[Publius Cornelius Tacitus]] in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' (98 AD). In [[s:Germania#XLIV|''Germania'' 44 and 45]] he mentions the Swedes (''Suiones'') as a powerful tribe with ships that had a [[prow]] at each end ([[longship]]s). Which kings ({{Lang|gem-x-proto|kuningaz}}) ruled these Suiones is unknown, but [[Norse mythology]] presents a long line of legendary and semi-legendary kings going back to the last centuries BC. The [[Runes|runic script]] was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the second century AD, but all that has survived from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke [[Proto-Norse]] at the time, a language ancestral to Swedish and other [[North Germanic languages]].

In the sixth century, the Byzantine historian [[Jordanes]] names two tribes living in [[Scandza]], both of which are now considered to be synonymous with the Swedes: the {{Lang|la|Suetidi}} and {{Lang|la|Suehans}}. The {{Lang|la|Suehans}} were known to the Roman world as suppliers of black fox skins and, according to Jordanes, had very fine horses, similar to those of the ''[[Thuringians|Thyringi]]'' of {{Lang|la|Germania}} ("{{Lang|la|alia vero gens ibi moratur Suehans, quae velud Thyringi equis utuntur eximiis}}").

===Viking Age===
{{See also|Early Swedish history|Consolidation of Sweden|Varangians}}
[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|upright=1.3|thumb|left|[[Viking]] expeditions (blue lines)]]

The Swedish [[Viking Age]] lasted roughly from the eighth century to the 11th century. It is believed that Swedish Vikings and [[Gutes|Gutar]] mainly travelled east and south, going to Finland, Estonia, the [[Baltic countries]], Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, the [[Black Sea]] and even as far as [[Baghdad]]. Their routes passed [[The Trade Route from the Varangians to the Greeks|through the Dnieper]] south to [[Constantinople]], on which they carried out numerous raids. The [[Byzantine Emperor|Byzantine emperor]] [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] noticed their great skills in war and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard, known as the [[Varangian Guard]]. The Swedish Vikings, called [[Rus (people)|Rus]], are believed to be the founders of [[Kievan Rus']]. The Vikings were described by many outside sources, such as the Arab traveler [[Ibn Fadlan]]. The actions of these [[Vikings|Swedish Vikings]] are commemorated on many [[runestone]]s in Sweden, such as the [[Greece runestones]] and the [[Varangian runestones]]. There was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards, which are commemorated on stones such as the [[England runestones]]. The last major Swedish Viking expedition appears to have been the ill-fated expedition of [[Ingvar the Far-Travelled]] to [[Serkland]], the region south-east of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Its members are commemorated on the [[Ingvar runestones]], none of which mentions any survivor.

During the early stages of the Viking Age, a centre of trade in [[Northern Europe]] developed at [[Birka]] on the island of [[Björkö, Ekerö|Björkö]], not far from where Stockholm was later constructed, in mid-latitude Sweden. Birka was founded around 750 AD as a trading port by a king or merchants trying to control trade. Birka was the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] link in the [[Dnieper trade route]] through [[Staraya Ladoga|Ladoga]] (''Aldeigja'') and [[Novgorod Land|Novgorod]] (''Holmsgard'') to the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. It was abandoned around 975, at about the same time [[Sigtuna]] was founded as a town some 35&nbsp;km to the northeast. It has been estimated that the population in Viking Age Birka was between 500 and 1000 people.

===Kingdom of Sweden===
[[File:Map of Sweden ca 1280.png|thumb|right|A rough map of the extent of Swedish rule, {{circa|1280}}]]
The exact age of the kingdom of Sweden is unknown. Determining its age depends mostly on whether Sweden is considered a nation when the {{Lang|sv|[[Svear]]}} (Swedes) ruled Svealand or when the {{Lang|sv|Svear}} and the {{Lang|sv|[[Götar]]}} (Geats) of Götaland were united under a single ruler. Svealand was described by [[Tacitus]] in 98 AD as being under a single ruler, though it is unknown how long this had been the case. The epic poem ''Beowulf'' describes semi-legendary [[Swedish-Geatish wars]] in the sixth century.

However, historians typically start the line of [[Swedish monarchs]] from when Svealand and Götaland were ruled under the same king, namely [[Erik the Victorious]] and his son [[Olof Skötkonung]] in the tenth century. These events are often described as the [[consolidation of Sweden]], although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later. In this context, "Götaland" primarily refers to the provinces of [[Östergötland]] and [[Västergötland]]. [[Småland]] was of little interest at the time due to its deep pine forests, with only the city of [[Kalmar]] and its castle holding any significant importance. There were also Swedish settlements along the southern coastline of [[Norrland]], one of the four [[lands of Sweden]].

[[Ansgar|Saint Ansgar]] is traditionally credited with introducing Christianity to Sweden in 829, but the new religion did not begin to fully replace [[paganism]] until the 12th century. During that century, Sweden was undergoing dynastic struggles between the [[House of Eric|Erik]] and [[House of Sverker|Sverker]] clans. The conflict ended when a third clan married into the Erik clan, founding the [[House of Bjälbo|Bjälbo]] dynasty, which gradually consolidated Sweden into a stronger state. According to the ''Legend of [[Saint Erik]]'' and the ''[[Erik's Chronicle]]'', Swedish kings conducted [[Swedish Crusades (disambiguation)|a series of Crusades]] to pagan Finland and started conflicts with the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']], who by then had no further connections with Sweden. As a result of the Crusades, mostly with the Second Swedish Crusade led by [[Birger Jarl]] Finland gradually became part of the kingdom of Sweden and the sphere of influence of the [[Catholic Church]]. The Swedes built fortresses in [[Häme|Tavastland]] and [[Åbo]], while a Swedish royal council was instituted, an administrative structure and fiscal apparatus was created, and law codes were codified during the reigns of [[Magnus Ladulås]] (1275–1290) and [[Magnus Eriksson]] (1319–1364). As a result, the Finnish lands were firmly integrated into the Swedish realm.

Except for the provinces of Scania, Blekinge, and Halland in the southwest of the Scandinavian peninsula, which were part of the Kingdom of Denmark during this period, [[feudalism]] never developed in Sweden as it did in much of Europe. As a result, the peasantry remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of Swedish history. [[Slavery]], also known as [[thrall]]dom, was not common in Sweden, and the institution gradually diminished due to the spread of Christianity, the difficulty of obtaining slaves from lands east of the Baltic Sea, and by the development of cities before the 16th century. Indeed, both slavery and [[serfdom]] were abolished altogether by a decree of King [[Magnus Eriksson]] in 1335. Sweden remained a poor and economically underdeveloped country, where barter was the primary means of exchange.

In 1319, Sweden and Norway were united in a [[personal union]] under King Magnus Eriksson, the grandson of King [[Magnus Ladulås]] of Sweden and of King [[Haakon V of Norway|Haakon V]] of Norway. Magnus Eriksson also ruled Scania from 1332 to 1360. In the mid-14th century, Sweden was struck by the [[Black Death]]. The population of Sweden and most of Europe was decimated. The population did not reach its pre-1348 levels until the beginning of the 19th century, with one third of the population dying between 1349 and 1351. During this period, the cities began to acquire greater rights and were heavily influenced by German merchants of the [[Hanseatic League]], active especially at [[Visby]]. In 1397, Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark]] (the former daughter-in-law of Magnus Eriksson) established the personal union of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark through the [[Kalmar Union]]. However, Margaret's successors, whose rule was centred in Denmark, were unable to control the Swedish nobility.

[[File:Gustav Vasa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav I]] [[Swedish War of Liberation|liberated]] Sweden from [[Christian II of Denmark]], ending the [[Kalmar Union]]. He established the [[House of Vasa]] which ruled Sweden and Poland until the 17th century.]]

In 1520, King [[Christian II of Denmark]], who attempted to restore the Union of Kalmar through military force, ordered the massacre of Swedish nobles in Stockholm, an event known as the "[[Stockholm Bloodbath]]." This atrocity incited the Swedish nobility to renew their resistance, and on 6 June 1523 (now celebrated as [[National Day of Sweden|Sweden's National Day]]), they made [[Gustav Vasa]] their king. This is sometimes considered as the [[foundation of modern Sweden]]. Shortly afterwards the new king rejected Catholicism and led Sweden into the [[Protestant Reformation]]. During the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Riksdag assemblies]] of 1527 and 1544, under King Gustav Vasa, representatives of all four [[estates of the realm]] (clergy, [[Swedish nobility|nobility]], [[Bourgeoisie|townsmen]] and [[peasant]]s) were called on to participate for the first time. When Gustav Vasa broke the monopoly power of the [[Hanseatic League]], he was regarded as a hero by the Swedish people. Furthermore, when Sweden became more developed, after breaking the trade monopoly of the Hanseatic League, and entered its golden age, the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that a greater share of the economic benefits went to them rather than to a feudal landowning class.

The end of the 16th century was marked by a final phase of rivalry between the remaining Catholics and the new Protestant communities. In 1592, Gustav Vasa's Catholic grandson and [[king of Poland]], [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund]], ascended the Swedish throne. He pursued to strengthen [[Holy See|Rome]]'s influence by initiating [[Counter-Reformation]] and created a dual monarchy that temporarily became known as the [[Polish-Swedish Union]]. His despotic rule, strongly characterised by intolerance towards the Protestants, sparked a [[War against Sigismund|civil war]] that plunged Sweden into poverty. In opposition, Sigismund's uncle and successor, [[Charles IX of Sweden|Charles Vasa]], summoned the [[Uppsala Synod]] in 1593 which officially confirmed the modern [[Church of Sweden]] as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]. Following his [[deposition (politics)|deposition]] in 1599, Sigismund attempted to reclaim the throne sparing no expense, and hostilities between [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] and Sweden continued for the next hundred years.

===Swedish Empire===

[[File:Swedish Empire.svg|thumb|The [[Swedish Empire]] between 1560 and 1815; its peak was between 1658 and 1660]]
Sweden rose to prominence on a continental scale during the reign of king [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]], seizing territories from [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]] and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in multiple conflicts.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=102}} During the Thirty Years' War, Sweden conquered approximately half of the Holy Roman states and defeated the Imperial army at the [[Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)|Battle of Breitenfeld]] in 1631.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=103}} Gustavus Adolphus planned to become the new [[Holy Roman Emperor]], ruling over a united Scandinavia and the Holy Roman states, but he was killed at the [[Battle of Lützen (1632)|Battle of Lützen]] in 1632. After the [[Battle of Nördlingen (1634)|Battle of Nördlingen]] in 1634 – Sweden's only significant military defeat of the war – pro-Swedish sentiment among the German states faded.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=103}} These German provinces broke away from Swedish power one by one, leaving Sweden with only a few northern German territories: [[Swedish Pomerania]], [[Bremen-Verden]] and [[Wismar]]. From 1643 to 1645, during the last years of the war, Sweden and [[Denmark-Norway]] fought the [[Torstenson War]]. The result of that conflict and the conclusion of the Thirty Years' War helped establish postwar Sweden as a major force in Europe.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=103}} The [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 granted Sweden territories in northern Germany.

In the middle of the 17th century, Sweden was the third-largest country in Europe by land area. Sweden reached its largest territorial extent under the rule of [[Charles X of Sweden|Charles X]] after the [[treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658, following Charles X's [[March Across the Belts|crossing of the Danish Belts]]. The foundation of Sweden's success during this period is credited to Gustav I's major changes to the [[Economy of Sweden|Swedish economy]] in the 16th century, and his introduction of [[Protestantism]]. One-third of the Finnish population died in the devastating [[Great Famine of 1695–1697]] that struck the country. Famine also hit Sweden, killing roughly 10% of Sweden's population.

In the 17th century, Sweden was engaged in many wars, for example with Poland–Lithuania, with both sides competing for territories of today's [[Baltic states]]. The Polish–Swedish War (1626–1629) ended with a ceasefire in [[Stary Targ]] ([[Truce of Altmark]]) on 26 September 1629 that was in favour of the Swedes, to whom Poland ceded the larger part of [[Livonia]] together with its important port of [[Riga]]. The Swedes also gained the right to tax Poland’s Baltic trade (3.5% on the value of goods), and kept control of several cities in [[Royal Prussia]] and [[Ducal Prussia]] (including [[Pillau]] (Baltiysk), [[Klaipėda|Memel]] (Klaipėda) and [[Elbing]] (Elbląg)). The Swedes later conducted a series of invasions into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, known as the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]].{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=156}} After more than half a century of almost constant warfare, the Swedish economy had deteriorated. It became the lifetime task of Charles X's son, [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]], to rebuild the economy and refit the army.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=216}} His legacy to his son, the coming ruler of Sweden, [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]], was one of the finest arsenals in the world, a large standing army and a great fleet.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=222}} Russia, the most serious threat to Sweden at this time, had a larger army but lagged far behind in both equipment and training.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=232}}

After the [[Battle of Narva (1700)|Battle of Narva]] in 1700, one of the first battles of the [[Great Northern War]], the Russian army was so severely devastated that Sweden had an open chance to invade Russia.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=230}} However, Charles XII did not pursue the Russian army, instead [[Swedish invasion of Poland (1701–1706)|turning against Poland]] and defeating the Polish king, [[Augustus II the Strong]], and his Saxon allies at the [[Battle of Kliszów]] in 1702.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=272}} This gave Russia time to rebuild and modernise its army.

[[File:Marten's Poltava.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709. In the following years, Russia and her allies occupied all [[Dominions of Sweden|Swedish dominions]] on the Baltic coast and even Finland.]]

After the success of invading Poland, Charles XII decided to make an attempt at [[Swedish invasion of Russia|invading Russia]], but this ended in a decisive Russian victory at the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=290}} After a long march exposed to [[Cossack]] raids, the Russian Tsar [[Peter the Great]]'s [[scorched-earth]] techniques and [[Great Frost of 1709|the extremely cold winter of 1709]], the Swedes stood weakened with a shattered morale and were enormously outnumbered against the Russian army at Poltava.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=286}} The defeat meant the beginning of the end for the Swedish Empire. In addition, [[The plague during the Great Northern War|the plague raging in East Central Europe]] devastated the [[Swedish dominions]] and reached Central Sweden in 1710. Returning to Sweden in 1715, Charles XII launched [[Great Northern War and Norway|two campaigns against Norway]] in 1716 and 1718, respectively. During the second attempt, he was shot to death during the [[siege of Fredriksten]] fortress.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=295}} The Swedes were not militarily defeated at Fredriksten, but the whole structure and organisation of the campaign fell apart with the king's death. Forced to cede large areas of land in the [[Treaty of Nystad]] in 1721, Sweden also lost its place as an empire and as the dominant state on the Baltic Sea.{{sfn|Frost|2000|p=296}} With Sweden's lost influence, Russia emerged as an empire and became one of [[European balance of power|Europe's dominant nations]]. As the war finally ended in 1721, Sweden had lost an estimated 200,000 men, 150,000 of those from the area of present-day Sweden and 50,000 from the [[Finland under Swedish rule|Finnish part of Sweden]].
Executive power was historically shared between the King and an aristocratic [[Privy council]] until 1680, followed by the King's [[autocracy|autocratic rule]] initiated by the commoner estates of the [[Riksdag]]. As a reaction to the failed Great Northern War, a parliamentary system was introduced in 1719, followed by three different flavours of constitutional monarchy in 1772, 1789 and 1809, [[Swedish constitution of 1809|the latter]] granting several civil liberties. Already during the first of those three periods, the 'Era of Liberty' (1719–72) the Swedish Riksdag had developed into a very active parliament, and this tradition continued into the nineteenth century, laying the basis for the transition towards modern democracy at the end of that century.
In the 18th century, Sweden did not have enough resources to maintain its territories outside Scandinavia, and most of them were lost, culminating with [[Finnish War|the loss in 1809]] of eastern Sweden to Russia, which became the highly autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Principality of Finland]] in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]].

In interest of re-establishing Swedish dominance in the Baltic Sea, Sweden allied itself against its traditional ally and benefactor, France, in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. However, in 1810, a French Marshal, [[Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]], was chosen as heir presumptive to [[Charles XIII]]; in 1818, he established the [[House of Bernadotte]], taking the [[regnal name]] of Charles XIV. Sweden's role in the [[Battle of Leipzig]] gave it the authority to force Denmark–Norway, an ally of France, to cede Norway to the King of Sweden on 14 January 1814 in exchange for the northern German provinces, at the [[Treaty of Kiel]]. The Norwegian attempts to keep their status as a sovereign state were rejected by the Swedish king, [[Charles XIII]]. He launched a [[Swedish–Norwegian War (1814)|military campaign against Norway]] on 27 July 1814, ending in the [[Convention of Moss]], which forced Norway into a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union]] with Sweden under the Swedish crown, which lasted until 1905. The 1814 campaign was the last time Sweden was at war.

[[File:Farewell_to_home,_Göteborg,_1905_(cropped).jpg|thumb|Swedish emigrants boarding a ship in [[Gothenburg]] in 1905]]
The [[Swedish East India Company]] began in 1731. The obvious choice of home port was [[Gothenburg]] ({{langx|sv|Göteborg}}) at Sweden's west coast, as the mouth of [[Göta älv|Göta älv river]] was very wide and had the county's largest and best harbour for high-seas journeys. The trade continued into the 19th century, and caused the little town to become Sweden's second city.
Between 1750 and 1850, the population in Sweden doubled. According to some scholars, mass emigration to America became the only way to prevent famine and rebellion; over 1% of the population emigrated annually during the 1880s. It is thought that between 1850 and 1910 more than one million [[Swedish emigration to the United States|Swedes moved to the United States]]. Nevertheless, Sweden remained poor, retaining a nearly entirely agricultural economy even as Western European countries began to industrialise.

Despite the slow rate of industrialisation into the 19th century, many important changes were taking place in the agrarian economy due to constant innovations and a rapid population growth. These innovations included government-sponsored programmes of [[enclosure]], aggressive exploitation of agricultural lands, and the introduction of new crops such as the potato. Between 1870 and 1914, Sweden began developing the industrialised economy that exists today.

Strong grassroots movements sprang up in Sweden during the latter half of the 19th century (trade unions, [[temperance movement|temperance]] groups, and independent religious groups), creating a strong foundation of democratic principles. These movements precipitated Sweden's migration into a modern parliamentary democracy, achieved by the time of World War I. As the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed during the 20th century, people gradually moved into cities to work in factories and became involved in socialist unions. A communist revolution was avoided in 1917, following the re-introduction of [[parliamentarism]], and the country was [[Democracy|democratised]].

===World War I and World War II===
{{Main|Sweden during World War I|Sweden during World War II}}

Sweden was officially neutral during [[World War I]]. However, under pressure from the [[German Empire]], they did take steps which were detrimental to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] – most notably, mining the [[Öresund]] channel, thus closing it to Allied shipping, and allowing the Germans to use Swedish facilities and the Swedish [[cipher]] to transmit secret messages to their overseas embassies. Sweden also allowed volunteers to fight alongside the Germans for the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]] against the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] and Russians in the [[Finnish Civil War]], and briefly occupied [[Åland]] in cooperation with the German Empire.

As in the First World War, Sweden remained officially neutral during [[World War II]], although its neutrality has been disputed. Sweden was under German influence for much of the war, as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades. Nevertheless, both Swedes and others have argued that Sweden could have done more to oppose the Nazis' war efforts.

===Post-war era===
[[File:Olivecrona erlander 380.jpg|thumb|[[Tage Erlander]] (left), Prime Minister under the ruling [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] from 1946 to 1969]]
Sweden was officially a neutral country and remained outside [[NATO]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] membership during the [[Cold War]], but privately Sweden's leadership had strong ties with the United States and other western governments. Following the war, Sweden took advantage of an intact industrial base, social stability and its natural resources to expand its industry to supply the rebuilding of Europe.<!---Recovery from the material damage and economic shocks of the war was more rapid than many expected."---> Sweden received aid under the [[Marshall Plan]] and participated in the OECD. During most of the post-war era, the country was governed by the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] largely in co-operation with [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation|trade unions]] and industry. The government actively pursued an internationally competitive manufacturing sector of primarily large corporations.

Like many industrialised countries, Sweden entered a period of economic decline and upheaval following the oil embargoes of 1973–74 and 1978–79. In the 1980s several key Swedish industries were significantly restructured. Shipbuilding was discontinued, wood pulp was integrated into modernised paper production, the steel industry was concentrated and specialised, and mechanical engineering was robotised. Swedish GDP per capita ranking declined during this time.

===Recent history===
{{See also|History of Sweden (1991–present)}}
A bursting real estate bubble caused by inadequate controls on lending combined with an international recession and a policy switch from anti-unemployment policies to anti-inflationary policies resulted in a [[Sweden financial crisis 1990-1994|fiscal crisis]] in the early 1990s. Sweden's GDP declined by around 5%. In 1992, a run on the currency caused the central bank to briefly increase interest rates to 500%.

[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|right|Sweden joined the European Union in 1995, and signed the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007.]]
The response of the government was to cut spending and institute a multitude of reforms to improve Sweden's competitiveness, among them reducing the [[welfare state]] and [[Privatisation|privatising]] public services and goods. [[1994 Swedish European Union membership referendum|A referendum]] passed with 52.3% in favour of joining the EU on 13 November 1994. Sweden joined the [[European Union]] on 1 January 1995. In a 2003 referendum the Swedish electorate [[2003 Swedish euro referendum|voted against]] joining the [[European Monetary Union|Euro]] currency. Sweden held the chair of the European Union from 1 July to 31 December 2009.

On 28 September 1994, the [[Sinking of the MS Estonia|MS Estonia sank]] as the ship was crossing the Baltic Sea, en route from Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm, Sweden. The disaster claimed the lives of 852 people (501 of them were Swedes), being one of the worst maritime disasters of the 20th century.

Until 2022, Sweden generally remained non-aligned militarily, although it participated in some joint military exercises with the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and some other countries, stationed its troops under NATO command in [[Islamic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], took part in EU-sponsored [[peacekeeping]] operations in [[Kosovo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Cyprus]], and [[2011 military intervention in Libya|helped enforce]] a [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973|UN-mandated no-fly zone]] over Libya during the [[Arab Spring]]. In addition, there was extensive cooperation with other European countries in the area of defence technology and defence industry; some Swedish-made weaponry was used by [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|Coalition]] militaries in Iraq. In response to the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]], Sweden moved to formally join NATO, alongside Finland. After many months of delays caused by the objections of Turkey and Hungary, Sweden became a NATO member on 7 March 2024. including the [[May 2013 Stockholm riots|2013 Stockholm riots]]. In response to these violent events, the [[Far-right politics|anti-immigration]] opposition party, the [[Sweden Democrats]], promoted their anti-immigration policies, while the [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] opposition blamed growing inequality caused by the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] government's socioeconomic policies.

Sweden was heavily affected by the [[2015 European migrant crisis]], eventually forcing the government to tighten regulations of entry to the country. Some of the asylum restrictions were relaxed again later.

On 30 November 2021, [[Magdalena Andersson]] became Sweden's first female prime minister. The September 2022 general [[2022 Swedish general election|election]] ended in a narrow win to a bloc of right-wing parties. On 18 October 2022, [[Ulf Kristersson]] of the Moderate Party became the new Prime Minister.
