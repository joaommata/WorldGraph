===Early history===
{{Main|Early Congolese history|Kingdom of Kongo}}

The geographical area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo was populated as early as 90,000 years ago, as shown by the 1988 discovery of the [[Semliki harpoon]] at [[Katanda Territory|Katanda]], one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found, believed to have been used to catch [[Bagrus|giant river catfish]].

[[Bantu peoples]] reached [[Central Africa]] at some point during the first millennium BC, then gradually started to expand southward. Their propagation was accelerated by the adoption of [[pastoralism]] and of [[Iron Age]] techniques. The people living in the south and southwest were foraging groups, whose technology involved only minimal use of metal technologies. The development of metal tools during this time period revolutionized agriculture. This led to the displacement of the [[African pygmies]]. Following the Bantu migrations, a period of state and class formation began circa 700 with three centres in the modern-day territory; one to the west around [[Pool Malebo]], one east around [[Lake Mai-Ndombe]], and a third even further east and south around the [[Upemba Depression]].{{Rp|page=|pages=17–18}}

By the 13th century, there were three main confederations of states in the western Congo Basin around Pool Malebo. In the east were the [[Seven Kingdoms of Kongo dia Nlaza]], considered to be the oldest and most powerful, which likely included [[Nsundi]], [[Mbata Kingdom|Mbata]], [[Mpangu]], and possibly [[Kundi kingdom|Kundi]] and [[Okanga]]. South of these was [[Mpemba]] which stretched from modern-day [[Angola]] to the [[Congo River]]. It included various kingdoms such as [[Mpemba Kasi]] and [[Vunda]]. To its west across the Congo River was a confederation of three small states; [[Vungu]] (its leader), [[Kakongo]], and [[Ngoyo]].{{Rp|pages=24–25}}

The [[Kingdom of Kongo]] was founded in the 14th century and dominated the western region. The empire of [[Mwene Muji]] was founded around Lake Mai-Ndombe. From the Upemba Depression the [[Luba Empire]] and [[Lunda Empire]] emerged in the 15th and 17th centuries respectively dominated the eastern region.

[[Congo Free State|Belgian exploration]] and administration took place from the 1870s until the 1920s. It was first led by [[Henry Morton Stanley]], who undertook his explorations under the sponsorship of King [[Leopold II of Belgium]]. The eastern regions of the precolonial Congo were heavily disrupted by constant [[slave raiding]], mainly from Arab–Swahili [[Arab slave trade|slave traders]] such as the infamous [[Tippu Tip]], who was well known to Stanley. Leopold had designs on what was to become the Congo as a colony. In a succession of negotiations, Leopold, professing humanitarian objectives in his capacity as chairman of the [[front organization]] ''[[Association Internationale Africaine]]'', actually played one European rival against another.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} King Leopold formally acquired rights to the Congo territory at the [[Berlin Conference|Conference of Berlin]] in 1885 and made the land his private property. He named it the [[Congo Free State]]. Leopold's regime began various infrastructure projects, such as the construction of the [[Matadi–Kinshasa Railway|railway that ran from the coast to the capital]] of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa), which took eight years to complete.

In the Congo Free State, colonists coerced the local population into producing rubber to meet the growing international demand driven by the spread of automobiles and the development of rubber tires. Rubber sales made a fortune for Leopold, who built several buildings in [[Brussels]] and [[Ostend]] to honor himself and his country. To enforce the rubber quotas, the ''[[Force Publique]]'' was called in and made the practice of cutting off the limbs of the natives a matter of policy. Under the Congo Free State, concessions were granted to private industries, giving them monopolies over violence and resource extraction. The most brutal of these concession zones surrounded rubber plantations. Concession regions were aligned with villages, where local chiefs were employed to help enforce strict quotas. Failure to comply or meet these quotas often resulted in the kidnapping of family members, who were held for ransom until quotas were met or subjected to physical violence. Violence was carried out by "village sentries"—militias led by European officers and composed of African soldiers—tasked with ensuring rubber collection. These sentries operated with full impunity, lacked proper oversight, and were reportedly known to kill and eat underperforming workers

During 1885–1908, between 1.2 and 13 million Congolese died as a consequence of exploitation and disease. In some areas the population declined dramatically – it has been estimated that [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] and [[smallpox]] killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower Congo River. News of the abuses began to circulate. In 1904, the [[British Empire|British consul]] at [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]] in the Congo, [[Roger Casement]], was instructed by the British government to investigate. His report, called the [[Casement Report]], confirmed the accusations of humanitarian abuses. The Belgian Parliament forced Leopold II to set up an independent commission of inquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement's report of abuses, concluding that the population of the Congo had been "reduced by half" during this period. Determining precisely how many people died is impossible, as no accurate records exist.

===Belgian Congo (1908–1960)===
{{Main|Belgian Congo}}

In 1908, the Belgian parliament, in spite of initial reluctance, bowed to international pressure (especially from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]) and took over the Free State from King Leopold II. On 18 October 1908, the Belgian parliament voted in favour of annexing the Congo as a Belgian colony. Executive power went to the [[Minister of the Colonies (Belgium)|Belgian minister of colonial affairs]], assisted by a Colonial Council (Conseil Colonial) (both located in Brussels). The Belgian parliament exercised legislative authority over the Belgian Congo. In 1923 the colonial capital moved from [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]] to Léopoldville, some {{convert|300|km}} further upstream into the interior. [[File:Congo belge campagne 1918.jpg|upright|thumbnail|left|''[[Force Publique]]'' soldiers in the Belgian Congo in 1918. At its peak, the Force Publique had around 19,000 Congolese soldiers, led by 420 Belgian officers.]]The transition from the Congo Free State to the Belgian Congo was a break, but it also featured a large degree of continuity. The last governor-general of the Congo Free State, Baron [[Théophile Wahis]], remained in office in the Belgian Congo and the majority of Leopold II's administration with him. Opening up the Congo and its natural and mineral riches to the Belgian economy remained the main motive for colonial expansion&nbsp;– however, other priorities, such as healthcare and basic education, slowly gained in importance.

Colonial administrators ruled the territory and a dual legal system existed (a system of European courts and another one of indigenous courts, ''tribunaux indigènes''). Indigenous courts had only limited powers and remained under the firm control of the colonial administration. The Belgian authorities permitted no political activity in the Congo whatsoever, and the ''Force Publique'' put down any attempts at rebellion.

The Belgian Congo was directly involved in the two world wars. During [[World War I]] (1914–1918), an initial stand-off between the ''Force Publique'' and the German colonial army in [[German East Africa]] turned into open warfare with a joint Anglo-Belgian-Portuguese invasion of German colonial territory in 1916 and 1917 during the [[East African campaign (World War I)|East African campaign]]. The ''Force Publique'' gained a notable victory when it marched into [[Tabora]] in September 1916 under the command of General [[Charles Tombeur]] after heavy fighting.

After 1918, Belgium was rewarded for the participation of the ''Force Publique'' in the East African campaign with a [[League of Nations]] mandate over the previously German colony of [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. During [[World War II]], the Belgian Congo provided a crucial source of income for the [[Belgian government in exile]] in London, and the ''Force Publique'' again participated in [[East African campaign (World War II)|Allied campaigns in Africa]]. Belgian Congolese forces under the command of Belgian officers notably fought against the Italian colonial army in Ethiopia in [[Asosa]], Bortaï and [[Siege of Saïo|Saïo]] under Major-General [[Auguste Gilliaert|Auguste-Eduard Gilliaert]].

===Independence and political crisis (1960–1965)===
{{Main|Congo Crisis|Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)}}

[[File:Joseph Kasa-Vubu in Israel.png|thumb|upright|right|The leader of [[ABAKO]], [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]], first democratically elected [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]] of [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Congo-Léopoldville]]]]

In May 1960, a growing nationalist movement, the [[Mouvement National Congolais]] led by [[Patrice Lumumba]], won the [[1960 Belgian Congo general election|parliamentary elections]]. Lumumba became the first [[Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Prime Minister]] of the Republic of the Congo, on 24 June 1960. The parliament elected [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] as [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|president]] of the Alliance des Bakongo ([[ABAKO]]) party. Other parties that emerged included the [[Parti Solidaire Africain]] led by [[Antoine Gizenga]], and the Parti National du Peuple led by Albert Delvaux and [[Laurent Mbariko]].

The Belgian Congo achieved independence on 30 June 1960 under the name "République du Congo" ("Republic of Congo" or "Republic of the Congo" in English). Shortly after, on 15 August 1960, the neighboring French colony of [[French Congo|Middle Congo]] also gained independence and adopted the same name, '[[Republic of the Congo|Republic of Congo]].' To avoid confusion between the two, the former Belgian Congo became known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo ('''DR Congo'''), while the former French colony retained the name 'Republic of the Congo' ('''Congo''').

Shortly after independence the ''Force Publique'' mutinied, and on 11 July the [[Katanga Province|province of Katanga]] (led by [[Moïse Tshombe]]) and [[South Kasai]] [[Congo Crisis|engaged in secessionist struggles]] against the new leadership. Most of the 100,000 [[White people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Europeans]] who had remained behind after independence fled the country. After the United Nations rejected Lumumba's call for help to put down the secessionist movements, Lumumba asked for assistance from the Soviet Union, who accepted and sent military supplies and advisers. On 23 August, the Congolese armed forces [[Invasion of South Kasai|invaded South Kasai]]. Lumumba was dismissed from office on 5 September 1960 by Kasa-Vubu who publicly blamed him for massacres by the armed forces in South Kasai and for involving Soviets in the country. On 7 September, Lumumba made a speech to the Congolese House of Representatives, arguing his dismissal was illegal under the nation's laws. Congolese law gave parliament, not the president, the authority to dismiss a government minister. The House and Senate both rejected the dismissal of Lumumba, but the removal proceeded unconstitutionally.

On 14 September, Colonel [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Joseph Mobutu]], with the backing of the US and Belgium, removed Lumumba from office. On 17 January 1961, Lumumba was handed over to Katangan authorities and executed by Belgian-led Katangan troops. A 2001 investigation by Belgium's Parliament found Belgium "morally responsible" for the murder of Lumumba, and the country has since officially apologised for its role in his death.

On 18 September 1961, in ongoing negotiations of a ceasefire, a [[1961 Ndola United Nations DC-6 crash|plane crash near Ndola]] resulted in the death of [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], along with all 15 passengers, setting off a succession crisis. Amidst widespread confusion and chaos, a temporary government was led by technicians (the [[College of Commissioners-General|Collège des commissaires généraux]]). Katangan secession ended in January 1963 with the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo|assistance of UN forces]]. Several short-lived governments of [[Joseph Iléo|Joseph Ileo]], [[Cyrille Adoula]], and Moise Kapenda Tshombe took over in quick succession.

Meanwhile, in the east of the country, Soviet and Cuban-backed rebels called the [[Simba rebellion|Simbas]] rose up, taking a significant amount of territory and proclaiming a communist "People's Republic of the Congo" in Stanleyville. The Simbas were pushed out of Stanleyville in November 1964 during [[Operation Dragon Rouge]], a military operation conducted by Belgian and American forces to rescue hundreds of hostages. Congolese government forces fully defeated the Simba rebels by November 1965.

Lumumba had previously appointed Mobutu chief of staff of the new Congo army, [[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Armée Nationale Congolaise]]. Taking advantage of the leadership crisis between Kasavubu and Tshombe, Mobutu garnered enough support within the army to launch a coup. A [[1964 Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville) constitutional referendum|constitutional referendum]] the year before [[Second Mobutu coup d'état|Mobutu's coup of 1965]] resulted in the country's official name being changed to the "Democratic Republic of the Congo". In 1971 Mobutu changed the name again, this time to "Republic of Zaire".

===Mobutu autocracy and Zaire (1965–1997)===
{{Main|Zaire}}

[[File:Mobutu Nixon.jpg|thumb|[[Mobutu Sese Seko]] and Richard Nixon in Washington, D.C., 1973]]
Mobutu had the staunch support of the United States because of his [[Anti-communism|opposition to communism]]; the U.S. believed that his administration would serve as an effective counter to communist movements in Africa. A [[One-party state|single-party system]] was established, and Mobutu declared himself [[List of heads of state of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|head of state]]. He periodically held elections in which he was the only candidate. Although relative peace and stability were achieved, Mobutu's government was guilty of severe [[human rights]] violations, [[political repression]], a [[cult of personality]] and [[Corruption in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|corruption]].

By late 1967, Mobutu had successfully neutralized his political opponents and rivals, either through co-opting them into his regime, arresting them, or rendering them otherwise politically impotent.{{sfn|Young|Turner|2013|p=58}} Throughout the late 1960s, Mobutu continued to shuffle his governments and cycle officials in and out of the office to maintain control. Joseph Kasa-Vubu's death in April 1969 ensured that no person with First Republic credentials could challenge his rule.{{sfn|Young|Turner|2013|pp=61–62}} By the early 1970s, Mobutu was attempting to assert Zaire as a leading African nation. He traveled frequently across the continent while the government became more vocal about African issues, particularly those relating to the southern region. Zaire established semi-clientelist relationships with several smaller African states, especially Burundi, Chad, and Togo.{{sfn|Young|Turner|2013|p=64}}

Corruption became so common the term "''le mal Zairois''" or "Zairian sickness", meaning gross corruption, theft and mismanagement, was coined, reportedly by Mobutu.{{sfn|Young|Turner|2013|p=74}} International aid, most often in the form of loans, enriched Mobutu while he allowed national infrastructure such as roads to deteriorate to as little as one-quarter of what had existed in 1960. Zaire became a [[kleptocracy]] as Mobutu and his associates embezzled government funds.

[[File:Prince Bernhard and Mobutu Sese Seko 1973.jpg|thumb|Mobutu with the Dutch [[Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld|Prince Bernhard]] in Kinshasa in 1973]]
In a campaign to identify himself with African nationalism, starting on 1 June 1966, Mobutu renamed the nation's cities: Léopoldville became Kinshasa (the country was known as Congo-Kinshasa), Stanleyville became [[Kisangani]], Elisabethville became [[Lubumbashi]], and Coquilhatville became [[Mbandaka]]. In 1971, Mobutu renamed the country the ''Republic of Zaire'', its fourth name change in eleven years and its sixth overall. The Congo River was renamed the Zaire River.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Mobutu was invited to visit the United States on several occasions, meeting with U.S. Presidents [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]]. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] U.S. relations with Mobutu cooled, as he was no longer deemed necessary as a [[Cold War]] ally. Opponents within Zaire stepped up demands for reform. This atmosphere contributed to Mobutu's declaring the Third Republic in 1990, whose constitution was supposed to pave the way for democratic reform. The reforms turned out to be largely cosmetic. Mobutu continued in power until armed forces forced him to flee in 1997. "From 1990 to 1993, the United States facilitated Mobutu's attempts to hijack political change", one academic wrote, and "also assisted the rebellion of Laurent-Desire Kabila that overthrew the Mobutu regime."

In September 1997, Mobutu died in exile in Morocco.

===Continental and civil wars (1996–2007)===
{{Main|First Congo War|Second Congo War}}

[[File:Second Congo War Africa map en.png|thumb|Belligerents of the [[Second Congo War]]]]
By 1996, following the [[Rwandan Civil War]] and [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]] and the ascension of a [[Tutsi]]-led government in Rwanda, Rwandan [[Hutu]] militia forces ([[Interahamwe]]) fled to eastern Zaire and used refugee camps as bases for incursions against Rwanda. They allied with the Zairian Armed Forces to launch a campaign against Congolese ethnic Tutsis in eastern Zaire.

A coalition of Rwandan and Ugandan armies invaded Zaire to overthrow the government of Mobutu, launching the First Congo War. The coalition allied with some opposition figures, led by [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], becoming the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]]. In 1997 Mobutu fled and Kabila marched into Kinshasa, naming himself as president and reverting the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Kabila later requested that foreign military forces return to their own countries. Rwandan troops retreated to [[Goma]] and launched a new Tutsi-led rebel military movement called the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy|Rassemblement Congolais pour la Democratie]] to fight Kabila, while Uganda instigated the creation of a rebel movement called the [[Movement for the Liberation of the Congo]], led by Congolese warlord [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The two rebel movements, along with Rwandan and Ugandan troops, started the Second Congo War by attacking the DRC army in 1998. Angolan, Zimbabwean, and Namibian militaries entered the hostilities on the side of the government.

Kabila was assassinated in 2001. His son [[Joseph Kabila]] succeeded him and called for multilateral peace talks. UN peacekeepers, MONUC, now known as [[MONUSCO]], arrived in April 2001. In 2002–03, Bemba intervened in the Central African Republic on behalf of its former president, [[Ange-Félix Patassé]]. Talks led to a peace accord under which Kabila would share power with former rebels, implemented between 2002 and 2003. The most widely reported estimate for the death toll during the Second Congo War is 5.4 million people, though other estimates put it at three million. It has been described as the deadliest conflict since [[World War II]]. By June 2003 all foreign armies except those of Rwanda had pulled out of Congo. A [[Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|transitional government]] was set up until an election was held. A constitution was approved by voters; further, on 30 July 2006, DRC held its [[2006 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election|first multi-party elections]]. These were the first free national elections since 1960, which many believed would mark the end to violence in the region. However, an election-result dispute between Kabila and Bemba turned into a skirmish between their supporters in Kinshasa. MONUC took control of the city. The second round of the election took place in October 2006, which Kabila won, and in December 2006 he was sworn in as president.

In March 2009, after a deal between the DRC and Rwanda, Rwandan troops entered the DRC and arrested Nkunda and were allowed to pursue FDLR militants. The CNDP signed a peace treaty with the government in which it agreed to become a political party and to have its soldiers integrated into the national army in exchange for the release of its imprisoned members. In 2012 [[Bosco Ntaganda]], the leader of the CNDP, and troops loyal to him, [[M23 rebellion (2012–2013)|mutinied]] and briefly captured the provincial capital of Goma in November 2012.

Neighboring countries have been accused of arming rebel groups and using them as proxies to gain control of the resource-rich country. In March 2013, the [[United Nations Security Council]] authorized the [[United Nations Force Intervention Brigade]] to neutralize armed groups. In 2013, the [[Mai-Mai]] created by Laurent Kabila briefly invaded the provincial capital of [[Lubumbashi]] and 400,000 people are displaced in the province {{As of|2013|lc=y}}. On and off fighting in the [[Ituri conflict]] occurred between the [[Nationalist and Integrationist Front]] and the [[Union of Congolese Patriots]]. In the northeast, [[Joseph Kony]]'s [[Lord's Resistance Army]] moved from their original bases in Uganda and South Sudan to DR Congo in 2005 and set up camps in the [[Garamba National Park]].

In 2015, [[19 January 2015 DRC protests|major protests]] broke out across the country and protesters demanded that Kabila step down as president. On 27 November 2016 Congolese foreign minister [[Raymond Tshibanda]] told the press no elections would be held in 2016: "it has been decided that the voter registration operation will end on July 31, 2017, and that election will take place in April 2018." [[December 2016 Congolese protests|Protests broke out in the country on 20 December]] when Kabila's term in office ended. Across the country, dozens of protesters were killed and hundreds were arrested.

Human Rights Watch said in 2017 that Kabila recruited former 23 March Movement fighters to put down country-wide protests over his refusal to step down from office at the end of his term. "M23 fighters patrolled the streets of Congo's main cities, firing on or arresting protesters or anyone else deemed to be a threat to the president," they said. Fierce fighting has erupted in Masisi between government forces and a powerful local warlord, General Delta. The United Nations mission in the DRC is its largest and most expensive peacekeeping effort, but it shut down five UN bases near Masisi in 2017, after the U.S. led a push to cut costs.

On 30 December 2018, a [[2018 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election|general election]] was held. The election was originally scheduled for 23 December, but was postponed after a warehouse fire destroyed several electronic voting machines, prompting concerns about potential tampering. Polling eventually opened on 30 December across most of the country, though voting remained suspended in certain areas—a measure officials said was intended to protect residents from an ongoing Ebola outbreak in eastern provinces.

After polls closed, the government imposed an internet blackout in some regions, announcing that service would be restored following the release of results, which had been slated for 6 January.

On 10 January 2019, the electoral commission announced opposition candidate [[Félix Tshisekedi]] as the winner of the presidential vote, and he was officially sworn in as president on 24 January. However, there were widespread suspicions that the results were rigged and that a deal had been made between Tshisekedi and Kabila, as professional election polls carried out on election day found that Martin Fayulu, the leading opposition candidate, was expected to take 47% of the vote, compared to 23% for Felix Tshisekedi and 19% for Emmanuel Shadary, Kabila's hand-picked successor.

In August 2019, six months after the inauguration of Félix Tshisekedi, a coalition government was announced. Tshisekedi succeeded in strengthening his hold on power, gaining the support of almost 400 out of 500 members of the National Assembly, the pro-Kabila speakers of both houses of parliament being forced out. In April 2021, the [[Lukonde cabinet|new government]] was formed without the supporters of Kabila.

A [[2019–2020 measles outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|major measles outbreak]] in the country left nearly 5,000 dead in 2019. The [[2018 Équateur province Ebola outbreak|Ebola outbreak]] ended in June 2020, after causing 2,280 deaths over 2 years. The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] also [[COVID-19 pandemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|reached the DRC]] in March 2020, with a [[COVID-19 vaccination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|vaccination campaign]] beginning on 19 April 2021. The [[List of ambassadors of Italy to the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Italian ambassador]] to the DRC, [[Luca Attanasio]], and his bodyguard were [[Killing of Luca Attanasio|killed in North Kivu on 22 February 2021]]. On 22 April 2021, meetings between Kenyan President [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] and Tshisekedi resulted in new agreements increasing international trade and security (counterterrorism, immigration, cyber security, and customs) between the two countries. In February 2022, [[2022 Democratic Republic of the Congo coup d'état allegations|allegations of a coup d'état]] in the country led to uncertainty, but the coup attempt failed. In December 2023, President Felix Tshisekedi won [[2023 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election|reelection]] with more than 70% of the vote.

The M23 Movement had a [[M23 campaign (2022–present)|resurgence in 2022]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo–Rwanda conflict (2022–present)|received military assistance from Rwanda]], which accused the Congolese government of supporting the [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda|FDLR]] Hutu militia. In early 2025, the conflict escalated with the M23 capture of [[2025 Goma offensive|Goma]] and [[2025 Bukavu offensive|Bukavu]], involving thousands of Rwandan troops. Peace negotiations between Rwanda and the DRC brokered by the United States took place in the spring of 2025, and culminated in the signing of a peace deal on 27 June 2025. The [[2025 Democratic Republic of the Congo–Rwanda peace agreement|peace agreement]] calls for the withdrawal of Rwandan troops from eastern Congo within 90 days and the end of the DRC's support for the FDLR, along with the creation of a regional economic integration framework for the two countries. Despite the treaty, the [[United Nations Human Rights Office|United Nations Humans Rights Office (UNHRO)]] found that hostilities in the provinces where Goma and Bukavu are located, increased during the period from January to July 2025. UNHRO found that M23, along with the occupying [[Rwandan Defence Force|Rwandan Defense Force (RDF)]] soldiers allegedly massacred hundreds of civilians in four villages within [[Rutshuru]], a region within [[North Kivu]] province. In July 2025, a Declaration of Principles was signed in [[Doha]] as a first agreement on shared objectives for a ceasefire, and to limit future violence in the conflict. In October 2025, former president Joseph Kabila was sentenced to death in absentia for alleged collaboration with the rebel group M23.
