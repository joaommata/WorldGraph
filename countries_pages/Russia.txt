The first human settlement on Russia dates back to the [[Oldowan]] period in the early [[Lower Paleolithic]]. About 2 million years ago, representatives of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' migrated to the [[Taman Peninsula]] in southern Russia. [[Flint]] tools, some 1.5 million years old, have been discovered in the [[North Caucasus]]. [[Radiocarbon dated]] specimens from [[Denisova Cave]] in the [[Altai Mountains]] estimate the oldest [[Denisovan]] specimen lived 195–122,700 years ago. Fossils of ''[[Denny (hybrid hominin)|Denny]]'', an [[archaic human]] hybrid that was half [[Neanderthal]] and half Denisovan, and lived some 90,000 years ago, was also found within the latter cave. Russia was home to some of the last surviving Neanderthals, from about 45,000 years ago, found in [[Mezmaiskaya cave]].

The first trace of an [[Ust'-Ishim man|early modern human]] in Russia dates back to 45,000 years, in [[Western Siberia]]. The discovery of high concentration cultural remains of [[Human|anatomically modern humans]], from at least 40,000 years ago, was found at [[Kostyonki–Borshchyovo]], and at [[Sungir]], dating back to 34,600 years ago—both in [[European Russia|western Russia]]. Humans reached [[Far North (Russia)|Arctic Russia]] at least 40,000 years ago, in [[Mamontovaya Kurya]]. [[Ancient North Eurasian]] populations from Siberia genetically similar to [[Mal'ta–Buret' culture]] and [[Afontova Gora]] were an important genetic contributor to [[Ancient Beringian|Ancient Native Americans]] and [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]]s.

[[File:Yamnaya Steppe Pastoralists.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Bronze Age spread of [[Yamnaya culture|Yamnaya]] [[Western Steppe Herders|Steppe pastoralist]] ancestry between 3300 and 1500 BC, including the [[Afanasievo culture]] of southern Siberia]]

The [[Kurgan hypothesis]] places the Volga-Dnieper region of southern Russia and [[Ukraine]] as the [[urheimat]] of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. Early [[Indo-European migrations]] from the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]] of Ukraine and Russia spread [[Yamnaya culture|Yamnaya]] ancestry and [[Indo-European languages]] across large parts of Eurasia. [[Nomadic pastoralism]] developed in the Pontic–Caspian steppe beginning in the [[Chalcolithic]]. Remnants of these steppe civilisations were discovered in places such as [[Ipatovo kurgan|Ipatovo]], [[Sintashta]], [[Arkaim]], and [[Pazyryk burials|Pazyryk]], which bear the earliest known traces of [[horses in warfare]]. The genetic makeup of speakers of the [[Uralic language family|Uralic]] language family in northern Europe was shaped by migration from [[Siberia]] that began at least 3,500 years ago.

In the 3rd to 4th centuries AD, the [[Goths|Gothic]] kingdom of [[Oium]] existed in southern Russia, which was later overrun by [[Huns]]. Between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD, the [[Bosporan Kingdom]], which was a Hellenistic [[polity]] that succeeded the Greek colonies, was also overwhelmed by nomadic invasions led by warlike tribes such as the Huns and [[Pannonian Avars|Eurasian Avars]]. The [[Khazars]], who were of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic origin]], ruled the steppes between the Caucasus in the south, to the east past the Volga river basin, and west as far as Kyiv on the Dnieper river until the 10th century. After them came the [[Pechenegs]] who created a large confederacy, which was subsequently taken over by the [[Cumans]] and the [[Kipchaks]].

The ancestors of [[Russians]] are among the [[List of ancient Slavic peoples|Slavic tribes]] that separated from the Proto-Indo-Europeans, who appeared in the northeastern part of Europe {{Circa|1500}} years ago. The East Slavs gradually settled western Russia (approximately between modern [[Moscow]] and [[Saint-Petersburg]]) in two waves: one moving from [[Kyiv|Kiev]] towards present-day [[Suzdal]] and [[Murom]] and another from [[Polotsk]] towards [[Novgorod]] and [[Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast|Rostov]]. Prior to Slavic migration, that territory was populated by [[Finno-Ugrian]] peoples. From the 7th century onwards, the incoming East Slavs slowly assimilated the native Finno-Ugrians.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}}

=== Kievan Rus' ===
{{Main|Rus' Khaganate|Kievan Rus'|List of tribes and states in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine}}
[[File:Kievan-rus-1015-1113-(en).png|thumb|[[Kievan Rus']] after the [[Council of Liubech]] in 1097]]
The establishment of the first East Slavic states in the 9th century coincided with the arrival of [[Varangians]], the [[Vikings]] who ventured along the waterways extending from the eastern Baltic [[From the Varangians to the Greeks|to the Black]] and [[Volga trade route|Caspian]] Seas.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} According to the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', a Varangian from the [[Rus' people]], named [[Rurik]], was elected ruler of [[Novgorod]] in 862. In 882, his successor [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]] ventured south and conquered [[Kiev]], which had been previously paying tribute to the [[Khazars]].{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} Rurik's son [[Igor of Kiev|Igor]] and Igor's son [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav]] subsequently subdued all local [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] tribes to Kievan rule, destroyed the Khazar Khaganate, and launched several military expeditions to [[Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Paphlagonian expedition of the Rus'|Byzantium]] and [[Caspian expeditions of the Rus'|Persia]].

In the 10th to 11th centuries, Kievan Rus' became one of the largest and most prosperous states in Europe. The reigns of [[Vladimir the Great]] (980–1015) and his son [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–1054) constitute the [[Golden Age]] of Kiev, which saw [[Christianisation of Kievan Rus'|the acceptance of]] Orthodox Christianity from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], and the creation of the first East Slavic written [[legal code]], the ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]''.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} The age of [[feudalism]] and decentralisation had come, marked by constant in-fighting between members of the [[Rurik dynasty]] that ruled Kievan Rus' collectively. Kiev's dominance waned, to the benefit of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] in the north-east, the [[Novgorod Republic]] in the north, and [[Galicia-Volhynia]] in the south-west.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} By the 12th century, Kiev lost its pre-eminence and Kievan Rus' had fragmented into different principalities. Prince [[Andrey Bogolyubsky]] sacked Kiev in 1169 and made [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] his base, leading to political power being shifted to the north-east.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}}

Led by Prince [[Alexander Nevsky]], Novgorodians repelled the invading [[Swedes]] in the [[Battle of the Neva]] in 1240, as well as the [[Northern Crusades|Germanic crusaders]] in the [[Battle on the Ice]] in 1242.

Kievan Rus' finally fell to the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Mongol invasion]] of 1237–1240, which resulted in the [[Siege of Kiev (1240)|sacking of Kiev]] and other cities, as well as the death of a major part of the population.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} The invaders, later known as [[Tatars]], formed the state of the [[Golden Horde]], which ruled over Russia for the next two centuries. Only the Novgorod Republic escaped foreign occupation after it agreed to pay tribute to the Mongols.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} Galicia-Volhynia would later be absorbed by [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] and [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Poland]], while the Novgorod Republic continued to prosper in the north. In the northeast, the Byzantine-Slavic traditions of Kievan Rus' were adapted to form the Russian autocratic state.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}}

=== Grand Principality of Moscow ===
{{Main|Grand Principality of Moscow}}
[[File:Lissner TroiceSergievaLavr.jpg|thumb|[[Sergius of Radonezh]] blessing [[Dmitry Donskoy]] in [[Trinity Sergius Lavra]], before the [[Battle of Kulikovo]], depicted in a painting by [[Ernst Lissner]]]]
The destruction of Kievan Rus' saw the eventual rise of the [[Grand Principality of Moscow]], initially a part of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]].{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}}{{Rp|pages=11–20}} While still under the domain of the [[Mongol]]-[[Tatars]] and with their connivance, Moscow began to assert its influence in the region in the early 14th century, gradually becoming the leading force in the "gathering of the Russian lands".{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} When the seat of the Metropolitan of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] moved to Moscow in 1325, its influence increased. Moscow's last rival, the [[Novgorod Republic]], prospered as the chief [[fur trade]] centre and the easternmost port of the [[Hanseatic League]].

Led by Prince [[Dmitry Donskoy]] of Moscow, the united army of Russian principalities inflicted [[List of conflicts in Eastern Europe during Turco-Mongol rule|a milestone defeat]] on the Mongol-Tatars in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] in 1380.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} Moscow gradually absorbed its parent duchy and surrounding principalities, including formerly strong rivals such as [[Principality of Tver|Tver]] and [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]].{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}}

[[Ivan III]] ("the Great") threw off the control of the [[Golden Horde]] and gained sovereignty over the ethnically Russian lands;{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} he later adopted the title of [[sovereign of all Russia]]. After the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, Moscow [[Third Rome|claimed succession to the legacy]] of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Ivan&nbsp;III married [[Sophia Palaiologina]], the niece of the last [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Constantine&nbsp;XI]], and made the Byzantine [[double-headed eagle]] his own, and eventually Russia's, coat-of-arms.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili III]] united all of Russia by annexing the last few independent [[List of tribes and states in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine|Russian states]] in the early 16th century.

=== Tsardom of Russia ===
{{Main|Tsardom of Russia}}
{{See also|Moscow, third Rome}}
[[File:Ivan grozny frame.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ivan IV]] was the [[Grand Prince of Moscow]] from 1533 to 1547, then [[Tsar of Russia]] until his death in 1584.]]
In development of the [[Moscow, third Rome|Third Rome]] ideas, the grand prince [[Ivan&nbsp;IV]] ("the Terrible") was officially crowned as the first [[tsar of all Russia]] in 1547. The tsar [[Promulgation|promulgated]] a new code of laws ([[Sudebnik of 1550]]), established the first Russian feudal representative body (the [[Zemsky Sobor]]), revamped the military, curbed the influence of the clergy, and reorganised local government.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} During his long reign, Ivan nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates: [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] along the [[Volga]], and the [[Khanate of Sibir]] in southwestern Siberia. Ultimately, by the end of the 16th century, Russia expanded east of the [[Ural Mountains]]. However, the Tsardom was weakened by the long and unsuccessful [[Livonian War]] against the coalition of the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] (later the united [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]), the [[History of Sweden (1523–1611)|Kingdom of Sweden]], and [[Denmark–Norway]] for access to the Baltic coast and sea trade. In 1572, an invading army of [[Crimean Tatars]] were [[Russo-Crimean Wars|thoroughly defeated]] in the crucial [[Battle of Molodi]].
[[File:Fedor chertezh.jpeg|thumb|left|Feodor Godunov's map of Russia, as published by [[Hessel Gerritsz]] in 1614]]
The death of Ivan's sons marked the end of the ancient [[Rurik dynasty]] in 1598, and in combination with the disastrous [[Russian famine of 1601–03|famine of 1601–1603]], led to a civil war, the rule of pretenders, and foreign intervention during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the early 17th century. The [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], taking advantage, occupied parts of Russia, extending into the capital Moscow. In 1612, the Poles were forced to retreat by the Russian volunteer corps, led by merchant [[Kuzma Minin]] and prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]]. The [[Romanov dynasty]] acceded to the throne in 1613 by the decision of the Zemsky Sobor, and the country started its gradual recovery from the crisis.

Russia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of the [[Cossacks]]. In 1654, the Ukrainian leader, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian tsar, [[Alexis of Russia|Alexis]], whose acceptance of this offer led to another [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)|Russo-Polish War]]. Ultimately, Ukraine was split along the [[Dnieper]], leaving the eastern part, ([[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Kiev]]) under Russian rule. In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of vast Siberia continued, hunting for valuable furs and ivory. [[List of Russian explorers|Russian explorers]] pushed eastward primarily along the [[Siberian River Routes]], and by the mid-17th century, there were Russian settlements in eastern Siberia, on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur River]], and on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. In 1648, [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] became the first European to navigate through the [[Bering Strait]].

=== Imperial Russia ===
{{Main|Russian Empire}}
Under [[Peter the Great]], Russia was proclaimed an empire in 1721, and established itself as one of the European great powers. Ruling from 1682 to 1725, Peter defeated Sweden in the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721), securing Russia's access to the sea and sea trade. In 1703, on the Baltic Sea, Peter founded [[Saint Petersburg]] as Russia's new capital. Throughout his rule, [[Government reform of Peter the Great|sweeping reforms were made]], which brought significant Western European cultural influences to Russia.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} He was succeeded by [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine I]] (1725–1727), followed by [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]] (1727–1730), and [[Anna of Russia|Anna]]. The reign of Peter&nbsp;I's daughter [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]] in 1741–1762 saw Russia's participation in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763). During the conflict, Russian troops overran [[East Prussia]], reaching Berlin. However, upon Elizabeth's death, all these conquests were returned to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] by pro-Prussian [[Peter&nbsp;III of Russia]].
[[File:Growth of Russia 1547-1725.png|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Expansion of Russia (1500–1800)|Expansion]] and [[Territorial evolution of Russia|territorial evolution]] of Russia from the [[Coronation of the Russian monarch|coronation]] of [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] to the death of [[Peter the Great|Peter I]]]]
[[Catherine the Great|Catherine&nbsp;II]] ("the Great"), who ruled in 1762–1796, presided over the [[Russian Enlightenment|Russian Age of Enlightenment]]. She extended Russian political control over the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and [[Partitions of Poland|annexed most of its territories into Russia]], making it the most populous country in Europe. In the south, after the successful [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]], Catherine advanced Russia's boundary to the Black Sea, by dissolving the [[Crimean Khanate]], and [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|annexing Crimea]]. As a result of victories over [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]] through the [[Russo-Persian Wars]], by the first half of the 19th century, Russia also [[Russian conquest of the Caucasus|conquered the Caucasus]]. Catherine's successor, her son [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]], was [[Personality and reputation of Paul I of Russia|unstable and focused predominantly on domestic issues]]. Following his short reign, Catherine's strategy was continued with [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;I]]'s (1801–1825) [[Finnish War|wresting of Finland]] from the weakened Sweden in 1809, and of [[Bessarabia]] from the Ottomans in 1812. In North America, the Russians became the first Europeans to [[Russian America|reach and colonise Alaska]]. In 1803–1806, the [[first Russian circumnavigation]] was made. In 1820, [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen#First Russian Antarctic expedition|a Russian expedition]] discovered the continent of [[Antarctica]].

====Great power and development of society, sciences, and arts====
[[File:Napoleons retreat from Moscow by Adolph Northen.jpg|thumb|''[[Napoleon]]'s retreat from Moscow'' by [[Albrecht Adam]] (1851)]]
During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Russia joined alliances with various European powers, and fought against France. The [[French invasion of Russia]] at the height of Napoleon's power in 1812 reached Moscow, but eventually failed as the obstinate resistance in combination with the bitterly cold [[Russian winter]] led to a disastrous defeat of invaders, in which the pan-European [[Grande Armée]] faced utter destruction. Led by [[Mikhail Kutuzov]] and [[Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly]], the [[Imperial Russian Army]] ousted Napoleon and drove throughout Europe in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], ultimately entering Paris. [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] controlled Russia's delegation at the [[Congress of Vienna]], which defined the map of post-Napoleonic Europe.

The officers who pursued Napoleon into Western Europe brought ideas of liberalism back to Russia, and attempted to curtail the tsar's powers during the abortive [[Decembrist revolt]] of 1825. At the end of the conservative reign of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] (1825–1855), a zenith period of Russia's power and influence in Europe, was disrupted by defeat in the [[Crimean War]].

====Great liberal reforms and capitalism====
[[File:The defeat of Shipka Peak, Bulgarian War of Independence.JPG|thumb|The [[Battle of Shipka Pass]] for the control of the vital [[Shipka Pass]] during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War]]]]
Nicholas's successor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;II]] (1855–1881) enacted significant changes throughout the country, including the [[emancipation reform of 1861]]. These reforms spurred industrialisation, and modernised the Imperial Russian Army, which liberated much of the [[Balkans]] from Ottoman rule in the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War]]. During most of the 19th and early 20th century, Russia and [[British Empire|Britain]] colluded over [[Emirate of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] and its neighbouring territories in [[Central Asia|Central]] and South Asia; the rivalry between the two major European empires came to be known as the [[Great Game]].

The late 19th century saw the rise of various socialist movements in Russia. Alexander&nbsp;II was [[Assassination of Alexander II of Russia|assassinated]] in 1881 by revolutionary terrorists. The reign of his son [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;III]] (1881–1894) was less liberal but more peaceful.

====Constitutional monarchy and World War====
Under last Russian emperor, [[Nicholas&nbsp;II]] (1894–1917), the [[Revolution of 1905]] was triggered by the humiliating failure of the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms ([[Russian Constitution of 1906]]), including granting [[freedom of speech|freedoms of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], the legalisation of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma]].

=== Revolution and civil war ===
{{main|Russian Revolution|Russian Civil War|Dissolution of the Russian Empire}}
[[File:Russian Imperial Family 1913.jpg|thumb|left|Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and the [[House of Romanov|Romanovs]] were [[Execution of the Romanov family|executed]] by the Bolsheviks in 1918.]]
In 1914, [[Russian entry into World War I|Russia entered World War&nbsp;I]] in response to [[Austria-Hungary]]'s declaration of war on Russia's ally [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], and fought across multiple fronts while isolated from its [[Triple Entente]] allies. In 1916, the [[Brusilov Offensive]] of the Imperial Russian Army almost completely destroyed the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. However, the already-existing public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war, [[World War I casualties|high casualties]], and rumors of corruption and treason. All this formed the climate for the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, carried out in two major acts.{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} In early 1917, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] was [[February Revolution|forced to abdicate]]; he and his family were imprisoned and [[Shooting of the Romanov family|later executed]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. The monarchy was replaced by a shaky coalition of political parties that declared itself the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], and proclaimed the [[Russian Republic]]. On {{OldStyleDateNY|19 January|6 January}}, 1918, the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]] declared Russia a democratic federal republic (thus ratifying the Provisional Government's decision). The next day the Constituent Assembly was dissolved by the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]].{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}}

An alternative socialist establishment co-existed, the [[Petrograd Soviet]], wielding power through the democratically elected councils of workers and peasants, called ''[[Soviet (council)|soviets]]''. The rule of the new authorities only aggravated the crisis in the country instead of resolving it, and eventually, the [[October Revolution]], led by [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]], overthrew the Provisional Government and gave full governing power to the soviets, leading to the creation of the world's first [[socialist state]].{{sfn|Curtis|1998|loc=Chapter 1–2. Historical Setting}} The [[Russian Civil War]] broke out between the [[anti-communist]] [[White movement]] and the Bolsheviks with its [[Red Army]]. In the aftermath of signing the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] that concluded hostilities with the [[Central Powers]] of [[World War I|World War&nbsp;I]], Bolshevist Russia surrendered most of its western territories, which hosted 34% of its population, 54% of its industries, 32% of its agricultural land, and roughly 90% of its coal mines.
[[File:Vladimir_Lenin_Speech_in_May_1920.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Lenin]] speaks in Moscow, 1920, with [[Leon Trotsky]] leaning against the podium]]
The [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] launched an unsuccessful [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|military intervention]] in support of anti-communist forces. In the meantime, both the Bolsheviks and White movement carried out campaigns of deportations and executions against each other, known respectively as the [[Red Terror]] and [[White Terror (Russia)|White Terror]]. By the end of the violent civil war, Russia's economy and infrastructure were heavily damaged, and as many as 10 million perished during the war, mostly civilians. Millions became [[White émigré]]s, and the [[Russian famine of 1921–1922]] claimed up to five&nbsp;million victims.

=== Soviet Union ===
{{Main|History of the Soviet Union}}
[[File:Soviet Union - Russian SFSR (1936).svg|thumb|left|Location of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] (red) within the [[Soviet Union]] in 1936]]

====Command economy and Soviet society====
On 30 December 1922, Lenin and his aides [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|formed]] the [[Soviet Union]], by joining the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] into a single state with the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian]], [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian]], and [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian]] republics. Eventually internal border changes and annexations during World War II created a union of [[republics of the Soviet Union|15 republics]], the largest in size and population being the Russian SFSR, which dominated the union politically, culturally, and economically.

Following [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's death]] in 1924, a [[List of Troikas in the Soviet Union|troika]] was designated to take charge. Eventually [[Joseph Stalin]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], managed to suppress all opposition factions and consolidate power in his hands to become the country's dictator by the 1930s. [[Leon Trotsky]], the main proponent of [[world revolution]], was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1929, and Stalin's idea of [[Socialism in One Country]] became the official line. The continued internal struggle in the Bolshevik party culminated in the [[Great Purge]].

====Stalinism and modernisation====
[[File:Telegram Stalin STZ.jpg|thumb|Congratulations sent by [[Joseph Stalin]] on the opening of the [[Volgograd Tractor Plant|Stalingrad Tractor Plant]]]]
Under Stalin's leadership, the government launched a [[command economy]], [[Industrialization in the USSR|industrialisation of the largely rural country]], and [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivisation]] of [[Agriculture in the USSR|its agriculture]]. During this period of rapid economic and social change, millions of people were sent to [[Gulag|penal labour camps]], including many political convicts for their suspected or real opposition to Stalin's rule, and millions were [[population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported and exiled]] to remote areas of the Soviet Union. The transitional disorganisation of the country's agriculture, combined with the harsh state policies and a drought, led to the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933]], which killed 5.7 to 8.7 million, 3.3 million of them in the Russian SFSR. The Soviet Union, ultimately, made the costly transformation from a largely agrarian economy to a major industrial powerhouse within a short span of time.

====World War II and United Nations====

The Soviet Union entered [[World War II]] on 17 September 1939 with its [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invasion of Poland]], in accordance with a secret protocol within the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]]. The Soviet Union later [[Winter War|invaded Finland]], and [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|occupied and annexed the Baltic states]], as well as [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|parts of Romania]].{{rp|91–95}} On 22 June 1941, Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]], opening the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], the largest theater of World War&nbsp;II.{{rp|7}}

Eventually, some 5 million [[Red Army]] troops were captured by the Nazis;{{rp|272}} the latter deliberately [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|starved to death or otherwise killed]] 3.3&nbsp;million Soviet [[Prisoner of war|POW]]s, and a vast number of civilians, as the "[[Hunger Plan]]" sought to fulfil [[Generalplan Ost]].{{rp|175–186}} Although the [[Wehrmacht]] had considerable early success, their attack was halted in the [[Battle of Moscow]]. Subsequently, the Germans were dealt major defeats first at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in the winter of 1942–1943, and then in the [[Battle of Kursk]] in the summer of 1943. Another German failure was the [[Siege of Leningrad]], in which the city was fully blockaded on land between 1941 and 1944 by German and Finnish forces, and suffered starvation and more than a million deaths, but never surrendered. Soviet forces steamrolled through Eastern and Central Europe in 1944–1945 and [[Battle of Berlin|captured Berlin]] in May 1945. In August 1945, the Red Army [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invaded Manchuria]] and [[Soviet–Japanese War|ousted the Japanese]] from Northeast Asia, contributing to the Allied victory over Japan.

The 1941–1945 period of World War&nbsp;II is known in Russia as the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]. The Soviet Union, along with the United States, the United Kingdom and China were considered the Big Four of Allied powers in World War II, and later became the [[Four Policemen]], which was the foundation of the [[United Nations Security Council]].{{rp|27}} During the war, [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|Soviet civilian and military death were about 26–27 million]], accounting for about half of all [[World War&nbsp;II casualties]].{{rp|295}} The [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economy]] and infrastructure suffered massive devastation, which caused the [[Soviet famine of 1946–1947]]. However, at the expense of a large sacrifice, the Soviet Union emerged as a global superpower.

====Superpower and Cold War====

After World War II, according to the [[Potsdam Conference]], the [[Red Army]] occupied parts of Eastern and Central Europe, including [[East Germany]] and the eastern regions of [[Austria]]. Dependent communist governments were installed in the [[Eastern Bloc]] satellite states. After becoming the world's second [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear power]], the Soviet Union established the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance, and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the [[Cold War]], with the rivalling United States and [[NATO]].

====Khrushchev Thaw reforms and economic development====
After [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|Stalin's death]] in 1953 and a short period of [[Collective leadership|collective rule]], the new leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] denounced [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Stalin]] and launched the policy of [[de-Stalinization]], releasing many political prisoners from the [[Gulag]] labour camps. The general easement of repressive policies became known later as the [[Khrushchev Thaw]]. At the same time, Cold War tensions reached its peak when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the United States [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter missiles]] in Turkey and Soviet [[Cuban Missile Crisis|missiles in Cuba]].

In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial [[satellite]], ''[[Sputnik&nbsp;1]]'', thus starting the [[Space Age]]. Russian [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first human to orbit the Earth, aboard the ''[[Vostok&nbsp;1]]'' crewed spacecraft on [[Cosmonautics Day|12 April 1961]].

====Period of developed socialism or Era of Stagnation====
Following the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, another period of [[Collectivity of leadership|collective rule]] ensued, until [[Leonid Brezhnev]] became the leader. The era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was later designated as the [[Era of Stagnation]]. The 1965 [[Kosygin reform]] aimed for partial [[decentralisation]] of the [[Soviet economy]]. In 1979, after a [[Saur Revolution|communist-led revolution]] in Afghanistan, Soviet forces invaded the country, ultimately starting the [[Soviet–Afghan War]]. In May 1988, the [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|Soviets started to withdraw from Afghanistan]], due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens.

====Perestroika, democratisation and Russian sovereignty====

From 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring) in an attempt to end the [[Era of Stagnation|period of economic stagnation]] and to [[Demokratizatsiya (Soviet Union)|democratise the government]]. This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements across the country. Prior to 1991, the Soviet economy was the world's second-largest, but during its final years, it went into a crisis.

By 1991, economic and political turmoil began to boil over as the [[Baltic states]] chose to secede from the Soviet Union. On 17 March, a [[1991 Soviet Union referendum|referendum]] was held, in which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into a [[New Union Treaty|renewed federation]]. In June 1991, [[Boris Yeltsin]] became the first directly elected [[President of Russia|President]] in Russian history when he was [[1991 Russian presidential election|elected]] President of the Russian SFSR. In August 1991, [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|a coup d'état attempt]] by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led to the end of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. On 25 December 1991, following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], along with contemporary Russia, fourteen other [[post-Soviet states]] emerged.

====Transition to a market economy and political crises====

The economic and political collapse of the Soviet Union led Russia into a deep and prolonged depression. During and after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, wide-ranging reforms including [[Privatization in Russia|privatisation]] and [[free trade|market and trade liberalisation]] were undertaken, including radical changes along the lines of "[[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]". The privatisation largely shifted control of enterprises from state agencies to individuals with inside connections in the government, which led to the rise of [[Russian oligarchs]]. Many of the newly rich moved billions in cash and assets outside of the country in an enormous [[capital flight]]. The depression of the economy led to the collapse of social services—the [[birth rate]] plummeted while the [[death rate]] skyrocketed, and millions plunged into poverty, while extreme corruption, as well as criminal gangs and organised crime rose significantly.

In late 1993, tensions between Yeltsin and the Russian parliament culminated in [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|a constitutional crisis]] which ended violently through military force. During the crisis, Yeltsin was backed by Western governments, and over 100 people were killed.

==== Modern liberal constitution, international cooperation and economic stabilisation ====
In December, a [[1993 Russian constitutional referendum|referendum]] was held and approved, which introduced a new constitution, giving the president enormous powers. The 1990s were plagued by armed conflicts in the [[North Caucasus]], both local ethnic skirmishes and separatist [[Islamist]] insurrections. From the time [[Chechnya|Chechen]] separatists declared independence in the early 1990s, an [[First Chechen War|intermittent guerrilla war]] was fought between the rebel groups and Russian forces. [[Terrorism in Russia|Terrorist attacks against civilians]] were carried out by Chechen separatists, claiming the lives of thousands of Russian civilians.{{efn|Most notably the [[Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis]], the [[Russian apartment bombings]], the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]], and the [[Beslan school siege]]}}

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia assumed responsibility for settling the latter's external debts. In 1992, most consumer price controls were eliminated, causing extreme inflation and significantly devaluing the rouble. High budget deficits coupled with increasing capital flight and inability to pay back debts, caused the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]], which resulted in a further GDP decline.

====Movement towards a modernised economy, political centralisation and democratic backsliding====
{{Further|Putinism}}
On 31 December 1999, President Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned, handing the post to the recently appointed prime minister and his chosen successor, [[Vladimir Putin]]. Putin then won the [[2000 Russian presidential election|2000 presidential election]], and defeated the Chechen insurgency in the [[Second Chechen War]].

Putin won a [[2004 Russian presidential election|second presidential term]] in 2004. [[Price of petroleum|High oil prices]] and a rise in foreign investment saw the [[Russian economy]] and living standards improve significantly. Putin's rule increased stability, while transforming Russia into an [[Authoritarianism#Examples|authoritarian state]]. In 2008, Putin took the post of prime minister, while [[Dmitry Medvedev]] was [[2008 Russian presidential election|elected President]] for one term, to hold onto power despite legal [[term limit]]s; this period has been described as a "[[Medvedev–Putin tandemocracy|tandemocracy]]".
Following a [[2008 Russo-Georgian diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis]] with neighbouring [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the [[Russo-Georgian War]] took place during 1–12 August 2008, resulting in Russia recognising two separatist states in the territories that it [[occupied territories of Georgia|occupies in Georgia]]. It was the first [[List of conflicts in Europe|European war]] of the 21st century. The [[2008 amendments to the Constitution of Russia|2008 constitutional amendments]] saw the terms of the president extend to six years and the lower house (State Duma) to five years. Putin then went on to win the [[2012 Russian presidential election|2012 presidential election]], which fueled the "[[2011–2013 Russian protests|Snow Revolution]]" protests.

====Invasion of Ukraine====

[[File:Annexation of Southern and Eastern Ukraine.svg|thumb|[[Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine]] as of 30 September 2022 at the time their [[Russian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts|annexation was declared]]]]
In early 2014, following [[Revolution of Dignity|a pro-Western revolution]] in neighbouring Ukraine, Russia [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexed Crimea]] after a [[2014 Crimean status referendum|disputed referendum]] on the status of Crimea was staged under [[Russian occupation of Crimea|Russian occupation]]. The annexation generated an insurgency in the [[Donbas]] region of Ukraine, supported by Russian military intervention as part of [[Russo-Ukrainian War|an undeclared war against Ukraine]]. Russian mercenaries and military forces, with the support of local separatist militias, waged a [[War in Donbas|war in eastern Ukraine]] against the new Ukrainian government after the Russian government fostered anti-government and [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|pro-Russian protests]] in the region, although most residents had opposed secession from Ukraine. Amidst [[2017–2018 Russian protests|nationwide protests against corruption]], Putin was re-elected for his second consecutive term in the [[2018 Russian presidential election|2018 presidential election]].

In a major escalation of the conflict, Russia launched a full-scale [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|invasion of Ukraine]] on 24 February 2022. The invasion marked the largest [[conventional warfare|conventional war]] in Europe since World War&nbsp;II, and was met with [[Reactions to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|international condemnation]], as well as [[International sanctions during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|expanded sanctions]] against Russia.

[[File:Meeting with military district commanders (2024-05-15) 14.jpg|thumb|Putin with [[Sergei Shoigu|Shoigu]], [[Valery Gerasimov|Gerasimov]], [[Andrey Belousov|Belousov]], [[Yunus-bek Yevkurov|Yevkurov]] and commanders of Russia's [[military districts of Russia|military districts]] on 15 May 2024]]
As a result, Russia was expelled from the [[Council of Europe]] in March, and was suspended from the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in April. In September, following successful Ukrainian counteroffensives, Putin announced a "[[2022 Russian mobilization|partial mobilisation]]", Russia's first mobilisation since [[Operation Barbarossa]]. In the end of September, Putin proclaimed the [[Annexation of southeastern Ukraine by the Russian Federation|annexation of four partially-occupied Ukrainian regions]], the largest annexation in Europe since World War&nbsp;II. Putin and Russian-installed leaders signed treaties of accession, internationally unrecognised and widely [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/4|denounced as illegal]]. As a result of the invasion, hundreds of thousands of people are [[Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War|estimated to have been killed or injured]], while Russia has been accused of [[War crimes in the Russian invasion of Ukraine|numerous war crimes]]. The war in Ukraine has further exacerbated Russia's [[Demographic crisis of Russia|demographic crisis]].

In June 2023, the [[Wagner Group]], a private military contractor fighting for Russia in Ukraine, declared an [[Wagner Group rebellion|open rebellion against the Russian Ministry of Defence]], capturing [[Rostov-on-Don]], before beginning a march on Moscow. However, after negotiations between Wagner and the Belarusian government, the rebellion was called off. The leader of the rebellion, [[Yevgeny Prigozhin]], was later [[2023 Wagner Group plane crash|killed in a plane crash]]. Putin won his third consecutive term in the [[2024 Russian presidential election|2024 presidential election]], by winning 88% of the vote, the highest percentage in a presidential election in post-Soviet Russia.
