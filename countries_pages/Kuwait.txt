{{Main|History of Kuwait}}

===Antiquity===
Following the post-glacial flooding of the [[Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf basin]], debris from the [[Tigris–Euphrates river system|Tigris–Euphrates river]] formed a substantial delta, creating most of the land in present-day Kuwait and establishing the present coastlines. One of the earliest evidence of human presence in Kuwait dates back to the [[Mesolithic]] era (c. 8000 BC). Historically, most of present-day Kuwait was part of ancient [[Mesopotamia]].

During the [[Ubaid period]] (c. 5500–3700 BC), Kuwait was the central site of interaction between the peoples of [[Mesopotamia]] and Neolithic [[Eastern Arabia]], including [[Bahra 1]] and [[H3 (Kuwait)|site H3]] in [[Subiya, Kuwait|Subiya]]. The Neolithic inhabitants of Kuwait were among the world's earliest maritime traders. One of the world's earliest [[reed boats]] was discovered at [[H3 (Kuwait)|site H3]] dating back to the Ubaid period. Other Neolithic sites in Kuwait are located in Khiran and [[Sulaibikhat]].

[[Mesopotamian]]s first settled in the Kuwaiti island of [[Failaka Island|Failaka]] in 2000 BC. and [[Failaka Island|Failaka]].

During the Dilmun era (from ca. 3000 BC), Failaka was known as "[[Agarum (toponym)|Agarum]]", the land of [[Enzak]], a great god in the Dilmun civilization according to Sumerian cuneiform texts found on the island. After the Dilmun civilization, Failaka was inhabited by the [[Kassites]] of [[Mesopotamia]], and was formally under the control of the [[Kassites#Kassite Dynasty of Babylon|Kassite dynasty of Babylon]]. Many of the artifacts found in Falaika are linked to Mesopotamian civilizations and seem to show that Failaka was gradually drawn toward the civilization based in [[Antioch]].

Under [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], the bay of Kuwait was under [[Babylonia]]n control. Cuneiform documents found in Failaka indicate the presence of Babylonians in the island's population. [[List of Kings of Babylon|Babylonian Kings]] were present in Failaka during the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] period, [[Nabonidus]] had a governor in Failaka and Nebuchadnezzar II had a palace and temple in Falaika. Failaka also contained temples dedicated to the worship of [[Shamash]], the Mesopotamian sun god in the Babylonian pantheon. Failaka was under the control of the Achaemenid Empire as evidenced by the archaeological discovery of Achaemenid strata. There are [[Aramaic]] inscriptions that testify Achaemenid presence. The bay of Kuwait was named ''Hieros Kolpos''. According to [[Strabo]] and [[Arrian]], Alexander the Great named Failaka ''Ikaros'' because it resembled the [[Aegean island|Aegean Island]] of that name in size and shape. Elements of [[Greek mythology]] were mixed with the local cults. "Ikaros" was also the name of a prominent city situated in Failaka. Large [[Hellenistic]] [[Towns of ancient Greece#Military settlements|fort]]s and [[Greek temple]]s were uncovered. Archaeological remains of Greek colonization were also discovered in Akkaz, Umm an Namil, and Subiya. Failaka was located 15 kilometers from the mouth of the Euphrates river. Characene was centered in the region encompassing southern Mesopotamia, Characene coins were discovered in Akkaz, Umm an Namil, and Failaka. A busy Parthian commercial station was situated in Kuwait.

In 224 AD, Kuwait became part of the [[Sassanid Empire]]. At the time of the Sassanid Empire, Kuwait was known as ''Meshan'', which was an alternative name of the kingdom of Characene. Akkaz was a [[Parthian Empire|Partho]]-[[Sassanian]] site; Late Sassanian settlements were discovered in Failaka. In [[Bubiyan Island|Bubiyan]], there is archaeological evidence of Sassanian to early Islamic periods of human presence as evidenced by the recent discovery of torpedo-jar pottery shards on several prominent beach ridges.

In 636 AD, the [[Battle of Chains]] between the Sassanid Empire and [[Rashidun Caliphate]] was fought in Kuwait. As a result of Rashidun victory in 636 AD, the bay of Kuwait was home to the city of [[Kazma]] (also known as "Kadhima" or "Kāzimah") in the early Islamic era.

In the early to mid 1700s, [[Kuwait City]] was a small [[fishing village]]. Administratively, it was a sheikhdom, ruled by [[sheikh]]s from the local [[Bani Khalid]] clan. Sometime in the mid 1700s, the [[Bani Utbah]] settled in Kuwait City. Sometime after the death of the Bani Khalid's leader Barak bin Abdul Mohsen and the fall of the [[Bani Khalid Emirate]], the Utub were able to wrest control of Kuwait as a result of successive [[Marriage of state|matrimonial alliances]]. By the late-1700s, Kuwait had established itself as a trading route from the Persian Gulf to [[Aleppo]]. As a result, Kuwait's maritime commerce boomed, The [[East India Company]] was diverted to Kuwait in 1792. The East India Company secured the sea routes between Kuwait, India and the east coasts of Africa. The flight of many of Basra's leading merchants to Kuwait continued to play a significant role in Basra's commercial stagnation well into the 1850s. In the late 18th century, Kuwait was a haven for Basra merchants fleeing [[Ottoman government|Ottoman]] persecution. Kuwait was the center of [[boat building]] in the Persian Gulf, its ships renowned throughout the [[Indian Ocean]]. Its sailors developed a positive reputation in the Persian Gulf. In the 19th century, Kuwait became significant in the [[horse trading|horse trade]], with regular shipments in sailing vessels.

After the [[Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913]], Kuwait was established as an autonomous ''[[kaza]],'' or district, of the Ottoman Empire and a ''[[de facto]]'' protectorate of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]].]]
After the [[Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913]], Kuwait was established as an autonomous ''[[kaza]],'' or district, of the Ottoman Empire and a ''[[de facto]]'' protectorate of Great Britain.

During [[World War I]], the [[British Empire]] imposed a trade blockade against Kuwait because its ruler at the time, [[Salim Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah]], supported the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The British economic blockade heavily damaged Kuwait's economy. The Ikhwan attack repulsed for the while, negotiations began between Salim and Al-Dawish; the latter threatened another attack if the Kuwaiti forces did not surrender. The local merchant class convinced Salim to call in help from British troops, who showed up with airplanes and three warships, ending the attacks. After the Battle of Jahra, Ibn Saud's warriors, the [[Ikhwan]], demanded that Kuwait follows five rules. They demanded that all the [[Shias]] be evicted, that all should adopt the [[Wahhabism|Ikhwan doctrine]], that the Turks be labelled "[[heretics]]", that smoking, [[Munkar and Nakir|munkar]], and prostitution be abolished, and that American missionary hospital be destroyed.

[[File:Jahra-castle.jpg|thumb|The [[Kuwait Red Fort]] in [[Al Jahra]]]]
The [[Kuwait–Najd War]] of 1919–20 erupted in the [[aftermath of World War I]]. The war occurred because [[Ibn Saud]] of Najd wanted to annex Kuwait. The sharpened conflict between Kuwait and Najd led to the death of hundreds of Kuwaitis. The war resulted in sporadic border clashes throughout 1919–1920.

When [[Percy Cox]] was informed of the border clashes in Kuwait, he sent a letter to the [[Emirate of Arabistan|Ruler of Arabistan]] Sheikh [[Khazʽal Ibn Jabir]] offering the Kuwaiti throne to either him or one of his heirs. Khaz'al refused. He then asked: {{blockquote|...even so, do you think that you have come to me with something new? Al Mubarak's position as ruler of Kuwait means that I am the true ruler of Kuwait. So there is no difference between myself and them, for they are like the dearest of my children and you are aware of this. Had someone else come to me with this offer, I would have complained about them to you. So how do you come to me with this offer when you are well aware that myself and Al Mubarak are one soul and one house, what affects them affects me, whether good or evil. The goal of the Saudi economic and military attacks on Kuwait was to annex as much of Kuwait's territory as possible. At the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Uqair conference]] in 1922, the boundaries of Kuwait and Najd were set; as a result of British interference, Kuwait had no representative at the Uqair conference. After the Uqair conference, Kuwait was still subjected to a Saudi economic blockade and intermittent Saudi [[Raid (military)|raiding]].

Kuwait immensely declined in regional economic importance, Kuwait's [[pearl]] industry also collapsed as a result of the worldwide economic depression. In 1946, crude oil was exported for the first time. In 1950, a major public-work programme began to enable Kuwaiti citizens to enjoy a luxurious standard of living.

By 1952, the country became the largest oil exporter in the Persian Gulf region. This massive growth attracted many foreign workers, especially from Palestine, Iran, India, and Egypt – with the latter being particularly political within the context of the [[Arab Cold War]]. It was also in 1952 that the first masterplan of Kuwait was designed by the British planning firm of [[Anthony Minoprio|Minoprio]], [[Hugh Spencely|Spenceley]], and Macfarlane. In 1958, ''[[Al-Arabi (magazine)|Al-Arabi]]'' magazine was first published. Many foreign writers moved to Kuwait because they enjoyed greater [[freedom of expression]] than elsewhere in the Middle East. Kuwait's press was described as one of the [[Freedom of the press|freest in the world]]. Kuwait was the pioneer of the post-[[Nahda]] literary renaissance in the Middle East.

At the time, Kuwait was considered the most developed country in the region. Kuwait was the pioneer in the Middle East in diversifying its earnings away from oil exports. The [[Kuwait Investment Authority]] is the world's first sovereign wealth fund.

Kuwaiti society embraced liberal and non-traditional attitudes throughout the 1960s and 1970s. For example, most Kuwaiti women did not wear the [[hijab]] in the 1960s and 70s.

[[File:HMS Victorious (R38) aerial c1959.jpeg|thumb| [[HMS Victorious (R38)|HMS ''Victorious'']] taking part in [[Operation Vantage]] in July 1961]]
Although Kuwait formally gained independence in 1961, Iraq initially refused to recognize the country's independence by maintaining that Kuwait is part of Iraq, albeit Iraq later briefly backed down following a show of force by Britain and [[Arab League]] support of Kuwait's independence.

The short-lived [[Operation Vantage]] crisis evolved in July 1961, as the Iraqi government threatened to invade Kuwait and the invasion was finally averted following plans by the Arab League to form an international Arab force against the potential Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. As a result of Operation Vantage, the Arab League took over the border security of Kuwait and the British had withdrawn their forces by 19 October. Under the terms of the newly drafted [[Constitution of Kuwait|Constitution]], Kuwait held its first [[Kuwaiti parliamentary election, 1963|parliamentary elections in 1963]].

[[Kuwait University]] was established in 1966.

The [[Kuwait-Iraq 1973 Sanita border skirmish|Kuwait-Iraq 1973 Samita border skirmish]] evolved on 20 March 1973, when Iraqi army units occupied El-Samitah near the Kuwaiti border, which evoked an international crisis.

On 6 February 1974, [[1974 attack on the Japanese Embassy in Kuwait|Palestinian militants occupied the Japanese embassy in Kuwait]], taking the ambassador and ten others hostage. The militants' motive was to support the [[Japanese Red Army]] members and Palestinian militants who were holding hostages on a Singaporean ferry in what is known as the [[Laju incident|''Laju'' incident]]. Ultimately, the hostages were released, and the guerrillas allowed to fly to [[Aden]]. This was the first time Palestinian guerrillas struck in Kuwait as the Al Sabah ruling family, headed by Sheikh Sabah Al-Salim Al-Sabah, funded the Palestinian resistance movement. Kuwait had been a regular endpoint for Palestinian [[aircraft hijacking|plane hijacking]] in the past and had considered itself safe.

[[Kuwait International Airport]] was opened in 1979 by the Al Hani Construction with a joint venture of [[Ballast Nedam]].

===1981–1991: Wars and terrorism===
{{main|1983–1988 Kuwait terror attacks|Gulf War}}
The Al Sabah strongly advocated [[Islamism]] throughout the 1980s. At that time, the most serious threat to the continuity of Al Sabah came from home-grown democrats,

Simultaneously, Kuwait experienced a major [[economic crisis]] after the [[Souk Al-Manakh stock market crash]] and [[1980s oil glut|decrease in oil price]].

[[File:Tankskuwait.jpg|thumb|left|[[Iraqi Armed Forces]] tanks in [[Kuwait City]] of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait on 2 August 1990 during the [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] that began the Gulf War.]]

After the Iran–Iraq War ended, Kuwait declined an Iraqi request to forgive its US$65&nbsp;billion debt. An economic rivalry between the two countries ensued after Kuwait increased its oil production by 40 percent. Tensions between the two countries increased further in July 1990, after Iraq complained to [[OPEC]] claiming that Kuwait was stealing its oil from a field near the border by [[slant drilling]] of the [[Rumaila field]].

During the Iraqi occupation, nearly 1,000 civilians were killed in Kuwait. In addition, 600 people went missing during Iraq's occupation; remains of approximately 375 were found in mass graves in Iraq. Kuwait celebrates 26 February as [[Liberation Day (Kuwait)|Liberation Day]].

===1992–present: Present era===
{{see also|Kuwait and state-sponsored terrorism}}
In the early 1990s, Kuwait [[Palestinian exodus from Kuwait (Gulf War)|deported]] nearly 400,000 Palestinians. Kuwait's policy was a form of [[collective punishment]], in response to the alignment of the [[PLO]] with Saddam Hussein. Kuwait also deported thousands of Iraqis and Yemenis after the Gulf War. Hundreds of thousands of [[Bedoon|stateless Bedoon]] were also expelled from Kuwait in the early-to-mid 1990s. Many of the stateless Bedoon fled to Iraq where they remain stateless people even today.

In March 2003, Kuwait became the springboard for the US-led [[invasion of Iraq]]. In 2005, women won the right to vote and run in elections. Upon the death of the Emir Jaber in January 2006, Sheikh [[Saad Al-Sabah]] succeeded him but was removed nine days later due to his failing health. As a result, Sheikh [[Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]] was sworn in as Emir. From that point onwards, Kuwait suffered from chronic political deadlock between the government and parliament which resulted in multiple cabinet reshuffles and dissolutions. China awarded Kuwait Investment Authority an additional $700 million quota on top of $300 million awarded in March 2012.

In March 2014,  [[David S. Cohen (attorney)|David S. Cohen]], who was then the United States [[Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence|Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence]], and many others accused [[Kuwait and state-sponsored terrorism|Kuwait of funding terrorism]], particularly for [[ISIS]] and [[Al-Qaeda]].

On 26 June 2015, a [[2015 Kuwait mosque bombing|suicide bombing took place]] at a Shia Muslim mosque in Kuwait. The [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] claimed responsibility for the attack. Twenty-seven people were killed and 227 people were wounded. It was the largest terror attack in Kuwait's history. In the aftermath, a lawsuit was filed accusing the Kuwaiti government of negligence and direct responsibility for the terror attack.

Due to [[2010s oil glut|declining oil prices]] in the mid-to-late 2010s, Kuwait faced one of the worst economic crunches in its history. [[Sabah Al Ahmad Sea City]] was inaugurated in mid-2016. Simultaneously, Kuwait invested significantly in its economic relations with [[China]]. China has been Kuwait's largest trade partner since 2016.

Under the [[Belt and Road Initiative]], Kuwait and China have various cooperation projects including [[Al-Mutlaa]] which is currently under construction in northern Kuwait. The [[Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Causeway]] is part of the first phase of the [[Madinat al-Hareer|Silk City]] project. it connects Kuwait City to northern Kuwait. Kuwait's economy faced a budget deficit of $46 billion in 2020. In September 2020, Kuwait's Crown Prince Sheikh [[Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]] became the 16th Emir of Kuwait and the successor to Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, who died at the age of 91. In October 2020, Sheikh [[Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]] was appointed as the Crown Prince. In December 2023, Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah died and was replaced by Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah''.''

Kuwait currently has the largest US military presence in the entire Middle East region. Kuwait is now the region's most oil-dependent country with the lowest share of economic diversification.

Since March 2024, Kuwait has been [[Human rights in Kuwait#Citizenship revocation|revoking the citizenship]] of many citizens (by decree). By March 2025, Kuwait revoked the citizenship of 42,000 people in just six months. The most high-profile revocation was that of singer [[Nawal El Kuwaitia|Nawal]] and actor Dawood Hussain in early December 2024. According to ''[[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|Carnegie Endowment]]'', Kuwait has weaponized citizenship revocation as a tool for political control.<ref name=demographic_engineering/>
