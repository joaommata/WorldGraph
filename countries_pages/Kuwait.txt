{{Main|History of Kuwait}}

===Antiquity===
Following the post-glacial flooding of the [[Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf basin]], debris from the [[Tigris–Euphrates river system|Tigris–Euphrates river]] formed a substantial delta, creating most of the land in present-day Kuwait and establishing the present coastlines. One of the earliest evidence of human presence in Kuwait dates back to the [[Mesolithic]] era (c. 8000 BC). Historically, most of present-day Kuwait was part of ancient [[Mesopotamia]].

During the [[Ubaid period]] (c. 5500–3700 BC), Kuwait was the central site of interaction between the peoples of [[Mesopotamia]] and Neolithic [[Eastern Arabia]], including [[Bahra 1]] and [[H3 (Kuwait)|site H3]] in [[Subiya, Kuwait|Subiya]]. The Neolithic inhabitants of Kuwait were among the world's earliest maritime traders. One of the world's earliest [[reed boats]] was discovered at [[H3 (Kuwait)|site H3]] dating back to the Ubaid period. Other Neolithic sites in Kuwait are located in Khiran and [[Sulaibikhat]].

[[Mesopotamian]]s first settled in the Kuwaiti island of [[Failaka Island|Failaka]] in 2000 BC. Traders from the [[Sumer]]ian city of [[Ur]] inhabited Failaka and ran a mercantile business. The island had many Mesopotamian-style buildings typical of those found in [[Iraq]] dating from around 2000 BC. In 4000 BC until 2000 BC, Kuwait was home to the [[Dilmun civilization]]. Dilmun included Al-Shadadiya, [[Akkaz Island|Akkaz]], [[Umm an Namil Island|Umm an Namil]], and [[Failaka Island|Failaka]]. At its peak in 2000 BC, Dilmun controlled the [[Persian Gulf]] trading routes.

During the Dilmun era (from ca. 3000 BC), Failaka was known as "[[Agarum (toponym)|Agarum]]", the land of [[Enzak]], a great god in the Dilmun civilization according to Sumerian cuneiform texts found on the island. As part of Dilmun, Failaka became a hub for the civilization from the end of the 3rd to the middle of the 1st millennium BC. After the Dilmun civilization, Failaka was inhabited by the [[Kassites]] of [[Mesopotamia]], and was formally under the control of the [[Kassites#Kassite Dynasty of Babylon|Kassite dynasty of Babylon]]. Studies indicate traces of human settlement can be found on Failaka dating back to as early as the end of the 3rd millennium BC, and extending until the 20th century AD. Many of the artifacts found in Falaika are linked to Mesopotamian civilizations and seem to show that Failaka was gradually drawn toward the civilization based in [[Antioch]].
[[File:Achaemenid_Empire_500_BCE.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Achaemenid Empire]] at its greatest territorial extent]]
Under [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], the bay of Kuwait was under [[Babylonia]]n control. Cuneiform documents found in Failaka indicate the presence of Babylonians in the island's population. [[List of Kings of Babylon|Babylonian Kings]] were present in Failaka during the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] period, [[Nabonidus]] had a governor in Failaka and Nebuchadnezzar II had a palace and temple in Falaika. Failaka also contained temples dedicated to the worship of [[Shamash]], the Mesopotamian sun god in the Babylonian pantheon.

Following the [[Fall of Babylon]], the bay of Kuwait came under the control of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (c. 550‒330 BC) as the bay was repopulated after seven centuries of abandonment. Failaka was under the control of the Achaemenid Empire as evidenced by the archaeological discovery of Achaemenid strata. There are [[Aramaic]] inscriptions that testify Achaemenid presence.

In fourth century BC, the [[ancient Greeks]] colonized the bay of Kuwait under [[Alexander the Great]]. The ancient Greeks named mainland Kuwait ''Larissa'' and Failaka was named ''[[Ikaros (Failaka Island)|Ikaros]]''. The bay of Kuwait was named ''Hieros Kolpos''. According to [[Strabo]] and [[Arrian]], Alexander the Great named Failaka ''Ikaros'' because it resembled the [[Aegean island|Aegean Island]] of that name in size and shape. Elements of [[Greek mythology]] were mixed with the local cults. "Ikaros" was also the name of a prominent city situated in Failaka. Large [[Hellenistic]] [[Towns of ancient Greece#Military settlements|fort]]s and [[Greek temple]]s were uncovered. Archaeological remains of Greek colonization were also discovered in Akkaz, Umm an Namil, and Subiya.

[[File:Seleucid_Empire_alternative_map.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Seleucid Empire]] at its greatest extent]]
At the time of Alexander the Great, the mouth of the [[Euphrates|Euphrates River]] was located in northern Kuwait. The Euphrates river flowed directly into the Persian Gulf via Khor [[Subiya, Kuwait|Subiya]] which was a river channel at the time. Failaka was located 15 kilometers from the mouth of the Euphrates river. By the first century BC, the Khor Subiya river channel dried out completely.

In 127 BC, Kuwait was part of the [[Parthian Empire]] and the kingdom of [[Characene]] was established around [[Teredon]] in present-day Kuwait. Characene was centered in the region encompassing southern Mesopotamia, Characene coins were discovered in Akkaz, Umm an Namil, and Failaka. A busy Parthian commercial station was situated in Kuwait.

In 224 AD, Kuwait became part of the [[Sassanid Empire]]. At the time of the Sassanid Empire, Kuwait was known as ''Meshan'', which was an alternative name of the kingdom of Characene. Akkaz was a [[Parthian Empire|Partho]]-[[Sassanian]] site; the [[Zoroastrianism|Sassanid religion]]'s [[tower of silence]] was discovered in northern Akkaz. Late Sassanian settlements were discovered in Failaka. In [[Bubiyan Island|Bubiyan]], there is archaeological evidence of Sassanian to early Islamic periods of human presence as evidenced by the recent discovery of torpedo-jar pottery shards on several prominent beach ridges.

In 636 AD, the [[Battle of Chains]] between the Sassanid Empire and [[Rashidun Caliphate]] was fought in Kuwait. As a result of Rashidun victory in 636 AD, the bay of Kuwait was home to the city of [[Kazma]] (also known as "Kadhima" or "Kāzimah") in the early Islamic era.

===1752–1945: Pre-oil===

[[File:MarinetimeMKuwaitAlshami.jpg|thumb|right|[[Al-Hashemi-II|Marine Museum]] in Kuwait City. Demonstrates the founding of Kuwait as a sea port for merchants.]]
In the early to mid 1700s, [[Kuwait City]] was a small [[fishing village]]. Administratively, it was a sheikhdom, ruled by [[sheikh]]s from the local [[Bani Khalid]] clan. Sometime in the mid 1700s, the [[Bani Utbah]] settled in Kuwait City. Sometime after the death of the Bani Khalid's leader Barak bin Abdul Mohsen and the fall of the [[Bani Khalid Emirate]], the Utub were able to wrest control of Kuwait as a result of successive [[Marriage of state|matrimonial alliances]].

In the latter half of the eighteenth century, Kuwait began establishing itself as a maritime [[port]] and gradually became a principal commercial center for the transit of goods between [[Baghdad]], India, Persia, [[Muscat]], and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. By the late-1700s, Kuwait had established itself as a trading route from the Persian Gulf to [[Aleppo]]. During the [[Ottoman–Persian War (1775–1776)|Persian siege of Basra in 1775–79]], Iraqi merchants took refuge in Kuwait and were partly instrumental in the expansion of Kuwait's boat-building and trading activities. As a result, Kuwait's maritime commerce boomed, as the Indian trade routes with Baghdad, Aleppo, [[Smyrna]] and [[Constantinople]] were diverted to Kuwait during this time. The [[East India Company]] was diverted to Kuwait in 1792. The East India Company secured the sea routes between Kuwait, India and the east coasts of Africa. After the Persians withdrew from [[Basra]] in 1779, Kuwait continued to attract trade away from Basra. The flight of many of Basra's leading merchants to Kuwait continued to play a significant role in Basra's commercial stagnation well into the 1850s.

The instability in Basra helped foster economic prosperity in Kuwait. In the late 18th century, Kuwait was a haven for Basra merchants fleeing [[Ottoman government|Ottoman]] persecution. Kuwait was the center of [[boat building]] in the Persian Gulf, its ships renowned throughout the [[Indian Ocean]]. Its sailors developed a positive reputation in the Persian Gulf. In the 19th century, Kuwait became significant in the [[horse trading|horse trade]], with regular shipments in sailing vessels. In the mid 19th century, it was estimated that Kuwait exported an average of 800 horses to India annually.

In 1899, ruler Sheikh [[Mubarak Al-Sabah|Mubarak Al Sabah]] signed an agreement with the [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British government in India]] (subsequently known as the [[Anglo-Kuwaiti Agreement of 1899]]) making Kuwait a [[British protectorate]]. This gave Britain exclusive access and trade with Kuwait, while denying Ottoman and Germany provinces to the north a port on the Persian Gulf. The [[Sheikhdom of Kuwait]] remained a British protectorate until 1961.

[[File:Basra Province 1897.png|left|thumb|The [[Basra Vilayet (Ottoman Empire)|Basra ''Vilayet'']] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1897. After the [[Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913]], Kuwait was established as an autonomous ''[[kaza]],'' or district, of the Ottoman Empire and a ''[[de facto]]'' protectorate of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]].]]
After the [[Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913]], Kuwait was established as an autonomous ''[[kaza]],'' or district, of the Ottoman Empire and a ''[[de facto]]'' protectorate of Great Britain.

During [[World War I]], the [[British Empire]] imposed a trade blockade against Kuwait because its ruler at the time, [[Salim Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah]], supported the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The British economic blockade heavily damaged Kuwait's economy.

In 1919, Sheikh [[Salim Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah]] intended to build a commercial city in the south of Kuwait. This caused a diplomatic crisis with Najd, but Britain intervened, discouraging Sheikh Salim. In 1920, an attempt by the [[Ikhwan]] to build a stronghold in southern Kuwait led to the [[Battle of Hamdh]]. The Battle of Hamdh involved 2,000 [[Ikhwan]] fighters against 100 Kuwaiti [[cavalrymen]] and 200 Kuwaiti [[infantrymen]]. The battle lasted for six days and resulted in heavy but unknown casualties on both sides resulting in the victory of the Ikhwan forces and leading to the battle of Jahra around the Kuwait Red Fort. The [[Battle of Jahra]] happened as the result of the [[Battle of Hamdh]]. A force of three to four thousand [[Ikhwan]], led by [[Faisal Al-Dawish]], attacked the [[Kuwait Red Fort|Red Fort]] at Al-Jahra, defended by fifteen hundred men. The fort was besieged and the Kuwaiti position precarious. The Ikhwan attack repulsed for the while, negotiations began between Salim and Al-Dawish; the latter threatened another attack if the Kuwaiti forces did not surrender. The local merchant class convinced Salim to call in help from British troops, who showed up with airplanes and three warships, ending the attacks. After the Battle of Jahra, Ibn Saud's warriors, the [[Ikhwan]], demanded that Kuwait follows five rules. They demanded that all the [[Shias]] be evicted, that all should adopt the [[Wahhabism|Ikhwan doctrine]], that the Turks be labelled "[[heretics]]", that smoking, [[Munkar and Nakir|munkar]], and prostitution be abolished, and that American missionary hospital be destroyed.

[[File:Jahra-castle.jpg|thumb|The [[Kuwait Red Fort]] in [[Al Jahra]]]]
The [[Kuwait–Najd War]] of 1919–20 erupted in the [[aftermath of World War I]]. The war occurred because [[Ibn Saud]] of Najd wanted to annex Kuwait. The sharpened conflict between Kuwait and Najd led to the death of hundreds of Kuwaitis. The war resulted in sporadic border clashes throughout 1919–1920.

When [[Percy Cox]] was informed of the border clashes in Kuwait, he sent a letter to the [[Emirate of Arabistan|Ruler of Arabistan]] Sheikh [[Khazʽal Ibn Jabir]] offering the Kuwaiti throne to either him or one of his heirs. Khaz'al refused. He then asked: {{blockquote|...even so, do you think that you have come to me with something new? Al Mubarak's position as ruler of Kuwait means that I am the true ruler of Kuwait. So there is no difference between myself and them, for they are like the dearest of my children and you are aware of this. Had someone else come to me with this offer, I would have complained about them to you. So how do you come to me with this offer when you are well aware that myself and Al Mubarak are one soul and one house, what affects them affects me, whether good or evil.}}

Following the Kuwait–Najd War in 1919–20, Ibn Saud imposed a trade blockade against Kuwait from the years 1923 until 1937. The goal of the Saudi economic and military attacks on Kuwait was to annex as much of Kuwait's territory as possible. At the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Uqair conference]] in 1922, the boundaries of Kuwait and Najd were set; as a result of British interference, Kuwait had no representative at the Uqair conference. After the Uqair conference, Kuwait was still subjected to a Saudi economic blockade and intermittent Saudi [[Raid (military)|raiding]].

Kuwait immensely declined in regional economic importance, due to the trade blockades and the world economic depression. Before [[Mary Bruins Allison]] visited Kuwait in 1934, Kuwait had already lost its prominence in long-distance trade.

[[File:Kuwait1944.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Celebration at [[Seif Palace]] in 1944]]
The [[Great Depression]] harmed Kuwait's economy, starting in the late 1920s. International trading was one of Kuwait's main sources of income before oil. Kuwait's merchants were mostly intermediary merchants. As a result of the decline of European demand for goods from India and Africa, Kuwait's economy suffered. The decline in international trade resulted in an increase in gold smuggling by Kuwait's ships to India. Some local merchant families became rich from this smuggling. Kuwait's [[pearl]] industry also collapsed as a result of the worldwide economic depression. At its height, Kuwait's pearl industry had led the world's luxury market, regularly sending out between 750 and 800 ships to meet the European elite's desire for pearls. During the economic depression, luxuries like pearls were in little demand. The Japanese invention of [[cultured pearl]]s also contributed to the collapse of Kuwait's pearl industry.

[[Freya Stark]] wrote about the extent of poverty in Kuwait at the time:{{blockquote|Poverty has settled in Kuwait more heavily since my last visit five years ago, both by sea, where the pearl trade continues to decline, and by land, where the blockade established by Saudi Arabia now harms the merchants.}}

On 22 February 1938, [[Petroleum|oil]] was first discovered in the [[Burgan field]].

===1946–1980: State-building===
Between 1946 and 1980, Kuwait experienced a period of prosperity driven by oil and its liberal cultural atmosphere; this period is called the "golden era of Kuwait". In 1946, crude oil was exported for the first time. In 1950, a major public-work programme began to enable Kuwaiti citizens to enjoy a luxurious standard of living.

By 1952, the country became the largest oil exporter in the Persian Gulf region. This massive growth attracted many foreign workers, especially from Palestine, Iran, India, and Egypt – with the latter being particularly political within the context of the [[Arab Cold War]]. It was also in 1952 that the first masterplan of Kuwait was designed by the British planning firm of [[Anthony Minoprio|Minoprio]], [[Hugh Spencely|Spenceley]], and Macfarlane. In 1958, ''[[Al-Arabi (magazine)|Al-Arabi]]'' magazine was first published. Many foreign writers moved to Kuwait because they enjoyed greater [[freedom of expression]] than elsewhere in the Middle East. Kuwait's press was described as one of the [[Freedom of the press|freest in the world]]. Kuwait was the pioneer of the post-[[Nahda]] literary renaissance in the Middle East.

In June 1961, Kuwait became independent with the end of the [[Sheikhdom of Kuwait#History as a Protected State of Britain|British protectorate]] and the Sheikh [[Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah]] became [[Emir of Kuwait]]. Kuwait's [[Public holidays in Kuwait|national day]], however, is celebrated on 25 February, the anniversary of the coronation of Sheikh Abdullah (it was originally celebrated on 19 June, the date of independence, but concerns over the summer heat caused the government to move it).

At the time, Kuwait was considered the most developed country in the region. Kuwait was the pioneer in the Middle East in diversifying its earnings away from oil exports. The [[Kuwait Investment Authority]] is the world's first sovereign wealth fund.

Kuwaiti society embraced liberal and non-traditional attitudes throughout the 1960s and 1970s. For example, most Kuwaiti women did not wear the [[hijab]] in the 1960s and 70s.

[[File:HMS Victorious (R38) aerial c1959.jpeg|thumb| [[HMS Victorious (R38)|HMS ''Victorious'']] taking part in [[Operation Vantage]] in July 1961]]
Although Kuwait formally gained independence in 1961, Iraq initially refused to recognize the country's independence by maintaining that Kuwait is part of Iraq, albeit Iraq later briefly backed down following a show of force by Britain and [[Arab League]] support of Kuwait's independence.

The short-lived [[Operation Vantage]] crisis evolved in July 1961, as the Iraqi government threatened to invade Kuwait and the invasion was finally averted following plans by the Arab League to form an international Arab force against the potential Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. As a result of Operation Vantage, the Arab League took over the border security of Kuwait and the British had withdrawn their forces by 19 October. Iraqi prime minister [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] was killed in a coup in 1963 but, although Iraq recognised Kuwaiti independence and the military threat was perceived to be reduced, Britain continued to monitor the situation and kept forces available to protect Kuwait until 1971. There had been no Iraqi military action against Kuwait at the time: this was attributed to the political and military situation within Iraq which continued to be unstable.

A treaty of friendship between Iraq and Kuwait was signed in 1963 by which Iraq recognised the 1932 border of Kuwait. Under the terms of the newly drafted [[Constitution of Kuwait|Constitution]], Kuwait held its first [[Kuwaiti parliamentary election, 1963|parliamentary elections in 1963]].

[[Kuwait University]] was established in 1966. Kuwait's [[#Television and theatre|theatre industry]] became well known throughout the region. After the 1967 [[Six Day War]], Kuwait along with other Arabic speaking countries voted the three no's of the [[Khartoum Resolution]]: no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, and no negotiations with Israel. From the 1970s onward, Kuwait scored highest of all Arab countries on the [[Human Development Index]]. The Iraqi poet [[Ahmed Matar]] left Iraq in the 1970s to take refuge in the more liberal environment of Kuwait. Kuwait is the 25th most peaceful country in the world, according to the 2024 [[Global Peace Index]].

The [[Kuwait-Iraq 1973 Sanita border skirmish|Kuwait-Iraq 1973 Samita border skirmish]] evolved on 20 March 1973, when Iraqi army units occupied El-Samitah near the Kuwaiti border, which evoked an international crisis.

On 6 February 1974, [[1974 attack on the Japanese Embassy in Kuwait|Palestinian militants occupied the Japanese embassy in Kuwait]], taking the ambassador and ten others hostage. The militants' motive was to support the [[Japanese Red Army]] members and Palestinian militants who were holding hostages on a Singaporean ferry in what is known as the [[Laju incident|''Laju'' incident]]. Ultimately, the hostages were released, and the guerrillas allowed to fly to [[Aden]]. This was the first time Palestinian guerrillas struck in Kuwait as the Al Sabah ruling family, headed by Sheikh Sabah Al-Salim Al-Sabah, funded the Palestinian resistance movement. Kuwait had been a regular endpoint for Palestinian [[aircraft hijacking|plane hijacking]] in the past and had considered itself safe.

[[Kuwait International Airport]] was opened in 1979 by the Al Hani Construction with a joint venture of [[Ballast Nedam]].

===1981–1991: Wars and terrorism===
{{main|1983–1988 Kuwait terror attacks|Gulf War}}
The Al Sabah strongly advocated [[Islamism]] throughout the 1980s. At that time, the most serious threat to the continuity of Al Sabah came from home-grown democrats, who were protesting the [[Kuwaiti general election, 1975|1976 suspension of the parliament]]. The Al Sabah were attracted to Islamists preaching the virtues of a [[hierarchical]] order that included loyalty to the Kuwaiti monarchy. In 1981, the Kuwaiti government [[gerrymandered]] electoral districts in favour of the Islamists. Islamists were the government's main allies, hence Islamists were able to dominate state agencies, such as the [[government ministries]].

[[File:BrennendeOelquellenKuwait1991.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kuwaiti oil fires]] set by retreating Iraqi forces in 1991]]
During the [[Iran–Iraq War]], Kuwait ardently supported Iraq. As a result, there were [[1983–1988 Kuwait terror attacks|various pro-Iran terror attacks]] across Kuwait, including the 1983 bombings, the attempted assassination of [[Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah|Emir Jaber]] in May 1985, the [[1985 Kuwait City bombings]], and the hijacking of several Kuwait Airways planes. Kuwait's economy and scientific research sector significantly suffered due to the pro-Iran terror attacks.

Simultaneously, Kuwait experienced a major [[economic crisis]] after the [[Souk Al-Manakh stock market crash]] and [[1980s oil glut|decrease in oil price]].

[[File:Tankskuwait.jpg|thumb|left|[[Iraqi Armed Forces]] tanks in [[Kuwait City]] of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait on 2 August 1990 during the [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] that began the Gulf War.]]

After the Iran–Iraq War ended, Kuwait declined an Iraqi request to forgive its US$65&nbsp;billion debt. An economic rivalry between the two countries ensued after Kuwait increased its oil production by 40 percent. Tensions between the two countries increased further in July 1990, after Iraq complained to [[OPEC]] claiming that Kuwait was stealing its oil from a field near the border by [[slant drilling]] of the [[Rumaila field]].

In August 1990, Iraqi forces [[Invasion of Kuwait|invaded and annexed]] Kuwait without any warning. After a series of failed diplomatic negotiations, the United States led a coalition to remove the Iraqi forces from Kuwait, in what became known as the [[Gulf War]]. On 26 February 1991, in phase of code-named [[Operation Desert Storm]], the coalition succeeded in driving out the Iraqi forces. As they retreated, Iraqi forces carried out a [[Kuwaiti oil fires|scorched earth]] policy by setting oil wells on fire.

During the Iraqi occupation, nearly 1,000 civilians were killed in Kuwait. In addition, 600 people went missing during Iraq's occupation; remains of approximately 375 were found in mass graves in Iraq. Kuwait celebrates 26 February as [[Liberation Day (Kuwait)|Liberation Day]].

===1992–present: Present era===
{{see also|Kuwait and state-sponsored terrorism}}
In the early 1990s, Kuwait [[Palestinian exodus from Kuwait (Gulf War)|deported]] nearly 400,000 Palestinians. Kuwait's policy was a form of [[collective punishment]], in response to the alignment of the [[PLO]] with Saddam Hussein. Kuwait also deported thousands of Iraqis and Yemenis after the Gulf War. Hundreds of thousands of [[Bedoon|stateless Bedoon]] were also expelled from Kuwait in the early-to-mid 1990s. At the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] in 1995, it was revealed that the Al Sabah ruling family deported 150,000 stateless Bedoon to refugee camps in the Kuwaiti desert near the Iraqi border with minimal water, insufficient food, and no basic shelter. Many of the stateless Bedoon fled to Iraq where they remain stateless people even today.

In March 2003, Kuwait became the springboard for the US-led [[invasion of Iraq]]. In 2005, women won the right to vote and run in elections. Upon the death of the Emir Jaber in January 2006, Sheikh [[Saad Al-Sabah]] succeeded him but was removed nine days later due to his failing health. As a result, Sheikh [[Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]] was sworn in as Emir. From that point onwards, Kuwait suffered from chronic political deadlock between the government and parliament which resulted in multiple cabinet reshuffles and dissolutions. This significantly hampered investment and economic reforms in Kuwait, making the country's economy much more dependent on oil.

Despite the political instability, Kuwait had the highest [[Human Development Index]] ranking in the Arab world from 2006 to 2009. China awarded Kuwait Investment Authority an additional $700 million quota on top of $300 million awarded in March 2012. The quota is the highest to be granted by China to foreign investment entities.

In March 2014,  [[David S. Cohen (attorney)|David S. Cohen]], who was then the United States [[Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence|Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence]], and many others accused [[Kuwait and state-sponsored terrorism|Kuwait of funding terrorism]], particularly for [[ISIS]] and [[Al-Qaeda]].

On 26 June 2015, a [[2015 Kuwait mosque bombing|suicide bombing took place]] at a Shia Muslim mosque in Kuwait. The [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] claimed responsibility for the attack. Twenty-seven people were killed and 227 people were wounded. It was the largest terror attack in Kuwait's history. In the aftermath, a lawsuit was filed accusing the Kuwaiti government of negligence and direct responsibility for the terror attack.

Due to [[2010s oil glut|declining oil prices]] in the mid-to-late 2010s, Kuwait faced one of the worst economic crunches in its history. [[Sabah Al Ahmad Sea City]] was inaugurated in mid-2016. Simultaneously, Kuwait invested significantly in its economic relations with [[China]]. China has been Kuwait's largest trade partner since 2016.

Under the [[Belt and Road Initiative]], Kuwait and China have various cooperation projects including [[Al-Mutlaa]] which is currently under construction in northern Kuwait. The [[Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Causeway]] is part of the first phase of the [[Madinat al-Hareer|Silk City]] project. The causeway was inaugurated in May 2019 as part of Kuwait Vision 2035, it connects Kuwait City to northern Kuwait.

The [[COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait|COVID-19 pandemic]] exacerbated Kuwait's economic crisis. Kuwait's economy faced a budget deficit of $46 billion in 2020. It was Kuwait's first fiscal deficit since 1995. In September 2020, Kuwait's Crown Prince Sheikh [[Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]] became the 16th Emir of Kuwait and the successor to Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, who died at the age of 91. In October 2020, Sheikh [[Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]] was appointed as the Crown Prince. In December 2023, Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah died and was replaced by Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah''.''

Kuwait currently has the largest US military presence in the entire Middle East region. There are over 14,000 US military personnel stationed in the country. [[Camp Arifjan]] is the largest US military base in Kuwait. The US uses bases in Kuwait as staging hubs, training ranges, and logistical support for its Middle East operations.

In recent years, Kuwait's infrastructure projects market has regularly underperformed due to political deadlock between the executive and legislative branches. Kuwait is now the region's most oil-dependent country with the lowest share of economic diversification. According to the World Economic Forum, Kuwait has the weakest infrastructure quality in the region.

Since March 2024, Kuwait has been [[Human rights in Kuwait#Citizenship revocation|revoking the citizenship]] of many citizens (by decree). By March 2025, Kuwait revoked the citizenship of 42,000 people in just six months. The most high-profile revocation was that of singer [[Nawal El Kuwaitia|Nawal]] and actor Dawood Hussain in early December 2024. According to ''[[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|Carnegie Endowment]]'', Kuwait has weaponized citizenship revocation as a tool for political control.
