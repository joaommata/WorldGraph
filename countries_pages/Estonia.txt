===Prehistory===
[[File:StoneCistGraves.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze age stone-cist graves at [[Rebala Heritage Reserve|Jõelähtme]]]]
Human settlement in Estonia became possible 13,000–11,000 years ago, when the [[glacier]]s of the last [[ice age]] melted. The [[Pulli settlement]], dated around 9000 BC, is the oldest known settlement in Estonia. The earliest human habitation during the [[Mesolithic]] period is connected to the [[Kunda culture]]. Around 5300 BC, [[Neolithic]] ceramics of the [[Narva culture]] appear. Next, the [[Comb Ceramic culture]] around 3900 BC brought early agriculture and sophisticated religious art. Starting from around 2800 BC, the [[Corded Ware culture]], which included primitive farming and animal husbandry, appeared. Archaeological estimates place the population within Estonian territory at {{circa|10,000}} inhabitants in 2000 BC.

The first [[hillfort]] settlements were established during the [[Nordic Bronze Age]]. A transition from hunter-fisher subsistence to single-farm-based settlement started around 1000 BC, and was complete by around 500 BC. The large amount of bronze objects indicate active communication with neighbouring [[Germanic tribes]]. During the [[Iron Age Europe|Iron Age]], the local iron production began around 200 BC; north Estonia, particularly the coastal region of [[Virumaa]], emerged as a trade hub. North Estonian settlers gradually moved into nearby areas in the Baltic Sea region, spreading [[Proto-Finnic language]]. In the 4th century AD, [[Goths|Gothic]] ruler [[Ermanaric]] claimed to have subjugated the territories corresponding to Estonia, but there is no archaeological evidence to support this. The [[Late Antique Little Ice Age|Little Ice Age]] in 6th–7th centuries AD, is starkly evident in the archaeological record, with a sharp drop in the number of sites and grave finds, indicating a severe population decline and slow recovery. Similar patterns appear in the surrounding regions.

===The Viking Age===
The Estonian coast and nearby Baltic Sea islands were a trade hub located on a major waterway which made these areas both a target and a starting point for many raids already prior to the [[Viking Age in Estonia]]. Coastal Estonians, particularly the [[Oeselians|Saaremaa islanders]], adopted a [[Vikings|Viking]] lifestyle. Several Scandinavian sagas referred to major confrontations with Estonians, notably when 7th century "Estonian Vikings" defeated and killed [[Ingvar Harra]], the [[Yngling|King]] of [[Swedes (tribe)|Swedes]]. In {{circa|1030}}, Grand Prince [[Yaroslav the Wise]] of [[Kievan Rus]] attempted to subjugate the [[Chud]]s (as East Slavic sources called Estonians and related Finnic tribes) in southeast Estonia and captured Tartu. Chuds (''Sosols'') destroyed this foothold in 1061. In 1187, Estonians, [[Curonians]] and [[Karelians]] sacked [[Sigtuna]], a major Swedish city at the time.

[[File:Old Estonian counties.png|thumb|left|Pre-Christian independent Estonian counties (''maakond''), {{circa|1200}}]]
Estonia had two regional cultures in this period. Northern and western coastal areas maintained close connections with [[Scandinavia]], while the inland had stronger ties to the [[Balts]] and the [[principality of Pskov]]. Ancient Estonia had a professional warrior caste, while international trade provided nobles wealth and prestige. This era's Estonian burial sites often contain both individual and collective graves, with artefacts like weapons and jewelry reflecting the shared material culture of Scandinavia and Northern Europe. Very little is known about the religious beliefs of medieval Estonians prior to [[Christianization|Christianisation]]. A 1229 [[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia|chronicle]] mentions ''[[Tharapita]]'' as the supreme deity of the islanders of Saaremaa (Ösel). [[Sacred grove]]s, particularly of [[oak]] trees, factored prominently into pagan worship practices.

In the early centuries AD, Estonia's first administrative subdivisions emerged, primarily the parish (Estonian: ''kihelkond'') and the county (Estonian: ''[[maakond]]''), usually including multiple parishes. Parishes were commonly centred on hill forts, and ruled by local nobles. By the 13th century, Estonia was divided into eight major counties – [[Harjumaa (ancient county)|Harjumaa]], [[Järvamaa]], [[Läänemaa]], [[Revala]], [[Saare County|Saaremaa]], [[Sakala County|Sakala]], [[Ugandi]], and [[Virumaa]] – and several smaller, single-parish counties. Counties operated independently, forming only loose defensive alliances against foreign threats.

===Christianisation and Catholic Estonia===
{{Main|Livonian Crusade|Terra Mariana|Danish Estonia}}

[[File:Medieval Livonia 1260.svg|thumb|right|Estonia and Livonia after the 12th/13th century [[Northern crusades]]]]
In 1199, Pope [[Innocent III]] declared a [[Livonian Crusade|crusade]] to "defend the Christians of [[Livonia]]". The crusading German [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Swordbrothers]], who had previously subjugated [[Livonians]], [[Latgalians]], and [[Selonians]], started campaigning against Estonians in 1208. The following years saw many raids and counter-raids. In 1217, the Estonians suffered a significant defeat in the [[Battle of St. Matthew's Day|battle]] where their most prominent leader [[Lembitu]], an elder of [[Sakala County|Sakala]], was killed. In 1219, the armies of King [[Valdemar II]] of Denmark defeated Estonians in the [[Battle of Lyndanisse]] (Tallinn), and conquered northern Estonia. In the uprising of 1223, Estonians were able to push the German and Danish invaders out of the whole country, except Tallinn. The crusaders soon resumed their offensive, and in 1227, Saaremaa was the last Estonian county to surrender, and convert to Christianity.

In the 13th century, the newly Christian territory of present-day Estonia and Latvia was named [[Terra Mariana]]; later it became known simply as Livonia. North Estonia became [[Danish Estonia|part of]] the [[Kingdom of Denmark]]. The rest was divided between Swordbrothers and the [[prince-bishop]]s of [[Bishopric of Dorpat|Dorpat]] and [[Bishopric of Ösel–Wiek|Ösel–Wiek]]. In 1236, the Swordbrothers merged into the then larger [[Teutonic Order]] (becoming its regional branch, the "[[Livonian Order]]"). In 1343, a major anti-German [[St. George's Night Uprising|uprising]] encompassed north Estonia and Saaremaa. The [[Teutonic Order]] suppressed the rebellion by 1345, and the next year bought the Estonian lands from the king of Denmark. The German upper-class minority consolidated their power after the unsuccessful rebellion. For the subsequent centuries [[Low German]] remained the language of the ruling elite in both Estonian cities and the countryside.

[[File:Wanradti-Koelli katekismus, fragment.jpg|thumb|Fragments of the [[Wanradt–Koell Catechism]] (1535), the first book printed in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]]]
[[Tallinn]], the capital of [[Danish Estonia]] founded on the site of Lindanise, adopted the [[Lübeck law]] and received full town rights in 1248. The [[Hanseatic League]] controlled trade on the Baltic Sea, and the four largest cities in Estonia became members: Tallinn, Tartu, [[Pärnu]], and [[Viljandi]]. Protected by stone walls and membership in the Hansa, prosperous cities like Tallinn and Tartu often defied other rulers of the medieval Livonia.

===Reformation and Swedish Estonia===
{{Main|Swedish Estonia}}
The [[Reformation]] began in central Europe in 1517, and soon spread northward to the Baltic region despite some opposition from the Catholic Teutonic Order. Protestant preaching began actively in Tallinn in 1524, leading the town council to align with the Reformation by the following year. Similar events unfolded in Tartu, where tensions arose with Catholic bishop Johann Blankenfeld, resulting in [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] riots that damaged Catholic churches and monasteries in both cities. By the late 1520s, most Estonian cities and towns had embraced the Reformation. Unlike the cities, rural areas were slower to adopt Protestantism, with Catholic influence persisting during the 1530s. With the Reformation, church services began to be conducted in vernacular language, which initially meant [[Low German]], but already from the 1530s onward the regular religious services were held in Estonian. Early Estonian-language Protestant texts emerged, including [[Wanradt–Koell Catechism]] in 1535.

In 1558, Tsar [[Ivan the Terrible]] of [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia (Muscovy)]] invaded Livonia, starting the [[Livonian War]]. The Livonian Order was decisively [[Battle of Ergeme|defeated]] in 1560. The majority of Livonia accepted Polish rule, while Reval and the nobles of Northern Estonia swore loyalty to the Swedish king, and the Bishop of Ösel-Wiek sold his lands to the Danish king. Russian forces gradually conquered the majority of Livonia, but in the late 1570s the Polish-Lithuanian and Swedish armies started their own offensives and the bloody war finally ended in 1583 with Russian defeat. As a result of the war, Northern Estonia became Swedish [[Duchy of Estonia (1561–1721)|Duchy of Estonia]], Southern Estonia became Polish [[Duchy of Livonia]], and Saaremaa remained under Danish control. [[List of wars between Poland and Sweden|Wars]] between Sweden and Poland-Lithuania continued until 1629, when the victorious Sweden acquired south Estonia and northern Latvia. Sweden [[Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645)|gained]] Saaremaa from Denmark in 1645. The wars cut the population of Estonia from about 250–270,000 people in the mid-16th century to 115–120,000 in the 1630s.
[[File:Academia Gustaviana.jpg|thumb|''Academia Gustaviana'', now [[University of Tartu]] was founded in 1632 by King Gustavus Adolphus]]
The Swedish era in Estonia was marked by both religious repression and significant reforms. Initially, it brought Protestant [[puritans]] who opposed traditional Estonian beliefs and practices, leading to [[witch trials]] and bans on [[folk music]]. While large parts of rural population remained in [[serfdom]], legal reforms under King [[Charles XI]] strengthened both serfs' and [[free tenant]] farmers' land usage and inheritance rights, resulting in this period's reputation as "The Good Old Swedish Time" in historical memory. King [[Gustav II Adolph]] established [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] in Tartu (which became the university in 1632) and Tallinn. [[Printer (publishing)|Printers]] were established in both towns. The beginnings of the Estonian-language public education system appeared in the 1680s, largely owing to [[Bengt Gottfried Forselius|Bengt Forselius]]. The population of Estonia grew rapidly until about 20% of the population died in the [[Great Famine of Estonia (1695–1697)|Great Famine]] of 1695–97.

===In the Russian Empire===
{{Main|Governorate of Estonia|Governorate of Livonia}}
During the 1700–1721 [[Great Northern War]], the [[Tsardom of Russia]] (Muscovy) conquered the whole of Estonia by 1710. The war and [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague]] again devastated the population of Estonia, with the 1712 population estimated at only 150,000–170,000. Russian administration restored all the political and landholding rights of Baltic Germans. The rights of local farmers reached their lowest point, as serfdom completely dominated agricultural relations during the 18th century. Tsarist regime sought to avoid conflicts with the local nobility, and the Baltic autonomous "special order" remained largely in effect until the late 19th century, marking a distinctive period of localised governance within the Russian Empire. Although serfdom had been abolished in Estonia in 1816–1819, major reforms improving farmers' rights started only in the mid-19th century.

====National awakening ====
The [[Estonian national awakening]] began in the 1850s as several leading figures started promoting an Estonian national identity among the general populace. Widespread farm buyouts by Estonians and the resulting rapidly growing class of land-owning farmers provided the economic basis for the formation of this new "Estonian identity". In 1857, [[Johann Voldemar Jannsen]] started publishing the first successful Estonian-language weekly newspaper, and began popularising the denomination of oneself as ''eestlane'' (Estonian).  The first nationwide movements formed, such as a campaign to establish an Estonian-language secondary school, the founding of the [[Society of Estonian Literati]] and the [[Estonian Students' Society]], and the first [[Estonian Song Festival|national song festival]], held in 1869 in Tartu. The national [[Epic poetry|epic]] ''[[Kalevipoeg]]'' was published in 1862, and 1870 saw the first performances of [[Theatre of Estonia|Estonian theatre]]. In 1878 a major split happened in the national movement. The moderate wing led by [[Jakob Hurt]] focused on development of culture and Estonian education, while the radical wing led by [[Carl Robert Jakobson]] started demanding increased political and economical rights.

In the 1890s, the central government of the Russian Empire launched a [[Russification]] campaign in order to tie the Baltic governorates more closely to the empire administratively and culturally. Russian language replaced German and Estonian in most secondary schools and universities, and many societal activities in local languages were suppressed. In the late 1890s, prominent figures like [[Jaan Tõnisson]] and [[Konstantin Päts]] rose in a new surge of nationalism. In the early 20th century, Estonians started taking over their German-run town governments.
During the [[1905 Russian Revolution|1905 Revolution]], the first legal Estonian political parties were founded. An Estonian national congress was convened and demanded the unification of Estonian areas into a single autonomous territory and an end to Russification. The unrest was accompanied by both peaceful [[political demonstration|demonstrations]] and violent [[riot]]s. The Tsarist government responded with a brutal crackdown; some 500 people were executed and hundreds more jailed or deported to Siberia.

===World War I and independence===
{{Main|Estonian Declaration of Independence|Estonian War of Independence|History of Estonia#Interwar period (1920–1939)}}
In 1917, following the [[February Revolution]] collapse of monarchy, the new [[Russian Provisional Government]] yielded to popular demand and the two main Estonian-speaking governorates were merged into one [[Autonomous Governorate of Estonia|autonomous Governorate of Estonia]], and the [[Estonian Provincial Assembly]] was then elected. [[Bolsheviks]] [[Bolshevik coup|seized power]] in Estonia in November 1917, and disbanded the Provincial Assembly. However, the Provincial Assembly established the [[Estonian Salvation Committee|Salvation Committee]], and during the short interlude between Russian retreat and [[Operation Faustschlag|German arrival]], the committee [[Estonian Declaration of Independence|declared the independence of Estonia]] on 24 February 1918, and formed the [[Estonian Provisional Government]]. [[German occupation of Estonia during World War I|German occupation]] immediately followed, but after Germany's capitulation in [[World War I]], they were forced to return power to the Estonian government on 19 November 1918.

[[File:Soomusrong nr 2 Valgas 1919.jpg|thumb|An improvised [[armoured train]] used by the Estonian army during the [[Estonian War of Independence|1918–1920 war of independence]]]]
On 28 November 1918 the new [[Soviet Russia]]n government of [[Vladimir Lenin]] launched a military attack against Estonia, starting the [[Estonian War of Independence]]. The Russian [[Red Army]] came within 30&nbsp;km of Tallinn, but in January 1919, the [[Estonian Army]], led by [[Johan Laidoner]], in co-operation with the British navy went on a counteroffensive, ejecting the Russian Bolshevik forces from Estonia within a few weeks. By the spring of 1919, the Estonian army advanced into neighbouring areas of Soviet Russia and [[Latvia]]. In June 1919, Estonia [[Battle of Cēsis (1919)|defeated]] the [[Baltische Landeswehr|German Landeswehr]] which had attempted to dominate Latvia. After a Soviet counteroffensive attempt in the [[Narva]] region in late 1919 failed to achieve a breakthrough, the sides agreed to a ceasefire. On 2 February 1920, the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)|Tartu Peace Treaty]] was signed by Estonia and [[Soviet Russia]], with the latter pledging to permanently give up all sovereign claims to Estonia.

[[File:EstConstAssmb.jpg|thumb|Estonian Constituent Assembly, opening session on 23 April 1919]] 
In April 1919, the [[Estonian Constituent Assembly]] was elected. They passed a sweeping [[Estonian Land Reform of 1919|land reform]] and adopted a highly [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Constitution of Estonia|constitution]], establishing Estonia as a [[Riigikogu|parliamentary]] democracy. Estonia joined the [[League of Nations]] in 1921. Estonia enjoyed rapid economic growth during the interwar period. Land reforms improved the farmers' conditions, but the country also prospered from industrialisation and the development of oil shale mining. With independence, most economic links with Russia dissolved, but trade rapidly reoriented towards Western markets. Estonia's cultural-autonomy law for ethnic minorities, adopted in 1925, was one of the most liberal of its time.

The [[Great Depression]] strained Estonia's political system, and in 1933 the right-wing [[Vaps movement]] spearheaded a constitutional reform establishing a strong presidency. On 12 March 1934 the acting head of state, [[Konstantin Päts]], extended a state of emergency over the entire country, under the pretext that the Vaps movement had been planning a coup. Päts ruled by decree for several years while parliament did not reconvene ("[[era of silence]]"). The Päts régime was relatively benign compared to other authoritarian régimes in [[Interwar period|interwar]] Europe, never using violence against political opponents. A 1937 referendum adopted a new constitution. In 1938, an election including opposition candidates provided [[1938 Estonian parliamentary election|a new bicameral parliament]]. Estonia signed non-aggression pacts [[Soviet–Estonian Non-Aggression Pact|with the Soviet Union]] in 1932, and [[German–Estonian Non-Aggression Pact|with Germany]] in 1939. In 1939, Estonia declared neutrality, but this proved futile in [[World War II]].

===World War II, Soviet and German occupations===
{{Main|Estonia in World War II|Occupation of the Baltic states}}

[[File:PlaqueMemorizingEstonianGovernment.jpg|thumb|Ten former Estonian prime ministers and 56 government members were executed or perished in captivity of the Soviet occupation regime after 1940 (memorial plaque at the [[Stenbock House|seat of government]] in [[Toompea]], Tallinn)]]
A week before the outbreak of [[World War II]], on 23 August 1939, [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. In the pact's [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|secret protocol]] Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland were divided between USSR and Germany into "spheres of influence", with Estonia assigned to the Soviet "sphere". On 24 September 1939, during the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], the Soviet dictator [[Joseph Stalin]] presented the Estonian government an ultimatum demanding that Estonia immediately sign a treaty that would allow the USSR to establish military bases in Estonia, or else face war. The Estonian government decided to avoid military conflict, and a "[[Soviet–Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty|mutual assistance treaty]]" was signed in Moscow on 28 September 1939, allowing the USSR to establish and operate several military bases in Estonia for 10 years. However, on 16–17 June 1940, the Soviet army invaded and occupied the entire territory of Estonia, including the capital Tallinn, facing almost no armed resistance, as the Estonian government considered it hopeless. Following instructions from Stalin, the Soviet occupation forces organized a [[coup d'état]] on 22 June 1940, and installed a new pro-Soviet government. On 6 August 1940, Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union; the administrative subunit of the USSR from then on was formally named the [[Estonian SSR]]. 

[[File:Victims of Soviet repressions in Kuressaare, Estonia, 1941.jpg|thumb|Over 90 civilians were killed by the Soviet naval forces and [[NKVD]] in 1941 in [[Kuressaare]] in one of the largest mass executions during the Soviet occupation of Estonia]]  
The new Stalinist government established a repressive wartime regime in occupied Estonia. Many of the country's high-ranking civil and military officials, intelligentsia and industrialists were imprisoned and executed. Soviet terror culminated on 14 June 1941 with [[June deportation|mass deportation]] of around 11,000 people to Soviet Russia. When [[Operation Barbarossa]] (accompanied by Estonian [[Guerilla warfare|guerrilla soldiers]] called "[[Forest Brothers]]") began against the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 in the form of the "[[Summer War]]", around 34,000 young Estonian men were forcibly drafted into the Soviet army (only about half of whom saw any military action, and fewer than 30% survived the war). Soviet [[destruction battalions]] initiated a scorched earth policy. Political prisoners who could not be evacuated from Estonia [[NKVD prisoner massacres|were executed]] by the Soviet [[NKVD]]. Many Estonians went into the forest, starting an anti-Soviet guerrilla campaign. In July 1941, German [[Wehrmacht]] reached south Estonia. The USSR [[Soviet evacuation of Tallinn|evacuated Tallinn]] in late August with massive losses, and capture of the Estonian islands was completed by German forces in October.

A puppet [[Estonian Self-Administration]] was established, and [[German occupation of Estonia during World War II|occupied Estonia]] was merged into [[Reichskommissariat Ostland]]. About a thousand [[Estonian Jews]] were [[Holocaust in Estonia|killed]] in 1941 and numerous forced labour camps were established. German occupation authorities initially started recruiting men into [[Estonian Legion|volunteer units]], but forced conscription was instituted in 1943, eventually leading to formation of the [[20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian)|Estonian Waffen-SS division]]. Thousands of Estonians escaped to Finland, where [[Finnish Infantry Regiment 200|many volunteered]] to fight together with Finns [[Continuation War|against Soviets]].

[[File:Tallinn Old Town after being bombed by the Soviet Air Forces in 1944.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tallinn Old Town]] after [[Bombing of Tallinn in World War II|bombing by the Soviet air force]] (March 1944)]]
The Red Army reached the Estonian borders again in early 1944, but its advance into Estonia was stopped in [[Battle of Narva (1944)|heavy fighting near Narva]] for six months by German forces, including numerous Estonian units. In March, the Soviet Air Force carried out heavy bombing raids [[Bombing of Tallinn in World War II|against Tallinn]] and other Estonian towns. In July, the Soviets started [[Tallinn Offensive|a major offensive]] from the south, forcing the Germans to abandon mainland Estonia in September, with the Estonian islands being abandoned in November. As German forces were retreating from Tallinn, the last pre-war prime minister [[Jüri Uluots]] [[National Committee of the Republic of Estonia|appointed a government]] headed by [[Otto Tief]] in an unsuccessful attempt to restore Estonia's independence. Tens of thousands of Estonians fled westwards from the Soviets. Estonia lost around one fourth of its population through war-related deaths, deportations and evacuations.

The United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the majority of other Western countries [[Stimson Doctrine|considered]] the annexation of Estonia by the Soviet Union illegal. [[State continuity of the Baltic states|Legal continuity]] of the Estonian state was preserved through the [[Estonian government-in-exile|government-in-exile]] and the Estonian [[Estonian Diplomatic Service (1940–91)|diplomatic representatives]] which Western governments continued to recognise. Thousands of Estonians opposing the second Soviet occupation joined a guerrilla movement known as the "[[Estonian partisans|Forest Brothers]]". The armed resistance was heaviest in the first few years after the war, but Soviet authorities gradually wore it down through attrition, and resistance effectively ceased to exist in the mid-1950s. The Soviets initiated a [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|policy of collectivisation]], but as farmers remained opposed to it a campaign of terror was unleashed. In March 1949 about 20,000 Estonians [[Operation Priboi|were deported]] to Siberia. Collectivization was fully completed soon afterwards.

The Soviet Union began [[Russification]], with hundreds of thousands of [[Russians in Estonia|Russians]] and people of other [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] nationalities being induced to settle in Estonia, which eventually threatened to turn Estonians into a minority in their own land. In 1945 Estonians formed 97% of the population, but by 1989 their share of the population had fallen to 62%.  The military presence was pervasive, with closed military zones occupying around one-fifth of the Estonian land and the entire surrounding sea. Access to coastal areas required permits, rendering the Estonian people physically isolated from the world outside the USSR. Economically, heavy industry was strongly prioritised, but this did not improve the well-being of the local population, and caused massive environmental damage through pollution. Living standards under the Soviet occupation kept falling further behind nearby independent Finland.

===Independence restored===
[[File:Balti kett 22.jpg|thumb|left|In the [[Baltic Way]] on 23 August 1989, two million people formed a human chain across three countries in a mass demonstration against the Soviet occupation.]]
The introduction of ''[[perestroika]]'' by the Soviet government in 1987 enabled political activism in Estonia, sparking the [[Singing Revolution]], a peaceful movement towards independence. One of the first major acts of resistance was the [[Phosphorite War]], an environmental protest against Soviet plans to establish large phosphate mines in [[Virumaa]]. On 23 August 1987, the [[Hirvepark meeting]] in Tallinn called for the public disclosure of the secret protocols of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact that had led to Estonia's occupation. In 1988, new political movements emerged, including the [[Popular Front of Estonia]], a moderate faction within the independence movement, and the [[Estonian National Independence Party]], which became the first non-communist political party registered in the Soviet Union. The [[Supreme Soviet of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|parliament of Soviet-controlled Estonia]] asserted the primacy of Estonian laws with the [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration|Sovereignty Declaration]] on 16 November 1988, inspiring similar declarations across other [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]]. On 23 August 1989, two million people formed the [[Baltic Way]], a human chain spanning Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, to demonstrate unity in pursuit of independence.

In 1990, the [[Congress of Estonia]] was formed as the representative body of Estonian citizens. In March 1991, a [[1991 Estonian independence referendum|referendum was held]] where 78.4% of voters supported independence, and during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|coup attempt in Moscow]], Estonia [[Estonian restoration of Independence|declared restoration of independence]] on 20 August. Soviet authorities recognised Estonian independence on 6 September, and on 17 September Estonia was admitted into the [[United Nations]]. The last units of the [[Russian army]] left Estonia in 1994. In 1992 radical economic reforms were launched for switching over to a market economy, including privatisation and currency reform. Estonian foreign policy since independence has been oriented toward [[Western world|the West]], and in 2004 Estonia joined both the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]. In 2011, Estonia joined the [[eurozone]] and adopted the EU single currency.
