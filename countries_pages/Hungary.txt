The [[Roman Empire]] conquered the territory between the [[Alps]] and the area west of the [[Danube]] River from 16 to 15 BC, the Danube being the frontier of the empire. In 14 BC, [[Pannonia]], the western part of the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]], which includes the west of today's Hungary, was recognised by emperor [[Augustus]] in the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'' as part of the Roman Empire.

{{History of Hungary}}
From 235, the Roman Empire went through troubled times, caused by revolts, rivalry and rapid succession of emperors. The Western Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century under the stress of the migration of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] and [[Carpi people|Carpian]] pressure. After the disintegration of the Hunnic Empire, the [[Gepids]], an Eastern Germanic tribe, who had been vassalised by the Huns, established their own kingdom in the Carpathian Basin. Other groups which reached the Carpathian Basin during the Migration Period were the [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], [[Lombards]], and [[Early Slavs|Slavs]]. Between 804 and 829, the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] conquered the lands east of the Danube and took over the rule of the local Slavic tribes and remnants of the Avars. By the mid-9th century, the [[Slavs in Lower Pannonia#Principality|Balaton Principality]], also known as Lower Pannonia, was established west of the Danube as part of the Frankish [[March of Pannonia]].

===Middle Ages (895–1526)===
{{Main|Principality of Hungary|Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages}}
[[File:Kalandozasok.jpg|thumb|[[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian raids in the 9–10th centuries]]: Between 899 and 970, the researchers count 47 (38 to West and 9 to East) raids in different parts of Europe. From these campaigns only 8 were unsuccessful and the others ended with success{{sfn|Nagy|2007|p=168}}]]

Foundation of the [[Principality of Hungary|Hungarian state]] is connected to the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Hungarian conquerors]], who arrived from the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe|Pontic-Caspian steppe]] as a confederation of [[Seven chieftains of the Magyars|seven tribes]]. The [[Hungarians]] arrived in the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]] as a frame of a strong centralised steppe-empire under the leadership of Grand Prince [[Álmos]] and his son [[Árpád]]: founders of the [[Árpád dynasty]], the Hungarian ruling dynasty and the Hungarian state. The [[Árpád dynasty]] claimed to be a direct descendant of [[Attila|Attila the Hun]]. The Hungarians took possession of the area in a pre-planned manner, with a long move-in between 862 and 895. The rising Hungary conducted successful [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|fierce campaigns and raids]], from [[Constantinople]] to as far as today's Spain. The Hungarians defeated [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|three major East Frankish imperial armies]] between 907 and 910. A defeat at the [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 signaled a provisory end to most campaigns on foreign territories, at least towards the west.

====Age of Árpádian kings====
{{Main|Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1301)|Árpád dynasty}}
[[File:A Szent Korona elölről 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Holy Crown of Hungary|Holy Crown]] (''Szent Korona''), one of the key symbols of Hungary. It was gifted to [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen]], the first [[King of Hungary]], who converted the nation to Christianity]]

In 972, the ruling prince ({{langx|hu|fejedelem}}) [[Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|Géza]] of the [[Árpád dynasty]] officially started to integrate Hungary into Christian Western Europe. His son [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen I]] became the first [[King of Hungary]] after defeating his [[paganism|pagan]] uncle [[Koppány]]. Under Stephen, Hungary was recognised as a Catholic [[Apostolic Majesty|Apostolic Kingdom]]. Applying to [[Pope Sylvester II]], Stephen received the insignia of royalty (including probably a part of the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]]) from the papacy.

By 1006, Stephen consolidated his power and started sweeping reforms to convert Hungary into a Western-style [[Feudalism|feudal state]]. The country switched to using Latin for administration purposes, and until as late as 1844, Latin remained the official language of administration. King [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|Saint Ladislaus]] completed the work of King [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen]], consolidating the Hungarian state's power and strengthening [[Christianity]]. His charismatic personality, strategic leadership and military talents resulted in the termination of internal power struggles and foreign military threats. The wife of the Croatian king [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]] was Ladislaus's sister. At [[Helen of Hungary, Queen of Croatia|Helen's]] request, Ladislaus intervened in the conflict and invaded Croatia in 1091.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=282, 284}} The [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]] entered a [[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1301)|Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1102 with the coronation of King [[Coloman, King of Hungary|Coloman]] as "King of Croatia and Dalmatia" in 1102 in [[Biograd na Moru|Biograd]].

[[File:Europe_mediterranean_1097.jpg|alt=1097, Europe, map|thumb|Europe in 1097]]

One of the most powerful and wealthiest king of the Árpád dynasty was [[Béla III of Hungary|Béla III]], who disposed of the equivalent of 23 tonnes of silver per year, according to a contemporary [[Income register of Béla III of Hungary|income register]]. This exceeded the income of the French king (estimated at 17 tonnes) and was double the receipts of the English Crown. [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]] issued the ''[[Diploma Andreanum]]'' which secured the special privileges of the [[Transylvanian Saxons]] and is considered the first [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomy]] law in the world. He led the [[Fifth Crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]] in 1217, setting up the largest royal army in the history of Crusades. His [[Golden Bull of 1222]] was the first constitution in [[Continental Europe]]. The lesser nobles also began to present Andrew with grievances, a practice that evolved into the institution of the parliament (''parlamentum publicum'').

In 1241–1242, the kingdom received a major blow with the [[Mongolian invasion of Hungary|Mongol (Tatar) invasion]]. Up to half of Hungary's population of 2 million were victims of the invasion. King [[Béla IV of Hungary|Béla IV]] let [[Cumans]] and [[Jasz people|Jassic people]] into the country, who were fleeing the Mongols. Over the centuries, they were fully assimilated. After the Mongols retreated, King Béla ordered the construction of hundreds of stone castles and fortifications, to defend against a possible second Mongol invasion. The [[Second Mongol invasion of Hungary|Mongols returned to Hungary]] in 1285, but the newly built stone-castle systems and new tactics (using a higher proportion of heavily armed knights) stopped them. The invading Mongol force was defeated near Pest by the royal army of King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus IV]]. As with later invasions, it was repelled handily, the Mongols losing much of their invading force.

==== Age of elected kings ====
{{Main|Kingdom of Hungary (1301–1526)|Ottoman–Hungarian Wars}}

The [[Kingdom of Hungary]] reached one of its greatest extents during the Árpádian kings, yet royal power was weakened at the end of their rule in 1301. After a destructive period of [[interregnum]] (1301–1308), the first [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] king, [[Charles I of Hungary]] – a bilineal descendant of the [[Árpád dynasty]] – successfully restored royal power and defeated oligarch rivals, the so-called "little kings". The second Angevin Hungarian king, [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]] (1342–1382), led many successful military campaigns from Lithuania to southern Italy ([[Kingdom of Naples]]) and was also [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]] from 1370. After King Louis died without a male heir, the country was stabilised only when [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]] (1387–1437) succeeded to the throne, who in 1433 also became [[Holy Roman Emperor]].
The first Hungarian [[Bible translations|Bible translation]] was completed in 1439. For half a year in 1437, there was an antifeudal and anticlerical [[Transylvanian peasant revolt|peasant revolt in Transylvania]] which was strongly influenced by [[Hussite]] ideas. From a small noble family in Transylvania, [[John Hunyadi]] grew to become one of the country's most powerful lords, thanks to his capabilities as a mercenary commander. He was elected governor, then regent. He was a successful crusader against the [[Ottoman Turks]], one of his greatest victories being the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|siege of Belgrade]] in 1456.

[[File:Portrait of Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary.jpg|alt=Portrait, Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, Hunyadi, relief|thumb|upright|Renaissance portrait of [[Matthias Corvinus]], King of Hungary and Croatia (1458–1490), King of Bohemia (1469–1490) and Archduke of Austria (1487–1490)]]

The last strong king of medieval Hungary was the [[Renaissance]] king [[Matthias Corvinus]] (1458–1490), son of John Hunyadi. His election was the first time that a member of the nobility mounted to the Hungarian royal throne without dynastic background. He was a successful military leader and an enlightened patron of the arts and learning. His library, the [[Bibliotheca Corviniana]], was Europe's greatest collection of historical chronicles, philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century, and second only in size to the [[Vatican Library]]. Items from the Bibliotheca Corviniana were inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]] in 2005. The serfs and common people considered him a just ruler because he protected them from excessive demands and other abuses by the magnates. Under his rule, in 1479, the Hungarian army destroyed the Ottoman and Wallachian troops at the [[Battle of Breadfield]]. Abroad he defeated the Polish and German imperial armies of Frederick at Breslau ([[Wrocław]]). Matthias' mercenary standing army, the [[Black Army of Hungary]], was an unusually large army for its time, and it conquered [[Vienna]] as well as parts of Austria and [[Bohemia]].

King Matthias died without lawful sons, and the Hungarian magnates procured the accession of the Pole [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] (1490–1516), supposedly because of his weak influence on Hungarian aristocracy. In 1514, the weakened old King Vladislaus II faced a major peasant rebellion led by [[György Dózsa]], which was ruthlessly crushed by the [[Hungarian nobility|nobles]], led by [[John Zápolya]]. The resulting degradation of order paved the way for Ottoman preeminence. In 1521, the strongest Hungarian fortress in the South, Nándorfehérvár (today's [[Belgrade]], Serbia), [[Siege of Belgrade (1521)|fell to the Turks]]. The early appearance of Protestantism further worsened internal relations in the country.

=== Ottoman wars (1526–1699) ===

[[File:Székely, Bertalan - The Women of Eger - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|"The Women of Eger", oil painting from 1867 commemorating the [[Siege of Eger (1552)|siege of Eger]], a major victory against the Ottomans]]

After some [[Ottoman wars in Europe|150 years of wars]] with the Hungarians and other states, the Ottomans gained a decisive victory over the Hungarian army at the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526, where King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] died while fleeing. Amid political chaos, the divided Hungarian nobility elected two kings simultaneously, [[John Zápolya]] and [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg dynasty]]. With the conquest of [[Buda]] by the Turks in 1541, Hungary was divided into three parts and remained so until the end of the 17th century. The north-western part, termed as [[Royal Hungary]], was annexed by the Habsburgs who ruled as kings of Hungary. The eastern part of the kingdom became independent as the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]], under Ottoman (and later Habsburg) [[suzerainty]]. The remaining central area, including the capital Buda, was known as the Pashalik of Buda.

In 1686, the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League's]] army, containing over 74,000 men from various nations, [[Siege of Buda (1686)|reconquered Buda]] from the Turks. After some more crushing [[Austro-Turkish War (1716–1718)|defeats of the Ottomans]] in the next few years, the entire Kingdom of Hungary was removed from Ottoman rule by 1718. The last raid into Hungary by the Ottoman vassals [[Crimean Khanate|Tatars]] from [[Crimea]] took place in 1717. The constrained Habsburg Counter-Reformation efforts in the 17th century reconverted the majority of the kingdom to Catholicism. The ethnic composition of Hungary was fundamentally changed as a consequence of the prolonged warfare with the Turks. A large part of the country became devastated, population growth was stunted, and many smaller settlements perished. The Austrian-Habsburg government settled large groups of [[Serbs]] and other Slavs in the depopulated south, and settled [[Germans of Hungary|Germans]] (called [[Danube Swabians]]) in various areas, but Hungarians were not allowed to settle or re-settle in the south of the Carpathian Basin.

=== From the 18th century to World War I (1699–1918) ===
{{Main|Rákóczi's War of Independence|Hungarian Reform Era|Hungarian Revolution of 1848|4 = Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|5 = Hungary in World War I}}
[[File:Mányoki, Ádam - Portrait of Prince Ferenc Rákóczi II - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francis II Rákóczi]], leader of the war of independence against Habsburg rule (1703–1711)]]

Between 1703 and 1711, there was a large-scale [[Rákóczi's War of Independence|war of independence]] led by [[Francis II Rákóczi]], who after the dethronement of the Habsburgs in 1707 at the Diet of [[Ónod]], took power provisionally as the ruling prince for the wartime period, but refused the Hungarian crown and the title "king". The uprisings lasted for years. The Hungarian [[Kuruc]] army, although taking over most of the country, lost the main [[Battle of Trenčín|battle at Trencsén]] (1708). Three years later, because of the growing desertion, defeatism, and low morale, the Kuruc forces surrendered.

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and afterward, the Hungarian Diet had not convened for decades. In the 1820s, the emperor was forced to convene the Diet, which marked the beginning of a Reform Period (1825–1848, {{langx|hu|reformkor}}). The Hungarian Parliament was reconvened in 1825 to handle financial needs. A liberal party emerged and focused on providing for the peasantry. [[Lajos Kossuth]] emerged as a leader of the lower [[gentry]] in the Parliament. A remarkable upswing started as the nation concentrated its forces on modernisation even though the Habsburg monarchs obstructed all important liberal laws relating to [[civil and political rights]] and economic reforms. Many reformers ([[Lajos Kossuth]], [[Mihály Táncsics]]) were imprisoned by the authorities.

[[File:E. Poulton Portrait of Lajos Kossuth 1860s.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Lajos Kossuth]], Regent-President during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]]]]

On 15 March 1848, mass demonstrations in Pest and Buda enabled Hungarian reformists to push through a list of [[12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848|12 demands]]. Under Governor and President [[Lajos Kossuth]] and Prime Minister [[Lajos Batthyány]], the House of Habsburg was dethroned. The Habsburg ruler and his advisors skillfully manipulated the Croatian, Serbian and Romanian peasantry, led by priests and officers firmly loyal to the Habsburgs, into rebelling against the Hungarian government, though the Hungarians were supported by the vast majority of the Slovak, German and [[Rusyns|Rusyn]] nationalities and by all the Jews of the kingdom, as well as by a large number of Polish, Austrian and Italian volunteers. In July 1849 the Hungarian Parliament proclaimed and enacted the first laws of ethnic and [[minority rights]] in the world. Many members of the nationalities gained the coveted highest positions within the Hungarian Army, like [[János Damjanich]] and [[Józef Bem]]. The Hungarian forces (''[[Royal Hungarian Landwehr|Honvédség]]'') defeated Austrian armies. To counter the successes of the Hungarian revolutionary army, Habsburg Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] asked for help from the "Gendarme of Europe", Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], whose Russian armies invaded Hungary. This made [[Artúr Görgei|Artúr Görgey]] surrender in August 1849. The leader of the Austrian army, [[Julius Jacob von Haynau]], became governor of Hungary for a few months and ordered the execution of [[the 13 Martyrs of Arad]], leaders of the Hungarian army, and Prime Minister Batthyány in October 1849. Kossuth escaped into exile. Following the war of 1848–1849, the whole country was in "passive resistance".

Because of external and internal problems, reforms seemed inevitable, and major military defeats of Austria forced the Habsburgs to negotiate the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], by which the dual monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]] was formed. This empire had the second largest area in Europe (after the [[Russian Empire]]), and it was the third most populous (after Russia and the [[German Empire]]). The two realms were governed separately by two parliaments from two capital cities, with a common monarch and common external and military policies. Economically, the empire was a customs union. The old Hungarian Constitution was restored, and Franz Joseph I was crowned as [[King of Hungary]]. The era witnessed impressive economic development. The formerly backward Hungarian economy became relatively modern and industrialised by the turn of the 20th century, although agriculture remained dominant until 1890. In 1873, the old capital Buda and [[Óbuda]] were officially united with [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], creating the new metropolis of Budapest. Many of the state institutions and the modern administrative system of Hungary were established during this period.

[[File:Austria-Hungary map.svg|thumb|The [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen]] consisted of the territories of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (16) and the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] (17)]]

After the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in Sarajevo, Prime Minister [[István Tisza]] and his cabinet tried to avoid the outbreak and escalating of a war in Europe, but their diplomatic efforts were unsuccessful. Austria-Hungary drafted over 4&nbsp;million soldiers from the Kingdom of Hungary on the side of Germany, Bulgaria, and Turkey. The troops raised in the Kingdom of Hungary spent little time defending the actual territory of Hungary, with the exceptions of the [[Brusilov offensive]] in June 1916 and a few months later when the Romanian army made an attack into Transylvania,{{self-published inline|date=January 2021}} both of which were repelled. The [[Central Powers]] conquered Serbia. Romania declared war. The Central Powers conquered southern Romania and the Romanian capital [[Bucharest]]. In 1916 Franz Joseph died, and the new monarch [[Charles I of Austria|Charles IV]] sympathised with the pacifists. With great difficulty, the Central Powers stopped and repelled the attacks of the Russian Empire.

The [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] of the Allied ([[Allies of World War I|Entente]]) Powers completely collapsed. The Austro-Hungarian Empire then withdrew from all defeated countries. Despite great success on the Eastern Front, Germany suffered complete defeat on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. By 1918, the economic situation had deteriorated (strikes in factories were organised by leftist and pacifist movements) and uprisings in the army had become common. In the capital cities, the Austrian and Hungarian leftist liberal movements and their leaders supported the separatism of ethnic minorities. Austria-Hungary signed a general armistice in [[Padua]] on 3 November 1918. In October 1918, Hungary's union with Austria was dissolved.

=== Between the World Wars (1918–1941) ===
{{Main|Hungary between the World Wars|Hungarian interwar economy|Treaty of Trianon}}{{More sources|subsection|date=April 2025}}[[File:Trianon consequences.png|left|thumb|With the 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon]], Hungary lost 72% of its territory, its sea ports, and 3,425,000 ethnic Hungarians.{{legend|#cd3318|Majority Hungarian areas (according to the 1910 census) detached from Hungary}}]]

Following the First World War, Hungary underwent a period of profound political upheaval, beginning with the [[Aster Revolution]] in 1918, which brought the social-democratic [[Mihály Károlyi]] to power as prime minister. The [[Royal Hungarian Honvéd|Hungarian Royal Honvéd army]] still had more than 1,400,000 soldiers when Károlyi was installed. Károlyi yielded to U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s demand for [[pacifism]] by ordering the disarmament of the Hungarian army. Disarmament meant that Hungary was to remain without a national defence at a time of particular vulnerability. During the rule of Károlyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost control over approximately 75% of its pre-war territories ({{Convert|325411|km2|sqmi}}) without a fight and was subject to foreign occupation. The [[Little Entente]], sensing an opportunity, invaded the country from three sides—[[Hungarian-Romanian War|Romania invaded Transylvania]], Czechoslovakia annexed [[Upper Hungary]] (today's Slovakia), and a joint [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serb]]-[[French Army|French]] coalition annexed [[Vojvodina]] and other southern regions. In March 1919, communists led by [[Béla Kun]] ousted the Károlyi government and proclaimed the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] (''Tanácsköztársaság''), followed by a thorough [[Red Terror (Hungary)|Red Terror]] campaign. Despite some successes on the Czechoslovak front, Kun's forces were ultimately unable to resist the Romanian invasion; by August 1919, Romanian troops occupied Budapest and ousted Kun.

[[File:Portraits de Miklós Horthy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Miklós Horthy]], Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1944)]]

In November 1919, rightist forces led by former Austro-Hungarian admiral [[Miklós Horthy]] entered Budapest; exhausted by the war and its aftermath, the populace accepted Horthy's leadership. In January 1920, parliamentary elections were held, and Horthy was proclaimed regent of the reestablished [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Kingdom of Hungary]], inaugurating the so-called "Horthy era" (''Horthy-kor''). The new government worked quickly to normalise foreign relations while turning a blind eye to a [[White Terror (Hungary)|White Terror]] that swept through the countryside; extrajudicial killings of suspected communists and Jews lasted well into 1920.

On 4 June 1920, the [[Treaty of Trianon]] established new borders for Hungary. The country lost 71% of its territory and 66% of its pre-war population, as well as many sources of raw materials and its sole port at [[Rijeka|Fiume]]. An estimated 3.3 million [[Hungarian diaspora|ethnic Hungarians were living in the ceded territories]], mostly in what is now [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Serbia]], although modern sources for this figure range from 2 million to 5 million. Though the revision of the treaty quickly rose to the top of the national political agenda, the Horthy government was not willing to resort to military intervention to do so.

The initial years of the Horthy regime were preoccupied with putsch attempts by [[Charles IV of Hungary|Charles IV]], the Austro-Hungarian [[pretender]]; continued suppression of communists; and a migration crisis triggered by the Trianon territorial changes. The government's actions continued to drift right with the passage of [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] laws and, because of the continued isolation of the Little Entente, economic and then political gravitation towards [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. The [[Great Depression]] further exacerbated the situation, and the popularity of fascist politicians increased, such as [[Gyula Gömbös]] and [[Ferenc Szálasi]], promising economic and social recovery. Horthy's nationalist agenda reached its apogee in 1938 and 1940, when the Nazis rewarded Hungary's staunchly pro-Germany foreign policy in the [[First Vienna Award|First]] and [[Second Vienna Award]]s, peacefully restoring ethnic-Hungarian-majority areas lost after Trianon. In 1939, Hungary regained further territory from Czechoslovakia [[Slovak–Hungarian War|through force]]. Hungary [[Tripartite Pact|formally joined]] the [[Axis powers]] on 20 November 1940 and in 1941 participated in the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], gaining some of its former territories in the south.

=== World War II (1941–1945) ===
{{Main|Hungary during World War II|Holocaust in Hungary|Soviet occupation of Hungary}}
[[File:Hungary 1941-44 Administrative Map.png|thumb|Kingdom of Hungary, 1941–1944]]

Hungary formally entered World War II as an Axis power on 26 June 1941, declaring war on the Soviet Union after unidentified planes bombed [[Košice|Kassa]], [[Munkacheve|Munkács]], and [[Rakhiv|Rahó]]. Hungarian troops fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] for two years. Despite early success at the [[Battle of Uman]], the government began seeking a secret peace pact with [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] after the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Second Army]] suffered catastrophic losses [[Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh offensive|at the River Don]] in January 1943. Learning of the planned defection, German troops [[Operation Margarethe|occupied Hungary]] on 19 March 1944 to guarantee Horthy's compliance.

In October, as the Soviet front approached, and the government made further efforts to disengage from the war, German troops ousted Horthy and installed a puppet government under Szálasi's fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]]. and through the 1947 [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaties]], Hungary was again reduced to its immediate post-Trianon borders.

The war left Hungary devastated, destroying over 60% of the economy and causing significant [[World War II casualties#endnote Hungary|loss of life]]. In addition to the over 600,000 Hungarian Jews killed, as many as 280,000 other Hungarians were raped, murdered and executed or deported for slave labour. After German occupation, Hungary participated in [[the Holocaust]], deporting nearly 440,000 Jews, mainly to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]; nearly all of them were murdered. The Horthy government's complicity in the Holocaust remains a point of controversy and contention.

[[File:Szétlőtt harckocsi a Móricz Zsigmond körtéren.jpg|thumb|left|A destroyed Soviet tank in Budapest during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Revolution of 1956]]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1956 was the Hungarian freedom fighter]]

Following the defeat of Nazi Germany, Hungary became a [[satellite state]] of the Soviet Union. The Soviet leadership selected [[Mátyás Rákosi]] to front the [[Stalinism|Stalinisation]] of the country, and Rákosi ''[[de facto]]'' ruled Hungary from 1949 to 1956. His government's policies of militarisation, industrialisation, collectivisation, and war compensation led to a severe decline in living standards. In imitation of Stalin's [[KGB]], the Rákosi government established a secret political police, the [[State Protection Authority|ÁVH]], to enforce the regime; approximately 350,000 officials and intellectuals were imprisoned or executed from 1948 to 1956. Many freethinkers, democrats, and Horthy-era dignitaries were secretly arrested and extrajudicially interned in domestic and foreign [[gulag]]s. Some 600,000 Hungarians were deported to Soviet labour camps, where at least 200,000 died.{{Better source needed|date=November 2025}}

After Stalin's death in 1953, the Soviet Union pursued a programme of [[De-Stalinization|de-Stalinisation]] that was inimical to Rákosi, leading to his deposition. The following political cooling saw the ascent of [[Imre Nagy]] to the premiership. Nagy promised market liberalisation and political openness. Rákosi eventually managed to discredit Nagy and replace him with the more hard-line [[Ernő Gerő]]. Hungary joined the [[Warsaw Pact]] in May 1955, as societal dissatisfaction with the regime swelled. Following the firing on peaceful demonstrations by Soviet soldiers and secret police, and rallies throughout the country on 23 October 1956, protesters took to the streets in Budapest, initiating the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Revolution]].

In an effort to quell the chaos, Nagy returned as premier, promised free elections, and took Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact. The violence nonetheless continued as revolutionary militias sprung up against the Soviet Army and the ÁVH; the roughly 3,000-strong resistance fought Soviet tanks using [[Molotov cocktail]]s and machine-pistols. Though the preponderance of the Soviets was immense, they suffered heavy losses, and by 30 October 1956, most Soviet troops had withdrawn from Budapest to garrison the countryside. For a time, the Soviet leadership was unsure how to respond but eventually decided to intervene to prevent a destabilisation of the Soviet bloc. On 4 November, reinforcements of more than 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks entered the country from the Soviet Union. Nearly 20,000 Hungarians were killed resisting the intervention, while an additional 21,600 were imprisoned afterward for political reasons. Some 13,000 were interned and 230 brought to trial and executed. Nagy was secretly tried, found guilty, sentenced to death, and executed by hanging in June 1958. Because borders were briefly opened, nearly a quarter of a million people fled the country by the time the revolution was suppressed.

[[File:János Kádár 1962.jpg|thumb|upright|[[János Kádár]], General Secretary of the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] (1956–1988)]]

After a second, briefer period of Soviet military occupation, [[János Kádár]], Nagy's former minister of state, was chosen by the Soviet leadership to head the new government and chair the new ruling [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]]. Kádár quickly normalised the situation. In 1963, the government granted a general amnesty. Kádár proclaimed a new policy line, according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the socialist regime as a fact of life. Kádár introduced new planning priorities in the economy, such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system (''háztáji gazdálkodás''). The living standard rose as consumer goods and food production took precedence over military production, which was reduced to one-tenth of prerevolutionary levels.

In 1968, the [[New Economic Mechanism]] introduced free-market elements into the socialist command economy. From the 1960s through the late 1980s, Hungary was often referred to as "the happiest barrack" within the Eastern bloc. During the latter part of the Cold War Hungary's [[Lists of countries by GDP per capita|GDP per capita]] was fourth only to [[East Germany]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and the Soviet Union. As a result of this relatively high [[standard of living]], a more liberalised economy, a less censored press, and less restricted travel rights, Hungary was generally considered one of the more liberal countries in which to live in Central Europe during communism. In 1980, Hungary sent a [[Cosmonaut]] into space as part of the [[Interkosmos]]. The first Hungarian astronaut was [[Bertalan Farkas]]. Hungary became [[Timeline of space travel by nationality|the seventh nation to be represented in space]] by him. In the 1980s, however, living standards steeply declined again because of [[Early 1980s recession|a worldwide recession]] to which communism was unable to respond. By the time Kádár died in 1989, the Soviet Union was in steep decline and a younger generation of reformists saw liberalisation as the solution to economic and social issues.

Hungary's transition from communism to capitalism (''rendszerváltás'', "regime change") was peaceful and prompted by economic stagnation, domestic political pressure, and changing relations with other Warsaw Pact countries. Although the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] began [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table Talks]] with various opposition groups in March 1989, the reburial of Imre Nagy as a revolutionary martyr that June is widely considered the symbolic end of communism in Hungary. Free elections were held [[1990 Hungarian parliamentary election|in May 1990]], and the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]], a major conservative opposition group, was elected to the head of a coalition government. [[József Antall]] became the first democratically elected prime minister since World War II.

With the removal of state subsidies and rapid privatisation in 1991, Hungary was affected by a severe economic recession. The Antall government's austerity measures proved unpopular, and the Communist Party's legal and political heir, the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], won the subsequent [[1994 Hungarian parliamentary election|1994 elections]]. This abrupt shift in the political landscape was repeated in [[1998 Hungarian parliamentary election|1998]] and [[2002 Hungarian parliamentary election|2002]]; in each electoral cycle, the governing party was ousted and the erstwhile opposition elected. Like most other post-communist European states, however, Hungary broadly pursued an [[European integration|integrationist]] agenda, [[Enlargement of NATO|joining NATO]] in 1999 and the European Union [[2003 Hungarian European Union membership referendum|in 2004]]. As a NATO member, Hungary was involved in the [[Yugoslav Wars]].

[[File:Police car at Hungary-Serbia border barrier.jpg|thumb|Police car at Hungary-Serbia border barrier]]In 2006, [[2006 protests in Hungary|major nationwide protests]] erupted after it was revealed that Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]] had claimed in [[Őszöd speech|a closed-door speech]] that his party "lied" to win the [[2006 Hungarian parliamentary election|recent elections]]. The popularity of left-wing parties plummeted in the ensuing political upheaval, and in 2010, [[Viktor Orbán]]'s national-conservative [[Fidesz]] party was [[2010 Hungarian parliamentary election|elected]] to a parliamentary [[supermajority]]. The legislature consequently approved a [[Constitution of Hungary|new constitution]], among other sweeping governmental and legal changes. Fidesz has won supermajorities in [[2014 Hungarian parliamentary election|every]] [[2018 Hungarian parliamentary election|subsequent]] [[2022 Hungarian parliamentary election|election]].

Since Orbán's election in 2010, Hungary has undergone [[democratic backsliding]]. It has been characterised as an [[illiberal democracy]],{{rp|95}} [[hybrid regime]], [[kleptocracy]], [[dominant-party system]], and [[mafia state]]. Orbán has publicly embraced illiberalism,{{Rp|page=9}} characterising Hungary as an "illiberal Christian democracy". As a result of these developments, Hungary's relationship with the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]] have entered a period of protracted strain. Various EU bodies and member states have moved to penalize Hungary or curtail its EU voting rights. Past and ongoing areas of conflict include [[LGBT rights in Hungary|LGBT rights]], migration, the ''[[lex CEU]],'' Hungary's decision to authorise [[Sputnik vaccine|Russian]] and [[CoronaVac|Chinese vaccines]] during the [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]], and [[International sanctions during the Russian invasion of Ukraine|international sanctions against Russia]]. The Orbán government has simultaneously come under increased international scrutiny over [[rule of law]] concerns. Hungary has and continues to dispute these allegations.
