===Prehistory===
[[File:El viajero ilustrado, 1878 602320 (3810561161).jpg|thumb|Solomon Islanders]]

The Solomons were first settled by people coming from the [[Bismarck Islands]] and [[New Guinea]] during the [[Pleistocene]] era {{Circa}} 30,000–28,000 BC, based on archaeological evidence found at [[Kilu Cave]] on [[Buka Island]] in the [[Autonomous Region of Bougainville]], [[Papua New Guinea]]. At this point sea levels were lower and Buka and Bougainville were physically joined to the southern Solomons in one landmass ("Greater Bougainville"), though it is unclear precisely how far south these early settlers spread as no other archaeological sites from this period have been found. Evidence of later human settlements dating to {{Circa}} 4500–2500 BC have been found at Poha Cave and Vatuluma Posovi Cave on [[Guadalcanal]]. Evidence for their presence has been found across the Solomon archipelago, as well at the [[Santa Cruz Islands]] in the south-east, with different islands being settled at different times.  These peoples mixed with the native Solomon Islanders and over time their languages became dominant, with most of the 60–70 languages spoken there belonging to the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] branch of the [[Austronesian language family]]. Then, as now, communities tended to exist in small villages practising subsistence agriculture, though extensive inter-island trade networks existed. The people of Solomon Islands were notorious for [[headhunting]] and [[Human cannibalism|cannibalism]] before the arrival of the Europeans.

===Arrival of Europeans (1568–1886)===
[[File:Alvaro de Mendaña de Neyra.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira]] (1542–1595), the first European to sight the Solomons]]

The first European to visit the islands was the Spanish navigator [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira]], sailing from [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] in 1568. Landing on [[Santa Isabel Island|Santa Isabel]] on 7 February, Mendaña explored several of the other islands including [[Makira]], Guadalcanal and [[Malaita]]. Relations with the native Solomon Islanders were initially cordial, although they often soured as time went by.

Save for [[Abel Tasman]]'s sighting of the remote [[Ontong Java Atoll]] in 1648, no European sailed to the Solomons again until 1767, when the British explorer [[Philip Carteret]] sailed by the Santa Cruz Islands, Malaita, and, continuing further north, Bougainville and the Bismarck Islands. The fate of La Pérouse was not confirmed until 1826, when the English merchant [[Peter Dillon]] visited Tikopia and discovered items belonging to La Pérouse in the possession of the local people, confirmed by the subsequent voyage of [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] in 1828.

Some of the earliest regular foreign visitors to the islands were [[whaling]] vessels from Britain, the United States and Australia. They came for food, wood and water from late in the 18th century, establishing a trading relationship with the Solomon Islanders and later taking aboard islanders to serve as crewmen on their ships. Relations between the islanders and visiting seamen were not always good and sometimes there was bloodshed. A knock-on effect of the greater European contact was the spread of diseases to which local peoples had no immunity, as well as a shift in the balance of power between coastal groups, who had access to European weapons and technology, and inland groups who did not.

Beginning in the 1840s, and accelerating in the 1860s, islanders began to be recruited (or often kidnapped) as labourers for the colonies in Australia, Fiji and Samoa in a process known as "[[blackbirding]]". Conditions for workers were often poor and exploitative, and local islanders often [[List of massacres in the Solomon Islands|violently]] attacked any Europeans who appeared on their island. Christian missionaries also began visiting the Solomons from the 1840s, beginning with an attempt by French Catholics under Jean-Baptiste Epalle to establish a mission on Santa Isabel, which was abandoned after Epalle was killed by islanders in 1845.

===Colonial period (1886–1978)===
{{Main|British Solomon Islands|British Western Pacific Territories|German New Guinea}}

====Establishment of colonial rule====
In 1884, [[German Empire|Germany]] annexed northeast New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago and, in 1886, extended its rule over the [[North Solomon Islands]], covering Bougainville, Buka, Choiseul, Santa Isabel, the Shortlands and Ontong Java atoll. In 1886 Germany and Britain confirmed this arrangement, with the British gaining a "sphere of influence" over the southern Solomons. Germany paid little attention to the islands, with German authorities based in New Guinea not even visiting the area until 1888.

In April 1896, colonial official [[Charles Morris Woodford]] was appointed as the British Acting Deputy Commissioner, and he was confirmed in his position in the following year. The Colonial Office appointed Woodford as the Resident Commissioner in the Solomon Islands on 17 February 1897. He was directed to control the coercive labour recruitment practices, known as [[blackbirding]], operating in the Solomon Island waters and to stop the illegal trade in firearms. and in 1898 and 1899 the [[Rennell and Bellona Province|Rennell and Bellona Islands]], [[Sikaiana]], the Santa Cruz Islands and outlying islands such as Anuta, Fataka, Temotu and Tikopia were added to the protectorate. In 1900, under the terms of the [[Tripartite Convention|Tripartite Convention of 1899]], Germany ceded the Northern Solomon to Britain, minus Buka and Bougainville, the latter becoming part of [[German New Guinea]] despite geographically belonging to the Solomons archipelago. Attempts at economic development met with mixed results, though [[Levers Pacific Plantations]] Ltd., a subsidiary of [[Lever Brothers]], managed to establish a profitable copra plantation industry which employed many islanders. However, the colony remained something of a backwater, with education, medical and other social services being under the administration of the missionaries.

====World War II====
{{main|Solomon Islands campaign|Japanese occupation of the Solomon Islands}}

With the outbreak of the Second World War most planters and traders were evacuated to Australia and most cultivation ceased. Some of the most intense fighting of the war occurred in the Solomons.

From 1942 until the end of 1943, the Solomon Islands were the scene of several major land, sea, and air battles between the Allies and the [[Empire of Japan]]'s armed forces. Following the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, war was declared between Japan and the Allied Powers, and the Japanese, seeking to protect their southern flank, invaded South-East Asia and New Guinea. In May 1942, the Japanese launched [[Operation Mo]], [[Invasion of Tulagi (May 1942)|occupying Tulagi]] and most of the western Solomon Islands, including Guadalcanal where they began work on an airstrip. In addition, around 3,200 men served in the [[Solomon Islands Labour Corps]] and some 6,000 enlisted in the [[British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force]], with their exposure to the Americans leading to several social and political transformations. For example, the Americans had extensively developed [[Honiara]], with the capital shifting there from Tulagi in 1952, and the [[Pijin language]] was heavily influenced by the communication between Americans and the Islands inhabitants.

{{main|Solomon Islands campaign|Guadalcanal campaign}}

The most significant of the Allied Forces' operations against the [[Japanese Imperial]] Forces was launched on 7 August 1942, with simultaneous naval bombardments and amphibious landings on the [[Florida Islands]] at [[Tulagi]] and Red Beach on [[Guadalcanal]].
	
The [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] became an important and bloody campaign fought in the Pacific War as the Allies began to repulse the Japanese expansion. Of strategic importance during the war were the [[coastwatchers]] operating in remote locations, often on Japanese held islands, providing early warning and intelligence of Japanese naval, army and aircraft movements during the campaign.

Islanders [[Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana]] were the first to find the shipwrecked [[John F. Kennedy]] and his crew of the [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]]. They suggested writing a rescue message on a coconut, and delivered the coconut by paddling a dugout canoe. The coconut was later kept on Kennedy's desk when he became [[President of the United States]].

====Post-war period and the lead-up to independence====
In 1943–44 the Malaita-based chief Aliki Nono'ohimae had founded the [[Maasina Ruru|Maasina Rule]] movement (aka the Native Council Movement, literally "Brotherhood Rule"), and was later joined by another chief, Hoasihau. Their aims were to improve the economic well-being of native Solomon Islanders, gain greater autonomy and to act as a liaison between Islanders and the colonial administration. The movement was especially popular with ex-Labour Corp members and after the war its numbers swelled, with the movement spreading to other islands. In late 1952 Stanley formally moved the capital of the territory to Honiara. In the early 1950s the possibility of transferring sovereignty of the islands to Australia was discussed by the British and Australian governments; however, the Australians were reluctant to accept the financial burden of administering the territory and the idea was shelved.

With decolonisation sweeping the colonial world, and Britain no longer willing (or able) to bear the financial burdens of the Empire, the colonial authorities sought to prepare the Solomons for self-governance. Appointed Executive and [[Legislative Council of the Solomon Islands|Legislative Councils]] were established in 1960, with a degree of elected Solomon Islander representation introduced in 1964 and then extended in 1967. A new constitution was drawn up in 1970 which merged the two Councils into one [[Governing Council of the Solomon Islands|Governing Council]], though the British Governor still retained extensive powers. Discontent with this prompted the creation of a new constitution in 1974 which reduced much of the Governor's remaining powers and created the post of Chief Minister, first held by [[Solomon Mamaloni]]. Full self-government for the territory was achieved in 1976, a year after the independence of neighbouring Papua New Guinea from Australia. Mamaloni created the Central Bank and national airline, and pushed for greater autonomy for individual islands of the country. Kenilorea returned to power after winning the [[1984 Solomon Islands general election|1984 election]], though his second term lasted only two years before he was replaced by [[Ezekiel Alebua]] following allegations of misuse of French aid money. In 1986 the Solomons helped found the [[Melanesian Spearhead Group]], aimed at fostering cooperation and trade in the region. After winning the [[1989 election]] Mamaloni and the PAP returned to power, with Mamaloni dominating Solomon Islands politics from the early to mid 1990s (save for the one year Premiership of [[Francis Billy Hilly]]). Mamaloni made efforts to make the Solomons a republic; however, these were unsuccessful. Tensions arose with Papua New Guinea as PNG forces frequently entered Solomons territory in the pursuit of rebels.

====Ethnic violence (1998–2003)====

Commonly referred to as ''the tensions'' or ''the ethnic tension'', the initial civil unrest was mainly characterised by fighting between the [[Isatabu Freedom Movement]] (IFM, also known as the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army and the Isatabu Freedom Fighters) and the [[Malaita Eagle Force]] (as well as the Marau Eagle Force). For many years people from the island of Malaita had been migrating to Honiara and Guadalcanal, attracted primarily by the greater economic opportunities available there. The large influx caused tensions with native Guadalcanal islanders (known as Guales), and in late 1998 the IFM was formed and began a campaign of intimidation and violence towards Malaitan settlers. Thousands of Malaitans subsequently fled back to Malaita or to Honiara, and in mid-1999 the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) was established to protect Malaitans on Guadalcanal. They are commemorated by the Anglican church on 24 April.

On 5 June 2000, Ulufa'alu was kidnapped by the MEF who felt that, although he was a Malaitan, he was not doing enough to protect their interests. On 15 October 2000, the [[Townsville Peace Agreement]] was signed by the MEF, elements of the IFM, and the Solomon Islands Government. Conflict also broke out in Western Province between locals and Malaitan settlers. The atmosphere of lawlessness, widespread extortion, and ineffective police prompted a formal request by the Solomon Islands Government for outside help; the request was unanimously supported in Parliament. Some 200 people had been killed in the conflict. However, other academics argue that, rather than being a 'failed state', it is an unformed state: a state that never consolidated even after decades of independence. Furthermore, some scholars, such as Kabutaulaka (2001) and Dinnen (2002) argue that the 'ethnic conflict' label is an oversimplification.

====Post-conflict era====

Kemakeza remained in office until April 2006, when he lost the [[2006 Solomon Islands general election]] and [[Snyder Rini]] became PM. However, allegations that Rini had used bribes from Chinese businessmen to buy the votes of members of Parliament led to mass rioting in the capital [[Honiara]], concentrated on the city's Chinatown area. Resentment against the minority [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] business community led to much of [[Chinatown]] in the city being destroyed. Evacuation of Australian and British citizens was on a much smaller scale. Additional Australian, New Zealand, and Fijian police and troops were dispatched to try to quell the unrest. Rini eventually resigned before facing a motion of no-confidence in Parliament, and Parliament elected [[Manasseh Sogavare]] as prime minister.

Sogavare struggled to assert his authority and was also hostile to the Australian presence in the country; after one failed attempt, he was removed in a no confidence vote in 2007 and replaced by [[Derek Sikua]] of the Solomon Islands Liberal Party. In 2008, a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Solomon Islands)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] was established to examine and help heal the wounds of the 'tension' years. Sikua lost the [[2010 Solomon Islands general election]] to [[Danny Philip]], though after a vote of no-confidence in him following allegations of corruption, Philip was ousted and replaced by [[Gordon Darcy Lilo]]. Sogavare returned to power after the [[2014 Solomon Islands general election|2014 election]], and oversaw the withdrawal of RAMSI forces from the country in 2017. In 2019, Sogavare announced that the Solomons would be switching recognition from Taiwan to China.

On 25 November 2019, Solomon Islands launched a national [[Ocean governance|ocean policy]] to achieve the sustainable development and use of the ocean for the benefit of the people of the island nation.

In [[2021 Solomon Islands unrest|November 2021, there was mass rioting and unrest]]. The Solomon Islands Government requested assistance from Australia under the 2017 Bilateral Security Treaty and Australia provided a deployment of [[Australian Federal Police]] and [[Australian Defence Force|Defence Forces]].

In March 2022, Solomon Islands signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] (MOU) on policing cooperation with China and was also reported to be in the process of concluding a security agreement with China. The agreement with China could allow an ongoing Chinese military and naval presence in the Solomons. A spokesperson for Australia's [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] said that, while "Pacific Island nations have the right to make sovereign decisions", Australia "would be concerned by any actions that destabilise the security of our region". There are similar concerns in New Zealand and the United States. China donated a shipment of replica firearms to the Solomon Islands police for training. Solomon Islands and China signed a security co-operation agreement in April to promote social stability and long-term peace and security in Solomon Islands. The BBC reported that, according to a leaked draft of the agreement verified by the Australian government, Beijing could deploy forces to Solomon Islands "to assist in maintaining social order". Prime Minister [[Manasseh Sogavare]] said the pact would not "undermine peace and harmony" in the region and was aimed at protecting the Solomon's internal security situation. China confirmed that the social-order clause had been maintained in the final agreement.

In February 2023, [[2023 Solomon Islands protests|further protests broke out]] after the Premier of [[Malaita Province]] [[Daniel Suidani]] was removed from office after a vote of no confidence from the provincial legislature. In May 2024, [[Jeremiah Manele]] was elected as Solomon Islands new prime minister to succeed Manasseh Sogavare.
