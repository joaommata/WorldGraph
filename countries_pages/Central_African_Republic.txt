=== Early history ===
[[File:Bouar Megaliths stamp.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Bouar]] Megaliths, pictured here on a 1967 Central African stamp, date back to the very late Neolithic Era ({{Circa|3500–2700 BCE}}).]]
Approximately 10,000 years ago, [[desertification]] forced [[hunter-gatherer]] societies south into the Sahel regions of northern Central Africa, where some groups settled. Farming began as part of the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. Initial farming of [[Dioscorea rotundata|white yam]] progressed into [[millet]] and [[sorghum]], and before 3000{{Nbsp}}BCE the domestication of [[Elaeis guineensis|African oil palm]] improved the groups' nutrition and allowed for expansion of the local populations. This agricultural revolution, combined with a "Fish-stew Revolution", in which fishing began to take place and the use of boats, allowed for the transportation of goods. Products were often moved in [[ceramic]] pots.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

The [[Bouar|Bouar Megaliths]] in the western region of the country indicate an advanced level of habitation dating back to the very late [[Neolithic|Neolithic Era]] ({{Circa|3500–2700 BCE}}). [[Ferrous metallurgy|Ironwork]] developed in the region around 1000{{Nbsp}}BCE.

The [[Ubangian languages|Ubangian people]] settled along the [[Ubangi River]] in what is today the Central and East Central African Republic while some [[Bantu peoples|Bantu people]] migrated from the southwest of [[Cameroon]].

[[Banana]]s arrived in the region during the first millennium BCE and added an important source of carbohydrates to the diet; they were also used in the production of [[alcoholic beverages]]. Production of [[copper]], [[salt]], [[dried fish]], and [[textiles]] dominated the economic trade in the Central African region.

===16th–19th century===

In the 16th and 17th centuries, [[History of slavery|slave trade]]rs began to raid the region as part of the expansion of the Saharan and Nile River slave routes. Their captives were enslaved and shipped to the Mediterranean coast, Europe, Arabia, the Western Hemisphere, or to the slave ports and factories along the West and North Africa or South along the Ubangui and Congo rivers. During the 18th century Bandia-Nzakara [[Azande]] peoples established the [[Bangassou]] Kingdom along the [[Ubangi River]]. In the mid 19th century, the [[Bangi language|Bobangi people]] became major slave traders and sold their captives to the Americas using the Ubangi river to reach the coast. In 1875, the [[Sudan]]ese sultan [[Rabih az-Zubayr]] governed Upper-Oubangui, which included present-day Central African Republic.

=== French colonial period ===
{{Main|Ubangi-Shari|French Equatorial Africa|Colonialism in the Central African Republic}}
The European invasion of Central African territory began in the late 19th century during the [[Scramble for Africa]]. Europeans, primarily the French, [[Germans]], and [[Belgians]], arrived in the area in 1885. France seized and colonized [[Ubangi-Shari]] territory in 1894. In 1911 at the [[Treaty of Fez]], France ceded a nearly 300,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> portion of the Sangha and Lobaye basins to the [[German Empire]] which ceded a smaller area (in present-day [[Chad]]) to France. After [[World War I]] France again annexed the territory. Modeled on [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold]]'s [[Congo Free State]], concessions were doled out to private companies that endeavored to strip the region's assets as quickly and cheaply as possible before depositing a percentage of their profits into the French treasury. The concessionary companies [[corvée|forced local people]] to harvest rubber, coffee, and other commodities without pay and held their families hostage until they met their quotas.

[[File:De Gaulle Bangui 1940.jpg|thumb|[[Charles de Gaulle]] in Bangui, 1940]]
In 1920, [[French Equatorial Africa]] was established and Ubangi-Shari was administered from [[Brazzaville]]. During the 1920s and 1930s the French introduced a policy of mandatory cotton cultivation, a network of roads were built, attempts were made to combat [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], and [[Protestant]] [[Mission (Christianity)|missions]] were established to spread Christianity. New forms of forced labour were also introduced and a large number of Ubangians were sent to work on the [[Congo-Ocean Railway]]. Through the period of construction until 1934 there was a continual heavy cost in human lives, with total deaths among all workers along the railway estimated in excess of 17,000 of the construction workers, from a combination of both industrial accidents and diseases including [[malaria]]. In 1928, a major insurrection, the [[Kongo-Wara rebellion]] or 'war of the hoe handle', broke out in Western Ubangi-Shari and continued for several years. The extent of this insurrection, which was perhaps the largest anti-colonial rebellion in Africa during the interwar years, was carefully hidden from the French public because it provided evidence of strong opposition to French colonial rule and forced labour.
French colonization in Oubangui-Chari is considered to be the most brutal of the French colonial Empire.

In September 1940, during the [[Second World War]], [[Charles de Gaulle|pro-Gaullist]] French officers took control of Ubangi-Shari and [[General Leclerc]] established his headquarters for the [[Free French Forces]] in [[Bangui]]. In 1946 [[Barthélemy Boganda]] was elected with 9,000 votes to the [[French National Assembly]], becoming the first representative of the Central African Republic in the French government. Boganda maintained a political stance against racism and the colonial regime but gradually became disheartened with the French political system and returned to the Central African Republic to establish the [[Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa]] (''Mouvement pour l'évolution sociale de l'Afrique noire'', MESAN) in 1950.

=== Since independence (1960–present) ===
In the [[1957 Ubangi-Shari parliamentary election|Ubangi-Shari Territorial Assembly election]] in 1957, MESAN captured 347,000 out of the total 356,000 votes and won every legislative seat, which led to Boganda being elected president of the Grand Council of [[French Equatorial Africa]] and vice-president of the Ubangi-Shari Government Council. Within a year, he declared the establishment of the Central African Republic and served as the country's first prime minister. MESAN continued to exist, but its role was limited. The Central African Republic was granted autonomy within the French Community on 1 December 1958, a status which meant it was still counted as part of the French Empire in Africa.

After Boganda's death in a [[Barthélemy Boganda#Plane crash|plane crash]] on 29 March 1959, his cousin, [[David Dacko]], took control of MESAN. Dacko became the country's first president when the Central African Republic formally received [[independence]] from France at midnight on 13 August 1960, a date celebrated by the country's [[List of national independence days|Independence Day]] holiday. Dacko threw out his political rivals, including [[Abel Goumba]], former Prime Minister and leader of [[Democratic Evolution Movement of Central Africa|Mouvement d'évolution démocratique de l'Afrique centrale]] (MEDAC), whom he forced into exile in France. With all opposition parties suppressed by November 1962, Dacko declared MESAN as the official party of the state.

====Bokassa and the Central African Empire (1965–1979)====
{{Further|Central African Empire}}
[[File:Bokassa with Ceausescu (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], self-crowned [[Emperor of Central Africa]]]]
On 31 December 1965, Dacko was overthrown in the [[Saint-Sylvestre coup d'état]] by Colonel [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], who suspended the constitution and dissolved the National Assembly. President Bokassa declared himself President for Life in 1972 and named himself Emperor Bokassa I of the [[Central African Empire]] (as the country was renamed) on 4 December 1976. A year later, Emperor Bokassa [[Coronation of Bokassa I and Catherine|crowned himself in an expensive ceremony]].

In April 1979, young students protested against Bokassa's decree that all school pupils were required to buy uniforms from a company owned by one of his wives. The government violently suppressed the protests, killing 100 children and teenagers. Bokassa might have been personally involved in some of the killings. In September 1979, [[Operation Caban|France overthrew Bokassa]] and restored Dacko to power (subsequently restoring the official name of the country and the original government to the Central African Republic). Dacko, in turn, was again overthrown in a [[1981 Central African Republic coup d'état|coup]] by General [[André Kolingba]] on 1 September 1981.

==== Central African Republic under Kolingba ====
Kolingba suspended the constitution and ruled with a [[military junta]] until 1985. He introduced a new constitution in 1986 which was adopted by a nationwide referendum. Membership in his new party, the [[Rassemblement Démocratique Centrafricain]] (RDC), was voluntary. In 1987 and 1988, semi-free elections to parliament were held, but Kolingba's two major political opponents, [[Abel Goumba]] and [[Ange-Félix Patassé]], were not allowed to participate.

By 1990, inspired by the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], a pro-democracy movement arose. Pressure from the United States, France, and from a group of locally represented countries and agencies called GIBAFOR (France, the US, Germany, Japan, the EU, the [[World Bank]], and the [[United Nations]]) finally led Kolingba to agree, in principle, to hold free elections in October 1992 with help from the UN Office of Electoral Affairs. After using the excuse of alleged irregularities to suspend the results of the elections as a pretext for holding on to power, President Kolingba came under intense pressure from GIBAFOR to establish a "Conseil National Politique Provisoire de la République" (Provisional National Political Council, CNPPR) and to set up a "Mixed Electoral Commission", which included representatives from all political parties.

When a second round of elections were finally held in 1993, again with the help of the international community coordinated by GIBAFOR, Ange-Félix Patassé won in the second round of voting with 53% of the vote while Goumba won 45.6%. Patassé's party, the ''Mouvement pour la Libération du Peuple Centrafricain'' (MLPC) or Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People, gained a [[Plurality voting|plurality]] (relative majority) but not an [[Majority|absolute majority]] of seats in parliament, which meant Patassé's party required coalition partners.

==== Patassé government (1993–2003) ====
Patassé purged many of the Kolingba elements from the government and Kolingba supporters accused Patassé's government of conducting a "[[Witch-hunt#Figurative use of the term|witch hunt]]" against the Yakoma. A new constitution was approved on 28 December 1994 but had little impact on the country's politics. In 1996–1997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in the government's erratic behavior, three [[Mutiny|mutinies]] against Patassé's administration were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension. During this time (1996), the [[Peace Corps]] evacuated all its volunteers to neighboring Cameroon. To date, the Peace Corps has not returned to the Central African Republic. The [[Bangui Agreements]], signed in January 1997, provided for the deployment of an inter-African military mission, to the Central African Republic and re-entry of ex-mutineers into the government on 7 April 1997. The inter-African military mission was later replaced by a U.N. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1159|peacekeeping force (MINURCA)]]. Since 1997, the country has hosted almost a dozen peacekeeping interventions, earning it the title of "world champion of peacekeeping".

In 1998, parliamentary elections resulted in Kolingba's RDC winning 20 out of 109 seats. The next year, however, in spite of widespread public anger in urban centers over his corrupt rule, Patassé won a second term in the presidential election.

On 28 May 2001, rebels stormed strategic buildings in Bangui in an [[2001 Central African Republic coup d'état attempt|unsuccessful coup attempt]]. The army chief of staff, Abel Abrou, and General François N'Djadder Bedaya were killed, but Patassé regained the upper hand by bringing in at least 300 troops of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] rebel leader [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] and Libyan soldiers.

In the aftermath of the [[2001 Central African Republic coup d'état attempt|failed coup]], militias loyal to Patassé sought revenge against rebels in many neighborhoods of [[Bangui]] and incited unrest including the murder of many political opponents. Eventually, Patassé came to suspect that General [[François Bozizé]] was involved in another coup attempt against him, which led Bozizé to flee with loyal troops to Chad. In March 2003, Bozizé launched a surprise attack against Patassé, who was out of the country. Libyan troops and some 1,000 soldiers of Bemba's Congolese rebel organization failed to stop the rebels and Bozizé's forces succeeded in overthrowing Patassé.

==== Civil wars ====

{{See also|Central African Republic Bush War|Central African Republic Civil War}}
[[François Bozizé]] suspended the constitution and named a new cabinet, which included most opposition parties. [[Abel Goumba]] was named vice-president. Bozizé established a broad-based National Transition Council to draft a new constitution, and announced that he would step down and run for office once the new constitution was approved.

In 2004, the [[Central African Republic Bush War]] began as forces opposed to Bozizé took up arms against his government. In May 2005, Bozizé won the presidential election, which excluded Patassé, and in 2006 fighting continued between the government and the rebels. In November 2006, Bozizé's government requested French military support to help them repel rebels who had taken control of towns in the country's northern regions. Though the initial public details of the agreement pertained to logistics and intelligence, by December the French assistance included airstrikes by [[Dassault Mirage 2000]] fighters against rebel positions.

The Syrte Agreement in February and the Birao Peace Agreement in April 2007 called for a cessation of hostilities, the billeting of [[Democratic Front of the Central African People|FDPC]] fighters and their integration with FACA, the liberation of political prisoners, the integration of FDPC into government, an amnesty for the [[Union of Democratic Forces for Unity|UFDR]], its recognition as a political party, and the integration of its fighters into the national army. Several groups continued to fight but other groups signed on to the agreement or similar agreements with the government (e.g., UFR on 15 December 2008). The only major group not to sign an agreement at the time was the [[Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace|CPJP]], which continued its activities and signed a peace agreement with the government on 25 August 2012.

In 2011, Bozizé was reelected in an election which was widely considered fraudulent.

In November 2012, [[Séléka]], a coalition of rebel groups, took over towns in the northern and central regions of the country. These groups eventually reached a peace deal with Bozizé's government in January 2013, involving a power-sharing government. The deal later broke down, and the rebels seized the capital in March 2013 and Bozizé fled the country.

[[Michel Djotodia]] took over as president. Prime Minister [[Nicolas Tiangaye]] requested a [[UN]] peacekeeping force from the [[UN Security Council]] and on 31 May former President Bozizé was indicted for crimes against humanity and incitement to genocide. By the end of the year, there were international warnings of a "genocide" and fighting was largely reprisal attacks on civilians by Seleka's predominantly Muslim fighters and Christian militias called "[[anti-balaka]]". By August 2013, there were reports of over 200,000 [[internally displaced persons]] (IDPs).

On 18 February 2014, [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] called on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] to immediately deploy 3,000 troops to the country, bolstering the 6,000 African Union soldiers and 2,000 French troops already in the country, to combat civilians being murdered in large numbers. The ''Séléka'' government was said to be divided, and in September 2013, Djotodia officially disbanded Seleka, but many rebels refused to disarm, becoming known as ex-Seleka, and veered further out of government control. It is argued that the focus of the initial disarmament efforts exclusively on the Seleka inadvertently handed the anti-Balaka the upper hand, leading to the forced displacement of Muslim civilians by anti-Balaka in Bangui and western Central African Republic.

On 11 January 2014, Michael Djotodia and Nicolas Tiengaye resigned as part of a deal negotiated at a regional summit in neighboring [[Chad]]. [[Catherine Samba-Panza]] was elected interim president by the National Transitional Council, becoming the first ever female Central African president. On 23 July 2014, following Congolese mediation efforts, Séléka and anti-balaka representatives signed a ceasefire agreement in [[Brazzaville]]. By the end of 2014, the country was de facto partitioned with the anti-Balaka in the southwest and ex-Seleka in the northeast. In March 2015, [[Samantha Power]], the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said 417 of the country's 436 mosques had been destroyed, and Muslim women were so scared of going out in public they were giving birth in their homes instead of going to the hospital. On 14 December 2015, Séléka rebel leaders declared an independent [[Republic of Logone]].

==== Touadéra government (2016–present) ====
[[File:War_in_Central_African_Republic.svg|thumb|Current military situation in Central African Republic]]
[[2015–16 Central African general election|Presidential elections]] were held in December 2015. As no candidate received more than 50% of the vote, a second round of elections was held on 14 February 2016 with run-offs on 31 March 2016. In the second round of voting, former Prime Minister [[Faustin-Archange Touadéra]] was declared the winner with 63% of the vote, defeating [[Union for Central African Renewal]] candidate [[Anicet-Georges Dologuélé]], another former Prime Minister. While the elections suffered from many potential voters being absent as they had taken refuge in other countries, the fears of widespread violence were ultimately unfounded, and the [[African Union]] regarded the elections as successful.

Touadéra was sworn in on 30 March 2016. No representatives of the Seleka rebel group or the "anti-balaka" militias were included in the subsequently formed government.

[[2020–21 Central African general election|Presidential elections]] were held on 27 December 2020. Former president [[François Bozizé]] announced his candidacy but was rejected by the Constitutional Court of the country, which held that Bozizé did not satisfy the "good morality" requirement for candidates because of an international warrant and [[United Nations]] sanctions against him for alleged assassinations, torture and other crimes.

As large parts of the country were at the time controlled by armed groups, the election could not be conducted in many areas of the country. Some 800 of the country's polling stations, or 14% of the total, were closed due to violence. Three [[Burundi]]an peacekeepers were killed and an additional two were wounded during the run-up to the election. President Faustin-Archange Touadéra was reelected. Russian mercenaries from the [[Wagner Group]] have supported President Faustin-Archange Touadéra in the fight against rebels. Russia's Wagner group has been accused of harassing and intimidating civilians. In December 2022, [[Roger Cohen]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'', "[[Wagner Group|Wagner]] shock troops form a Praetorian Guard for Mr. Touadéra, who is also protected by Rwandan forces, in return for an untaxed license to exploit and export the Central African Republic's resources" and "one Western ambassador called the Central African Republic...a 'vassal state' of the Kremlin."
