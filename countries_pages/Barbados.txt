{{Main|History of Barbados}}

=== Geological history ===
Around 700,000 years ago, the island emerged from the ocean as a body of soft rock known as a [[diapir]] rose from the mantle beneath its present-day location. This process is still ongoing, raising Barbados at an average rate of 30 centimetres per thousand years. Dozens of inland sea reefs still dominate coastal features within terraces and cliffs on the island. More permanent [[Amerindian]] settlement of Barbados dates to about the 4th to 7th centuries AD, by a group known as the [[Saladoid]]-Barrancoid. Settlements of [[Arawaks]] from South America appeared by around 800 AD and again in the 12th–13th century.

=== European arrival ===

It is uncertain which European nation arrived first in Barbados, which probably would have been at some point in the 15th century or 16th century. One lesser-known source points to earlier revealed works antedating contemporary sources, indicating it could have been the Spanish. were the first Europeans to come upon the island. The island was largely ignored by Europeans, though Spanish slave raiding is thought to have reduced the native population, with many fleeing to other islands.

=== English settlement in the 17th century ===

The first English ship, which had arrived on 14 May 1625, was captained by John Powell. The first settlement began on 17 February 1627, near what is now [[Holetown]] (formerly Jamestown, after King James I of England), by a group led by John Powell's younger brother, [[Henry Powell (governor)|Henry]], consisting of 80 settlers and 10 English [[Indentured servitude|indentured labourers]]. Some sources state that some Africans were among these first settlers. Courten's title was later transferred to [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle]], in what was called the "Great Barbados Robbery". Carlisle then chose as governor [[Henry Powell (governor)|Henry Powell]], who established the [[Barbados House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] in 1639, in an effort to appease the planters, who might otherwise have opposed his controversial appointment.

In the period 1640–1660, the West Indies attracted more than two-thirds of the total number of English emigrants to the Americas. By 1650, there were 44,000 settlers in the West Indies, as compared to 12,000 on the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] and 23,000 in [[New England]]. Most English arrivals were indentured. After five years of labour, they were given "freedom dues" of about £10, usually in goods. Before the mid-1630s, they also received {{convert|5|to|10|acre|ha|abbr=off|0}} of land, but after that time the island filled and there was no more free land. During the [[Interregnum (England)|Cromwellian era]] (1650s) this included a large number of prisoners-of-war, vagrants and people who were illicitly kidnapped, who were forcibly transported to the island and sold as servants. These last two groups were predominantly Irish, as several thousand were infamously rounded up by English merchants and sold into servitude in Barbados and other Caribbean islands during this period, a practice that came to be known as being ''Barbadosed''. Cultivation of [[sugar]] was thus handled primarily by European indentured labour until it became difficult to bring more indentured servants from England.

[[Parishes of Barbados|Parish]] registers from the 1650s show that, for the white population, there were four times as many deaths as marriages. The mainstay of the infant colony's economy was the growth export of tobacco, but tobacco prices eventually fell in the 1630s as Chesapeake production expanded. The conditions of the surrender were incorporated into the [[Charter of Barbados]] ([[Oistins#History|Treaty of Oistins]]), which was signed at the Mermaid's Inn, [[Oistins]], on 17 January 1652.

=== Irish people in Barbados ===

{{Main|Irish people in Barbados}}
Starting with [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]], a large percentage of the white labourer population were indentured servants and involuntarily transported people from Ireland. Irish servants in Barbados were often treated poorly, and Barbadian planters gained a reputation for cruelty.{{rp|55}} The decreased appeal of an indenture on Barbados, combined with enormous demand for labour caused by sugar cultivation, led to the use of involuntary transportation to Barbados as a punishment for crimes, or for political prisoners, and also to the kidnapping of labourers who were deported to Barbados.{{rp|236}} According to historian [[Thomas Bartlett (historian)|Thomas Bartlett]], it is "generally accepted" that approximately 10,000 Irish were deported to the West Indies and approximately 40,000 came as voluntary indentured servants, while many also travelled as voluntary, un-indentured emigrants.{{rp|256}}

==== The sugar revolution ====
[[File:Mercado de los domingos, donde lo esclavos eran intercambiados por otros bienes y necesidades (Barbados Museum, Bridgetown).jpg|thumb|Sunday market in Barbados during the colonial era]]
The introduction of [[sugar cane]] from [[Dutch Brazil]] in 1640 completely transformed society, the economy and the physical landscape. Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries. One group instrumental in ensuring the early success of the industry was the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jews]], who had originally been expelled from the [[Iberian peninsula]], to end up in [[Dutch Brazil]]. The law's text was influential in laws in other colonies.

By 1680 there were 20,000 free whites and 46,000 enslaved Africans; Growing opposition to slavery led to its abolition in the British Empire in 1833. In 1854, a [[cholera]] epidemic killed more than 20,000 inhabitants.

=== 20th century before independence ===

Deep dissatisfaction with the situation on Barbados led many to emigrate. Things came to a head in the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]], as Barbadians [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934–1939|began demanding]] better conditions for workers, the legalisation of trade unions and a widening of the franchise, which at that point was limited to male property owners. He became the first Premier of Barbados in 1953, followed by fellow BLP-founder [[Hugh Gordon Cummins]] from 1958 to 1961. A group of left-leaning politicians who advocated swifter moves to independence broke off from the BLP and founded the [[Democratic Labour Party (Barbados)|Democratic Labour Party]] (DLP) in 1955. The DLP subsequently won the [[1961 Barbadian general election]] and their leader [[Errol Barrow]] became premier.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}}

Full internal self-government was enacted in 1961.

=== Post-independence era ===

The Barrow government sought to diversify the economy away from agriculture, seeking to boost industry and the tourism sector. Barbados was also at the forefront of regional integration efforts, spearheading the creation of [[CARIFTA]] and [[CARICOM]]. Adams died in office in 1985 and was replaced by [[Harold Bernard St. John]]; however, St. John lost the [[1986 Barbadian general election]], which saw the return of the DLP under Errol Barrow, who had been highly critical of the US intervention in Grenada. Barrow, too, died in office, and was replaced by [[Lloyd Erskine Sandiford]], who remained Prime Minister until 1994.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}}

[[Owen Arthur]] of the BLP won the [[1994 Barbadian general election]], remaining prime minister until 2008. Arthur was a strong advocate of republicanism, though a planned referendum to replace Queen Elizabeth as Head of State in 2008 never took place. The DLP won the [[2008 Barbadian general election]], but the new Prime Minister [[David Thompson (Barbadian politician)|David Thompson]] died in 2010 and was replaced by [[Freundel Stuart]]. The BLP returned to power [[2018 Barbadian general election|in 2018]] under [[Mia Mottley]], who became Barbados's first female prime minister.

==== Transition to republic ====

{{Main|Republicanism in Barbados}}
The Government of Barbados announced on 15 September 2020 that it intended to become a republic by 30 November 2021, the 55th anniversary of its independence, resulting in the replacement of the [[Barbadian monarchy]] with a president elected through [[electoral college]]. Barbados would then cease to be a [[Commonwealth realm]], but could maintain membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], like [[Guyana]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

On 20 September 2021, just over a full year after the announcement for the transition was made, the [[Constitution (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2021]] was introduced to the Parliament of Barbados. Passed on 6 October, the Bill made amendments to the Constitution of Barbados, introducing the office of the [[president of Barbados]] to replace the role of [[Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Barbados. The following week, on 12 October 2021, incumbent [[Governor-General of Barbados]] [[Sandra Mason]] was jointly nominated by the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition as candidate to be the first [[president of Barbados]], and was subsequently [[2021 Barbadian presidential election|elected]] on 20 October. Mason took office on 30 November 2021. [[Prince Charles]], the heir apparent to the Barbadian Crown at the time, attended the swearing-in ceremony in Bridgetown at the invitation of the Government of Barbados.

Queen Elizabeth sent a message of congratulations to President Mason and the people of Barbados, saying: "As you celebrate this momentous day, I send you and all Barbadians my warmest good wishes for your happiness, peace and prosperity in the future."

A survey that was conducted between 23 October 2021 and 10 November 2021, by the [[University of the West Indies]] showed 34% of respondents being in favour of transitioning to a republic, while 30% were indifferent. Notably, no overall majority was found in the survey; with 24% not indicating a preference and the remaining 12% being opposed to the removal of Queen Elizabeth.

On 20 June 2022, a Constitutional Review Commission was formed and sworn in by Jeffrey Gibson (who at the time was serving temporarily as Acting President of Barbados) to review the Constitution of Barbados.

The commission was given a 15-month timeline to complete its work, which included consulting the public about the new republic and drafting a constitution. Thus, the CRC engaged the public in a number of public meetings, lectures, and [[Twitter Spaces]]. The report was announced delayed by August 2023, with the final report submitted 30 June 2024.
