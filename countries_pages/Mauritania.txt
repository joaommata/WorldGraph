===Early history===
[[File:Rock Art Mauritania.jpg|thumb|left|Rock art in the [[Sahara Desert]]]]
The ancient tribes of Mauritania were [[Berbers|Berber]], [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo]], and [[Bafour]] peoples. The Bafour were among the first Saharan peoples to abandon their previously nomadic lifestyle and adopt a primarily agricultural one. In response to the gradual desiccation of the [[Sahara]], they eventually migrated southward. Many of the Berber tribes have claimed to have [[Yemen]]i (and sometimes other [[Arabs|Arab]]) origins. Little evidence supports those claims; however, a 2000 [[DNA]] study of the Yemeni people suggested some ancient connection might exist between the peoples.

The [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyads]] were the first [[Arab Muslims]] to enter Mauritania. During the [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic conquests]], they made incursions into Mauritania and were present in the region by the end of the seventh century. Many [[Berbers|Berber]] tribes in Mauritania fled the arrival of the Arabs to the [[Gao]] region in [[Mali]].

Other peoples also migrated south past the Sahara and into [[West Africa]]. In the 11th century, several nomadic Berber confederations in the desert regions overlapping present-day Mauritania joined to form the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] movement. They expanded north and south, spawning an important empire that stretched from the Sahara to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in [[Europe]]. According to a disputed Arab tradition, the Almoravids traveled south and conquered the ancient and extensive [[Ghana Empire]] around 1076.

From 1644 to 1674, the indigenous peoples of the area that is modern Mauritania made what became their final effort to repel the Yemeni [[Maqil]] Arabs who were invading their territory. This effort, which was unsuccessful, is known as the [[Char Bouba war|Char Bouba War]]. The invaders were led by the [[Beni Ḥassān|Beni Hassan]] tribe. The descendants of the Beni Hassan warriors became the [[hassane|upper stratum]] of [[Moors|Moorish]] society. [[Hassaniya Arabic|Hassaniya]], a bedouin [[Varieties of Arabic|Arabic dialect]] named for the Beni Hassan, became the dominant language among the largely [[nomad]]ic population.

Starting in the late 19th century, France [[Franco-Trarzan War of 1825|laid claim to the territories]] of present-day Mauritania, from the [[Senegal River]] area northwards. In 1901, [[Xavier Coppolani]] took charge of the imperial mission. Through a combination of strategic alliances with [[Zawaya]] tribes and military pressure on the [[Hassane]] warrior nomads, he managed to extend French rule over the Mauritanian [[emirate]]s. Beginning in 1903 and 1904, the French armies succeeded in occupying [[Emirate of Trarza|Trarza]], [[Brakna Region|Brakna]], and [[Tagant Region|Tagant]]. However the northern emirate of [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar]] held out longer; the emirate was aided by the anticolonial rebellion (or ''[[jihad]]'') of ''shaykh'' [[Ma al-'Aynayn|Maa al-Aynayn]] and by insurgents from Tagant and the other occupied regions. In 1904, France organized the territory of Mauritania, and it became part of [[French West Africa]], first as a [[protectorate]] and later as a colony. In 1912, the French armies defeated Adrar, and incorporated it into the territory of Mauritania.

French rule brought legal prohibitions against slavery and an end to interclan warfare. During the colonial period 90% of the population remained nomadic. Gradually many individuals belonging to sedentary peoples, whose ancestors had been expelled centuries earlier, began to migrate into Mauritania. Until 1902, the capital of French West Africa was in modern-day Senegal. It was first established at [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]] and later, from 1902 to 1960, in Dakar. When Senegal gained its independence that year, France chose Nouakchott as the site of the new capital of Mauritania. At the time, Nouakchott was little more than a fortified village (or ''ksar'').

After Mauritanian independence, larger numbers of indigenous [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n peoples ([[Fula people|Haalpulaar]], [[Soninke people|Soninke]], and [[Wolof people|Wolof]]) migrated into it, most of them settling in the area north of the [[Senegal River]]. Many of these new arrivals had been educated in the French language and customs, and became clerks, soldiers, and administrators in the new state. At the same time, the French were militarily suppressing the most intransigent Hassane tribes in the north. French pressure on those tribes altered the existing balance of power, and new conflicts arose between the southern populations and the Moors.{{Clarify |date=April 2019|reason=Unsure what this sentence is trying to convey, but it doesn't discernibly reflect anything in the cited source.}}{{Incomprehensible inline|date=April 2019|reason=}}

The great [[Droughts in the Sahel|Sahel droughts]] of the early 1970s caused massive devastation in Mauritania, exacerbating problems of poverty and conflict. The arabized dominant elites reacted to changing circumstances, and to [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] calls from abroad, by increasing pressure to [[Arabization|arabize]] many aspects of Mauritanian life, such as law and the education system. This was also a reaction to the consequences of the French domination under the colonial rule. Various models for maintaining the country's cultural diversity have been suggested, but none have been successfully implemented.{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}}

This ethnic discord was evident during intercommunal violence that broke out in April 1989 (the "[[Mauritania–Senegal Border War]]"); the conflict has since subsided. Mauritania expelled some 70,000 sub-Saharan African Mauritanians in the late 1980s. Ethnic tensions and the sensitive issue of slavery –&nbsp;past and, in some areas, present&nbsp;– are still powerful themes in the country's political debate. A significant number from all groups seek a more diverse, pluralistic society.{{Citation needed|date=July 2024}}

===Conflict with Western Sahara===

[[File:Central mosque in Nouakchott.jpg|thumb|[[Nouakchott]] is the [[Capital city|capital]] and [[List of cities in Mauritania|largest city]] of Mauritania. It is one of the largest cities in the [[Sahara]].]]
The [[International Court of Justice]] concluded that in spite of some evidence of both [[Morocco]]'s and Mauritania's legal ties prior to [[Spanish colonization]], neither set of ties was sufficient to affect the application of the UN General Assembly [[Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples]] to [[Western Sahara]].

In 1976, Mauritania, along with Morocco, annexed the territory of Western Sahara. After several military losses to the [[Polisario Front|Polisario]] –&nbsp;heavily armed and supported by Algeria, the [[regional power]] and rival to Morocco&nbsp;– Mauritania withdrew in 1979. Its claims were taken over by Morocco. Due to economic weakness, Mauritania has been a negligible player in the territorial dispute, with its official position being that it wishes for an expedient solution that is mutually agreeable to all parties. While most of Western Sahara has been occupied by Morocco, the [[United Nations|UN]] still considers the Western Sahara a territory that needs to express its wishes with respect to statehood. A referendum, originally scheduled for 1992, is still supposed to be held at some point in the future, under UN auspices, to determine whether or not the indigenous [[Sahrawis]] wish to be independent, as the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]], or to be part of Morocco.{{Citation needed|date=July 2024}}

===Ould Daddah era (1960–1978)===
{{Main|History of Mauritania (1960–78)|Mauritanian People's Party|Moktar Ould Daddah}}
<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->
In 1960, Mauritania became an independent nation. In 1964, President [[Moktar Ould Daddah]], originally installed by the French, formalized Mauritania as a [[one-party state]] with a new [[Constitution of Mauritania|constitution]], setting up an authoritarian presidential regime. Daddah's own [[Mauritanian People's Party|Parti du Peuple Mauritanien]] <!-- (PPM) --> became the ruling organization in a [[One-party state|one-party system]]. The President justified this on the grounds that Mauritania was not ready for western style [[multi-party system|multiparty democracy]]. Under this one-party constitution, Daddah was re-elected in uncontested elections in 1976 and 1978.

Daddah was ousted in a [[1978 Mauritanian coup d'état|bloodless coup]] on 10 July 1978. He had brought the country to near-collapse through the disastrous [[Western Sahara War|war]] to [[annexation|annex]] the [[Tiris al-Gharbiyya|southern part]] of [[Western Sahara]]; this potential annexation was framed as an attempt to create a "[[Greater Mauritania]]".

===CMRN and CMSN military governments (1978–1984)===
[[File:Chinguetti-Guide.JPG|thumb|[[Chinguetti]] was a center of Islamic scholarship in [[West Africa]].]]
[[Mustafa Ould Salek]]'s [[Military Committee for National Recovery]] proved incapable of either establishing a strong base of power or extracting the country from its destabilizing conflict with the [[Sahrawis|Sahrawi]] resistance movement, the [[Polisario Front]]. It quickly fell, to be replaced by another military government, the [[Military Committee for National Salvation]].

Colonel [[Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla]]h soon emerged as its strongman. By giving up all claims to [[Western Sahara]], he found peace with the Polisario and improved relations with its main backer, [[Algeria]], but relations with [[Morocco]], the other party to the conflict, and its [[Europe]]an ally [[France]], deteriorated. Instability continued, and Haidallah's ambitious reform attempts foundered. His regime was plagued by attempted coups and intrigue within the military establishment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2025}} It became increasingly contested due to his harsh and uncompromising measures against opponents; many dissidents were jailed, and some executed.

[[Slavery in Mauritania]] still exists, despite being officially abolished three timesː 1905, 1981, and again in August 2007. Anti-slavery activists are persecuted, imprisoned and tortured.

In 1981, [[Newspapers in the United States|United States newspapers]] mistakenly reported that the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] planned a covert operation to overthrow the government of Mauritania as part of the U.S. [[Cold War]] strategy. Journalist [[Bob Woodward]] later wrote that the mistake was made by "[[White House]] aides unfamiliar with the world" who meant to leak news about an operation planned for [[Mauritius]].

===Ould Taya's rule (1984–2005)===
{{Main|History of Mauritania (1984–present)}}
{{See also|Foreign relations of Mauritania}}
In December 1984, [[Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla|Haidallah]] was deposed by Colonel [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya]], who, while retaining tight military control, relaxed the political climate. Ould Taya moderated Mauritania's previous pro-Algerian stance, and re-established ties with [[Morocco]] during the late 1980s. He deepened these ties during the late 1990s and early 2000s, as part of Mauritania's drive to attract support from Western states and Western-aligned Arab states. Its position on the [[Western Sahara conflict]] has been, since the 1980s, one of strict neutrality.

The [[Mauritania–Senegal Border War]] started as a result of a conflict in [[Diawara, Senegal|Diawara]] between Moorish Mauritanian herders and [[Demographics of Senegal|Senegalese]] farmers over grazing rights. On 9 April 1989, Mauritanian guards killed two Senegalese.

Following the incident, several [[riot]]s erupted in [[Bakel, Senegal|Bakel]], [[Dakar]] and other towns in [[Senegal]], directed against the mainly Arabized Mauritanians who dominated the local retail business. The rioting, adding to the already existing tensions, led to a campaign of terror against black [[Demographics of Mauritania|Mauritanians]]; black Mauritanians are often seen as "Senegalese" by the Bidān (White Moors), regardless of their nationality. As low scale conflict with Senegal continued into 1990–91, the Mauritanian government engaged in and encouraged acts of violence and seizures of property directed against the Halpularen ethnic group. The tension culminated in an international airlift agreed to by Senegal and Mauritania under international pressure to prevent further violence. The Mauritanian Government expelled thousands of black Mauritanians. Most of these so-called "Senegalese" had few or no ties with Senegal, and many have been repatriated from Senegal and [[Mali]] after 2007. The exact number of expulsions is not known; however, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that, as of June 1991, 52,995 Mauritanian refugees were living in Senegal and at least 13,000 in Mali.{{rp|27}}

Opposition parties were legalized, and a new Constitution approved in 1991 which put an end to formal military rule. But President [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya|Ould Taya]]'s election wins were dismissed as fraudulent by some opposition groups.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

In the late 1980s, Ould Taya had established close co-operation with [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], and pursued a strongly [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] line. Mauritania grew increasingly isolated internationally, and tensions with Western countries grew dramatically after it took a pro-Iraqi position during the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2025}}

During the mid-to late 1990s, Mauritania shifted its foreign policy to one of increased co-operation with the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. It was rewarded with diplomatic normalization and aid projects. On 28 October 1999, Mauritania joined [[Egypt]], [[Palestine]], and [[Jordan]] as the only members of the [[Arab League]] to officially [[International recognition of Israel|recognize Israel]]. Ould Taya also started co-operating with the U.S. in anti-terrorism activities, a policy that was criticized by some human rights organizations.

During the regime of President Ould Taya, Mauritania developed economically, [[oil]] was discovered in 2001 by the [[Woodside Energy|Woodside]] Company.

===August 2005 military coup===
{{Main|2005 Mauritanian coup d'état}}
On 3 August 2005, a military coup led by Colonel [[Ely Ould Mohamed Vall]] ended President [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya]]'s 21 years of rule. Taking advantage of Ould Taya's attendance at the funeral of Saudi [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]], the military, including members of the presidential guard (BASEP), seized control of key points in the capital [[Nouakchott]]. The coup proceeded without loss of life. Calling themselves the [[Military Council for Justice and Democracy]], the officers released the following statement:

<blockquote>The national armed forces and security forces have unanimously decided to put a definitive end to the oppressive activities of the defunct authority, which our people have suffered from during the past years.</blockquote>

The Military Council later issued another statement naming Colonel Ould Mohamed Vall as president and director of the national police force, the ''Sûreté Nationale''. Vall, once regarded as a firm ally of the now-ousted president, had aided Ould Taya in the coup that had originally brought him to power, and had later served as his Security Chief. Sixteen other officers were listed as members of the council.

Though cautiously watched by the international community, the coup came to be generally accepted, with the military ''junta'' organizing elections within a promised two-year timeline. In a referendum on 26 June 2006, 97% of Mauritanians approved a new constitution that limited the duration of a president's stay in office. The leader of the ''junta'', Col. Vall, promised to abide by the referendum and relinquish power peacefully. Mauritania's establishment of relations with Israel{{spaced ndash}}it was one of only three Arab states to recognize Israel{{spaced ndash}}was maintained by the new regime, despite widespread criticism from the opposition. Parliamentary and municipal elections in Mauritania took place on 19 November and 3 December 2006.

===2007 presidential elections===
[[File:Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi]]]]
Mauritania's first fully democratic presidential elections took place on 11 March 2007. The elections effected the final transfer from military to civilian rule following the military coup in 2005. This was the first time since Mauritania gained independence in 1960 that it elected a president in a multi-candidate election.

The elections were won in a second round of voting by [[Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi]].

===2008 military coup===
{{Main|2008 Mauritanian coup d'état}}
On 6 August 2008, the head of the presidential guards took over the president's palace in Nouakchott, a day after 48 lawmakers from the ruling party resigned in protest of President Abdallahi's policies. The Army surrounded key government facilities, including the state television building, after the president fired senior officers, one of them the head of the presidential guards. The President, Prime Minister [[Yahya Ould Ahmed El Waghef|Yahya Ould Ahmed Waghef]], and Mohamed Ould R'zeizim, Minister of Internal Affairs, were arrested.

The coup was coordinated by General [[Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz]], former chief of staff of the Mauritanian Army and head of the presidential guard, who had recently been fired. Mauritania's presidential spokesman, Abdoulaye Mamadouba, said the President, Prime Minister, and Interior Minister had been arrested by renegade senior Mauritanian army officers and were being held under house arrest at the presidential palace in the capital.

In the apparently successful and bloodless coup, Abdallahi's daughter, Amal Mint Cheikh Abdallahi, said: "The security agents of the BASEP (Presidential Security Battalion) came to our home and took away my father." The coup plotters, all dismissed in a presidential decree shortly beforehand, included Ould Abdel Aziz, General [[Mohamed Ould Ghazouani|Muhammad Ould Al-Ghazwani]], General Philippe Swikri, and Brigadier General (Aqid) Ahmed Ould Bakri.

===2008–2018===
[[File:Mauritania-aziz-in-his-home-city-Akjoujt-15mar09 1.jpg|thumb|Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz in his hometown, [[Akjoujt]], on 15 March 2009.]]
[[File:Nouakchott-Dispersion des manifestants-2011.jpg|thumb|[[2011–2012 Mauritanian protests|2011–12 Mauritanian protests]].]]
A Mauritanian lawmaker, Mohammed Al Mukhtar, claimed that many of the country's people supported the takeover of a government that had become "an authoritarian regime" under a president who had "marginalized the majority in parliament". However, Abdel Aziz's regime was isolated internationally, and became subject to diplomatic sanctions and the cancellation of some aid projects. Domestically, a group of parties coalesced around Abdallahi to continue protesting the coup, which caused the junta to ban demonstrations and crack down on opposition activists. International and internal pressure eventually forced the release of Abdallahi, who was instead placed under house arrest in his home village. The new government broke off relations with Israel.

After the coup, Abdel Aziz insisted on holding new presidential elections to replace Abdallahi; however, Aziz was forced to reschedule them due to internal and international opposition. During the spring of 2009, the [[Military junta|junta]] negotiated an understanding with some opposition figures and international parties. As a result, Abdallahi formally resigned under protest, as it became clear that some opposition forces had defected from him and most international players, notably including France and Algeria, now aligned with Abdel Aziz. The United States continued to criticize the coup, but did not actively oppose the elections.

Abdallahi's resignation allowed the [[2009 Mauritanian presidential election|election]] of Abdel Aziz as civilian president, on 18 July, by a 52% majority.

Many of Abdallahi's former supporters criticized this as a political ploy and refused to recognize the results. Despite complaints, the elections were almost unanimously accepted by Western, Arab and African countries, which lifted sanctions and resumed relations with Mauritania. By late summer, Abdel Aziz appeared to have secured his position and to have gained widespread international and internal support. Some figures, such as Senate chairman [[Messaoud Ould Boulkheir]], continued to refuse the new order and call for Abdel Aziz's resignation.

In February 2011, the waves of the [[Arab Spring]] spread to Mauritania, where thousands of people took to the streets of the capital.

In November 2014, Mauritania was invited as a non-member guest nation to the G20 summit in [[Brisbane]].

The [[Flag of Mauritania|national flag of Mauritania]] was changed on 5 August 2017. Two red stripes were added as a symbol of the country's sacrifice and defense. In late 2018, Mauritania bribed members of the EU parliament ([[Antonio Panzeri]]) to "not speak ill of Mauritania" in what became known as the [[Qatar corruption scandal at the European Parliament]].

===2019–present===

In August 2019, [[Mohamed Ould Ghazouani]] was sworn in as president after the [[2019 Mauritanian presidential election|2019 elections]], which were considered Mauritania's first [[peaceful transition of power]] since independence.

In June 2021, former president Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz was arrested amidst a corruption probe into allegations of embezzlement. In December 2023, Aziz was sentenced to 5 years in prison for corruption.

In early 2024, a sudden increase of the number of refugees arriving on the [[Canary Islands]] by boat prompted a visit from [[European Commission]] president [[Ursula von der Leyen]] and Spanish prime minister [[Pedro Sánchez]]. The EU subsequently signed a €210M deal with Mauritania to reduce passage of African migrants through its territory towards the Canary Islands. The UN estimates that 150,000 people from Mali have fled to Mauritania.

In June 2024, President Ghazouani was [[2024 Mauritanian presidential election|re-elected]] for a second term.
