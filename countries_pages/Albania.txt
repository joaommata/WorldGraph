Mesolithic habitation in Albania has been evidenced in several open air sites which were close to the Adriatic coastline and in caves. Mesolithic objects found in a cave near Xarrë include [[flint]] and [[jasper]] objects along with fossilised animal bones, while those discoveries at Mount Dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the [[Aurignacian culture]]. The [[Neolithic]] era in Albania began around 7000 BC and is evidenced in finds which indicate domestication of sheep and goats and small-scale agriculture. A part of the Neolithic population may have been the same as the Mesolithic population of the southern Balkans like in the [[Konispol]] cave where the Mesolithic stratum co-exists with Pre-Pottery Neolithic finds. [[Cardium pottery]] culture appears in coastal Albania and across the Adriatic after 6500 BC, while the settlements of the interior took part in the processes which formed the [[Starčevo culture]]. The Albanian [[bitumen]] mines of [[Selenicë]] provide early evidence of bitumen exploitation in Europe, dating to Late Neolithic Albania (from 5000 BC), when local communities used it as pigment for ceramic decoration, [[waterproofing]], and [[adhesive]] for reparing broken vessels. The bitumen of Selenicë circulated towards eastern Albania from the early 5th millennium BC. First evidence of its overseas trade export comes from Neolithic and Bronze Age southern [[Italy]]. The high-quality bitumen of Selenicë has been exploited throughout all the historical ages since the Late Neolithic era until today.

The [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-Europeanisation]] of Albania in the context of the IE-isation of the western Balkans began after 2800 BC. The presence of the Early Bronze Age [[Tumulus|tumuli]] in the vicinity of later [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]] dates to 2679±174 calBC (2852-2505 calBC). These burial mounds belong to the southern expression of the Adriatic-Ljubljana culture (related to later [[Cetina culture]]) which moved southwards along the Adriatic from the northern Balkans. The same community built similar mounds in Montenegro (Rakića Kuće) and northern Albania (Shtoj). The first [[Archaeogenetics|archaeogenetic]] find related to the IE-isation of Albania involves a man with predominantly [[Western Steppe Herders|Yamnaya ancestry]] buried in a tumulus of northeastern Albania which dates to 2663–2472 calBC. During the Middle Bronze Age, Cetina culture sites and finds appear in Albania. Cetina culture moved southwards across the Adriatic from the [[Cetina|Cetina valley]] of [[Dalmatia]]. In Albania, Cetina finds are concentrated around southern [[Lake Shkodër]] and appear typically in tumulus cemeteries like in Shkrel and Shtoj and hillforts like Gajtan (Shkodër) as well as cave sites like Blaz, Nezir and Keputa (central Albania) and lake basin sites like Sovjan (southeastern Albania).

=== Antiquity ===
{{Main|History of Albania#Antiquity|l1=Antiquity in Albania}}

[[File:The City and the Prokletije from the castle.jpg|thumb|right|Founded in the 4th century BC, the city of [[Scodra]] was the capital of the [[Illyrian kingdom]] of [[Ardiaei]] and [[Labeatae]].]]

The incorporated territory of Albania was historically inhabited by [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European people]]s, amongst them numerous [[Illyrian tribes|Illyrian]] and [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirote]] tribes. There were also several [[Greek colonization|Greek colonies]]. The territory referred to as [[Illyria]] corresponded roughly to the area east of the [[Adriatic Sea]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] extending in the south to the mouth of the [[Vjosë]]. The first account of the Illyrian groups comes from [[Periplus of the Euxine Sea]], a Greek text written in the 4th century BC. The [[Bryges]] were also present in central Albania, while the south was inhabited by the Epirote [[Chaonians]], whose capital was at [[Phoenice]]. Other colonies such as [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]] and [[Epidamnos]] were established by Greek city-states on the coast by the 7th century BC.

[[File:Parku Arkeologjik i Apollonisë 04.jpg|thumb|left|[[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]] was an important [[Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies|Greek colony]] on the [[Illyria]]n coast along the [[Adriatic Sea]] and one of the western points of the [[Via Egnatia]] route, that connected Rome and [[Constantinople]].]]

The Illyrian [[Taulantii|Taulanti]] were a powerful Illyrian tribe among the earliest recorded tribes in the area. They lived in an area that corresponds with much of present-day Albania. Together with the Dardanian ruler [[Cleitus (son of Bardylis)|Cleitus]], [[Glaucias of Taulantii|Glaucias]], the ruler of the Taulantian kingdom, fought against [[Alexander the Great]] at the [[Siege of Pelium|Battle of Pelium]] in 335 BC. As the time passed, the ruler of Ancient Macedonia, [[Cassander|Cassander of Macedon]] captured Apollonia and crossed the river [[Shkumbin|Genusus]] ({{Langx|sq|Shkumbin}}) in 314 BC. A few years later Glaucias laid siege to Apollonia and captured the Greek colony of [[Epidamnos]].

The Illyrian [[Ardiaei]] tribe, centred in Montenegro, ruled over most of the territory of northern Albania. Their [[Ardiaean Kingdom]] reached its greatest extent under [[Agron of Illyria|King Agron]], the son of [[Pleuratus II]]. Agron extended his rule over other neighbouring tribes as well. Following Agron's death in 230 BC, his wife, [[Teuta]], inherited the&nbsp;Ardiaean kingdom. Teuta's forces extended their operations further southwards to the&nbsp;Ionian Sea. In 229 BC, Rome declared war on the kingdom for extensively plundering Roman ships. The war ended in Illyrian defeat in 227&nbsp;BC. Teuta was eventually succeeded by&nbsp;[[Gentius]]&nbsp;in 181&nbsp;BC. Gentius clashed with the Romans in 168&nbsp;BC, initiating the [[Third Illyrian War]]. The conflict resulted in Roman conquest of the region by 167&nbsp;BC. The Romans split the region into three administrative divisions.

=== Middle Ages ===
{{Main|Albania in the Middle Ages}}

[[File:Krujë-KrujaAlbania 2016.jpg|thumb|right|The town of [[Krujë]] was the capital of the [[Principality of Arbanon]] in the Middle Ages.]]

The [[Roman Empire]] was split in 395 upon the death of [[Theodosius I]] into an [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] and [[Western Roman Empire]] in part because of the increasing pressure from threats during the [[Barbarian Invasions]]. From the 6th century into the 7th century, the [[South Slavs|Slavs]] crossed the [[Danube]] and largely absorbed the indigenous Greeks, Illyrians and Thracians in the [[Balkans]]; thus, the Illyrians were mentioned for the last time in historical records in the 7th century.

In the 11th century, the [[Great Schism of 1054|Great Schism]] formalised the break of communion between the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Western Catholic Church]] that is reflected in Albania through the emergence of a Catholic north and Orthodox south. The Albanian people inhabited the west of [[Lake Ochrida]] and the upper valley of [[Shkumbin|River Shkumbin]] and established the [[Principality of Arbanon]] in 1190 under the leadership of [[Progon of Kruja]]. The realm was succeeded by his sons [[Gjin Progoni|Gjin]] and [[Dhimitër Progoni|Dhimitër]].

Upon the death of Dhimiter, the territory came under the rule of the Albanian-Greek [[Gregory Kamonas]] and subsequently under the [[Golem of Kruja]]. In the 13th century, the principality was dissolved. Arbanon is considered to be the first sketch of an Albanian state, that retained a [[semi-autonomous]] status as the western extremity of the [[Byzantine Empire]], under the Byzantine [[Doukas|Doukai]] of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] or [[Laskaris|Laskarids]] of [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]].

It illustrates [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Mehmet II]] laying siege to the Albanian town of Scutari, then part of [[Venetian Empire]].]]

Towards the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th centuries, [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serb]]s and [[Venetian Empire|Venetians]] started to take possession over the territory. The [[ethnogenesis]] of the Albanians is uncertain; however, the first undisputed mention of Albanians dates back in historical records from 1079 or 1080 in a work by [[Michael Attaliates]], who referred to the [[Albanoi]] as having taken part in a revolt against [[Constantinople]]. At this point the Albanians were fully Christianised.

After the dissolution of Arbanon, [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]] concluded an agreement with the Albanian rulers, promising to protect them and their ancient liberties. In 1272, he established the [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|Kingdom of Albania]] and conquered regions back from the [[Despotate of Epirus]]. The kingdom claimed all of central Albania territory from [[Dyrrhachium]] along the Adriatic Sea coast down to [[Butrint]]. A Catholic political structure was a basis for the papal plans of spreading [[Catholicism]] in the Balkan Peninsula. This plan found also the support of [[Helen of Anjou, Queen of Serbia|Helen of Anjou]]. Around 30 Catholic churches and monasteries were built during her rule mainly in northern Albania. Internal power struggles within the Byzantine Empire in the 14th century enabled Serbs' most powerful medieval ruler, [[Stefan Dusan]], to establish a [[Serbian Empire|short-lived empire]] that included all of Albania except Durrës.
[[File:Albanian Principalities, ca. 1390 (modern Albania).png|thumb|Albanian principalities, {{Circa|1390}}, excluding the [[Despotate of Arta]]]]
In 1367, Albanian rulers established the [[Despotate of Arta]]. During that time, several [[Albanian principalities]] were created, notably the [[Principality of Albania (medieval)|Principality of Albania]], [[Principality of Kastrioti]], [[Lordship of Berat]] and [[Principality of Dukagjini]]. In the first half of the 15th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] invaded most of Albania, and the [[League of Lezhë]] was held under [[Skanderbeg]] as a ruler, who became the national hero of the Albanian medieval history.

With the [[fall of Constantinople]], the Ottoman Empire continued an extended period of conquest and expansion with its borders going deep into [[Ottoman conquest of the Balkans|Southeast Europe]]. They reached the [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast]] in 1385 and erected their garrisons across [[Southern Albania]] in 1415 and then occupied most of Albania in 1431. Thousands of Albanians consequently fled to Western Europe, particularly to [[Calabria]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], whereby others sought protection at the often inaccessible [[Geography of Albania|Mountains of Albania]]. The Albanians, as Christians, were considered an [[Rayah|inferior class]] of people, and as such they were subjected to heavy [[Jizya|tax]]es among others by the [[Devshirme]] system that allowed the [[Sultan]] to collect a requisite percentage of Christian adolescents from their families to compose the [[Janissary]]. The Ottoman conquest was also accompanied with the gradual process of [[Islamisation]] and the rapid construction of mosques.

A prosperous and longstanding revolution erupted after the formation of the [[League of Lezhë]] until the [[Siege of Shkodra|fall of Shkodër]] under the leadership of [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg]], who consistently defeated major Ottoman armies led by [[Sultan]]s [[Murad II]] and [[Mehmed II]]. Skanderbeg managed to unite several of the Albanian principalities, amongst them the [[Arianiti family|Arianiti]]s, [[Dukagjini family|Dukagjini]]s, [[Zaharia family|Zaharia]]s and [[Thopia family|Thopia]]s, and establish a centralised authority over most of the non-conquered territories, becoming the [[Skanderbeg|Lord of Albania]]. The Ottoman Empire's expansion ground to a halt during the time that Skanderbeg's forces resisted, and he has been credited with being one of the main reasons for the delay of Ottoman expansion into [[Western Europe]], giving the Italian principalities more time to better prepare for the [[Siege of Otranto|Ottoman arrival]].{{sfn|Hodgkinson|2005|p=240}} However, the failure of most European nations, with the exception of Naples, in giving him support, along with the failure of Pope Pius II's plans to organise a promised crusade against the Ottomans meant that none of Skanderbeg's victories permanently hindered the Ottomans from invading the Western Balkans.{{sfn|Hodgkinson|2005|p=xii}}

Despite his brilliance as a military leader, Skanderbeg's victories were only delaying the final conquests. The constant Ottoman invasions caused enormous destruction to Albania, greatly reducing the population and destroying flocks of livestock and crops. Besides surrender, there was no possible way Skanderbeg would be able to halt the Ottoman invasions despite his successes against them. His manpower and resources were insufficient, preventing him from expanding the war efforts and driving the Turks from the Albanian borders. Albania was therefore doomed to face an unending series of Ottoman attacks until it eventually fell years after his death.

When the Ottomans were gaining a firm foothold in the region, Albanian towns were organised into four principal [[sanjaks]]. The government fostered trade by settling a sizeable Jewish colony of refugees fleeing persecution in Spain. The city of [[Vlorë]] saw passing through its ports imported merchandise from Europe such as velvets, cotton goods, mohairs, carpets, spices and leather from [[Bursa]] and [[Constantinople]]. Some citizens of Vlorë even had business associates throughout Europe.

The phenomenon of Islamisation among the Albanians became primarily widespread from the 17th century and continued into the 18th century. Islam offered them equal opportunities and advancement within the Ottoman Empire. However, motives for conversion were, according to some scholars, diverse depending on the context though the lack of source material does not help when investigating such issues. Because of increasing suppression of Catholicism, most Catholic Albanians converted in the 17th century, while Orthodox Albanians followed suit mainly in the following century.

Since the Albanians were seen as strategically important, they made up a significant proportion of the [[Ottoman military]] and bureaucracy. Many Muslim Albanians attained important political and military positions and culturally contributed to the broader [[Muslim world]]. Enjoying this privileged position, they held various high administrative positions with over two dozen Albanian [[Grand Viziers]]. Others included members of the prominent [[Köprülü family]], [[Zagan Pasha]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] and [[Ali Pasha of Tepelena]]. Furthermore, two sultans, [[Bayezid II]] and [[Mehmed III]], both had mothers of Albanian origin.

The [[Albanian Renaissance]] was a period with its roots in the late 18th century and continuing into the 19th century, during which the Albanian people gathered spiritual and intellectual strength for an independent cultural and political life within an [[Independent Albania|independent nation]]. Modern [[Albanian culture]] flourished too, especially [[Albanian literature]] and [[Albanian art|arts]], and was frequently linked to the influences of the [[Romanticism]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles. Prior to the [[Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire|rise of nationalism]], Ottoman authorities suppressed any expression of national unity or conscience by the Albanian people.

The victory of Russia over the Ottoman Empire following the [[Russian-Ottoman War]]s resulted the execution of the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] which assigned Albanian-populated lands to their Slavic and Greek neighbours. However, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] consequently blocked the arrangement and caused the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. From this point, Albanians started to organise themselves with the goal to protect and unite the Albanian-populated lands into a unitary nation, leading to the formation of the [[League of Prizren]]. The league had initially the assistance of the Ottoman authorities whose position was based on the religious solidarity of Muslim people and landlords connected with the [[Ottoman Porte|Ottoman administration]]. They favoured and protected the Muslim solidarity and called for defence of Muslim lands simultaneously constituting the reason for titling the league [[League of Prizren#Formation|Committee of the Real Muslims]].

Approximately 300 Muslims participated in the assembly composed by delegates from Bosnia, the [[sanjakbey|administrator]] of the [[Sanjak of Prizren]] as representatives of the central authorities and no delegates from [[Vilayet of Scutari]]. Signed by only 47 Muslim deputies, the league issued the [[Kararname (League of Prizren)|Kararname]] that contained a proclamation that the people from northern Albania, [[Epirus]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] are willing to defend the [[territorial integrity]] of the Ottoman Empire by all possible means against the troops of [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].

Ottomans authorities cancelled their assistance when the league, under [[Abdyl Frashëri]], became focused on working towards Albanian autonomy and requested merging four [[Ottoman vilayet|vilayet]]s, including [[Kosovo Vilayet|Kosovo]], [[Scutari Vilayet|Shkodër]], [[Monastir Vilayet|Monastir]] and [[Janina Vilayet|Ioannina]], into a unified vilayet, the [[Albanian Vilayet]]. The league used military force to prevent the annexing areas of [[Plav Municipality|Plav]] and [[Gusinje]] assigned to Montenegro. After several successful battles with Montenegrin troops, such as the [[Battle of Novšiće]], the league was forced to retreat from their contested regions. The league was later defeated by the Ottoman army sent by the sultan.

[[File:Ismail Qemali (portrait).jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Ismail Qemali]] is regarded as the [[List of national founders#Albania|founding father]] of the modern Albanian nation.]]

Albania [[Albanian Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] from the Ottoman Empire on 28 November 1912, accompanied by the establishment of the [[Senate of Albania|Senate]] and [[Provisional Government of Albania|Government]] by the [[Assembly of Vlorë]] on 4 December 1912. Its sovereignty was recognised by the [[London Conference of 1912–1913|Conference of London]]. On 29 July 1913, the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] delineated the borders of the country and its neighbors, leaving many Albanians outside Albania, predominantly [[Partition (politics)|partitioned]] between [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]].

Headquartered in Vlorë, the [[International Commission of Control]] was established on 15 October 1913 to take care of the administration of Albania until its own political institutions were in order. The [[International Gendarmerie]] was established as the [[Principality of Albania]]'s first law enforcement agency. In November, the first gendarmerie members arrived in the country. Prince of Albania [[Wilhelm of Wied]] ''(Princ Vilhelm Vidi)'' was selected as the first prince of the principality. On 7 March, he arrived in the provisional capital of [[Durrës]] and began to organise his government, appointing [[Turhan Pasha Përmeti]] to form the first Albanian cabinet.

In November 1913, the Albanian pro-Ottoman forces had offered the throne of Albania to the Ottoman war minister of Albanian origin, [[Ahmed Izzet Pasha]]. The pro-Ottoman peasants believed that the new regime was a tool of the six Christian [[Great Power]]s and local landowners, who owned half of the arable land.

In February 1914, the [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]] was proclaimed in [[Gjirokastër]] by the local [[Greeks in Albania|Greek population]] against incorporation to Albania. This initiative was short-lived, and in 1921 the southern provinces were incorporated into the Albanian Principality. Meanwhile, the [[Peasant Revolt in Albania|revolt of Albanian peasants]] against the new regime erupted under the leadership of the group of Muslim clerics gathered around [[Essad Pasha Toptani]], who proclaimed himself the savior of Albania and Islam. To gain the support of the [[Mirdita]] Catholic volunteers from northern Albania, Prince [[Wilhelm of Wied|Wied]] appointed their leader, [[Prênk Bibë Doda]], foreign minister of the Principality of Albania. In May and June 1914, the International Gendarmerie was joined by [[Isa Boletini]] and his men, mostly from [[Kosovo]], and the rebels defeated northern [[Mirdita]] Catholics, capturing most of Central Albania by the end of August 1914. Prince Wied's regime collapsed, and he left the country on 3 September 1914.

=== First Republic ===
{{Main|Albanian Republic (1925–1928)|l1=First Republic of Albania}}
{{See also|World War I in Albania|World War II in Albania|l1=World War I}}

[[File:Fan Stilian Noli.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Fan Noli]] played a significant role in the 20th century, advocating for Albanian independence and cultural revival, while also serving as [[Prime Minister of Albania|Prime Minister]] in 1924 and later as the head of the [[Albanian Orthodox Church]].]]

The [[interwar period]] in Albania was marked by persistent economic and social difficulties, political instability and foreign interventions. After [[World War I]], Albania lacked an established government and internationally recognised borders, rendering it vulnerable to neighboring entities such as Greece, Italy, and Yugoslavia, all of which sought to expand their influence. This led to political uncertainty, highlighted in 1918 when the [[Congress of Durrës]] sought [[Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)|Paris Peace Conference]] protection but was denied, further complicating Albania's position on the international stage. Territorial tensions escalated as Yugoslavia, particularly Serbia, sought control of northern Albania, while Greece aimed dominance in southern Albania. The situation deteriorated in 1919 when the Serbs launched attacks on Albanian inhabitants, among others in [[Gusinje]] and [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]], resulting in [[Plav–Gusinje massacres (1912–1913)|massacres and large-scale displacement]]. Meanwhile, Italian influence continued to expand during this time, driven by economic interests and political ambitions.

[[Fan Noli]], renowned for his [[idealism]], became prime minister in 1924, with a vision to institute a Western-style constitutional government, abolish feudalism, counter Italian influence, and enhance critical sectors, including infrastructure, education and healthcare. He faced resistance from former allies, who had assisted in the removal of [[Zog I of Albania|Zog]] from power, and struggled to secure foreign aid to implement his agenda. Noli's decision to establish diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, an adversary of the Serbian elite, ignited allegations of [[bolshevism]] from Belgrade. This in turn led to increased pressure from Italy and culminated in Zog's restoration to authority. In 1928, Zog transitioned Albania from a republic to a monarchy that garnered backing from [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]], with Zog assuming the title of King Zog I. Key constitutional changes dissolved the Senate and established a unicameral National Assembly while preserving Zog's authoritative powers.

In 1939, Italy under [[Benito Mussolini]] launched a military invasion of Albania, resulting in the exile of Zog and the creation of an [[Italian protectorate of Albania (1939–1943)|Italian protectorate]]. As [[World War II]] progressed, Italy aimed to expand its territorial dominion in the Balkans, including territorial claims on regions of Greece ([[Chameria]]), Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo. These ambitions laid the foundation of [[Italian protectorate of Albania (1939–1943)|Greater Albania]], which aimed to unite all areas with Albanian-majority populations into a single country. In 1943, as Italy's control declined, [[Nazi Germany]] assumed control of Albania, subjecting Albanians to forced labour, economic exploitation and repression under [[German occupation of Albania|German rule]]. The tide shifted in 1944 when Albanian partisan forces, under the leadership of [[Enver Hoxha]] and other communist leaders, successfully liberated Albania from German occupation.

[[File:Enver Hoxha (portret).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Enver Hoxha]] was the founding leader of communist Albania and its ruler for over four decades, implementing a regime marked by [[authoritarianism]] and [[isolationism]].]]

The establishment of the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|People's Republic of Albania]] under the leadership of [[Enver Hoxha]] was a significant epoch in modern Albanian history. Hoxha's regime embraced [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist ideologies]] and implemented [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] policies, including prohibition of religious practices, severe restrictions on travel, and abolition of private property rights. It was also defined by a persistent pattern of purges, extensive repression, instances of betrayal, and hostility to external influences. Any form of opposition or resistance to his rule was met with expeditious and severe consequences, such as internal exile, extended imprisonment, and execution. The regime confronted a multitude of challenges, including widespread poverty, illiteracy, health crises and gender inequality. In response, Hoxha initiated a modernisation initiative aimed at attaining economic and social liberation and transforming Albania into an industrial society. The regime placed a high priority on the diversification of the economy through Soviet-style industrialisation, comprehensive infrastructure development such as the introduction of a transformative [[Hekurudha Shqiptare|railway system]], expansion of education and healthcare services, elimination of adult illiteracy, and targeted advancements in areas such as women's rights.

[[File:Bunker in Albanian Alps.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bunkers in Albania]] were constructed to prevent potential external invasions. By 1983, approximately 173,371 bunkers were scattered throughout its territory.]]

Albania's diplomatic history under Hoxha was characterised by notable conflicts. Initially aligned with Yugoslavia as a satellite state, the relationship deteriorated as Yugoslavia aimed to incorporate Albania within its territory. Subsequently, Albania established relations with the Soviet Union and engaged trade agreements with other Eastern European countries, but experienced disagreements over Soviet policies, leading to strained ties with Moscow and diplomatic separation in 1961. Simultaneously, tensions with the West heightened due to Albania's refusal to hold free elections and allegations of Western support for [[Anti-communism|anti-communist uprisings]]. Albania's enduring partnership was with China; it sided with Beijing during the [[Sino-Soviet split|Sino-Soviet conflict]], resulting in severed ties with the Soviet Union and withdrawal from the [[Warsaw Pact]] in response to the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. But their relations stagnated in 1970, prompting both to reassess their commitment, and Albania actively reduced its dependence on China.

Under Hoxha's regime, Albania underwent a widespread campaign targeting religious clergy of various faiths, resulting in public persecution and executions, particularly targeting Muslims, Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox adherents. In 1946, religious estates underwent nationalisation, coinciding with the closure or transformation of religious institutions into various other purposes. This culminated in 1976, when Albania became the world's first constitutionally atheist state. Under this regime, citizens were forced to renounce their religious beliefs, adopt a secular way of life, and embrace socialist ideology.

[[File:Tirana Square 1988.jpg|thumb|right|In 1988, the first foreigners were allowed to walk into the car-free [[Skanderbeg Square]] in [[Tirana]].]]

After four decades of communism paired with the [[revolutions of 1989]], Albania witnessed a notable rise in political activism, particularly among students, which led to a transformation in the prevailing order. After the first [[multi-party elections]] of [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1991|1991]], the communist party maintained a stronghold in the parliament until its defeat in the [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1992|parliamentary elections of 1992]] directed by the [[Democratic Party of Albania|Democratic Party]]. Considerable economic and financial resources were devoted to [[Pyramid schemes in Albania|pyramid schemes]] that were widely supported by the government. The schemes swept up somewhere between one sixth and one third of the population of the country. Despite the [[International Monetary Fund]]'s warnings, [[Sali Berisha]] defended the schemes as large investment firms, leading more people to redirect their remittances and sell their homes and cattle for cash to deposit in the schemes.

The schemes began to collapse in late 1996, leading many of the investors to join initially peaceful protests against the government, requesting their money back. The protests turned violent in February 1997 as government forces responded by firing on the demonstrators. In March, the Police and Republican Guard deserted, leaving their armories open. These were promptly emptied by militias and criminal gangs. The resulting [[1997 Albanian civil unrest|civil war]] caused a wave of evacuations of foreign nationals and refugees.

The crisis led both [[Aleksandër Meksi]] and [[Sali Berisha]] to resign from office in the wake of the general election. In April 1997, [[Operation Alba]], a U.N. peacekeeping force led by Italy, entered Albania with two goals: to assist with the evacuation of expatriates and secure the ground for international organisations. The main international organisation involved was the [[Western European Union]]'s [[Albanian civil war of 1997#International intervention|multinational]] [[Albanian Police]] element, which worked with the government to restructure the [[Judicial system of Albania|judicial system]] and simultaneously the Albanian police.

After its [[Communist Albania|communist system]] disintegrated, Albania embarked on an active path towards [[Westernization|Westernisation]] with the ambition to obtain membership in the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO). A notable milestone was reached in 2009, when the country attained [[Albania–NATO relations|membership]] in NATO, marking a pioneering achievement among the nations of [[Southeast Europe]]. In adherence to its vision for further integration into the EU, it [[Accession of Albania to the European Union|formally applied]] for membership on 28 April 2009. Another milestone was reached on 24 June 2014, when the country was granted [[Future enlargement of the European Union|official candidate status]].

[[Edi Rama]] of the [[Socialist Party of Albania|Socialist Party]] won both the [[Albanian parliamentary election, 2013|2013]] and [[Albanian parliamentary election, 2017|2017 parliamentary elections]]. As [[Prime Minister of Albania|prime minister]], he implemented numerous reforms focused on [[Modernism|modernising]] the [[Economy of Albania|economy]], as well as democratising state institutions, including the [[Judiciary of Albania|judiciary]] and [[Law enforcement in Albania|law enforcement]]. Unemployment has steadily declined, with Albania achieving the 4th-lowest [[List of countries by unemployment rate|unemployment rate]] in the Balkans. Rama has also placed [[gender equality]] at the centre of his agenda; since 2017 almost 50% of the ministers have been female, the largest number of women serving in the country's history. During the [[2021 Albanian parliamentary election|2021 parliamentary elections]], the ruling Socialist Party led by Rama secured its third consecutive victory, winning nearly half of votes and enough seats in parliament to govern alone.

On 26 November 2019, a 6.4 [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] [[earthquake]] ravaged Albania, with the [[epicentre]] about {{convert|16|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} southwest of the town of [[Mamurras]]. The tremor was felt in [[Tirana]] and in places as far away as [[Taranto]], Italy, and [[Belgrade]], Serbia, while the most affected areas were the coastal city of [[Durrës]] and the village of [[Kodër-Thumanë]]. Comprehensive response to the earthquake included substantial humanitarian aid from the [[Albanian diaspora]] and various countries [[2019 Albania earthquake#International assistance|around the world]].
