The earliest [[human]] artifacts in Mexico are chips of [[stone tool]]s found near campfire remains in the Valley of Mexico and radiocarbon-dated to circa 10,000 years ago.{{sfn|Werner|2001|pp=386–}} Mexico is the site of the domestication of maize, tomato, and [[phaseolus|beans]], which produced an agricultural surplus. This enabled the transition from [[Paleo-Indians|paleo-Indian]] hunter-gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around 5000 BC. The formative period of Mesoamerica is considered one of the six independent [[cradles of civilization]], this era saw the origin of distinct cultural traits such as religious and symbolic traditions, maize cultivation, artistic and architectural complexes as well as a [[vigesimal]] (base 20) numeric system that spread from the Mexican cultures to the rest of the [[Mesoamerica]]n cultural area. In this period, villages became more dense in terms of population, becoming socially stratified with an artisan class, and developing into [[chiefdom]]s. The most powerful rulers had religious and political power, organizing the construction of large ceremonial centers.

The earliest complex civilization in Mexico was the [[Olmec]] culture, which flourished on the Gulf Coast from around 1500 BC. Olmec cultural traits diffused through Mexico into other formative-era cultures in Chiapas, Oaxaca, and the Valley of Mexico. In the subsequent [[Mesoamerican chronology|pre-classical period]], the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] civilizations developed complex centers at [[Calakmul]] and [[Monte Albán]], respectively. During this period the first true [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] were developed in the [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]] and Zapotec cultures. The Mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the Classic [[Maya Script|Maya Hieroglyphic script]], the earliest written histories date from this era. The tradition of writing was important after the Spanish conquest in 1521, with indigenous scribes learning to write their languages in alphabetic letters, while also continuing to create pictorial texts.

In Central Mexico, the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy of [[Teotihuacan|Teotihuacán]], which formed a military and commercial empire. Teotihuacan, with a population of more than 150,000 people, had some of the largest [[Mesoamerican pyramid|pyramidal structures]] in the pre-Columbian Americas. After the collapse of Teotihuacán around 600 AD, competition ensued between several important political centers in central Mexico such as [[Xochicalco]] and [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]]. At this time, during the Epi-Classic, [[Nahua people]]s began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North, and became politically and culturally dominant in central Mexico, as they displaced speakers of [[Oto-Manguean languages]]. During the early post-classic era (ca. 1000–1519 AD), Central Mexico was dominated by the [[Toltec]] culture, [[Oaxaca]] by the [[Mixtec civilization|Mixtec]], and the lowland Maya area had important centers at [[Chichén Itzá]] and [[Mayapán]]. Toward the end of the post-Classic period, the [[Aztecs]] (or [[Mexica]]) established dominance, establishing a [[Aztec Empire|political and economic empire]] based in the city of [[Tenochtitlan]] (modern [[Mexico City]]), extending from central Mexico to the border with Guatemala.

===Spanish conquest and colonial era (1519–1821)===
{{Main|Spanish conquest of Mexico|New Spain}}Although the [[Spanish Empire]] had established colonies in the [[Caribbean]] starting in 1493 the Spanish first learned of Mexico during the [[Juan de Grijalva]] expedition of 1518. The [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] began in February 1519 when [[Hernán Cortés]] founded the Spanish city of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]]. The 1521 [[capture of Tenochtitlan]] and posterior founding of the Spanish capital [[Mexico City]] on its ruins was the beginning of a 300-year-long colonial era during which Mexico was known as {{lang|es|Nueva España}} ([[New Spain]]). Two factors made Mexico a jewel in the Spanish Empire: the existence of large, hierarchically organized Mesoamerican populations that rendered tribute and performed obligatory labor and the discovery of vast silver deposits in northern Mexico. 
[[File:Guanaguato_at_night.jpg|thumb|[[Guanajuato (city)|Guanajuato]] was one of the richest and most opulent cities in [[New Spain]]]]

The [[Kingdom of New Spain]] was created from the remnants of the Aztec empire. The two pillars of Spanish rule were the State and the Roman Catholic Church, both under the authority of the Spanish crown. In 1493 the pope granted [[Patronato real|sweeping powers]] to the Spanish monarchy for its overseas empire, with the proviso that the crown spread Christianity in its new realms. In 1524, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I]] created the [[Council of the Indies]] based in Spain to oversee State power in its overseas territories. In New Spain the crown established a high court in Mexico City, the {{lang|es|[[Real Audiencia]]}} ('royal audience' or 'royal tribunal').

In 1535, the crown created the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]]. The viceroy was the highest official of the State. In the religious sphere, the Diocese of Mexico was created in 1530 and elevated to the [[Archdiocese of Mexico]] in 1546, with the archbishop as the head of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Castilian Spanish was the language of rulers. The Catholic faith was the only one permitted, with non-Catholics and Catholics (excluding Indians) holding unorthodox views being subject to the [[Mexican Inquisition]], established in 1571.

Spanish military forces, sometimes accompanied by native allies, led expeditions to conquer territory or quell rebellions through the colonial era. Notable Amerindian revolts in sporadically populated northern New Spain include the [[Chichimeca War]] (1576–1606), the [[Tepehuán Revolt]] (1616–1620), and the [[Pueblo Revolt]] (1680). The [[Tzeltal Rebellion of 1712]] was a regional Maya revolt. Most rebellions were small-scale and local, posing no major threat to the ruling elites. To protect Mexico from the attacks of English, French, and Dutch [[pirate]]s and protect the Crown's monopoly of revenue, only two ports were open to foreign trade—Veracruz on the Atlantic, connecting to [[Spain]], and Acapulco on the Pacific, connecting to the [[Philippines]]. Among the best-known pirate attacks are the 1663 [[Sack of Campeche (1663)|Sack of Campeche]] and the 1683 [[Attack on Veracruz]].

Of greater concern to the crown was the issue of foreign invasion, especially after Britain seized in 1762 the Spanish ports of [[Havana]] and [[Manila]] in the [[Seven Years' War]]. It created a standing military, increased coastal fortifications, and expanded the northern [[presidio]]s and [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] into [[Alta California]]. The volatility of the urban poor in Mexico City was evident in the 1692 riot in the Zócalo. The riot over the price of maize escalated to a full-scale attack on the seats of power, with the viceregal palace and the archbishop's residence attacked by the mob.

===Independence era (1808–1855)===
{{Main|Mexican War of Independence|First Mexican Empire|First Mexican Republic|Centralist Republic of Mexico|Mexican–American War}}

[[File:Plaza de Dolores.JPG|thumb|[[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]]'s [[Cry of Dolores]] on 16 September 1810, by J.J. del Moral. The call to arms marks the beginning of Mexico's War of Independence against Spanish colonial rule.]]

On 16 September 1810, [[Secular clergy|secular priest]] [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] declared against "bad government" in the small town of [[Dolores Hidalgo|Dolores]], Guanajuato. This event, known as the [[Cry of Dolores]] ({{langx|es|Grito de Dolores}}) is commemorated each year, on 16 September, as Mexico's independence day. The upheaval in the Spanish Empire that resulted in the independence of most of its New World territories was due to [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s invasion of Spain in 1808. Hidalgo and some of his soldiers were eventually captured, Hidalgo was defrocked, and they were [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] on 31 July 1811. The first 35 years after Mexico's independence were marked by political instability and the changing of the Mexican state from a [[First Mexican Empire|transient monarchy]] to a fragile federated republic. There were military coups d'état, foreign invasions, ideological conflict between [[Conservative Party (Mexico)|Conservatives]] and [[Liberal Party (Mexico)|Liberals]], and [[economic history of Mexico|economic stagnation]].

[[File:Batalla de la Alhóndiga de Granaditas.jpg|thumb|The [[capture of Alhóndiga de Granaditas]] in Guanajuato by [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Hidalgo]]'s army on 28 September 1810, by José Díaz del Castillo]]
[[File:Generales del Trigarante.jpg|thumb|The entry of the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] into Mexico City on 27 September 1821]]

Former Royal Army General [[Agustín de Iturbide]] became regent, as newly independent Mexico sought a [[first Mexican Empire|constitutional monarch]] from Europe. When no member of a European royal house desired the position, Iturbide himself was declared Emperor Agustín I. The United States was the first country to recognize Mexico's independence, sending an ambassador to the court and sending a message to Europe via the [[Monroe Doctrine]] not to intervene in Mexico. The emperor's rule was short (1822–1823) and he was overthrown by army officers in the [[Plan of Casa Mata]].

After the forced abdication of the monarch, Central America and [[Chiapas]] left the union to form the [[Federal Republic of Central America]]. In 1824, the [[First Mexican Republic]] was established. Former insurgent General [[Guadalupe Victoria]] became the first president of the republic — the first of many army generals to hold the presidency. In 1829, former insurgent general and fierce Liberal [[Vicente Guerrero]], a signatory of the [[Plan of Iguala]] that achieved independence, became president in a disputed election. During his short term in office, from April to December 1829, he abolished slavery. His Conservative vice president, former Royalist General [[Anastasio Bustamante]], led a coup against him and Guerrero was [[judicial murder|judicially murdered]].

Mexico's ability to maintain its independence and establish a viable government was in question. Spain [[Spanish attempts to reconquer Mexico|attempted to reconquer]] its former colony during the 1820s but eventually recognized its independence. France attempted to recoup losses it claimed for its citizens during Mexico's unrest and blockaded the Gulf Coast during the so-called [[Pastry War]] of 1838–1839. General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] emerged as a national hero because of his role in both these conflicts; Santa Anna came to dominate the politics for the next 25 years, often known as the "Age of Santa Anna", until his overthrow in 1855.
[[File:FalloftheAlamo.jpg|thumb|The 1836 [[Battle of the Alamo|Battle of El Álamo]] between the Mexican army led by President [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] and American troops.]]

Mexico also contended with indigenous groups that controlled the territory that Mexico claimed in the north. For example, the [[Comanche]] controlled a [[comancheria|huge territory]] in sparsely populated central and northern Texas. Wanting to stabilize and develop that area — and as few people from central Mexico had chosen to resettle to this remote and hostile territory — the Mexican government encouraged [[Anglo-Americans|Anglo-American]] immigration into present-day Texas, a region that bordered that United States. Mexico by law was a Catholic country; the Anglo-Americans were primarily Protestant English speakers from the southern United States. Some brought their black slaves, which after 1829 was contrary to Mexican law.

In 1835, Santa Anna sought to centralize government rule in Mexico, suspending the 1824 constitution and promulgating the [[Siete Leyes|Seven Laws]], which placed power in his hands. As a result, civil war spread across Mexico. Three new governments declared independence: the [[Republic of Texas]], the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]] and the [[Republic of Yucatán]].{{rp|129–137}} The largest blow to Mexico was the U.S. invasion of Mexico in 1846 in the [[Mexican–American War]]. Mexico lost much of its sparsely populated northern territory, sealed in the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. Despite that disastrous loss, Santa Anna returned to the presidency yet again before being ousted and exiled in the Liberal [[Revolution of Ayutla]].

===Liberal era (1855–1911)===
{{Main|Second Mexican Republic|La Reforma|Second Mexican Empire|Restored Republic (Mexico)|Porfiriato}}
[[File:Photograph_of_Benito_Juarez.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Liberal President [[Benito Juárez]]. Known for his efforts to modernize Mexico, defend its sovereignty, and promote liberal reforms, especially during the mid-19th century.]]

The overthrow of Santa Anna and the establishment of a civilian government by Liberals allowed them to enact laws that they considered vital for Mexico's economic development. The [[La Reforma|Liberal Reform]] attempted to modernize Mexico's economy and institutions along liberal principles. They promulgated a new [[constitution|Constitution of 1857]], separating Church and State, stripping the Church and the military of their special privileges ({{lang|es|[[fueros]]}}); mandating the sale of Church-owned property and sale of indigenous community lands, and secularizing education. Conservatives revolted, touching off [[war of the Reform|civil war]] between rival Liberal and Conservative governments (1858–1861).

The Liberals defeated the Conservative army on the battlefield, but Conservatives sought another solution to gain power via foreign intervention by the French, asking Emperor [[Napoleon III]] to place a European monarch as head of state in Mexico. The French Army defeated the Mexican Army and placed [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian Habsburg]] on the [[second Mexican Empire|newly established throne]] of Mexico, supported by Mexican Conservatives and propped up by the French Army.

The Liberal Republic under [[Benito Juárez]] was a government in internal exile, but with the end of the Civil War in the United States in April 1865, the Reunified U.S. government began aiding the Mexican Republic. Two years later, the French Army withdrew its support, but Maximilian remained in Mexico. Republican forces captured him and he was executed. The "Restored Republic" saw the return of Juárez, "the personification of the embattled republic," as president.

The Conservatives had been not only defeated militarily but also discredited politically for their collaboration with the French invaders and Liberalism became synonymous with patriotism. The Mexican Army that had its roots in the colonial royal army and then the army of the early republic was destroyed and new military leaders had emerged from the War of the Reform and the conflict with the French, most notably [[Porfirio Díaz]], a hero of the {{lang|es|[[Battle of Puebla|Cinco de Mayo]]}}, who now sought civilian power and challenged Juárez on his re-election in 1867.

Díaz then rebelled but was crushed by Juárez. Having won re-election, Juárez died in office in July 1872. Liberal [[Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada]] became president, declaring a "religion of the state" for the rule of law, peace, and order. When Lerdo ran for re-election, Díaz rebelled against the civilian president, issuing the [[Plan of Tuxtepec]]. Díaz had more support and waged guerrilla warfare against Lerdo. On the verge of Díaz's victory on the battlefield, Lerdo fled from office into exile.

After the turmoil in Mexico from 1810 to 1876, the 35-year rule of Liberal General [[Porfirio Díaz]] (r.1876–1911) allowed Mexico to rapidly modernize in a period characterized as one of "[[Positivism|order and progress]]". The [[Porfiriato]] was characterized by economic stability and growth, significant foreign investment and influence, an expansion of the [[rail transport in Mexico|railroad network]] and telecommunications, and investments in the arts and sciences. Díaz ruled with a group of advisors that became known as the {{lang|es|[[científico]]s}} ('scientists'). The most influential {{lang|es|científico}} was Secretary of Finance [[José Yves Limantour]].

The Porfirian regime was influenced by [[positivism]]. They rejected theology and [[idealism]] in favor of scientific methods being applied towards national development. An integral aspect of the liberal project was secular education. The Díaz government led a protracted [[Yaqui Wars|conflict against the Yaqui]] that culminated with the forced relocation of thousands of [[Yaqui]] to Yucatán and Oaxaca. As the centennial of independence approached, Díaz gave an [[James Creelman|interview]] where he said he was not going to run in the 1910 elections, when he would be 80. Political opposition had been suppressed and there were few avenues for a new generation of leaders. But his announcement set off a frenzy of political activity, including the unlikely candidacy of the scion of a rich landowning family, [[Francisco I. Madero]]. Madero won a surprising amount of political support when Díaz changed his mind and ran in the election, jailing Madero. The September centennial celebration of independence was the last celebration of the [[Porfiriato]]. The Mexican Revolution starting in 1910 saw a decade of civil war, the "wind that swept Mexico."

===Mexican Revolution (1910–1920)===
{{Main|Mexican Revolution}}
[[File:Francisco_I_Madero.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Francisco I. Madero]], who challenged Díaz in the fraudulent 1910 election and was elected president when Díaz was forced to resign in May 1911]]

The [[Mexican Revolution]] was a decade-long transformational conflict. It began with scattered uprisings against President Díaz after the fraudulent 1910 election, his resignation in May 1911, demobilization of rebel forces, an interim presidency of a member of the old guard and the democratic election of a rich, civilian landowner, [[Francisco I. Madero]] in fall 1911. In [[Ten Tragic Days|February 1913]], a military coup d'état overthrew Madero's government, with the support of the U.S., resulting in Madero's murder by agents of [[Federal Army]] General [[Victoriano Huerta]]. During the Revolution, the U.S. Republican administration of [[William Howard Taft|Taft]] supported the Huerta coup against Madero, but when Democrat [[Woodrow Wilson]] was inaugurated as president in March 1913, Wilson refused to recognize Huerta's regime and allowed arms sales to the Constitutionalists. Wilson ordered troops to [[United States occupation of Veracruz|occupy]] the strategic port of Veracruz in 1914, which was lifted. A coalition of anti-Huerta forces in the North, the [[Constitutional Army]] led by [[Governor of Coahuila]] [[Venustiano Carranza]], and a peasant army in the South under [[Emiliano Zapata]] defeated the Federal Army in 1914, leaving only revolutionary forces.

Following the revolutionaries' victory against Huerta, they sought to broker a peaceful political solution, but the coalition splintered, plunging Mexico again into a civil war. Constitutionalist general [[Pancho Villa]], commander of the Division of the North, broke with Carranza and allied with Zapata. Carranza's best general [[Alvaro Obregón]] defeated Villa, his former comrade-in-arms, in the [[Battle of Celaya]] in 1915, and Villa's northern forces melted away. Carranza became the de facto head of Mexico, and the U.S. recognized his government while Zapata's forces in the south reverted to guerrilla warfare. After Pancho Villa was defeated by revolutionary forces in 1915, he led an incursion raid into [[Columbus, New Mexico]], prompting the U.S. to send [[Pancho Villa Expedition|10,000 troops]] led by General [[John J. Pershing]] in an unsuccessful attempt to capture Villa. Carranza pushed back against U.S. troops being in northern Mexico. The expeditionary forces withdrew as the U.S. entered World War I. Although often viewed as an internal conflict, the revolution had significant international elements: Germany attempted to get Mexico to side with it, sending a coded [[Zimmermann Telegram|telegram]] in 1917 to incite war between the U.S. and Mexico, with Mexico to regain the territory it lost in the Mexican-American War but Mexico remained neutral in the conflict.

In 1916, the winners of the Mexican revolution met at a constitutional convention to draft the [[Constitution of 1917]], which was ratified in February 1917. The Constitution empowered the government to expropriate resources including land, gave rights to labor, and strengthened anticlerical provisions of the 1857 Constitution. With amendments, it remains the governing document of Mexico. It is estimated that the revolutionary war killed 900,000 people out of Mexico's 15 million population at the time. Consolidating power, President Carranza had peasant leader Emiliano Zapata assassinated in 1919. Carranza had gained the support of the peasantry during the Revolution, but once in power, he did little to institute land reform, which had motivated many to fight in the Revolution. Carranza returned some confiscated land to their original owners. President Carranza's best general, Obregón, served briefly in his administration but returned to his home state of Sonora to position himself to run in the 1920 presidential election. Since Carranza could not run for re-election, he chose a civilian to succeed him, intending to remain the power behind the presidency. Obregón and two other Sonoran revolutionary generals drew up the [[Plan of Agua Prieta]], overthrowing Carranza, who died fleeing Mexico City in 1920. General [[Adolfo de la Huerta]] became interim president, followed by the election of General [[Álvaro Obregón]].

===Political consolidation and one-party rule (1920–2000)===
{{Further|Maximato|Institutional Revolutionary Party}}
[[File:General_PE_Calles_(cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Plutarco Elías Calles]], the ruler of the ''[[Maximato]]'' and the founder of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], that held uninterrupted power in Mexico from 1929 to 2000]]

The first quarter-century of the post-revolutionary period (1920–1946) was characterized by revolutionary generals serving as [[Presidents of Mexico]], including [[Álvaro Obregón]] (1920–24), [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] (1924–28), [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] (1934–40), and [[Manuel Avila Camacho]] (1940–46). The post-revolutionary project of the Mexican government sought to bring order to the country, end military intervention in politics, and create organizations of interest groups. Workers, peasants, urban office workers, and even the army for a short period were incorporated as sectors of the single party that dominated Mexican politics from its founding in 1929. Obregón instigated land reform and strengthened the power of organized labor. He gained recognition from the United States and took steps to [[American-Mexican Claims Commission|settle claims]] with companies and individuals that lost property during the Revolution. He imposed his fellow former Sonoran revolutionary general, Calles, as his successor, prompting an unsuccessful military revolt. As president, Calles provoked a [[Cristero War|major conflict]] with the [[Catholic Church in Mexico|Catholic Church]] and Catholic guerrilla armies when he strictly enforced anticlerical articles of the 1917 Constitution which ended with an agreement. Although the constitution prohibited the reelection of the president, Obregón wished to run again and the constitution was amended to allow non-consecutive re-election; he won the 1928 elections but was assassinated by a Catholic activist, causing a political crisis of succession. Calles could not become president again, so he sought to set up a structure to manage presidential succession, founding the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], which went on to dominate Mexico for the rest of the 20th century.

Despite not holding the presidency, Calles remained the key political figure during the period known as the [[Maximato]] (1929–1934), that ended during the presidency of [[Lázaro Cárdenas]], who expelled Calles from the country and implemented many economic and social reforms. This included the [[Mexican oil expropriation]] in March 1938, which nationalized the U.S. and Anglo-Dutch oil company known as the [[Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company]], which would result in the creation of the state-owned [[Pemex]].

Cárdenas's successor, [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]] (1940–1946) was more moderate, and relations between the U.S. and Mexico vastly improved during [[World War II]], when Mexico was a significant ally. From 1946 the election of [[Miguel Alemán Valdés|Miguel Alemán]], the first civilian president in the post-revolutionary period, Mexico embarked on an aggressive program of economic development, known as the [[Mexican miracle]], which was characterized by industrialization, urbanization, and the increase of inequality between urban and rural areas. The [[Green Revolution]], a technological movement that led to a significant worldwide increase in crop production, began in the [[Yaqui Valley]] of Sonora in the middle of the 20th century.

[[File:Exèrcit al Zócalo-28 d'agost.jpg|thumb|Armored cars in the [[Zócalo]] during the [[Tlatelolco massacre|protests of 1968]]]]

With robust economic growth, Mexico sought to showcase it to the world by hosting the [[1968 Summer Olympics]]. The government poured huge resources into building new facilities, prompting political unrest among university students and others. Demonstrations in central Mexico City went on for weeks before the planned opening of the games, with the government of [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz]] cracking down. The culmination was the [[Tlatelolco Massacre]], which killed around 300 protesters based on conservative estimates and perhaps as many as 800. Although the economy continued to flourish for some, [[distribution of wealth|social inequality]] remained a factor of discontent. PRI rule became increasingly authoritarian and at times oppressive in what is now referred to as the [[Mexican Dirty War]].

[[File:President Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Mexican President Carlos Salinas participate in the... - NARA - 186460.jpg|thumb|right|NAFTA signing ceremony, October 1992. From left to right: (standing) President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] (Mexico), President [[George H. W. Bush]] (U.S.), and Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] (Canada).]]

In the 1980s the first cracks emerged in the PRI's complete political dominance. In [[Baja California]], the [[Ernesto Ruffo Appel|PAN candidate]] was elected as governor. When De la Madrid chose [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] as the candidate for the PRI, and therefore a foregone presidential victor, [[Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas]], son of former President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]], broke with the PRI and challenged Salinas in the 1988 elections. In 1988 there was massive [[electoral fraud]], with results showing that Salinas had won the election by the narrowest percentage ever. There were massive protests in Mexico City over the stolen election. Salinas took the oath of office on 1 December 1988. In 1990 the PRI was famously described by [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] as the "perfect dictatorship", but by then there had been major challenges to the PRI's hegemony.

Salinas embarked on a program of [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] reforms that fixed the exchange rate of the peso, controlled inflation, opened Mexico to foreign investment, and began talks with the U.S. and Canada to join their [[free-trade agreement]], which culminated in the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) on 1 January 1994; the same day, the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN) in Chiapas began armed peasant rebellion against the federal government, which captured a few towns but brought world attention to the situation in Mexico. The armed conflict was short-lived and has continued as a non-violent opposition movement against [[neoliberalism]] and [[globalization]]. In 1994, following the assassination of the PRI's presidential candidate [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]], Salinas was succeeded by victorious PRI candidate [[Ernesto Zedillo]]. Salinas left Zedillo's government to deal with the [[Mexican peso crisis]], requiring a $50 billion [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] bailout. Major macroeconomic reforms were started by Zedillo, and the economy rapidly recovered and growth peaked at almost 7% by the end of 1999.

===Contemporary Mexico===
[[File:Vicente Fox flag (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright |[[Vicente Fox]] won the [[2000 Mexican general election|2000 general election]] and became the first president not from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] since 1929, and the first elected from an opposition party since [[Francisco I. Madero]] in 1911.]]

After 71 years of rule, the incumbent PRI lost the [[2000 Mexican general election|2000 presidential election]] to [[Vicente Fox]] of the opposing conservative [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] (PAN). In the [[2006 Mexican general election|2006 presidential election]], [[Felipe Calderón]] from the PAN was declared the winner, with a very narrow margin (0.58%) over leftist politician [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]] of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]] (PRD). López Obrador, however, [[Controversies of the 2006 Mexican general election|contested the election]] and pledged to create an "alternative government".

After twelve years, in the [[2012 Mexican general election|2012 presidential election]], the PRI again won the presidency with the election of [[Enrique Peña Nieto]]. However, he won with a plurality of around 38% and did not have a legislative majority.

During the twenty-first century, Mexico has contended with [[Crime in Mexico|high crime rates]], [[Corruption in Mexico|bureaucratic corruption]], [[Mexican drug war|narcotrafficking]], and a stagnant economy. Many state-owned industrial enterprises were privatized starting in the 1990s with [[neoliberal]] reforms, but [[Pemex]], the state-owned petroleum company is only slowly being privatized, with exploration licenses being issued. In a push against government corruption, the ex-CEO of Pemex, [[Emilio Lozoya Austin]], was arrested in 2020.

After founding the new political party [[National Regeneration Movement|MORENA]], Andrés Manuel López Obrador (commonly known as AMLO) won the 2018 presidential election with over 50% of the vote. His political coalition, led by his left-wing party founded after the 2012 elections, included parties and politicians from across the political spectrum. The coalition also won a majority in both the upper and lower Congress chambers. His success is attributed to the country's opposing political forces exhausting their chances as well as AMLO's adoption of a moderate discourse with a focus on reconciliation. The first confirmed case of [[COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico|COVID-19 in Mexico]] occurred on 28 February 2020. The [[COVID-19 vaccination in Mexico]] began in December 2020.

[[Claudia Sheinbaum]], López Obrador's political successor, won the [[2024 Mexican general election|2024 presidential election]] in a landslide and upon taking office in October became the first woman to lead the country in Mexico's history. She was sworn in as Mexico's president on 1 October 2024.
