{{Further|Early history of Singapore}}
In 1299, according to the ''[[Malay Annals]]'', the [[Kingdom of Singapura]] was founded on the island by [[Sang Nila Utama]]. Although the historicity of the accounts as given in the ''Malay Annals'' is the subject of academic debates,{{sfn|Miksic|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bMt3BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA154 154]}} it is nevertheless known from various documents that Singapore in the 14th century, then known as ''[[Temasek]]'', was a trading port under the influence of both the [[Majapahit]] Empire and the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Siamese]] kingdoms,{{sfn|Miksic|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bMt3BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA184 183–185]}} and was a part of the [[Indosphere]]. These Indianised kingdoms were characterised by surprising resilience, political integrity and administrative stability. Historical sources also indicate that around the end of the 14th century, its ruler [[Parameswara (king)|Parameswara]] was attacked by either the [[Majapahit]] or the Siamese, forcing him to move to [[Malacca]] where he founded the [[Sultanate of Malacca]].{{sfn|Miksic|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bMt3BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA162 155–163]}} Archaeological evidence suggests that the main settlement on [[Fort Canning Hill]] was abandoned around this time, although a small trading settlement continued in Singapore for some time afterwards. By then, Singapore was nominally part of the [[Johor Sultanate]]. The wider maritime region and much trade was under Dutch control for the following period after the 1641 [[Dutch Malacca|Dutch conquest of Malacca]].

[[File:Letter from William Farquhar to Sultan Muhammad Kanzul Alam, the Sultan of Brunei, dated 28 November 1819.jpg|thumb|Letter from [[William Farquhar]] to Sultan Muhammad Kanzul Alam, the 21st [[List of sultans of Brunei|Sultan of Brunei]], dated 28 November 1819. In the first line, Farquhar mentions that Sultan Hussein Shah and Temenggong Abdul Rahman allowed the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] to establish a [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Singapore on 6 February 1819.]]
The British governor [[Stamford Raffles]] arrived in Singapore on 28 January 1819 and soon recognised the island as a natural choice for the new port. The island was then nominally ruled by [[Abdul Rahman Muazzam Shah of Johor|Tengku Abdul Rahman]], the [[Sultan of Johor]], who was controlled by the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and the [[Bugis]]. However, the [[Sultanate]] was weakened by factional division: [[Temenggong Abdul Rahman|Abdul Rahman]], the [[Temenggong of Johor]] to Tengku Abdul Rahman, as well as his officials, were loyal to the Sultan's elder brother [[Hussein Shah of Johor|Tengku Long]], who was living in [[exile]] in [[Penyengat Island]], [[Riau Islands]]. With the Temenggong's help, Raffles managed to smuggle Tengku Long back into Singapore. Raffles offered to recognise Tengku Long as the rightful Sultan of Johor, under the title of [[Hussein Shah of Johor|Sultan Hussein]], as well as provide him with a yearly payment of $5000 and another $3000 to the Temenggong; in return, Sultan Hussein would grant the British the right to establish a trading post on Singapore. The [[1819 Singapore Treaty|Treaty of Singapore]] was signed on 6 February 1819.

[[File:Part of Singapore Island (British Library India Office Records, 1825, detail).jpg|thumb|left|A British survey map from 1825 showing Singapore's [[free port]] trade centred around the [[Singapore River]], where it remained for the next 150 years. [[Fort Canning]] hill, located in the centre, served as the seat of both the ancient and early colonial rulers.]]
In 1824, a further treaty with the Sultan led to the entire island becoming a part of the [[British Empire]]. In 1826, Singapore became part of the [[Straits Settlements]], then under the jurisdiction of [[British India]]. Singapore became the regional capital in 1836. Prior to Raffles' arrival, there were only about a thousand people living on the island, mostly indigenous [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] along with a handful of [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]]. By 1860 the population had swelled to over 80,000, more than half being [[Chinese Singaporeans|Chinese]]. In 1867, the Straits Settlements were separated from [[British India]], coming under the direct control of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. Later, in the 1890s, when the rubber industry became established in [[State of Singapore (Malaysia)|Malaya]] and Singapore, the island became a global centre for rubber sorting and export. After hearing rumours that they were to be sent to fight the [[Ottoman Empire]], a Muslim state, the soldiers rebelled, killing their officers and several British civilians before the mutiny was suppressed by non-Muslim troops arriving from [[Johore]] and [[Burma]].

After [[World War I]], the British built the large [[Singapore Naval Base]] as part of the defensive [[Singapore strategy]]. Originally announced in 1921, the construction of the base proceeded at a slow pace until the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931. Costing $60&nbsp;million and not fully completed in 1938, it was nonetheless the largest [[dry dock]] in the world, the third-largest [[floating dock (jetty)|floating dock]], and had enough fuel tanks to support the entire British navy for six months. The base was defended by heavy {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on}} naval guns stationed at [[Fort Siloso]], [[Fort Canning]] and Labrador, as well as a [[Royal Air Force]] airfield at [[Tengah Air Base]]. [[Winston Churchill]] touted it as the "[[Gibraltar]] of the East", and military discussions often referred to the base as simply "[[East of Suez]]". However, the [[British Home Fleet]] was stationed in Europe, and the British could not afford to build a second fleet to protect their interests in Asia. The plan was for the Home Fleet to sail quickly to Singapore in the event of an emergency. As a consequence, after [[World War II]] broke out in 1939, the fleet was fully occupied with defending Britain, leaving Singapore vulnerable to [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese invasion]].

During the [[Pacific War]], the Japanese [[Malayan campaign|invasion of Malaya]] culminated in the [[Battle of Singapore]]. When the British force of 60,000 troops surrendered on 15 February 1942, British prime minister Winston Churchill called the defeat "the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history". British and Empire losses during the fighting for Singapore were heavy, with a total of nearly 85,000 personnel captured.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=382}} About 5,000 were killed or wounded, of which [[Australians]] made up the majority.{{sfn|Legg|1965|p=248}} Japanese casualties during the fighting in Singapore amounted to 1,714 killed and 3,378 wounded.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=382}}{{efn|The breakdown of British Empire losses included 38,496 United Kingdom, 18,490 Australian, 67,340 Indian and 14,382 local volunteer troops. Total Australian casualties included 1,789 killed and 1,306 wounded.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=382}}}} The occupation was to become a major turning point in the histories of several nations, including those of [[Japan]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and Singapore. Japanese newspapers triumphantly declared the victory as deciding the general situation of the war.{{sfn|Toland|1970|p=277}} Between 5,000 and 25,000 ethnic Chinese people were killed in the subsequent [[Sook Ching massacre]]. British forces had [[Operation Mailfist|planned to liberate Singapore]] in 1945/1946; however, the war ended before these operations could be carried out.{{sfn|Bose|2010|pp=18–20}}

=== Post-war period ===

After the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] on 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder; looting and revenge-killing were widespread. British, Australian, and Indian troops led by Lord [[Louis Mountbatten]] [[Operation Tiderace|returned to Singapore]] to receive the formal surrender of Japanese forces in the region from General [[Seishirō Itagaki]] on behalf of General [[Hisaichi Terauchi]] on 12 September 1945.{{sfn|Bose|2010|pp=18–20}}

Much of the infrastructure in Singapore had been destroyed during the war, including those needed to supply utilities. A shortage of food led to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. A series of strikes in 1947 caused massive stoppages in public transport and other services. However, by late 1947 the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing international demand for tin and rubber. The failure of Britain to successfully defend its colony against the Japanese changed its image in the eyes of Singaporeans. [[British Military Administration (Malaya)|British Military Administration]] ended on 1 April 1946, and Singapore became a separate [[Crown colony|Crown Colony]].

During the 1950s, [[Chinese Communist Party|Chinese communists]], with strong ties to the trade unions and Chinese schools, waged a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against the government, leading to the [[Malayan Emergency]]. The [[1954 National Service riots]], [[Hock Lee bus riots]], and [[Chinese middle schools riots]] in Singapore were all linked to these events. [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]], pro-independence leader of the [[Labour Front]], won Singapore's first general election in 1955. He led a delegation to [[London]], and Britain rejected his demand for complete self-rule. He resigned and was replaced by [[Lim Yew Hock]] in 1956, and after further negotiations Britain agreed to grant Singapore full internal [[Self-governance of Singapore|self-government]] for all matters except defence and foreign affairs on 3 June 1959. Days before, in the [[1959 Singaporean general election|30 May 1959 election]], the PAP won a landslide victory under [[Lee Kuan Yew]]. [[Governor of Singapore|Governor]] Sir [[William Allmond Codrington Goode]] served as the first [[Yang di-Pertuan Negara]] (Head of State).

[[File:Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore Making a Toast at a State Dinner Held in His Honor, 1975.jpg|thumb|upright=0.68|[[Lee Kuan Yew]], the first prime minister of Singapore from 1959 to 1990.]]
PAP leaders believed that Singapore's future lay with Malaya, due to strong ties between the two. It was thought that reuniting with Malaya would benefit the economy by creating a common market, alleviating ongoing unemployment woes in Singapore. However, a sizeable left-wing faction of the PAP was strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a loss of influence, and hence formed the [[Barisan Sosialis]], after being kicked out from the PAP. The ruling party of Malaya, [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), was staunchly anti-communist, and it was suspected UMNO would support the non-communist factions of PAP. UMNO, initially sceptical of the idea of a merger due to distrust of the PAP government and concern that the large ethnic Chinese population in Singapore would alter the racial balance in Malaya on which their political power base depended, became supportive of the idea of the merger due to joint fear of a communist takeover.

On 27 May 1961, Malaya's prime minister, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], made a surprise proposal for a new Federation called [[Malaysia]], which would unite the current and former [[British possessions]] in the region: the [[Federation of Malaya]], Singapore, [[Brunei]], [[North Borneo (British Crown colony)|North Borneo]], and [[Sarawak (British Crown colony)|Sarawak]]. UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Bornean territories would balance Singapore's Chinese population. To obtain a mandate for a merger, the PAP held a [[1962 Merger Referendum of Singapore|referendum on the merger]]. This referendum included a choice of different terms for a merger with Malaysia and had no option for avoiding merger altogether. On 16 September 1963, Singapore joined with Malaya, the North Borneo, and Sarawak to form the new Federation of Malaysia under the terms of the [[Malaysia Agreement]]. Under this Agreement, Singapore had a relatively high level of autonomy compared to the other states of Malaysia.

[[Indonesia]] opposed the formation of Malaysia due to its own claims over Borneo and launched [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|''Konfrontasi'']]  in response to the formation of Malaysia. On 10 March 1965, [[MacDonald House bombing|a bomb planted by Indonesian saboteurs]] on a mezzanine floor of [[MacDonald House]] exploded, killing three people and injuring 33 others. It was the deadliest of at least 42 bomb incidents which occurred during the ''Konfrontasi''. Two members of the [[Indonesian Marine Corps]], [[Osman bin Haji Mohamed Ali]] and [[Harun bin Said]], were eventually convicted and executed for the crime. The explosion caused US$250,000 ({{Inflation|US|250000|1965|fmt=eq|cursign=[[United States dollar|US$]]}}) in damages to MacDonald House.

Even after the merger, the [[People's Action Party–United Malays National Organisation relations|Singaporean government and the Malaysian central government disagreed]] on many political and economic issues. On 7 August 1965, Malaysian prime minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, seeing no alternative to prevent further bloodshed and following the conclusion of secret negotiations with certain PAP leaders, advised the [[Parliament of Malaysia]] to vote for the expulsion of Singapore from Malaysia. On 9 August 1965, [[Members of the Dewan Rakyat, 2nd Malaysian Parliament|the Malaysian Parliament]] voted 126 to 0 to move a bill to amend the constitution, expelling Singapore from Malaysia, which left Singapore as a newly independent country.

After its expulsion from Malaysia, Singapore became independent as the "Republic of Singapore" on 9 August 1965, with [[Lee Kuan Yew]] and [[Yusof bin Ishak]] as the first prime minister and president respectively. In 1967, the country co-founded the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN). Race riots [[1969 race riots of Singapore|erupted again]] in 1969 as a spillover from the [[13 May incident]] in Malaysia. On this occasion, the unrest was more firmly contained. Lee's emphasis on rapid economic growth, racial integration, promotion of business entrepreneurship and curbs on democratic freedoms by governing with extensive legal powers shaped Singapore's policies for the next half century. Lee's government capitalised on Singapore's favourable geographical position to develop the [[Port of Singapore]] into one of the world's busiest ports, while the service and tourism industries also expanded significantly during this period.

The PAP has remained in power since 1959. Often described as a ''de facto'' one-party state because of its uncommon longevity for a nominal [[liberal democracy]], some activists and opposition politicians view the PAP government's tight regulation of political and media activities, along with its stringent laws, as an infringement on political rights. In response, the PAP introduced several significant political changes, including the creation of the [[Non-constituency Members of Parliament]] (NCMPs) scheme from the [[1984 Singaporean general election|1984 election]], which allowed a limited number of the best performing losing opposition candidates to be appointed as MPs. [[Group representation constituencies]] (GRCs) were subsequently introduced in the [[1988 Singaporean general election|1988 election]] as multi-member electoral divisions intended to guarantee minority representation in parliament, although the opposition has accused the scheme of enabling [[gerrymandering]]. In addition, [[Nominated Members of Parliament]] (NMPs) were introduced in 1990 to allow non-elected and non-partisan representatives from diverse professional fields to serve in parliament. The [[Constitution of Singapore|constitution]] was amended in 1991 to provide for an [[President of Singapore|elected president]] with veto powers over the use of [[Reserves of the Government of Singapore|past reserves]] and key public service appointments. The first such election was held in [[1993 Singaporean presidential election|1993]].

In 1990, [[Goh Chok Tong]] succeeded Lee and became Singapore's second prime minister, leading the PAP into the [[1991 Singaporean general election|1991 election]]. During Goh's tenure, the country went through the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] and the [[2002–2004 SARS outbreak]]. In 2004, [[Lee Hsien Loong]], the eldest son of [[Lee Kuan Yew]], became the country's third prime minister. The PAP experienced its [[2011 Singaporean general election|worst electoral performance]] in 2011, securing only 60% of the vote. While this would be considered a [[landslide victory]] in many countries since it preserved the party's [[supermajority]], it was regarded locally as a poor outcome, reflecting public debate over issues such as the high rates of [[Immigration to Singapore|immigration]] and the rising [[cost of living]]. On 23 March 2015, Lee Kuan Yew [[Death and state funeral of Lee Kuan Yew|died]], and a one-week period of public mourning was observed nationwide. Subsequently, the PAP regained its dominance in Parliament through the [[2015 Singaporean general election|September general election]], receiving 69.9% of the popular vote, although this remained lower than the [[2001 Singaporean general election|2001]] tally of 75.3% and the [[1968 Singaporean general election|1968]] tally of 86.7%. The [[2020 Singaporean general election|2020 election]] held in July saw the PAP drop to 61% of the vote, while the [[Workers' Party (Singapore)|Workers' Party]] (WP) took 10 of the 93 seats, including its leader [[Pritam Singh]] becoming the first ''de jure'' [[Leader of the Opposition (Singapore)|leader of the opposition]] since independence. On 15 May 2024, [[Lawrence Wong]] became Singapore's fourth prime minister and the first born after independence. Wong's first electoral test came at the [[2025 Singaporean general election|2025 election]], which saw the PAP winning 65.5% of the vote and 87 out of 97 seats in Parliament; the WP retained their 10 seats. Singapore was one of eight cities worldwide that was classified as an "Alpha+" city by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]] (GaWC) in 2024.
