[[File:Göbekli Tepe, Urfa.jpg|thumb|Some [[henge]]s at [[Göbekli Tepe]] were erected as far back as [[Göbekli Tepe#Large enclosures|9600 BC]], predating those of [[Stonehenge]] by over seven millennia.]]

Present-day Turkey has been inhabited by [[Human|modern humans]] since the [[Upper Paleolithic|late Paleolithic]] period and contains some of the world's oldest [[Neolithic]] sites. [[Göbekli Tepe]] is close to 12,000 years old. Other important Anatolian Neolithic sites include [[Çatalhöyük]] and [[Alaca Höyük]]. Neolithic Anatolian farmers differed genetically from farmers in [[Iran]] and [[Jordan Valley]]. These early Anatolian farmers also [[Early European Farmers|migrated into Europe]], starting around 9,000 years ago. [[Troy]]'s earliest layers go back to around 4500 BC. These tablets belonged to an [[Karum (trade post)|Assyrian trade colony]]. [[Hattic language|Hattian]] was a language indigenous to Anatolia, with no known modern-day connections. [[Hurrian language]] was used in northern [[Syria]]. forming the [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian sub-group]].{{efn|The origin of Indo-European languages is unknown. [[Anatolian hypothesis|They may be native to Anatolia]] or non-native.}}

[[Hattians|Hattian]] rulers were gradually replaced by [[Hittites|Hittite]] rulers. The [[Thracians]] were also present in modern-day [[Turkish Thrace]]. It is not known if the [[Trojan War]] is based on historical events. [[Late Bronze Age Troy|Troy's Late Bronze Age]] layers matches most with ''[[Iliad]]''{{'}}s story.

Around 750 BC, [[Phrygia]] had been established, with its two centers in [[Gordium]] and modern-day [[Kayseri]]. [[Phrygians]] spoke an Indo-European language, which was closer to [[Greek language|Greek]] than Anatolian languages. Urartians spoke a non-Indo-European language and their capital was around [[Lake Van]]. They were replaced by [[Carians]], [[Lycians]] and [[Lydians]]. Around 1000 BC, [[Iron Age Greek migrations|Greeks started migrating]] to the west coast of Anatolia. These eastern Greek settlements played a vital role in shaping the Archaic Greek civilization; important [[polis|cities]] included [[Miletus]], [[Ephesus]], [[Halicarnassus]], [[Smyrna]] (now [[İzmir]]) and [[Byzantium]] (now [[Istanbul]]), the latter founded by colonists from [[Megara]] in the seventh century BCE. These settlements were grouped as [[Aeolis]], [[Ionia]], and [[Doric hexapolis|Doris]], after the specific Greek groups that settled them. Further Greek colonization in Anatolia was led by Miletus and [[Megara]] in 750–480 BC. The Greek cities along the Aegean prospered with trade, and saw remarkable scientific and scholarly accomplishments. [[Thales of Miletus|Thales]] and [[Anaximander]] from Miletus founded the [[Ionian school (philosophy)|Ionian School of philosophy]], thereby laying the foundations of [[rationalism]] and [[Western philosophy]].
[[File:Ephesus_Celsus_Library_Façade.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Library of Celsus]] in [[Ephesus]] was built by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 114–117.]]

[[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] attacked eastern Anatolia in 547 BC, and [[Achaemenid Empire]] eventually [[Siege of Sardis (547 BC)|expanded into western Anatolia]].

Following the victories of Alexander in [[Battle of the Granicus|334 BC]] and [[Battle of Issus|333 BC]], the Achaemenid Empire collapsed and Anatolia became part of the [[Macedon|Macedonian Empire]]. which met resistance in some places. Following Alexander's death, the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] ruled large parts of Anatolia, while native Anatolian states emerged in the Marmara and Black Sea areas. In eastern Anatolia, [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|the kingdom of Armenia]] appeared. In third century BC, [[Celts]] invaded central Anatolia and continued as a major ethnic group in the area for around 200 years. They were known as the [[Galatians (people)|Galatians]].

===Rome and Byzantine Empire===

[[File:Justinian555AD.png|thumb|The [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]] in 555 under [[Justinian the Great]], at its greatest extent]]

When [[Kingdom of Pergamon|Pergamon]] requested assistance in its conflict with the Seleucids, [[Roman Republic|Rome]] intervened in Anatolia in the second century BC. Without an heir, Pergamum's king left the kingdom to Rome, which was annexed as [[Asia (Roman province)|province of Asia]]. Roman influence grew in Anatolia afterwards. Following [[Asiatic Vespers]] massacre, and [[Mithridatic Wars]] with [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]], Rome emerged victorious. Around the 1st century BC, [[Roman province|Rome expanded into parts of Pontus and Bithynia]], while turning rest of Anatolian states into Roman satellites. Several [[Roman–Parthian Wars|conflicts with Parthians ensued]], with peace and wars alternating.

According to [[Acts of the Apostles]], early Christian Church had significant growth in Anatolia because of [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]]'s efforts. Letters from St. Paul in Anatolia comprise the [[Early Christianity|oldest Christian literature]]. Under Roman authority, [[ecumenical councils]] such as [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea (Iznik)]] in 325 served as a guide for developing "orthodox expressions of basic Christian teachings".]]
The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the [[Roman Empire]] centered in [[Constantinople]] during [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]]. The eastern half of the Empire survived the conditions that caused the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of the West]] in the 5th century AD, and continued to exist until the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire remained the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in the [[Mediterranean world]]. The term ''Byzantine Empire'' was only coined following the empire's demise; its citizens referred to the polity as the "Roman Empire" and to themselves as ''Romans''. Due to the imperial seat's move from Rome to [[Byzantium]], the [[Christianity as the Roman state religion|adoption of Christianity as the state religion]], and the predominance of [[Medieval Greek|Greek]] instead of [[Latin]], modern historians continue to make a distinction between the earlier ''Roman Empire'' and the later ''Byzantine Empire''.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

In the early Byzantine Empire period, the Anatolian coastal areas were Greek speaking. In addition to natives, interior Anatolia had diverse groups such as [[Goths]], [[Celts]], [[Persians]] and [[History of the Jews in the Byzantine Empire|Jews]]. Interior Anatolia had been "heavily Hellenized". [[Anatolian languages]] eventually became extinct after [[Hellenization]] of Anatolia.

According to historians and linguists, the [[Proto-Turkic language]] originated in Central-East Asia. Initially, Proto-[[Turkic languages|Turkic speakers]] were potentially both hunter-gatherers and farmers; they later became [[nomadic]] [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]]. During the 9th and 10th centuries CE, [[Oghuz Turks|the Oghuz]] were a Turkic group that lived in the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe|Caspian]] and [[Aral Sea|Aral]] steppes. Partly due to pressure from the [[Kipchaks]], the Oghuz migrated into [[Iranian Plateau|Iran]] and [[Transoxiana]]. In 1040, the Seljuks defeated the [[Ghaznavids]] at the [[Battle of Dandanaqan]] and established the [[Seljuk Empire]] in [[Greater Khorasan]]. [[Baghdad]], the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]'s capital and center of [[Islamic Golden Age|the Islamic world]], was taken by Seljuks in 1055. In the latter half of the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks began penetrating into [[medieval Armenia]] and Anatolia. During this period, there were also [[Anatolian beyliks|Turkish principalities]] such as [[Danishmendids]]. Seljuk arrival started the [[Turkification]] process in Anatolia; The shift took several centuries and happened gradually. Members of [[Mysticism#Islamic mysticism|Islamic mysticism]] orders, such as [[Mevlevi Order]], played a role in the [[Islamization]] of the diverse people of Anatolia. Seljuk expansion was one of the reasons for the [[Crusades]]. In 13th century, there was a second significant wave of Turkic migration, as people fled [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] expansion. Seljuk sultanate was defeated by the Mongols at the [[Battle of Köse Dağ]] in 1243 and disappeared by the beginning of the 14th century. It was replaced by various Turkish principalities.

===Ottoman Empire===
{{Main|Ottoman Empire}}
[[File:OttomanEmpireMain.png|thumb|The [[Ottoman Empire]] at its greatest European extent, in 1683, during the [[Battle of Vienna]]]]
Based around [[Söğüt]], [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Beylik]] was founded by [[Osman I]] in the early 14th century. According to Ottoman chroniclers, Osman descended from the ''[[Kayı (tribe)|Kayı]]'' tribe of the [[Oghuz Turks]]. Ottomans started annexing the nearby Turkish beyliks (principalities) in Anatolia and expanded into the [[Balkans]]. [[Mehmed II]] completed Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire by [[Fall of Constantinople|capturing its capital, Constantinople]], on 29 May 1453. [[Selim I]] united Anatolia under Ottoman rule. In the 16th and 17th centuries, [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire|Sephardic Jews]] moved into Ottoman Empire following their [[Reconquista#Conversions and expulsions|expulsion]] from Spain. From the second half of the 18th century onwards, the [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire began to decline]]. The [[Tanzimat]] reforms, initiated by [[Mahmud II]] in 1839, aimed to modernize the Ottoman state in line with the progress that had been made in Western Europe. The [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]] was the first among Muslim states, but was [[First Constitutional Era|short-lived]].

As the empire gradually shrank in size, military power and wealth; especially after the [[Great Eastern Crisis|Ottoman economic crisis and default]] in 1875 which led to uprisings in the Balkan provinces that culminated in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]]. The decline of the Ottoman Empire led to a [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|rise in nationalist sentiment among its various subject peoples]], leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence, such as the [[Hamidian massacres]] of [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Armenians]], which claimed up to 300,000 lives.{{Better source needed|reason=some of this information is not in the source|date=November 2024}} Ottoman territories in Europe ([[Rumelia]]) were lost in the [[First Balkan War]] (1912–1913). Ottomans managed to recover some territory in Europe, such as [[Edirne]], in the [[Second Balkan War]] (1913).

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, [[persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction]] and [[Persecution of Muslims#Russian Empire|in the Russian Empire]] resulted in estimated 5 million deaths, with the casualties including Turks. shifting the center of the Ottoman Empire to Anatolia. In addition to a small number of Jews, the refugees were overwhelmingly Muslim; they were both Turkish and non-Turkish people, such as [[Circassians]] and [[Crimean Tatars]]. [[Paul Mojzes]] has called the Balkan Wars an "unrecognized genocide", where multiple sides were both victims and perpetrators. Circassian refugees included the survivors of the [[Circassian genocide]].

Following the [[1913 Ottoman coup d'état|1913 coup d'état]], the [[Three Pashas]] took control of the Ottoman government. The Ottoman Empire entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and was ultimately defeated. During the war, the empire's Armenian subjects were [[Temporary Law of Deportation|deported to Syria]] as part of the [[Armenian genocide]]. As a result, an estimated 600,000 to more than 1 million, [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Armenians]] were killed. The Turkish government has [[Armenian genocide denial|refused to acknowledge]] the events as genocide and states that Armenians were only [[Population transfer|"relocated]]" from the eastern war zone. [[Late Ottoman genocides|Genocidal campaigns]] were also committed against the empire's other minority groups such as the [[Assyrian genocide|Assyrians]] and [[Greek genocide|Greeks]]. Following the [[Armistice of Mudros]] in 1918, the victorious [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] sought the [[partition of the Ottoman Empire]] through the 1920 [[Treaty of Sèvres]].

===Republic of Türkiye===
{{Main|History of the Republic of Turkey}}
[[File:Atatürk şapkasıyla selam verirken.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], the [[List of national founders|founder]] and the [[List of presidents of Turkey|first President]] of the Turkish Republic]]
The [[occupation of Istanbul]] (1918) and [[Occupation of Smyrna|İzmir]] (1919) by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in the aftermath of World War I initiated the [[Turkish National Movement]]. Under the leadership of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal Pasha]], a military commander who had distinguished himself during the [[Gallipoli campaign|Battle of Gallipoli]], the [[Turkish War of Independence]] (1919–1923) was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] (1920).

The [[Government of the Grand National Assembly|Turkish Provisional Government]] in [[Ankara]], which had declared itself the legitimate government of the country on [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|23 April 1920]], started to formalize the legal transition from the old Ottoman into the new Republican political system. The Ankara Government engaged in armed and diplomatic struggle. In 1921–1923, the Armenian, Greek, French, and British armies had been expelled. The military advance and diplomatic success of the Ankara Government resulted in the signing of the [[Armistice of Mudanya]] on 11 October 1922. On 1 November 1922, the Turkish Parliament in Ankara formally abolished the Sultanate, thus ending 623 years of [[monarchy|monarchical]] Ottoman rule.

The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] of 24 July 1923, which superseded the Treaty of Sèvres, The [[Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations|Lausanne Convention]] stipulated a [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].

[[File:Turkey-1658 (2215850337).jpg|thumb|left|[[Anıtkabir]] in [[Ankara]] was completed in 1953 to become the mausoleum of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]]]
Mustafa Kemal became the republic's first [[President of Turkey|president]] and introduced [[Atatürk's reforms|many reforms]]. The reforms aimed to transform the old [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|religion-based and multi-communal]] Ottoman monarchy into a Turkish [[nation state]] that would be governed as a [[parliamentary republic]] under a [[Turkish Constitution of 1924|secular constitution]]. Women gained the right to vote nationally in 1934. With the [[Surname Law (Turkey)|Surname Law]], the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Turkish Parliament]] bestowed upon Kemal the honorific surname "Atatürk" (''Father Turk''). and the [[Dersim rebellion]] in 1937.

[[İsmet İnönü]] became the country's second president following Atatürk's death in 1938. In 1939, the [[Hatay State|Republic of Hatay]] voted in favor of joining Turkey with a referendum. Turkey [[Second Cairo Conference|remained neutral]] during almost all of [[World War II]], but entered the war on the side of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] on [[Turkish declaration of war on Germany and Japan|23 February 1945]]. Later that year, Turkey became a [[United Nations Charter|charter member]] of the United Nations. In 1950 Turkey became a member of the [[Council of Europe]]. After fighting as part of the [[United Nations|UN]] forces in the [[Korean War]], Turkey joined [[NATO]] in 1952, becoming a bulwark against Soviet expansion into the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]].

Military coups or memorandums, which happened in [[1960 Turkish coup d'état|1960]], [[1971 Turkish military memorandum|1971]], [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|1980]], and [[1997 Turkish military memorandum|1997]], complicated Turkey's transition to a democratic [[Multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey|multiparty system]]. Between 1960 and the end of the 20th century, the prominent leaders in Turkish politics who achieved multiple election victories were [[Süleyman Demirel]], [[Bülent Ecevit]] and [[Turgut Özal]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2024}} PKK started a "campaign of terrorist attacks on civilian and military targets" in the 1980s. It is designated as a [[list of designated terrorist groups|terrorist organization]] by Turkey, and the European Union. [[Tansu Çiller]] became the first female prime minister of Turkey in 1993. Turkey applied for full membership of the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] in 1987, joined the [[European Union Customs Union]] in 1995 and started [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|accession negotiations]] with the [[European Union]] in 2005. Customs Union had an important impact on the Turkish manufacturing sector.

In 2014, prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan won Turkey's first direct [[2014 Turkish presidential election|presidential election]]. On 15 July 2016, an [[2016 Turkish coup attempt|unsuccessful coup attempt]] tried to oust the government. According to the Turkish government, there are 13,251 arrested or convicted people in jail as of 2024, related to the 2016 coup attempt. With a [[2017 Turkish constitutional referendum|referendum in 2017]], the parliamentary republic was replaced by an [[executive president|executive presidential system]]. The office of the prime minister was abolished, and its powers and duties were transferred to the president. On the referendum day, while the voting was still underway, the [[Supreme Election Council (Turkey)|Supreme Electoral Council]] lifted a rule that required each ballot to have an official stamp. In 2025 the PKK declared a ceasefire.
