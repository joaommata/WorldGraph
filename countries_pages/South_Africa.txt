South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological and [[List of human evolution fossils|human-fossil]] sites in the world. Archaeologists have recovered extensive fossil remains from a series of caves in [[Gauteng]] Province. The area, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], has been branded "the [[Cradle of Humankind]]". The sites include [[Sterkfontein]], one of the richest sites for [[hominin]] fossils in the world, as well as [[Swartkrans]], [[Gondolin Cave]], [[Kromdraai fossil site|Kromdraai]], [[Cooper's Cave]] and [[Malapa Fossil Site, Cradle of Humankind|Malapa]]. [[Raymond Dart]] identified the first hominin fossil discovered in Africa, the [[Taung Child]] (found near [[Taung]]) in 1924. Other hominin remains have come from the sites of [[Makapansgat]] in [[Limpopo]] Province; [[Cornelia, Free State|Cornelia]] and [[Florisbad]] in [[Free State (province)|Free State Province]]; [[Border Cave]] in [[KwaZulu-Natal]] Province; [[Klasies River Caves]] in [[Eastern Cape]] Province; and [[Pinnacle Point]], [[Saldanha man|Elandsfontein]] and Die Kelders Cave in [[Western Cape]] Province.

These finds suggest that various hominid species existed in South Africa from about three million years ago, starting with ''[[Australopithecus africanus]],'' followed by ''[[Australopithecus sediba]]'', ''[[Homo ergaster]]'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'', ''[[Homo rhodesiensis]]'', ''[[Homo helmei]]'', ''[[Homo naledi]]'' and modern [[human]]s (''Homo sapiens''). Modern humans have inhabited Southern Africa for at least 170,000 years. Various researchers have located [[Oldowan|pebble tools]] within the [[Vaal River]] valley.

=== Khoisan People ===
[[Khoisan]] refers to the [[indigenous peoples]]; [[San people|Sān]] and [[Khoekhoen]]  of Southern Africa. The San were mostly [[hunter-gatherers]] while the Khoekhoen also practiced [[pastoralism]]. Khoisan peoples may be the descendants of an early dispersal of [[anatomically modern humans]] to Southern Africa before 150,000&nbsp;years ago. They were mostly displaced or absorbed by [[Bantu expansion]] between 1,500 and 2,000&nbsp;years ago.

=== Bantu expansion ===
[[File:MapungubweHill.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mapungubwe Hill]], the site of the former capital of the [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]]]]
{{Main|Bantu expansion}}
Bantu [[settlers]] expanded from West Africa since approximately 3,000 BCE. Settlements of [[Bantu peoples of South Africa|Bantu-speaking peoples]], who were iron-using agriculturists and [[herder|herdsmen]], were present south of the [[Limpopo River]] (now the northern border with [[Botswana]] and [[Zimbabwe]]) by the 4th or 5th century AD. The earliest [[ironworks]] in modern-day [[KwaZulu-Natal|KwaZulu-Natal Province]] are believed to date from around 1050 AD. The southernmost group was the [[Xhosa people]], whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoisan people. The Xhosa reached the [[Great Fish River]], in today's Eastern Cape Province. As they migrated, these larger [[Iron Age]] populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples. In [[Mpumalanga]] Province, several stone circles have been found along with a stone arrangement that has been named [[Blaauboschkraal stone ruins|Adam's Calendar]], and the ruins are thought to be created by the [[Bokoni|Bakone]], a [[Northern Sotho language|Northern Sotho]] people.

=== Mapungubwe ===
Around 1220, in the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]]-[[Shashe River|Shashe]] Basin, the elite of [[Bambandyanalo|K2]] moved to settle the flat-topped summit of Mapungubwe Hill, with the population settling below. [[Rainmaking (ritual)|Rainmaking]] was crucial to the development of [[sacral kingship]]. By 1250, the capital had a population of 5000 and the state covered 30,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (11,500 square miles), growing wealthy through the [[Indian Ocean trade]]. The events around Mapungubwe's collapse circa 1300 are unknown, however trade routes shifted north from the Limpopo to the [[Zambezi]], precipitating the rise of [[Great Zimbabwe]]. The hill was abandoned and Mapungubwe's population scattered.

=== Portuguese exploration ===
{{see also|Portuguese discoveries}}
[[File:F. Benda-The planting of cross by Bartholomew Dias in 1488-0681 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Portuguese explorer [[Bartolomeu Dias]] planting the cross at [[Cape Point]] after being the first to successfully round the [[Cape of Good Hope]]]]

In 1487, the Portuguese explorer [[Bartolomeu Dias]] led the first European voyage to land in southern Africa. On 4 December, he landed at Walfisch Bay (now known as [[Walvis Bay]] in present-day Namibia). This was south of the furthest point reached in 1485 by his predecessor, the Portuguese navigator [[Diogo Cão]] ([[Cape Cross]], north of the bay). Dias continued down the western coast of southern Africa. After 8 January 1488, prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast, he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of Africa without seeing it. He reached as far up the eastern coast of Africa as, what he called, {{lang|pt|Rio do Infante}}, probably the present-day [[Groot River (Eastern Cape)|Groot River]], in May 1488. On his return, he saw the cape, which he named {{lang|pt|Cabo das Tormentas}} ('Cape of Storms'). King [[John II of Portugal|John II]] renamed the point {{lang|pt|Cabo da Boa Esperança}}, or [[Cape of Good Hope]], as it led to the riches of the [[East Indies]]. Dias' feat of navigation was immortalised in [[Luís de Camões]]' 1572 epic poem, ''[[Os Lusíadas]]''.

=== Dutch colonisation ===
{{Main|Dutch Cape Colony|Boer Republics}}
[[File:Charles Bell - Jan van Riebeeck se aankoms aan die Kaap.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles Davidson Bell]]'s 19th-century painting of [[Jan van Riebeeck]], who founded the first European settlement in South Africa, arriving in [[Table Bay]] in 1652]]

In [[1595 in South Africa|1595]], the Dutch made their first contact with the coast of Southern Africa. With Portugal's maritime power declining in the early 17th century, English and Dutch merchants competed to dislodge Portugal's lucrative monopoly on the [[spice trade]]. British [[East India Company]] representatives sporadically called at the cape in search of provisions from as early as 1601 but later came to favour [[Ascension Island]] and [[Saint Helena]] as ports of refuge. Dutch interest was aroused after 1647, when two employees of the [[Dutch East India Company]] were shipwrecked at the cape for several months. The sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives. Upon their return to Holland, they reported favourably on the cape's potential as a "warehouse and garden" for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages. In time, the cape became home to a large population of {{lang|nl|vrijlieden}}, also known as {{lang|nl|vrijburgers}} ({{lit.|free citizens}}), [[Free Burghers in the Dutch Cape Colony|former company employees]] who stayed in Dutch overseas territories after serving their contracts. Some of the earliest mixed race communities in the country were formed between {{lang|nl|vrijburgers}}, enslaved people, and indigenous peoples. This led to the development of a new ethnic group, the [[Cape Coloureds]], most of whom adopted the Dutch language and Christian faith.

Dutch colonists' eastward expansion caused wars with the southwesterly migrating Xhosa nation, known as the [[Xhosa Wars]], as both sides competed for the pastureland near the Great Fish River, which the colonists desired for grazing cattle. ''Vrijburgers'' who became independent farmers on the frontier were known as ''[[Boers]]'', with some adopting semi-nomadic lifestyles being denoted as {{lang|nl|[[trekboers]]}}. Following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it was formally ceded to Great Britain and became an integral part of the [[British Empire]]. British emigration to South Africa began around 1818, subsequently culminating in the arrival of the [[1820 Settlers]]. [[Chiefdom]]s grew wealthier and competed over trade routes and grazing land, leading to the formation of the [[Ndwandwe]] and [[Mthethwa Clan|Mthethwa]] Paramountcies in the east. Ndwandwe defeated Mthethwa which split into different groups, one of which was led by [[Shaka]] of the [[amaZulu]]. The 1810s saw the fourth and fifth [[Xhosa Wars]] as British colonisation expanded. Ndwandwe splintered amid costly raids and Shaka's [[Zulu Kingdom]] rose to fill the power vacuum.

[[File:Cape Colony map 1876 - Eve of Confederation Wars.jpg|thumb|1876 map of South Africa]]
During the early 19th century, many Dutch settlers departed from the [[Cape Colony]], where they had been subjected to British control, in a series of migrant groups who came to be known as {{lang|nl|[[Voortrekkers]]}}, meaning "pathfinders" or "pioneers". They migrated to the future [[Natal (province)|Natal]], Free State, and [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]] regions. The Boers founded the [[Boer republics]]: the [[South African Republic]], the [[Natalia Republic]], and the [[Orange Free State]]. In the interior, the [[Cape Colony]] expanded at the expense of the [[Tswana people|Batswana]] and [[Griqua people|Griqua]], and Boer expansion caused great instability in the Middle Orange River region. The [[Matabele kingdom]] came to dominate the eastern interior, and raided the [[Venda people|Venda]] kingdom. The discovery of diamonds in 1867 and gold in 1884 in the interior started the [[Mineral Revolution]] and increased economic growth and immigration. This intensified British subjugation of the indigenous people. The struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between Europeans and the indigenous population and also between the Boers and the British.

On 16 May 1876, President [[Thomas François Burgers]] of the South African Republic declared war against the [[Pedi people]]. King [[Sekhukhune]] managed to defeat the army on 1 August 1876. Another attack by the Lydenburg Volunteer Corps was also repulsed. On 16 February 1877, the two parties signed a peace treaty at [[Botshabelo, Mpumalanga|Botshabelo]]. The Boers' inability to subdue the Pedi led to the departure of Burgers in favour of [[Paul Kruger]] and the British annexation of the South African Republic. In 1878 and 1879 three British attacks were successfully repelled until [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Garnet Wolseley]] defeated Sekhukhune in November 1879 with an army of 2,000 British soldiers, Boers and 10,000 Swazis.

The [[Anglo-Zulu War]] was fought in 1879 between the British and the [[Zulu Kingdom]]. Following [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]]'s successful introduction of [[Canadian Confederation|federation in Canada]], it was thought that similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might succeed with the African kingdoms, tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa. In 1874, [[Henry Bartle Frere]] was sent to South Africa as the British [[High Commissioner for Southern Africa|High Commissioner]] to bring such plans into being. Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the Boers, and the Zululand army. The Zulu nation defeated the British at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]]. Eventually Zululand lost the war, resulting in the termination of the Zulu nation's independence.

===Boer Wars===
{{main|Boer Wars|First Boer War|Second Boer War}}
[[File:Battle of Majuba Hill.jpg|thumb| The [[Battle of Majuba Hill]] was the last decisive battle during the [[First Boer War]].]]
The Boer republics successfully resisted British encroachments during the [[First Boer War]] (1880–1881) using [[guerrilla warfare]] tactics, which were well-suited to local conditions. The British returned with greater numbers, more experience, and new strategy in the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902) and, although suffering heavy casualties due to Boer [[attrition warfare]], they were ultimately successful due in part to [[scorched earth]] tactics and [[Second Boer War concentration camps|concentration camps]], in which 27,000 Boer civilians died due to a combination of disease and neglect.

South Africa's urban population grew rapidly from the end of the 19th century onward. After the devastation of the wars, Boer farmers fled into [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] and Orange Free State cities and constituted a white urban poor class.

=== Independence ===
{{See also|Union of South Africa|Military history of South Africa during World War I|Military history of South Africa during World War II}}
Anti-British policies among white South Africans focused on independence. During the Dutch and British colonial years, [[racial segregation]] was mostly informal, though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of indigenous people, including the [[Native Location Act of 1879]] and the system of [[pass laws]].

Eight years after the end of the Second Boer War and after four years of negotiation, the [[South Africa Act 1909]] granted nominal independence while creating the [[Union of South Africa]] on 31 May 1910. The union was a [[dominion]] that included the former territories of the Cape, Transvaal and Natal colonies, as well as the Orange Free State republic. The [[Natives Land Act, 1913|Natives' Land Act]] of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks; at that stage they controlled only 7% of the country. The amount of land reserved for indigenous peoples was later marginally increased.

In 1931, the union became fully sovereign from the United Kingdom with the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], which abolished the last powers of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] to legislate in the country. Only three other African countries—Liberia, Ethiopia, and Egypt—had been independent prior to that point. In 1934, the [[South African Party]] and [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] merged to form the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]], seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking whites. In 1939, the party split over the entry of the union into World War II, as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which National Party followers opposed.

=== Apartheid era ===
{{Main|Apartheid}}
{{Further|Disinvestment from South Africa}}
[[File:DFMalanPortret.jpg|thumb|262x262px|[[D. F. Malan]], the first apartheid-era prime minister (1948–1954)]]
In 1948, the National Party was elected to power. It strengthened the racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule. Taking Canada's [[Indian Act]] as a framework, the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] government classified all peoples into three races (''Whites'', ''Blacks'', ''Indians and Coloured people (people of mixed race))'' and developed rights and limitations for each. The white minority (less than 20%) controlled the vastly larger black majority. The legally institutionalised segregation became known as ''[[apartheid]]''. While whites enjoyed the highest [[standard of living]] in all of Africa, comparable to [[First World]] Western nations, the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. The [[Freedom Charter]], adopted in 1955 by the [[Congress Alliance]], demanded a non-racial society and an end to discrimination.

On 31 May 1961, the country became a republic following [[1960 South African republic referendum|a referendum]] (only open to white voters) which narrowly passed; the British-dominated Natal province largely voted against the proposal. [[Elizabeth II]] lost the title [[Monarchy of South Africa|Queen of South Africa]], and the last [[Governor-General of South Africa|Governor-General]], [[C. R. Swart|Charles Robberts Swart]], became [[State President of South Africa|state president]]. As a concession to the [[Westminster system]], the appointment of the president remained by parliament and was virtually powerless until [[P. W. Botha]]'s [[South African Constitution of 1983|Constitution Act of 1983]], which eliminated the office of [[Prime Minister of South Africa|prime minister]] and instated a unique "strong presidency" [[Parliamentary system|responsible to parliament]]. Pressured by other [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries, South Africa withdrew from the organisation in 1961. It would rejoin it in 1994, after the end of apartheid.

Despite [[Internal resistance to apartheid|opposition to apartheid]] both within and outside the country, the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid. The security forces cracked down on internal dissent, and violence became widespread, with anti-apartheid organisations such as the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), the [[Azanian People's Organisation]], and the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania|Pan-Africanist Congress]] carrying out guerrilla warfare and urban sabotage. The three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional inter-factional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence. Apartheid became increasingly controversial, and several countries began to boycott business with the South African government because of its racial policies. The boycotts and restrictions were later extended to international sanctions and the [[Disinvestment from South Africa|divestment of holdings]] by foreign investors.

=== Post-apartheid ===
{{Further|History of South Africa (1994–present)}}
[[File:Frederik de Klerk with Nelson Mandela - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 1992.jpg|thumb|[[F. W. de Klerk|F.W. de Klerk]] and [[Nelson Mandela]] shake hands in January 1992.]]
The [[Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith]], signed by [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] and [[Harry Schwarz]] in 1974, enshrined the principles of [[peaceful transition of power]] and equality for all, the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in South Africa. Ultimately, [[F. W. de Klerk|F.W. de Klerk]] opened bilateral discussions with [[Nelson Mandela]] in 1993 for a transition of policies and government.

In 1990, the National Party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the ANC and other political organisations. It released Nelson Mandela from prison after 27 years of serving a sentence for sabotage. A [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|negotiation process]] followed. With approval from the white electorate in a [[1992 South African apartheid referendum|1992 referendum]], the government continued negotiations to end apartheid. South Africa held its first universal [[1994 South African general election|elections in 1994]], which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since. The country rejoined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and became a member of the [[Southern African Development Community]].

In post-apartheid ANC-governed South Africa, unemployment skyrocketed to over 30% and income inequality increased. While many black people have risen to middle or upper classes, the overall unemployment rate of black people worsened between 1994 and 2003 by official metrics but declined significantly using expanded definitions. Poverty among white South Africans, which was previously rare, increased. The government struggled to achieve the monetary and fiscal discipline to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. The United Nations [[Human Development Index]] rose steadily until the mid-1990s, then fell from 1995 to 2005 before recovering its 1995 peak in 2013. The fall is in large part attributable to the [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|South African HIV/AIDS pandemic]] which saw South African life expectancy fall from a high point of 62 years in 1992 to a low of 53 in 2005, and the failure of the government to take steps to address the pandemic in its early years.

In May 2008, riots left over 60 people dead. The [[Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions]] estimated that over 100,000 people were driven from their homes. The targets were mainly [[Immigration to South Africa|legal]] and [[Illegal immigration to South Africa|illegal migrants]], and refugees seeking asylum, but a third of the victims were South African citizens. The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UN High Commissioner for Refugees]] in 2008 reported that over 200,000 refugees applied for asylum in South Africa, almost four times as many as the year before. These people were mainly from [[Zimbabwe]], though many also come from [[Burundi]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Rwanda]], [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]].

On 14 February 2018, Jacob Zuma resigned the presidency. On 15 February, ANC president [[Cyril Ramaphosa]] became President of South Africa. On 16 March 2018, just over a month after [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Jacob Zuma]] resigned from the presidency, National Director of Public Prosecutions [[Shaun Abrahams]] announced that Zuma would again [[Jacob Zuma corruption charges|face prosecution]] on 16 criminal charges – 12 charges of fraud, two of corruption, and one each of racketeering and money laundering, just as in the 2006 indictment. A warrant was issued for his arrest in February 2020 after he failed to appear in court. In 2021, [[Jacob Zuma contempt of court|he was found guilty]] of [[contempt of court]] and sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment. In response, supporters of Zuma [[2021 South African unrest|engaged in protests]] which led to riots leaving 354 people dead.

South Africa went through a period of political and economic crisis since 2020, with some international institutions, businesses and political figures stating that the country is heading towards failed state status. Due to high unemployment, low business investment, de-industrialisation, political corruption, and [[state capture]]. The country has been undergoing an [[South African energy crisis|energy crisis]] since 2007, resulting in routine rolling electricity blackouts due to [[Rolling blackout|loadshedding]]. According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], South Africa is suffering from "massive corruption" and state capture. One of the main causes of instability in South Africa is [[land distribution]], black South Africans own 4% of the land despite making up 80% of the population, while white South Africans control 75% of [[Private property|privately owned land]]. This is a remnant of the apartheid [[Bantustan]] system where black Africans were forced into reservations. Since 1998, the South African government has settled 80,000 land claims from people who had been evicted from land by the previous government. In 90% of the land claim cases, people chose money instead of land.

The [[Zondo Commission]], established in 2018 in order to investigate allegations of corruption and state capture released its findings in 2022, found corruption at every level of government, including [[Transnet]], [[Eskom]], and [[Denel]], as well as [[Law enforcement in South Africa|law enforcement]]. It documented evidence of [[Corruption|systemic corruption]], [[fraud]], [[racketeering]], [[bribery]], [[money laundering]], and state capture. It investigated the [[African National Congress]] party and Jacob Zuma, whom it concluded were complicit in state capture through their direct assistance to the [[Gupta family]].

South Africa has maintained a position of neutrality in regards to the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russia invasion of Ukraine]] in 2022 and the [[Russo-Ukrainian War|ongoing war]]. On 29 December 2023, South Africa formally submitted [[South Africa's genocide case against Israel|its case]] to the [[International Court of Justice]] regarding [[Israel]]'s conduct in the [[Gaza Strip]] as part of the [[Gaza war]], alleging that Israel had committed and was committing [[Palestinian genocide accusation|genocide against Palestinians]] in the Gaza Strip.

Following the [[2024 South African general election|2024 general elections]], the African National Congress saw its share of the national vote fall below 50% for the first time since the end of Apartheid, though it remained the single largest party in the South African Parliament. President Ramaphosa announced a [[national unity government]], the first since the [[Cabinet of Nelson Mandela]], and entered a deal with the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]], the previous main opposition party, and other minor parties. Ramaphosa was reelected for a second term in office by the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] against the leader of the [[Economic Freedom Fighters]], [[Julius Malema]].
