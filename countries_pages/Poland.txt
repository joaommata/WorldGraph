[[File:Biskupin brama od zewnatrz.jpg|thumb|right|A reconstruction of a [[Bronze Age]] [[Lusatian culture]] settlement in [[Biskupin]], 8th century BC]]

The first [[Stone Age]] archaic humans and ''[[Homo erectus]]'' species settled what was to become Poland approximately 500,000 years ago, though the ensuing hostile climate prevented early humans from founding more permanent encampments. The arrival of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and [[Early European modern humans|anatomically modern humans]] coincided with the climatic discontinuity at the end of the [[Last Glacial Period]] ([[Weichselian glaciation|Northern Polish glaciation]] 10,000 BC), when Poland became habitable. [[Neolithic]] excavations indicated broad-ranging development in that era; the earliest evidence of European cheesemaking (5500 BC) was discovered in Polish [[Kuyavia]], and the [[Bronocice pot]] is incised with the earliest known depiction of what may be a wheeled vehicle (3400 BC).

The period spanning the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Early Iron Age]] (1300 BC–500 BC) was marked by an increase in population density, establishment of [[palisade]]d settlements ([[Gord (archaeology)|gords]]) and the expansion of [[Lusatian culture]]. A significant archaeological find from [[Prehistory and protohistory of Poland|the protohistory of Poland]] is a fortified settlement at [[Biskupin]], attributed to the Lusatian culture of the [[Late Bronze Age]] (mid-8th century BC).

Throughout [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] (400 BC–500 AD), many distinct ancient populations inhabited the territory of present-day Poland, notably [[Celts|Celtic]], [[Scythia]]n, [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]], [[Balts|Baltic]] and [[Early Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. Furthermore, archaeological findings confirmed the presence of [[Roman Legions]] sent to protect the [[Amber Road|amber trade]]. The [[Polish tribes]] emerged following the [[Migration Period#Second wave|second wave of the Migration Period]] around the 6th century AD; Beginning in the early 10th century, the [[Polans (western)|Polans]] would come to dominate other [[Lechites|Lechitic]] tribes in the region, initially forming a tribal federation and later a centralised monarchical state.

=== Kingdom of Poland ===
{{Main|History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Baptism of Poland|Kingdom of Poland}}
[[File:Poland960.png|thumb|left|Poland under the rule of Duke [[Mieszko I]], whose acceptance of Christianity under the auspices of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Church]] and the [[Baptism of Poland]] marked the beginning of statehood in 966. His son, [[Bolesław I the Brave]], was crowned [[King of Poland|king]] in 1025]]

Poland began to form into a recognisable unitary and territorial entity around the middle of the 10th century under the [[Piast dynasty]]. In 966, the ruler of the Polans, [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], accepted Christianity under the auspices of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Church]] with the [[Baptism of Poland]]. In 968, a missionary [[bishopric]] was established in [[Poznań]]. An [[incipit]] titled [[Dagome iudex]] first defined Poland's geographical boundaries with its capital in [[Gniezno]] and affirmed that its monarchy was under the protection of the [[Apostolic See]]. The country's early origins were described by [[Gallus Anonymus]] in {{Lang|la|[[Gesta principum Polonorum]]}}, the oldest Polish chronicle. An important national event of the period was the [[martyrdom]] of [[Adalbert of Prague|Saint Adalbert]], who was killed by [[Old Prussians|Prussian]] pagans in 997 and whose remains were reputedly bought back for their weight in gold by Mieszko's successor, [[Bolesław I the Brave]]. Also, Otto bestowed upon Bolesław royal [[regalia]] and a replica of the [[Holy Lance]], which were later used at his coronation as the first [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]] {{Circa|1025}}, when Bolesław received permission for his coronation from [[Pope John XIX]]. Bolesław also expanded the realm considerably by seizing parts of German [[Lusatia]], Czech [[Moravia]], [[Upper Hungary]], and southwestern regions of the [[Kievan Rus']].

[[File:Casimir the Great by Leopold Löffler.PNG|thumb|upright|right|[[Casimir III the Great]] is the only Polish king to receive the title of ''Great''. He built extensively during his reign, and reformed the Polish army along with the country's legal code, 1333–1370.]]

The transition from [[Slavic paganism|paganism]] in Poland was not instantaneous and resulted in the [[Pagan reaction in Poland|pagan reaction of the 1030s]]. In 1031, [[Mieszko II Lambert]] lost the title of king and fled amidst the violence. The unrest led to the transfer of the capital to Kraków in 1038 by [[Casimir I the Restorer]]. In 1076, [[Bolesław II the Generous|Bolesław II]] re-instituted the office of king, but was banished in 1079 for murdering his opponent, [[Stanislaus of Szczepanów|Bishop Stanislaus]]. In 1138, the country [[Testament of Bolesław III Wrymouth|fragmented]] into five principalities when [[Bolesław III Wrymouth]] divided his lands among his sons. In 1226, [[Konrad I of Masovia]] invited the [[Teutonic Knights]] to aid in combating the [[Balts|Baltic]] Prussians; a decision that later led to centuries of warfare with the Knights.

In the first half of the 13th century, [[Henry I the Bearded]] and [[Henry II the Pious]] aimed to unite the fragmented dukedoms, but the [[First Mongol invasion of Poland|Mongol invasion]] and the death of Henry II in [[Battle of Legnica|battle]] hindered the unification. As a result of the devastation which followed, depopulation and the demand for craft labour spurred a migration of [[History of Germans in Poland|German and Flemish settlers]] into Poland, which was encouraged by the Polish dukes. In 1264, the [[Statute of Kalisz]] introduced unprecedented autonomy for the [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]], who came to Poland fleeing persecution elsewhere in Europe.

In 1320, [[Władysław I the Elbow-high|Władysław I the Short]] became the first king of [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|a reunified Poland]] since [[Przemysł II]] in 1296, and the first to be crowned at [[Wawel Cathedral]] in Kraków. Beginning in 1333, the reign of [[Casimir III the Great]] was marked by developments in [[Trail of the Eagle's Nests|castle infrastructure]], army, judiciary and [[Congress of Kraków|diplomacy]]. Under his authority, Poland transformed into a major European power; he instituted Polish rule over [[Kingdom of Ruthenia|Ruthenia]] in 1340 and imposed quarantine that prevented the spread of [[Black Death]]. In 1364, Casimir inaugurated the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Kraków]], one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in Europe. Upon his death in 1370, the Piast dynasty came to an end. He was succeeded by his closest male relative, [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis of Anjou]], who ruled Poland, [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], and [[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|Croatia]] in a [[personal union]]. Louis' younger daughter [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] became Poland's first female monarch in 1384. The partnership between Poles and Lithuanians brought the vast multi-ethnic [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] territories into Poland's sphere of influence and proved beneficial for its inhabitants, who coexisted in one of the largest European [[personal union|political entities]] of the time.

In the Baltic Sea region, the struggle of Poland and Lithuania with the [[Teutonic Knights]] continued and culminated at the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410, where a combined Polish-Lithuanian army inflicted a decisive victory against them. In 1493, [[John I Albert]] sanctioned the creation of a [[bicameral parliament]] (the Sejm) composed of a lower house, the chamber of deputies, and an upper house, the chamber of senators. The ''[[Nihil novi]]'' act adopted by the Polish [[General Sejm]] in 1505, transferred most of the [[legislature|legislative power]] from the monarch to the parliament, an event which marked the beginning of the period known as [[Golden Liberty]], when the state was ruled by the seemingly free and equal [[szlachta|Polish nobles]].

[[File:Wawel (4).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Wawel Castle]] in [[Kraków]], seat of [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish kings]] from 1038 until the capital was moved to [[Warsaw]] in 1596]]

The 16th century saw [[Protestant Reformation]] movements making deep inroads into Polish Christianity, which resulted in the establishment of policies promoting religious tolerance, unique in Europe at that time. In Poland, [[Nontrinitarianism|Nontrinitarian Christianity]] became the doctrine of the so-called [[Polish Brethren]], who separated from their [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] denomination and became the co-founders of global [[Unitarianism]].

The European [[Renaissance]] evoked under [[Sigismund I the Old]] and [[Sigismund II Augustus]] a sense of urgency in the need to promote a [[Renaissance in Poland|cultural awakening]]. During the [[Polish Golden Age]], the nation's economy and culture flourished. The Italian-born [[Bona Sforza]], daughter of the [[Gian Galeazzo Sforza|Duke of Milan]] and queen consort to Sigismund I, made considerable contributions to [[Architecture of Poland|architecture]], [[Polish cuisine|cuisine]], language and court customs at [[Wawel Castle]]. The latter coincided with a period of prosperity. The Polish-dominated union thereafter became a leading power and a major cultural entity, exercising political control over parts of Central, [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]], [[Southeastern Europe|Southeastern]] and Northern Europe. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth occupied approximately {{convert|1|e6km2|sqmi|abbr=unit}} [[Truce of Deulino|at its peak]] and was the largest state in Europe. Simultaneously, Poland imposed [[Polonisation]] policies in newly acquired territories which were met with resistance from ethnic and religious minorities. When he left Poland to become [[List of French monarchs|King of France]], his successor, [[Stephen Báthory]], led a successful [[Livonian campaign of Stephen Báthory|campaign]] in the [[Livonian War]], granting Poland more [[Livonia|lands across the eastern shores]] of the Baltic Sea. State affairs were then headed by [[Jan Zamoyski]], the [[Chancellor (Poland)|Crown Chancellor]]. Stephen's successor, [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]], defeated a rival [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] electoral candidate, [[Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Maximilian III]], in the [[War of the Polish Succession (1587–1588)]]. In 1592, Sigismund succeeded his father [[John III of Sweden|John Vasa]], in [[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]]. The [[Polish-Swedish union]] endured until 1599, when he was [[War against Sigismund|deposed]] by the Swedes.

In 1609, Sigismund [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–1618)|invaded]] [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]] which was engulfed in a [[Time of Troubles|civil war]], Sigismund's long reign in Poland coincided with the [[Sigismund III Vasa#Legacy|Silver Age]]. The liberal [[Władysław IV Vasa|Władysław IV]] effectively defended Poland's territorial possessions but after his death the vast Commonwealth began declining from internal disorder and constant warfare.

In 1648, the Polish hegemony over Ukraine sparked the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], followed by the decimating [[Deluge (history)|Swedish Deluge]] during the [[Second Northern War]], and Prussia's [[Treaty of Bromberg|independence]] in 1657. The [[House of Wettin|Saxon]] era, under [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus II]] and [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]], saw neighboring powers grow in strength at the expense of Poland. Both Saxon kings faced opposition from [[Stanisław Leszczyński]] during the [[Great Northern War]] (1700) and the [[War of the Polish Succession]] (1733).

=== Partitions ===
{{Main|History of Poland (1795–1918)|Partitions of Poland}}
[[File:Stanisław II August Poniatowski in coronation clothes.PNG|thumb|upright|right|[[Stanisław II Augustus]], the last [[King of Poland]], reigned from 1764 until his abdication on 25 November 1795.]]

The [[Royal elections in Poland|royal election]] of 1764 resulted in the elevation of [[Stanisław August Poniatowski|Stanisław II Augustus Poniatowski]] to the monarchy. His candidacy was extensively funded by his sponsor and former lover, Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]]. The new king maneuvered between his desire to implement necessary modernising reforms, and the necessity to remain at peace with surrounding states. His ideals led to the formation of the 1768 [[Bar Confederation]], a rebellion directed against the Poniatowski and all external influence, which ineptly aimed to preserve Poland's sovereignty and privileges held by the nobility. The failed attempts at government restructuring as well as the domestic turmoil provoked its neighbours to invade.

In 1772, the [[First Partition of Poland|First Partition of the Commonwealth]] by Prussia, Russia, and Austria took place, an act which the [[Partition Sejm]], under considerable duress, eventually ratified as a [[List of French words and phrases used by English speakers#F|fait accompli]]. Corporal punishment of schoolchildren was officially prohibited in 1783. Poniatowski was the head figure of the [[Polish Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], encouraged the development of industries, and embraced republican [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]]. For his contributions to the arts and sciences, he was awarded a [[Fellowship of the Royal Society]].

In 1791, the [[Great Sejm|Great Sejm parliament]] adopted the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|3 May Constitution]], the first set of supreme national laws, and introduced a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The [[Targowica Confederation]], an organisation of nobles and deputies opposing the act, appealed to Catherine and caused the [[Polish–Russian War of 1792|1792 Polish–Russian War]]. Fearing the reemergence of Polish hegemony, Russia and Prussia arranged and, in 1793, executed the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second Partition]], which left the country deprived of territory and incapable of independent existence. On 24 October 1795, the Commonwealth was [[Third Partition of Poland|partitioned for the third time]] and ceased to exist as a territorial entity. Stanisław Augustus, the last King of Poland, abdicated the throne on 25 November 1795.

=== Era of insurrections ===
{{Main|Austrian Partition|Prussian Partition|Russian Partition}}
[[File:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 3.png|thumb|right|upright=1.3|The [[partitions of Poland]], carried out by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (''blue''), the [[Russian Empire]] (''brown''), and the [[Habsburg monarchy|Austrian Habsburg Monarchy]] (''green'') in [[First Partition of Poland|1772]], [[Second Partition of Poland|1793]] and [[Third Partition of Poland|1795]]]]

The Polish people [[List of wars involving Poland|rose several times against the partitioners]] and occupying armies. An unsuccessful attempt at defending Poland's sovereignty took place in the 1794 [[Kościuszko Uprising]], where a popular and distinguished general [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]], who had several years earlier served under [[George Washington]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]], led Polish insurgents. Despite the victory at the [[Battle of Racławice]], his ultimate defeat ended Poland's independent existence [[Third Partition of Poland|for 123 years]].

In 1806, an [[Greater Poland uprising (1806)|insurrection]] organised by [[Jan Henryk Dąbrowski]] liberated western Poland ahead of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s advance into Prussia during the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]]. In accordance with the 1807 [[Treaty of Tilsit]], Napoleon proclaimed the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a [[client state]] ruled by his ally [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony]]. The Poles actively aided French troops in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], particularly those under [[Józef Poniatowski]] who became [[Marshal of the Empire|Marshal of France]] shortly before his death at [[Battle of Leipzig|Leipzig]] in 1813. In the aftermath of Napoleon's exile, the Duchy of Warsaw was abolished at the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 and its territory was divided into Russian [[Congress Kingdom of Poland]], the Prussian [[Grand Duchy of Posen]], and [[Austrian Poland|Austrian Galicia]] with the [[Free City of Kraków]].

{{Annotated image |float=left |width=150 |height=160 |image=Karl G Schweikart - Tadeusz Kościuszko (ÖaL).jpg|caption=[[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] was a veteran and hero of both the [[Polish–Russian War of 1792|Polish]] and [[American Revolutionary War|American]] wars of independence. After its collapse, Congress Poland lost its [[Constitution of Congress Poland|constitutional autonomy]], [[Army of Congress Poland|army]] and legislative assembly. During the [[Spring of Nations|European Spring of Nations]], Poles took up arms in the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|Greater Poland Uprising of 1848]] to resist [[Germanisation]], but its failure saw duchy's status reduced to a mere [[Province of Posen|province]]; and subsequent integration into the [[German Empire]] in 1871. In Russia, the fall of the [[January Uprising]] (1863–1864) prompted severe [[January Uprising#The decades of reprisals|political, social and cultural reprisals]], followed by deportations and [[pogroms]] of the Polish-Jewish population. Towards the end of the 19th century, Congress Poland became heavily industrialised; its primary exports being coal, [[zinc]], iron and textiles.

=== Second Polish Republic ===
{{Main|History of Poland (1918–1939)|Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Second Polish Republic}}
[[File:Józef Piłsudski (-1930).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Naczelnik państwa|Chief of State]] Marshal [[Józef Piłsudski]] was a hero of the Polish independence campaign and the nation's premiere statesman from 1918 until his death on 12 May 1935.]]
In the aftermath of [[World War I]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] agreed on the reconstitution of Poland, confirmed through the [[Treaty of Versailles]] of June 1919. A total of 2 million Polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers, and over 450,000 died. Following the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice with Germany]] in November 1918, Poland regained its independence as the [[Second Polish Republic]].

The Second Polish Republic reaffirmed its sovereignty after [[List of wars involving Poland|a series of military conflicts]], most notably the [[Polish–Soviet War]], when Poland inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[Red Army]] at the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]].

The inter-war period heralded a new era of Polish politics. Whilst Polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until [[World War I]], a new political tradition was established in the country. Many exiled Polish activists, such as [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], who would later become prime minister, returned home. A significant number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures. Tragedy struck in 1922 when [[Gabriel Narutowicz]], inaugural holder of the presidency, was assassinated at the [[Zachęta]] Gallery in Warsaw by a painter and right-wing nationalist [[Eligiusz Niewiadomski]]. By the late 1930s, due to increased threats posed by political extremism inside the country, the Polish government became increasingly heavy-handed, banning a number of radical organisations, including communist and ultra-nationalist political parties, which threatened the stability of the country.

=== World War II ===
{{Main|History of Poland (1939–1945)|Invasion of Poland|Military history of Poland during World War II|War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II}}
[[File:7TP Polish Tank.png|thumb|left|[[Polish Armed Forces (Second Polish Republic)|Polish Army]] [[7TP]] tanks on military manoeuvres shortly before the [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939]]

World War II began with the [[Nazi German]] [[invasion of Poland]] on 1 September 1939, followed by the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] on 17 September. On 28 September 1939, [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|Warsaw fell]]. As agreed in the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], Poland was split into two zones, [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|one occupied by Nazi Germany]], the other by [[territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]]. In 1939–1941, the Soviets deported hundreds of thousands of Poles. The Soviet [[NKVD]] executed thousands of Polish prisoners of war (among other incidents in the [[Katyn massacre]]) ahead of [[Operation Barbarossa]].

Poland made the fourth-largest troop contribution in Europe, [[Polish Cipher Bureau|Polish code breakers]] were responsible for [[cryptanalysis of the Enigma|cracking the Enigma cipher]] and Polish scientists participating in the [[Manhattan Project]] were co-creators of the American [[atomic bomb]]. In the east, the Soviet-backed [[First Polish Army (1944–1945)|Polish 1st Army]] distinguished itself in the battles for [[Warsaw Uprising|Warsaw]] and [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin]]. Altogether, 3 million Polish Jews – approximately 90% of Poland's pre-war Jewry – and between 1.8 and 2.8 million ethnic Poles were killed during the German [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupation of Poland]], including between 50,000 and 100,000 members of the Polish [[intelligentsia]] – academics, doctors, lawyers, nobility and priesthood. During the Warsaw Uprising alone, over 150,000 Polish civilians were killed, most were murdered by the Germans during the [[Wola massacre|Wola]] and [[Ochota massacre|Ochota]] massacres. Around 150,000 Polish civilians were killed by Soviets between 1939 and 1941 during the Soviet Union's occupation of eastern Poland ([[Kresy]]), and another estimated 100,000 Poles were murdered by the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA) between 1943 and 1944 in what became known as the [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia|Wołyń Massacres]]. [[World War II casualties|Of all the countries]] in the war, Poland lost the highest percentage of its citizens: around 6 million perished – more than one-sixth of Poland's pre-war population – [[Holocaust in Poland|half of them]] Polish Jews. About 90% of deaths were non-military in nature.

In 1945, Poland's borders [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|were shifted westwards]]. Over two million Polish inhabitants of [[Kresy]] [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)|were expelled]] along the [[Curzon Line]] by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]. The western border became the [[Oder-Neisse line]]. As a result, Poland's territory was reduced by 20%, or {{convert|77500|km2|sqmi}}. The shift forced the migration of [[World War II evacuation and expulsion|millions of other people]], most of whom were Poles, Germans, Ukrainians, and Jews. In 1944, Stalin had made guarantees to [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] that he would maintain Poland's sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place. However, upon achieving victory in 1945, the elections organised by the occupying Soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of legitimacy for Soviet hegemony over Polish affairs. The Soviet Union instituted a new [[communist state|communist]] government in Poland, analogous to much of the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. [[Anti-Communism in the Communist Bloc|As elsewhere in Communist Europe]], the Soviet influence over Poland was met with [[Cursed soldiers|armed resistance]] from the outset which continued into the 1950s.

Despite widespread objections, the new Polish government accepted the Soviet annexation of the pre-war eastern regions of Poland

The new communist government took control with the adoption of the [[Small Constitution of 1947|Small Constitution]] on 19 February 1947. The [[Polish People's Republic]] (''Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa'') [[Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland|was officially proclaimed in 1952]]. In 1956, after the death of [[Bolesław Bierut]], the régime of [[Władysław Gomułka]] became temporarily more liberal, freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms. [[Collectivization in the Polish People's Republic|Collectivisation in the Polish People's Republic]] failed. A similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under [[Edward Gierek]], but most of the time persecution of [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944–1989)|anti-communist opposition]] groups persisted. Despite this, Poland was at the time considered to be one of the least oppressive states of the Eastern Bloc. Despite persecution and imposition of [[Martial law in Poland|martial law in 1981]] by General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], it eroded the dominance of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] and by 1989 had triumphed in Poland's first [[Contract Sejm|partially free and democratic parliamentary elections]] since the end of the Second World War. [[Lech Wałęsa]], a Solidarity candidate, eventually [[1990 Polish presidential election|won the presidency in 1990]]. The Solidarity movement heralded the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of communist regimes and parties across Europe]].

=== Third Polish Republic ===
{{Main|History of Poland (1989–present)}}
[[File:Flowers in front of the Presidential Palace in Warsaw.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|Flowers in front of the [[Presidential Palace, Warsaw|Presidential Palace]] following the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|death of Poland's top government officials]] in a plane crash on 10 April 2010]]
A [[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]] programme, initiated by [[Leszek Balcerowicz]] in the early 1990s, enabled the country to transform its [[Soviet-style socialism|Soviet-style]] [[planned economy]] into a [[market economy]]. As with other [[post-communism|post-communist countries]], Poland suffered temporary declines in social, economic, and living standards, but it became the first post-communist country to reach its pre-1989 [[Gross domestic product|GDP levels]] as early as 1995, although the unemployment rate increased. Poland became a member of the [[Visegrád Group]] in 1991, and joined [[NATO]] in 1999. Poles then voted to join the [[European Union]] in [[2003 Polish European Union membership referendum|a referendum]] in June 2003, with [[Poland in the European Union|Poland becoming a full member]] on 1 May 2004, following the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|consequent enlargement of the union]].

Poland joined the [[Schengen Area]] in 2007, as a result of which, [[Borders of Poland|the country's borders]] with other member states of the European Union were dismantled, allowing for [[Freedom of movement#European Union|full freedom of movement]] within most of the European Union.

In 2011, the ruling [[Civic Platform]] won [[2011 Polish parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]]. In 2014, the [[Prime Minister of Poland]], [[Donald Tusk]], was chosen to be [[President of the European Council]], and resigned as prime minister. The [[2015 Polish parliamentary election|2015]] and [[2019 Polish parliamentary election|2019 elections]] were won by the national-conservative [[Law and Justice]] Party (PiS) led by [[Jarosław Kaczyński]], resulting in increased [[Euroscepticism]] and [[Polish constitutional crisis|increased friction]] with the European Union. In December 2017, [[Mateusz Morawiecki]] was sworn in as the Prime Minister, succeeding [[Beata Szydło|Beata Szydlo]], in office since 2015. President [[Andrzej Duda]], supported by Law and Justice party, was re-elected in the 2020 presidential [[2020 Polish presidential election|election]].

{{As of|November 2023}}, the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]] had led to 17 million [[Ukrainian refugee crisis|Ukrainian refugees]] crossing the border to Poland. {{As of|November 2023}}, 0.9 million of those had stayed in Poland.
