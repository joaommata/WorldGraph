Excavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world. An important site of early historical activities, many believe that Afghanistan compares to [[Egypt]] in the historical value of its archaeological sites. Artifacts typical of the [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]], and [[Iron Age]]s have been found in Afghanistan. Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of [[Mundigak]] (near [[Kandahar]] in the south of the country) was a center of the [[Helmand culture]]. More recent findings established that the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] stretched up towards modern-day Afghanistan. An Indus Valley site has been found on the [[Oxus River]] at [[Shortugai]] in northern Afghanistan.

After 2000 BCE successive waves of semi-nomadic people from Central Asia began moving south into Afghanistan; among them were many [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]-speaking [[Indo-Iranians]]. These tribes later migrated further into South Asia, Western Asia, and toward Europe via the area north of the [[Caspian Sea]]. The region at the time was referred to as [[Ariana]]. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenids overthrew the [[Medes]] and incorporated [[Arachosia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]], and [[Bactria]] within its eastern boundaries. An [[Epigraphy|inscription]] on the tombstone of [[Darius I of Persia]] mentions the [[Kabulistan|Kabul Valley]] in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered. The region of [[Arachosia]], around [[Kandahar]] in modern-day southern Afghanistan, used to be primarily Zoroastrian and played a key role in the transfer of the Avesta to [[Persis|Persia]] and is thus considered by some to be the "second homeland of Zoroastrianism".

[[Alexander the Great]] and his Macedonian forces arrived in Afghanistan in 330 BCE after defeating [[Darius III of Persia]] a year earlier in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]]. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the [[Seleucid Empire]] controlled the region until 305 BCE, when they gave much of it to the [[Maurya Empire]] as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans controlled the area south of the [[Hindu Kush]] until they were overthrown in about 185 BCE. Their decline began 60 years after [[Ashoka]]'s rule ended, leading to the [[Hellenistic]] reconquest by the [[Greco-Bactrians]]. Much of it soon broke away and became part of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. They were defeated and expelled by the [[Indo-Scythians]] in the late 2nd century BCE.{{sfn|Runion|2007|page=44}}
The [[Silk Road]] appeared during the first century BCE, and Afghanistan flourished with trade, with routes to China, India, Persia, and north to the cities of [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]], and [[Khiva]] in present-day Uzbekistan. Goods and ideas were exchanged at this center point, such as Chinese silk, Persian silver and Roman gold, while the region of present Afghanistan was mining and trading [[lapis lazuli]] stones mainly from the [[Badakhshan]] region.

During the first century BCE, the [[Parthian Empire]] subjugated the region but lost it to their [[Indo-Parthian]] vassals. In the mid-to-late first century CE the vast [[Kushan Empire]], centered in Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture, making [[Buddhism]] flourish throughout the region. The Kushans were overthrown by the [[Sassanids]] in the 3rd century CE, though the [[Indo-Sassanids]] continued to rule at least parts of the region. They were followed by the [[Kidarite]]s who, in turn, was replaced by the [[Hephthalites]]. They were replaced by the [[Turk Shahi]] in the 7th century. The Buddhist Turk Shahi of Kabul was replaced by a Hindu dynasty before the Saffarids conquered the area in 870, this Hindu dynasty was called [[Hindu Shahi]]. Much of the northeastern and southern areas of the country remained dominated by [[Buddhist]] culture.

===Medieval period===
{{Main|Muslim conquests of Afghanistan|Mongol campaigns in Central Asia|Ghaznavid campaigns in India}}
[[File:Ghurid Empire according to Schwartzberg Atlas, p.147.png|thumb|right|The [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurids]] originated from [[Ghor Province]] in central Afghanistan.]]

[[Arab]] [[Muslim]]s brought Islam to [[Herat]] and [[Zaranj]] in 642&nbsp;CE and began spreading eastward; some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted. Before the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|arrival of Islam]], the region used to be home to various beliefs and cults, often resulting in [[Syncretism]] between the dominant religions such as [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Buddhism]] or [[Greco-Buddhism]], [[Ancient Iranian religion]]s, [[Hinduism]], Christianity, and Judaism. An exemplification of the syncretism in the region would be that people were patrons of Buddhism but still worshipped local Iranian gods such as [[Ahura Mazda]], [[Nana (Kushan goddess)|Lady Nana]], [[Anahita]] or [[Mithra|Mihr (Mithra)]] and portrayed [[Greek mythology|Greek gods]] as protectors of Buddha. The [[Zunbils]] and Kabul Shahi were first conquered in 870&nbsp;CE by the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarid]] Muslims of Zaranj. Later, the [[Samanids]] extended their Islamic influence south of the Hindu Kush. The [[Ghaznavids]] rose to power in the 10th century.

By the 11th century, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] had defeated the remaining Hindu rulers and effectively [[Islamized]] the wider region,{{sfn|Ewans|2002|page=22–23}} with the exception of [[Kafiristan]]. Mahmud made [[Ghazni]] into an important city and patronized intellectuals such as the historian [[Al-Biruni]] and the poet [[Ferdowsi]]. The [[Ghaznavid dynasty]] was [[Siege of Lahore (1186)|overthrown by the Ghurids in 1186]], whose architectural achievements included the remote [[Minaret of Jam]]. The Ghurids controlled Afghanistan for less than a century before being conquered by the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] in 1215.{{sfn|Ewans|2002|page=23}}

[[File:Genghis Khan empire-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Mongol invasions and conquests]]]]

In 1219 CE, [[Genghis Khan]] and his [[Mongol invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire|Mongol army overran the region]]. His troops are said to have annihilated the Khwarazmian cities of [[Herat]] and [[Balkh]] as well as [[Siege of Bamyan|Bamyan]]. The destruction caused by the Mongols forced many locals to return to an agrarian rural society. Mongol rule continued with the [[Ilkhanate]] in the northwest while the [[Khalji dynasty]] administered the Afghan tribal areas south of the Hindu Kush until the invasion of [[Timur]] (aka Tamerlane), who established the [[Timurid Empire]] in 1370. Under the rule of [[Shah Rukh]], the city of Herat served as the focal point of the [[Timurid Renaissance]], whose glory matched [[Florence]] of the [[Italian Renaissance]] as the center of a cultural rebirth.

In the early 16th century [[Babur]] arrived from [[Ferghana]] and captured Kabul from the [[Arghun dynasty]].{{sfn|Barfield|2012|pp=92–93}} [[Babur]] would go on to conquer the Afghan [[Lodi dynasty]] who had ruled the Delhi Sultanate in the [[First Battle of Panipat]].{{sfn|Barfield|2012|pp=75}} Between the 16th and 18th century, the Uzbek [[Khanate of Bukhara]], Iranian [[Safavids]], and Indian [[Mughals]] ruled parts of the territory.{{sfn|Dupree|1997|pp=319, 321}} During the medieval period, the northwestern area of Afghanistan was referred to by the regional name [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], which was commonly used up to the 19th century among natives to describe their country.

===Hotak dynasty===
{{Main|Hotak dynasty}}
[[File:Mapofthehotaks1728.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Map of the Hotak Empire at its height in 1728, disputed between [[Hussain Hotak]] (centered in Kandahar) and [[Ashraf Hotak]] (centered in Isfahan)]]

In 1709, [[Mirwais Hotak]], a local [[Ghilzai]] tribal leader, successfully rebelled against the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]]. He defeated [[Gurgin Khan]], the Georgian governor of Kandahar under the Safavids, and established his own kingdom. Mirwais died in 1715, and was succeeded by his brother [[Abdul Aziz Hotak|Abdul Aziz]], who was soon killed by Mirwais's son [[Mahmud Hotak|Mahmud]] for possibly planning to sign a peace with the Safavids. Mahmud led the Afghan army in 1722 to the Persian capital of [[Isfahan]], and captured the city after the [[Battle of Gulnabad]] and proclaimed himself King of Persia. The Afghan dynasty was ousted from Persia by [[Nader Shah]] after the 1729 [[Battle of Damghan (1729)|Battle of Damghan]].

In 1738, [[Nader Shah]] and his [[Afsharid dynasty|forces]] captured Kandahar in the [[siege of Kandahar]], the last Hotak stronghold, from Shah [[Hussain Hotak]]. Soon after, the Persian and Afghan forces [[Nader Shah's invasion of India|invaded India]], Nader Shah had plundered Delhi, alongside his 16-year-old commander, [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] who had assisted him on these campaigns. Nader Shah was assassinated in 1747.

===Durrani Empire===
{{Main|Durrani Empire|Ahmad Shah Durrani}}

After the death of Nader Shah in 1747, [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] had returned to Kandahar with a contingent of 4,000 [[Pashtuns]]. The Abdalis had "unanimously accepted" Ahmad Shah as their new leader. With his ascension in 1747, Ahmad Shah had led multiple campaigns against the [[Mughal empire]], [[Maratha empire]], and then-receding [[Afsharid Iran|Afsharid empire]]. Ahmad Shah had captured [[Kabul]] and [[Peshawar]] from the Mughal appointed governor, Nasir Khan. Ahmad Shah had then conquered [[Herat]] in 1750, and had also captured [[Kashmir]] in 1752. Ahmad Shah had launched two campaigns into [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], 1750–1751 and 1754–1755. His first campaign had seen the siege of [[Mashhad]], however, he was forced to retreat after four months. In November 1750, he moved to siege [[Khanate of Nishapur|Nishapur]], but he was unable to capture the city and was forced to retreat in early 1751. [[Durrani Campaign to Khorasan (1754-55)|Ahmad Shah returned in 1754]]; he captured [[Ferdows|Tun]], and on 23 July, he sieged [[Mashhad]] once again. Mashhad had fallen on 2 December, but [[Shahrokh Shah|Shahrokh]] was [[Afsharid Iran|reappointed]] in 1755. He was forced to give up [[Torshiz]], [[Bakharz]], [[Torbat-e Jam|Jam]], [[Khaf, Iran|Khaf]], and [[Torbat-e Heydarieh|Turbat-e Haidari]] to the Afghans, as well as accept Afghan sovereignty. Following this, Ahmad Shah sieged [[Khanate of Nishapur|Nishapur]] once again, and captured it.

Ahmad Shah [[Indian campaign of Ahmad Shah Durrani|invaded India eight times]] during his reign,{{sfn|Mehta|p=248}} beginning in 1748. Crossing the Indus River, his armies sacked and absorbed [[Lahore]] into the [[Durrani Empire|Durrani Realm]]. He met Mughal armies at the [[Battle of Manupur (1748)]], where he was defeated and forced to retreat back to Afghanistan. He returned the next year in 1749 and captured the area around [[Lahore]] and [[Punjab]], presenting it as an Afghan victory for this campaign.{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=122–123}} From 1749 to 1767, Ahmad Shah led six more invasions, the most important being the last; the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] created a power vacuum in northern India, halting [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] expansion.

[[File:Portrait of Ahmad-Shah Durrani. Mughal miniature. ca. 1757, Bibliothèque nationale de France.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] {{Circa|1757}}]]

Ahmad Shah Durrani died in October 1772, and a civil war over succession followed, with his named successor, [[Timur Shah Durrani]], succeeding him after the defeat of his brother, Suleiman Mirza.{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=149}} Timur Shah Durrani ascended to the throne in November 1772, having defeated a coalition under Shah Wali Khan and Humayun Mirza. Timur Shah began his reign by consolidating power toward himself and people loyal to him, purging Durrani Sardars and influential tribal leaders in [[Kabul]] and [[Kandahar]]. One of Timur Shah's reforms was to move the capital of the [[Durrani Empire]] from [[Kandahar]] to [[Kabul]]. Timur Shah fought multiple series of rebellions to consolidate the empire, and he also led campaigns into [[Punjab]] against the Sikhs like his father, though more successfully. The most prominent example of his battles during this campaign was when he led his forces under Zangi Khan Durrani – with over 18,000 men total of Afghan, Qizilbash, and Mongol cavalrymen – against over 60,000 Sikh men. The Sikhs lost over 30,000 in this battle and staged a Durrani resurgence in the [[Punjab]] region. The Durranis lost [[Multan]] in 1772 after Ahmad Shah's death. Following this victory, Timur Shah was able to lay siege to [[Multan]] and recapture it, incorporating it into the Durrani Empire once again, reintegrating it as a province until the [[Siege of Multan (1818)]]. Timur Shah was succeeded by his son [[Zaman Shah Durrani]] after his death in May 1793. Timur Shah's reign oversaw the attempted stabilization and consolidation of the empire. However, Timur Shah had over 24 sons, which plunged the empire in civil war over succession crises.{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=155}}

[[Zaman Shah Durrani]] succeeded to the [[Durrani Empire|Durrani Throne]] following the death of his father, Timur Shah Durrani. His brothers [[Mahmud Shah Durrani]] and Humayun Mirza revolted against him, with Humayun centered in [[Kandahar]] and Mahmud Shah centered in [[Herat]].{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=158}} Zaman Shah would defeat Humayun and force the loyalty of Mahmud Shah Durrani.{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=158}} Securing his position on the throne, Zaman Shah led three campaigns into [[Punjab]]. The first two campaigns captured [[Lahore]], but he retreated due to intel about a possible [[Qajar Iran|Qajar]] invasion. Zaman Shah embarked on his third campaign for [[Punjab]] in 1800 to deal with a rebellious Ranjit Singh.{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=162}} However, he was forced to withdraw, and Zaman Shah's reign was ended by Mahmud Shah Durrani.{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=162}} However, just under two years into his reign, Mahmud Shah Durrani was deposed by his brother [[Shah Shuja Durrani]] on 13 July 1803.{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=166}} Shah Shuja attempted to consolidate the [[Durrani Empire|Durrani Realm]] but was deposed by his brother at the [[Battle of Nimla (1809)]].{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=172}} Mahmud Shah Durrani defeated Shah Shuja and forced him to flee, usurping the throne again. His second reign began on 3 May 1809.{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=176}}

[[File:Map of Afghanistan March 1839.png|thumb|300px|Map of Afghanistan ([[Emirate of Afghanistan|Emirate]]) and surrounding nations in 1839, during the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]]. [[Dost Mohammad Khan]]'s realm can be seen as the Emirate of Kabul, with the [[Principality of Qandahar]] and the [[Emirate of Herat]] seen as well.]]

By the early 19th century, the Afghan empire was under threat from the [[Qajar dynasty|Persians]] in the west and the [[Sikh Empire]] in the east. [[Fateh Khan Barakzai|Fateh Khan]], leader of the [[Barakzai dynasty|Barakzai tribe]], installed many of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire. Fateh Khan was [[Torture and Execution of Fateh Khan Barakzai|brutally murdered]] in 1818 by [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]]. As a result, the brothers of Fateh Khan and the [[Barakzai]] tribe rebelled, and a civil war brewed. During this turbulent period, Afghanistan fractured into many states, including the [[Principality of Qandahar]], [[Herat (1793–1863)|Emirate of Herat]], [[Kunduz Khanate|Khanate of Qunduz]], [[Maimana Khanate]], and numerous other warring polities. The most prominent state was the [[Emirate of Afghanistan|Emirate of Kabul]], ruled by [[Dost Mohammad Khan]].

With the collapse of the Durrani Empire, and the exile of the [[Durrani dynasty|Sadozai Dynasty]] to be left to rule in [[Herat (1793–1863)|Herat]], Punjab and Kashmir were lost to [[Ranjit Singh]], ruler of the [[Sikh Empire]], who invaded [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] in March 1823 and captured the city of [[Peshawar]] following the [[Battle of Nowshera]]. In 1834, Dost Mohammad Khan led numerous campaigns, firstly [[Dost Mohammad's Campaign to Jalalabad (1834)|campaigning to Jalalabad]], and then allying with his rival brothers in [[Principality of Qandahar|Kandahar]] to defeat [[Shah Shuja Durrani]] and the British in the [[Expedition of Shuja ul-Mulk]].{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=205}} In 1837, Dost Mohammad Khan attempted to conquer Peshawar and sent a large force under his son [[Wazir Akbar Khan]], leading to the [[Battle of Jamrud]]. [[Wazir Akbar Khan|Akbar Khan]] and the Afghan army failed to capture the [[Jamrud Fort]] from the [[Sikh Khalsa Army]], but killed Sikh Commander [[Hari Singh Nalwa]], thus ending the [[Afghan-Sikh Wars]]. By this time the British were advancing from the east, capitalizing on the decline of the Sikh Empire after it had its own period of turbulence following the death of [[Ranjit Singh]], which engaged the [[Emirate of Afghanistan|Emirate of Kabul]] in the [[First Anglo-Afghan War|first major conflict]] during "[[The Great Game]]".

[[File:Afghan foot soldiers in 1841.jpg|thumb|[[Pashtun tribes|Afghan tribesmen]] in 1841, painted by British officer [[James Rattray]]]]

In 1839 a [[British Army|British]] expeditionary force marched into Afghanistan, invading the [[Principality of Qandahar]], and in August 1839, seized [[Kabul]]. Dost Mohammad Khan defeated the British in the [[Parwan Campaign (1840)|Parwan campaign]], but surrendered following his victory. He was replaced with the former Durrani ruler [[Shah Shuja Durrani]] as the new [[List of heads of state of Afghanistan|ruler]] of [[Kabul]], a de facto puppet of the British. Following an uprising that saw the assassination of [[Shah Shuja Durrani|Shah Shuja]], the [[1842 retreat from Kabul]] of British-Indian forces and the [[1842 retreat from Kabul|annihilation]] of [[William George Keith Elphinstone|Elphinstone]]'s army, and the punitive expedition of [[Battle of Kabul (1842)|The Battle of Kabul]] that led to its sacking, the British gave up on their attempts to try to subjugate Afghanistan, allowing Dost Mohammad Khan to return as ruler. Following this, Dost Mohammad pursued a myriad of campaigns to unite most of Afghanistan in his reign, launching numerous incursions including against the surrounding states such as the [[Hazarajat Campaign of 1843|Hazarajat campaign]], [[Afghan Conquest of Balkh|conquest of Balkh]], [[Afghan Conquest of Kunduz|conquest of Kunduz]], and the [[conquest of Kandahar]]. Dost Mohammad led his final campaign against [[Herat (1793–1863)|Herat]], conquering it and re-uniting Afghanistan. During his campaigns of re-unification, he held friendly relations with the British despite the First Anglo-Afghan War, and affirmed their status in the [[Second Anglo-Afghan Treaty (1857)|Second Anglo-Afghan treaty]] of 1857, while [[Emirate of Bukhara|Bukhara]] and internal religious leaders pressured Dost Mohammad to invade India during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].

Dost Mohammad died in June 1863, a few weeks after his successful [[Herat campaign of 1862–1863|campaign]] to Herat. Following his death, a civil war ensued among his sons, prominently [[Mohammad Afzal Khan]], [[Mohammad Azam Khan]], and [[Sher Ali Khan]]. Sher Ali won the resulting [[Afghan Civil War (1863–1869)]] and ruled Afghanistan until his death in 1879. In his final years, the British returned to Afghanistan in the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] to fight perceived Russian influence in the region. Sher Ali retreated to northern Afghanistan, intending to create a resistance there similar to his predecessors, Dost Mohammad Khan, and Wazir Akbar Khan. His untimely death however, saw [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan|Yaqub Khan]] declared the new Amir, leading to Britain gaining control of Afghanistan's foreign relations as part of the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] of 1879, making it an official [[British Protectorate|British Protected State]].{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=359-366}} [[Siege of the British Residency in Kabul|An uprising]] however, re-started the conflict, and Yaqub Khan was deposed. During this tumultuous period, [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] began his rise to power, becoming an eligible candidate to become Amir after he seized [[Second Anglo-Afghan War#Exploits of Abdur Rahman Khan|much of Northern Afghanistan]]. Abdur Rahman marched on [[Kabul]], and was declared Amir, being recognized by the British as well. Another uprising by [[Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]] threatened the British, where rebels confronted and defeated British forces in the [[Battle of Maiwand]]. Following up on his victory, Ayub Khan unsuccessfully [[Battle of Kandahar (1880)|besieged Kandahar]], and his decisive defeat saw the end of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, with Abdur Rahman secured firmly as Amir.{{sfn|Lee|2019|p=376-383}} In 1893, Abdur Rahman signed an agreement in which the ethnic [[Pashtun]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] territories were divided by the [[Durand Line]], which forms the modern-day border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. [[Shia Islam in Afghanistan|Shia]]-dominated [[Hazarajat]] and pagan [[Kafiristan]] remained politically independent until being [[Muslim conquests of Afghanistan|conquered]] by Abdur Rahman Khan in 1891–1896. He was known as the "Iron Amir" for his features and his ruthless methods against tribes. He died in 1901, succeeded by his son, [[Habibullah Khan]].{{blockquote|How can a small power like Afghanistan, which is like a goat between these lions [Britain and Russia] or a grain of wheat between two strong millstones of the grinding mill, stand in the midway of the stones without being ground to dust?|author=[[Abdur Rahman Khan]], the "Iron Amir", in 1900}}

During the [[First World War]], when Afghanistan was neutral, Habibullah Khan was met by officials of the central powers in the [[Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition]]. They called on Afghanistan to declare full independence from the United Kingdom, join them and attack British India, as part of the [[Hindu–German Conspiracy]]. The effort to bring Afghanistan into the Central Powers failed, but it sparked discontent among the population about maintaining neutrality with the British. Habibullah was assassinated in February 1919, and [[Amanullah Khan]] eventually assumed power. A staunch supporter of the 1915–1916 expeditions, Amanullah Khan invaded British India, beginning the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]], and entering British India via the [[Khyber Pass]].

[[File:King Amanullah standing.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Amanullah Khan]] proclaimed himself [[King of Afghanistan]] in June 1926.]]

After the end of the Third Anglo-Afghan War and the signing of the [[Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919|Treaty of Rawalpindi]] on 19 August 1919, [[Emir of Afghanistan|Emir]] Amanullah Khan declared the [[Emirate of Afghanistan]] a [[sovereign state|sovereign]] and fully [[independent state]]. He moved to end his country's traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community, particularly with the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Weimar Republic]]. He proclaimed himself [[King of Afghanistan]] on 9 June 1926, forming the [[Kingdom of Afghanistan]]. He introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was [[Mahmud Tarzi]], an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's 1923 [[constitution of Afghanistan|constitution]], which made elementary education compulsory. [[Slavery]] was abolished in 1923. King Amanullah's wife, [[Soraya Tarzi|Queen Soraya]], was an important figure during this period in the fight for woman's education and against their oppression.

Some of the reforms, such as the abolition of the traditional [[burqa]] for women and the opening of co-educational schools, alienated many tribal and religious leaders, leading to the [[Afghan Civil War (1928–1929)]]. King Amanullah abdicated in January 1929, and soon after Kabul fell to [[Saqqawist]] forces led by [[Habibullah Kalakani]]. [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]], Amanullah's cousin, defeated and killed Kalakani in October 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah. He abandoned the reforms of King Amanullah in favor of a more gradual approach to modernization, but was assassinated in 1933 by [[Abdul Khaliq Hazara (assassin)|Abdul Khaliq]].

Mohammed Zahir Shah succeeded to the throne and reigned as king from 1933 to 1973. During the [[Afghan tribal revolts of 1944–1947|tribal revolts of 1944–1947]], King Zahir's reign was challenged by [[Zadran (Pashtun tribe)|Zadran]], [[Safi (Pashtun tribe)|Safi]], [[Mangal (Pashtun tribe)|Mangal]], and [[Wazir (Pashtun tribe)|Wazir]] tribesmen led by [[Mazrak Zadran]], [[Salemai]], and [[Faqir Ipi|Mirzali Khan]], among others – many of whom were [[Amanullah loyalist]]s. Afghanistan joined the [[League of Nations]] in 1934. The 1930s saw the development of roads, infrastructure, the founding of a [[Da Afghanistan Bank|national bank]], and increased education. Road links in the north played a large part in a growing cotton and textile industry. The country built close relationships with the [[Axis powers]], with [[Nazi Germany]] having the largest share in Afghan development at the time.

[[File:Portrait of King Zahir Shah of Afghanistan in 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mohammed Zahir Shah|King Zahir]], the last reigning monarch of Afghanistan, who reigned from 1933 until 1973]]

Until 1946 King Zahir ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|prime minister]] and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another uncle, [[Shah Mahmud Khan]], became prime minister in 1946 and experimented with allowing greater political freedom. He was replaced in 1953 by [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], a [[Pashtun]] nationalist who sought the creation of a [[Pashtunistan]], leading to highly tense relations with Pakistan. Daoud Khan pressed for social modernization reforms and sought a closer relationship with the [[Soviet Union]]. Afterward, the [[1964 Constitution of Afghanistan|1964 constitution]] was formed, and the first non-royal prime minister was sworn in.

Zahir Shah, like his father Nadir Shah, had a policy of maintaining national independence while pursuing gradual modernization, creating nationalist feeling, and improving relations with the United Kingdom. Afghanistan was neither a participant in [[World War II]] nor aligned with either power bloc in the [[Cold War]]. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports, and other vital infrastructure. On a per capita basis, Afghanistan received more Soviet [[development aid]] than any other country. In 1973, while the King was in Italy, Daoud Khan launched a [[1973 Afghan coup|bloodless coup]] and became the first [[president of Afghanistan]], abolishing the monarchy.

===Democratic Republic and Soviet war===
{{Main|Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Soviet–Afghan War|Afghan Civil War (1989–1992)}}
{{Further|History of Afghanistan (1978–1992)}}
[[File:Afgan1987 Gardez UAZ469.jpg|thumb|Soviet troops in [[Gardez]], Afghanistan, in 1987]]

In April 1978, the communist [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) seized power in a bloody coup d'état against then-President [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], in what is called the [[Saur Revolution]]. The PDPA declared the establishment of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]], with its first leader named as [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|People's Democratic Party]] General Secretary [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]].{{sfn|Ewans|2002|page=186–88}} This would trigger a series of events that would dramatically turn Afghanistan from a peaceful (albeit poor and secluded) country to a hotbed of conflict and terrorism. The PDPA initiated various social, symbolic, and land distribution reforms that provoked strong opposition, while also brutally oppressing political dissidents. This caused unrest and quickly expanded into a state of [[Afghan conflict|civil war]] by 1979, waged by guerrilla ''[[mujahideen]]'' (and smaller [[Maoist]] guerrillas) against regime forces countrywide. It quickly turned into a [[proxy war]] as the Pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers, the United States [[Operation Cyclone|supported]] them through Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI), and the [[Soviet Union]] sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA regime. Meanwhile, there was increasingly hostile friction between the competing factions of the PDPA&nbsp;– the dominant [[Khalq]] and the more moderate [[Parcham]].

In October 1979, PDPA General Secretary Taraki was assassinated in an internal coup orchestrated by then-prime minister [[Hafizullah Amin]], who became the new general secretary of the PDPA. The situation in the country deteriorated under Amin, and thousands of people went missing. Displeased with Amin's government, the [[Soviet Army]] invaded the country in December 1979, heading for Kabul and killing Amin.{{sfn|Barfield|2012|page=234}} A Soviet-organized regime, led by Parcham's [[Babrak Karmal]] but inclusive of both factions (Parcham and Khalq), filled the vacuum. Soviet troops in more substantial numbers were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal, marking the beginning of the [[Soviet–Afghan War]]. Lasting nine years, the war caused the deaths of between 562,000 and 2&nbsp;million Afghans,{{efn|Attributed to multiple sources: }} and displaced about 6&nbsp;million people who subsequently fled Afghanistan, mainly to [[Afghans in Pakistan|Pakistan]] and [[Afghans in Iran|Iran]]. Heavy air bombardment destroyed many countryside villages, millions of [[landmine]]s were planted, and some cities such as [[Herat]] and [[Kandahar]] were also damaged from bombardment. After the [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|Soviet withdrawal]], another [[Afghan Civil War (1989-92)|civil war ensued]] until the communist regime under PDPA leader [[Mohammad Najibullah]] collapsed in 1992.{{sfn|Barfield|2012|pp=239, 244}}

The Soviet–Afghan War had drastic social effects on Afghanistan. The militarization of society led to heavily armed police, private bodyguards, openly armed civil defense groups and the like becoming the norm in Afghanistan for decades thereafter. The traditional power structure had shifted from clergy, community elders, intelligentsia, and military in favor of powerful [[warlords]].

Another civil war broke out after the [[Peshawar Accords|creation]] of a dysfunctional coalition [[Islamic State of Afghanistan|government]] between leaders of various ''mujahideen'' factions. Amid a state of anarchy and factional infighting, various ''mujahideen'' factions committed widespread rape, murder and extortion, while Kabul was heavily bombarded and partially destroyed by the fighting. Several failed reconciliations and alliances occurred between different leaders. The [[Taliban]] emerged in September 1994 as a movement and militia of students (''talib'') from Islamic [[Madrassas in Pakistan|madrassas (schools) in Pakistan]], who soon had military support from Pakistan.

Taking control of [[Kandahar]] city that year, they conquered more territories until finally driving out the government of [[Burhanuddin Rabbani|Rabbani]] from Kabul in 1996, where they established an [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (1996–2001)|emirate]]. The Taliban were condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic [[sharia]] law, which resulted in the brutal treatment of many Afghans, especially [[Taliban treatment of women|women]]. During their rule, the Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan civilians, denied UN food supplies to starving civilians and conducted a policy of [[scorched earth]], burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes.{{efn|Attributed to multiple sources: }}

[[Battle of Kabul (1992–1996)|After the fall of Kabul]] to the Taliban, [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] and [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] formed the [[Northern Alliance]], later joined by others, to resist the Taliban. Dostum's forces were defeated by the Taliban during the [[Battles of Mazar-i-Sharif (1997–1998)|Battles of Mazar-i-Sharif]] in 1997 and 1998; Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff, [[Pervez Musharraf]], began sending thousands of Pakistanis to help the Taliban defeat the Northern Alliance.{{efn|Attributed to multiple sources: }} By 2000, the Northern Alliance only controlled 10% of territory, cornered in the northeast. On 9 September 2001, Massoud was assassinated by two Arab [[suicide attack]]ers in [[Panjshir Valley]]. Around 400,000 Afghans died in internal conflicts between 1990 and 2001.

=== US invasion and Islamic Republic ===

In October 2001, the [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|United States invaded Afghanistan]] to remove the Taliban from power after they refused to hand over [[Osama bin Laden]], the prime suspect of the [[September 11 attacks]], who was a "guest" of the Taliban and was operating his [[al-Qaeda]] network in Afghanistan. The majority of Afghans supported the American invasion. During the initial invasion, US and UK forces bombed al-Qaeda training camps, and later working with the Northern Alliance, the Taliban regime came to an end.

In December 2001, after the Taliban government was overthrown, the [[Afghan Interim Administration]] under [[Hamid Karzai]] was formed. The [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) was established by the [[UN Security Council]] to help assist the [[Karzai administration]] and provide basic security. By this time, after two decades of war as well as an acute [[famine]] at the time, Afghanistan had one of the highest [[infant mortality|infant]] and child mortality rates in the world, the lowest life expectancy, much of the population were hungry, and infrastructure was in ruins. Many foreign donors started providing aid and assistance to rebuild the war-torn country. As coalition troops entered Afghanistan to help the [[Reconstruction in Afghanistan|rebuilding process]], the [[Taliban insurgency|Taliban began an insurgency]] to regain control. Afghanistan remained one of the poorest countries in the world because of a lack of foreign investment, [[Corruption in Afghanistan|government corruption]], and the Taliban insurgency.

The Afghan government was able to build some democratic structures, adopting a constitution in 2004 with the name [[Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]]. Attempts were made, often with the support of foreign donor countries, to improve the country's economy, healthcare, education, transport, and agriculture. ISAF forces also began to train the [[Afghan National Security Forces]]. Following 2002, nearly five million [[Afghan diaspora|Afghans]] were repatriated. The number of NATO troops present in Afghanistan peaked at 140,000 in 2011, dropping to about 16,000 in 2018. In September 2014 [[Ashraf Ghani]] became president after the [[Afghan presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]] where for the first time in Afghanistan's history power was democratically transferred. On 28 December 2014, NATO formally ended ISAF combat operations and transferred full security responsibility to the Afghan government. The NATO-led [[Operation Resolute Support]] was formed the same day as a successor to ISAF. Thousands of NATO troops remained in the country to train and advise Afghan government forces and continue their fight against the Taliban. A report titled ''Body Count'' concluded that 106,000–170,000 civilians had been killed as a result of the fighting in Afghanistan at the hands of all parties to the conflict.

On 19 February 2020, the [[US–Taliban deal]] was made in Qatar. The deal was one of the critical events that caused the collapse of the [[Afghan National Security Forces]] (ANSF); following the signing of the deal, the US dramatically reduced the number of air attacks and deprived the ANSF of a critical edge in fighting the [[Taliban insurgency]], leading to the Taliban takeover of Kabul.

===Second Taliban era===
{{Further|Aftermath of the Afghanistan War (2001–2021)}}

NATO Secretary General [[Jens Stoltenberg]] announced on 14 April 2021 that the alliance had agreed to start [[2020–2021 US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan|withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan]] by 1 May. Soon after NATO troops began withdrawing, the [[Taliban]] launched an [[2021 Taliban offensive|offensive against the Afghan government]] and quickly advanced in front of collapsing Afghan government forces. The Taliban [[Fall of Kabul (2021)|captured the capital city of Kabul]] on 15 August 2021, after regaining control over a vast majority of Afghanistan. Several foreign diplomats and Afghan government officials, including president Ashraf Ghani, were evacuated from the country, with many Afghan civilians attempting to flee along with them. On 17 August, first vice president [[Amrullah Saleh]] proclaimed himself caretaker president and announced the formation of an [[National Resistance Front of Afghanistan|anti-Taliban front]] with a reported 6,000+ troops in the [[Panjshir Valley]], along with [[Ahmad Massoud]]. However, by 6 September, the Taliban had taken control of most of [[Panjshir province]], with resistance fighters retreating to the mountains. Clashes in the valley ceased mid-September.

According to the [[Costs of War Project]], 176,000 people were killed in the conflict, including 46,319 civilians, between 2001 and 2021. According to the [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]], at least 212,191 people were killed in the conflict. Though the state of war in the country ended in 2021, armed conflict persists in some regions amid [[Islamic State–Taliban conflict|fighting between the Taliban and the local branch of the Islamic State]], as well as an anti-Taliban [[Republican insurgency in Afghanistan|Republican insurgency]].

The Taliban government is led by [[Head of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|supreme leader]] [[Hibatullah Akhundzada]] and acting prime minister [[Hasan Akhund]], who took office on 7 September 2021. Akhund is one of the four founders of the Taliban and was a deputy prime minister of the previous emirate; his appointment was seen as a compromise between moderates and hardliners. A [[Cabinet of Afghanistan|new, all-male cabinet]] was formed, which included [[Abdul Hakim Haqqani]] as minister of justice. On 20 September 2021, [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] [[António Guterres]] received a letter from acting [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|minister of foreign affairs]] [[Amir Khan Muttaqi]] to formally claim Afghanistan's seat as a member state for their official spokesman in [[Doha]], [[Suhail Shaheen]]. The United Nations did not recognize the previous Taliban government and chose to work with the then government-in-exile instead.

Western nations suspended most of their humanitarian aid to Afghanistan following the Taliban's August 2021 takeover of the country; the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] also halted their payments. More than half of Afghanistan's 39 million people faced an acute [[Food security|food shortage]] in October 2021. Human Rights Watch reported on 11 November 2021 that Afghanistan was facing widespread [[famine]] due to an economic and banking crisis.

The [[Taliban]] have significantly tackled corruption, improving on the [[Corruption Perceptions Index|corruption perceptions index]] from 174th to 150th best out of 180 countries from 2021 to 2022, but dropping to 162nd in 2023. The Taliban have also reportedly reduced bribery and extortion in public service areas.

At the same time, the human rights situation in the country has deteriorated. Following the 2001 invasion, more than 5.7&nbsp;million refugees returned to Afghanistan; however, in 2021, 2.6&nbsp;million Afghans remained refugees, primarily in Iran and Pakistan, and another 4 million were internally displaced.

In October 2023, the Pakistani government ordered the [[expulsion of Afghans from Pakistan]]. Iran also decided to deport [[Afghans in Iran|Afghan]] nationals back to Afghanistan. Taliban authorities condemned the deportations of Afghans as an "inhuman act". Afghanistan faced a humanitarian crisis in late 2023.

On 10 November 2024, Afghanistan's Foreign Ministry confirmed that Taliban representatives would attend the [[2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], marking the first time the country participated since the Taliban's return to power in 2021. Afghanistan had been barred from previous summits due to the lack of global recognition of the Taliban regime. In May 2025, Iran ordered the [[2025 Afghan deportation from Iran|mass deportation]] of an estimated 4 million Afghan migrants and refugees.
