=== Early history ===
In the [[7th millennium BC]], ecological conditions in the northern half of Chadian territory favoured human settlement, and its population increased considerably. Some of the most important [[African archaeology|African archaeological]] sites are found in Chad, mainly in the [[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region]]; some date to earlier than 2000 BC.

For more than 2,000 years, the Chadian Basin has been inhabited by agricultural and [[sedentism|sedentary]] people. The region became a crossroads of civilisations. The earliest of these was the legendary [[Sao civilisation|Sao]], known from artifacts and oral histories. The Sao fell to the [[Kanem Empire]], the first and longest-lasting of the empires that developed in Chad's [[Sahel]]ian strip by the end of the 1st millennium AD. Two other states in the region, [[Sultanate of Bagirmi]] and [[Wadai Empire]], emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries. The power of Kanem and its successors was based on control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes that passed through the region. In Kanem, about a third of the population were slaves.

=== French colonial period (1900–1960) ===
{{Main|French Chad}}

French colonial expansion led to the creation of the {{lang|fr|Territoire Militaire des Pays et Protectorats du Tchad}} in 1900. By 1920, France had secured full control of the colony and incorporated it as part of [[French Equatorial Africa]]. [[Colonial Chad|French rule in Chad]] was characterised by an absence of policies to unify the territory and sluggish modernisation compared to other French colonies.

The French primarily viewed the colony as an unimportant source of untrained labour and raw [[cotton]]; France introduced large-scale cotton production in 1929. The colonial administration in Chad was critically understaffed and had to rely on the dregs of the French civil service. Only the [[Sara people|Sara]] of the south was governed effectively; French presence in the Islamic north and east was nominal. The educational system was affected by this neglect. Tensions between farmers and elites culminated in the 1952 [[Bébalem massacre]] by colonial authorities.

After [[World War II]], France granted Chad the status of [[Overseas France|overseas territory]] and its inhabitants the right to elect representatives to the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] and a [[National Assembly (Chad)|Chadian assembly]]. The largest political party was the [[Chadian Progressive Party]] ({{langx|fr|Parti Progressiste Tchadien}}, PPT), based in the southern half of the colony. Chad was granted independence on 11 August 1960 with the PPT's leader, [[François Tombalbaye]], an ethnic [[Sara people|Sara]], as its first [[Heads of state of Chad|president]].

=== Tombalbaye rule (1960–1979) ===
Two years later, Tombalbaye banned opposition parties and established a one-party system. Tombalbaye's autocratic rule and insensitive mismanagement exacerbated inter-ethnic tensions. In 1965, Muslims in the north, led by the [[FROLINAT|National Liberation Front of Chad]] ({{langx|fr|Front de libération nationale du Tchad}}, FRONILAT), began a [[Transitional Government of National Unity (Chad)|civil war]]. Becoming gradually more erratic, Tombalbaye's regime alienated even his southern base of support, notably through the forced introduction of ''yondo'' (ritual scarring) for [[Public service|public servants]] and the 1973 assassination of expatriate dissident [[Outel Bono]] in Paris. Tombalbaye was [[1975 Chadian coup d'état|overthrown and killed]] in 1975, but the insurgency continued. In 1979 the rebel factions led by [[Hissène Habré]] took the capital, and all central authority in the country collapsed. Armed factions, many from the north's rebellion, contended for power.

=== Chad's first civil war (1979–1987) ===
The disintegration of Chad caused the collapse of France's position in the country. [[Libya]] moved to fill the power vacuum and became [[Chadian-Libyan conflict|involved in Chad's civil war]]. Libya's adventure [[Toyota War|ended in disaster]] in 1987; the French-supported president, [[Hissène Habré]], evoked a united response from Chadians of a kind never seen before and forced the Libyan army off Chadian soil.

=== Dictatorship of Habré (1987–1990) ===
Habré consolidated his dictatorship through a power system that relied on corruption and violence with thousands of people estimated to have been killed under his rule. The president favoured his own [[Toubou people|Toubou]] ethnic group and discriminated against his former allies, the [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]]. His general, [[Idriss Déby]], overthrew him in 1990. Attempts to prosecute Habré led to his placement under house arrest in [[Senegal]] in 2005; in 2013, Habré was formally charged with war crimes committed during his rule. In May 2016, he was found guilty of human-rights abuses, including rape, sexual slavery, and ordering the killing of 40,000 people, and sentenced to life in prison.

===Déby dynasty and democracy with second Civil War (1990–present)===
[[File:Idriss Déby at the White House in 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Despite internal political opposition, coup attempts, and a civil war, [[Idriss Déby]] continuously ruled Chad from 1990 until his death in 2021]]

Déby attempted to reconcile the rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics. Chadians approved a [[Constitution of Chad|new constitution]] by [[1996 Chadian constitutional referendum|referendum]], and in 1996, Déby easily won a [[Chadian presidential election, 1996|competitive presidential election]]. He won a [[Chadian presidential election, 2001|second term]] five years later. [[Petroleum|Oil]] exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it hopes that Chad would, at last, have some chances of peace and prosperity. Instead, internal dissent worsened, and a [[War in Chad (2005–present)|new civil war]] broke out. Déby [[Chadian constitutional referendum, 2005|unilaterally modified the constitution]] to remove the two-term limit on the presidency; this caused an uproar among the civil society and opposition parties.

In 2006 Déby won [[Chadian presidential election, 2006|a third mandate]] in elections that the opposition boycotted. Ethnic violence in eastern Chad has increased; the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] has warned that a [[genocide]] like that in [[Darfur conflict|Darfur]] may yet occur in Chad. [[Battle of N'Djamena (2006)|In 2006]] and [[Battle of N'Djamena (2008)|in 2008]] rebel forces attempted to take the capital by force, but failed on both occasions. An agreement for the restoration of harmony between Chad and Sudan, signed 15 January 2010, marked the end of a five-year war. The fix in relations led to the Chadian rebels from Sudan returning home, the opening of the border between the two countries after seven years of closure, and the deployment of a joint force to secure the border. In May 2013, security forces in Chad foiled a coup against President [[Idriss Déby]] that had been in preparation for several months.

Chad is one of the leading partners in a [[Multinational Joint Task Force|West African coalition]] in the [[Boko Haram insurgency|fight]] against [[Boko Haram]] and other Islamist militants. Déby's son, [[Mahamat Déby Itno|Mahamat Déby]], has been named interim president by a [[Transitional Military Council (Chad)|Transitional Council of military officers]]. That transitional council has replaced the [[Constitution of Chad|Constitution]] with a new charter, granting Mahamat Déby the powers of the presidency and naming him head of the armed forces. On 23 May 2024, Mahamat  Idriss Déby was sworn in as [[President of Chad]] after the disputed 6 May [[2024 Chadian presidential election|election]].
