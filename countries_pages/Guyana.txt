===Before colonisation===
What is now Guyana has been inhabited for millennia. Nine [[Indigenous peoples in Guyana|indigenous]] tribes reside in Guyana: the [[Wai-wai people|Wai Wai]], [[Macushi]], [[Patamona people|Patamona]], [[Lokono]], [[Kalina people|Kalina]], [[Wapishana]], [[Pemon]], [[Akawaio people|Akawaio]], and [[Warao people|Warao]]. Many of these peoples practised [[shifting agriculture]] alongside [[hunting]]. Historians speculate that the Arawaks and Caribs originated in the South American hinterland and migrated northward, first to the present-day Guianas and then to the Caribbean islands. The Arawak, mainly cultivators, hunters, and fishermen, migrated to the Caribbean islands before the Carib and settled throughout the region.

===Colonial period===
Although [[Christopher Columbus]] was the first European to sight Guyana during his third voyage (in 1498), and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] wrote an account in 1596, the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to establish colonies: [[Pomeroon (colony)|Pomeroon]] (1581), [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] (1616), [[Berbice]] (1627), and [[Demerara]] (1752). After France invaded the Dutch Republic ([[Batavian Republic|1795]]), the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] assumed control in 1796, with the Dutch and British signing the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]] in London that ceded [[Demerara-Essequibo]] and Berbice to Britain.

In 1831, the united colonies of Demerara-Essequibo and separate colony of Berbice together became a single British colony known as [[British Guiana]].

Since its independence in 1824, Venezuela has claimed the area of land to the west of the [[Essequibo River]]. [[Simón Bolívar]] wrote to the British government warning against the Berbice and Demerara settlers settling on land which the Venezuelans, as assumed heirs of Spanish claims on the area dating to the 16th century, claimed was theirs. In 1899, an international tribunal ruled that the land belonged to Great Britain. From the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]], the British inherited [[Dutch colonisation of the Guianas|Dutch territory]] which included lands between the [[Orinoco river|Orinoco]] and [[Courantyne River|Courantyne]] rivers. Dutch sovereignty over these settlements was recognised in 1648 by Spain with the [[Peace of Münster]], which stated under Article 5 that the Dutch would retain all of the "lordships, cities, castles, fortresses, trades and lands in the... West Indies" under their possession at the time. However, the treaty did not specify the boundary between [[Spanish Guiana]] and [[Dutch colonisation of the Guianas|Dutch Guiana]].

===Independence===
Guyana achieved independence from the United Kingdom as a dominion on 26 May 1966 and became a republic on 23 February 1970, remaining a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. Shortly after independence, [[Venezuela]] began to take diplomatic, economic, and military action against Guyana to enforce its [[Guyana–Venezuela territorial dispute|territorial claim to the Essequibo region]]. Five months after Guyana's independence, in October 1966, Venezuelan troops crossed the international border and seized [[Ankoko Island]] which has been under occupation ever since. Venezuelan troops quickly made military installations and an airstrip.

Following independence, [[Forbes Burnham]] of the [[People's National Congress Reform|People's National Congress]] rose to power, quickly becoming a repressive authoritarian leader. Politics became divided on race with the Afro-Guyanese supporting Burnham's [[People's National Congress Reform|People's National Congress]] and the Indo-Guyanese supporting [[Cheddi Jagan]]'s [[People's Progressive Party/Civic|People's Progressive Party]], in what became known as ''aapan [[Jāti|jaat]]'' politics, loosely translated from [[Caribbean Hindustani#Guyanese Hindustani|Guyanese Hindustani]] as "for your own kind".

Guyana was elected three times as a member of the [[UN Security Council]] in 1975–76, 1982–83 and 2024–25.

In 1978, a total of 918 people died at the [[Jonestown|Jonestown mass murder-suicide]] led by American cult leader [[Jim Jones]] at a remote settlement in northwest Guyana.

Former U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] visited Guyana to lobby for the resumption of free elections. On 5 October 1992, a new National Assembly and regional councils were elected in the first Guyanese election since 1964 to be internationally recognised as free and fair. [[Cheddi Jagan]] of the PPP was elected and sworn in as president on 9 October 1992.

In 2015, major oil reserves were discovered off the coast by [[ExxonMobil]].

In March 2020, President [[David A. Granger]] narrowly lost the [[2020 Guyanese general election|snap elections]], following Granger's government loss of a vote of no confidence back in 2018. Granger refused to accept the results, but eventually five months later, [[Irfaan Ali]] of the [[People's Progressive Party/Civic]] was sworn in as the new president because of allegations of fraud and irregularities.

The [[National Trust of Guyana]] has designated nine historic sites as national monuments.

A [[2023 Venezuelan referendum|referendum in neighbouring Venezuela]] was held in December 2023 on the annexation of the [[Guyana–Venezuela territorial dispute|disputed Essequibo region]], which lies entirely in the territory of Guyana. The vote passed with a 95% majority, but with a low turnout, with analysts stating Maduro's government had falsified the results. This came at the same time as a [[2023 Guyana–Venezuela crisis|Venezuelan military buildup]] on the Guyanese border, sparking concerns of war between the two states.

In September 2025, Irfaan Ali was [[2025 Guyanese general election|re-elected]] for a second term as Guyana’s president.
