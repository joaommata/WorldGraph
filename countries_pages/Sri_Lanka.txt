{{Main|Prehistory of Sri Lanka}}

The pre-history of Sri Lanka goes back 125,000 years and possibly even as far back as 500,000 years. The era spans the [[Palaeolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], and early [[Iron Age]]s. Among the [[Paleolithic]] human settlements discovered in Sri Lanka, [[Fa Hien Cave|Pahiyangala]] (37,000 BP), named after the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] traveller [[Bhikkhu|monk]] [[Faxian]]; [[Batadombalena]] (28,500 BP); and [[Belilena]] (12,000 BP) are the most important. In these caves, archaeologists have found the remains of [[anatomy|anatomically]] modern [[humans]] which they have named [[Balangoda Man]], and other evidence suggesting that they may have engaged in [[agriculture]] and kept domestic dogs for driving game.

The earliest inhabitants of Sri Lanka were probably ancestors of the [[Vedda people]], an indigenous people numbering approximately 2,500 living in modern-day Sri Lanka.

During the protohistoric period (1000–500 BCE) Sri Lanka was culturally united with southern India, and shared the same megalithic burials, [[Black and red ware culture|pottery]], iron technology, farming techniques and [[megalithic graffiti symbols|megalithic graffiti]]. This cultural complex spread from southern India along with Dravidian clans such as the [[Velir]], prior to the migration of [[Prakrit]] speakers. It is said that Kubera was overthrown by his [[rakshasa]] stepbrother, [[Ravana]].

According to the ''[[Mahāvaṃsa]]'', a [[Pali|Pāḷi]] chronicle written in the 5th century CE, the original inhabitants of Sri Lanka are said to be the [[Yaksha]]s and [[Naga people (Lanka)|Nagas]]. Sinhalese history traditionally starts in 543 BCE with the arrival of [[Prince Vijaya]], a semi-legendary prince who sailed with 700 followers to Sri Lanka, after being expelled from [[Vanga kingdom]] (present-day [[Bengal]]). He established the [[Kingdom of Tambapanni]], near modern-day [[Mannar, Sri Lanka|Mannar]]. Vijaya (Singha) is the first of the approximately [[List of Sri Lankan monarchs|189 monarchs of Sri Lanka]] described in chronicles such as the ''[[Dīpavaṃsa]]'', ''Mahāvaṃsa'', ''[[Cūḷavaṃsa]]'', and ''Rājāvaliya''.

Once [[Prakrit]] speakers had attained dominance on the island, the ''[[Mahāvaṃsa]]'' further recounts the later migration of royal brides and service castes from the Tamil [[Pandya kingdom]] to the [[Anuradhapura kingdom]] in the early historic period.

The [[Anuradhapura period]] (377 BCE{{snd}}1017 CE) began with the establishment of the [[Anuradhapura kingdom]] in 380 BCE during the reign of [[Pandukabhaya]]. Thereafter, Anuradhapura served as the capital city of the country for nearly 1,400 years. Ancient Sri Lankans excelled at building certain types of [[Ancient constructions of Sri Lanka|structures]] such as [[Sri Lankan irrigation network|tanks]], [[Stupa|dagobas]] and palaces. Society underwent a major transformation during the reign of [[Devanampiya Tissa]], with the arrival of Buddhism from India. In 250 BCE, [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], a [[bhikkhu]] and the son of the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] Emperor [[Ashoka]] arrived in [[Mihintale]] carrying the message of Buddhism. His mission won over the monarch, who embraced the faith and propagated it throughout the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese population]].

Succeeding kingdoms of Sri Lanka would maintain many [[schools of Buddhism|Buddhist schools]] and monasteries and support the propagation of Buddhism into other countries in Southeast Asia. Sri Lankan Bhikkhus studied in India's famous ancient Buddhist University of [[Nalanda]], which was destroyed by [[Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji|Bakhtiyar Khalji]]. It is probable that many of the scriptures from Nalanda are preserved in Sri Lanka's many monasteries and that the written form of the [[Tripiṭaka]], including Sinhalese Buddhist literature, were part of the University of Nalanda. In 245 BCE, [[bhikkhunī]] [[Sanghamitta]] arrived with the [[Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi]] tree, which is considered to be a sapling from the historical [[Bodhi Tree]] under which [[Gautama Buddha]] became enlightened. It is considered the oldest human-planted tree (with a continuous historical record) in the world. ([[Bodhivaṃsa]])

Sri Lanka experienced the first of many foreign invasions during the reign of [[Suratissa of Anuradhapura|Suratissa]], who was defeated by two horse traders named [[Sena and Guttika]] from South India. Sri Lankan monarchs undertook some remarkable construction projects such as [[Sigiriya]], the so-called "Fortress in the Sky", built during the reign of [[Kashyapa I]], who ruled between 477 and 495. The Sigiriya rock fortress is surrounded by an extensive network of ramparts and moats. Inside this protective enclosure were gardens, ponds, pavilions, palaces and other structures.

In 993 CE, the invasion of [[Chola dynasty|Chola emperor]] [[Rajaraja I]] forced the then Sinhalese ruler [[Mahinda V]] to flee to the southern part of Sri Lanka. Taking advantage of this situation, [[Rajendra I]], son of Rajaraja I, launched a large invasion in 1017. Mahinda V was captured and taken to India, and the Cholas [[Chola conquest of Anuradhapura|sacked the city of Anuradhapura]] causing the fall of [[Anuradhapura kingdom]]. Subsequently, they moved the capital to [[Polonnaruwa]].

=== Post-classical period ===
{{Main|Polonnaruwa period|Transitional period of Sri Lanka}}

Following a 17-year-long campaign, [[Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa|Vijayabahu I]] successfully drove the Chola out of Sri Lanka in 1070, reuniting the country for the first time in over a century. Upon his request, ordained monks were sent from [[Burma]] to Sri Lanka to re-establish Buddhism, which had almost disappeared from the country during the Chola reign. During the medieval period, Sri Lanka was divided into three sub-territories, namely, [[Principality of Ruhuna|Ruhunu]], Pihiti and [[Maya Rata|Maya]].

[[File:Gal Viharaya 02.jpg|thumb|The seated image of [[Gal Vihara]] in [[Polonnaruwa]], 12th century, which depicts the [[List of mudras (yoga)|dhyana mudra]], shows signs of [[Mahayana]] influence.]]
Sri Lanka's [[Sri Lankan irrigation network|irrigation system]] was extensively expanded during the reign of [[Parakramabahu I of Polonnaruwa|Parākramabāhu the Great]] (1153–1186). This period is considered as a time when Sri Lanka was at the height of its power. He built 1,470 reservoirs – the highest number by any ruler in Sri Lanka's history – repaired 165 dams, 3,910 canals, 163 major reservoirs, and 2,376 mini-reservoirs. the largest irrigation project of medieval Sri Lanka. Parākramabāhu's reign is memorable for two major campaigns – in the south of India as part of a Pandyan war of succession, and a punitive strike against the kings of Ramanna ([[Myanmar|Burma]]) for various perceived insults to Sri Lanka.

After his demise, Sri Lanka gradually decayed in power. In 1215, [[Kalinga Magha]], an invader with uncertain origins, identified as the founder of the Jaffna kingdom, invaded and captured the [[Kingdom of Polonnaruwa]]. He sailed from [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] 690 nautical miles on 100 large ships with a 24,000 strong army. Unlike previous invaders, he [[Looting|looted]], ransacked and destroyed everything in the ancient [[Anuradhapura kingdom|Anuradhapura]] and [[Kingdom of Polonnaruwa|Polonnaruwa]] Kingdoms beyond recovery. His priorities in ruling were to extract as much as possible from the land and overturn as many of the traditions of [[Rajarata]] as possible. His reign saw the massive migration of native [[Sinhalese people]] to the south and west of Sri Lanka, and into the mountainous interior, in a bid to escape his power.

Sri Lanka never really recovered from the effects of Kalinga Magha's invasion. King Vijayabâhu III, who led the resistance, brought the kingdom to [[Kingdom of Dambadeniya|Dambadeniya]]. The north, in the meanwhile, eventually evolved into the [[Jaffna kingdom]]. He ruled the North from 1450 to 1467 CE.

The next three centuries starting from 1215 were marked by kaleidoscopically shifting collections of capitals in south and central Sri Lanka, including Dambadeniya, [[Yapahuwa]], [[Gampola]], [[Raigama]], [[Kingdom of Kotte|Kotte]], [[Kingdom of Sitawaka|Sitawaka]], and finally, [[Kingdom of Kandy|Kandy]]. In 1247, the Malay kingdom of [[Tambralinga]] which was a vassal of [[Sri Vijaya]] led by their king [[Chandrabhanu]] briefly invaded Sri Lanka from [[Insular Southeast Asia]]. They were then expelled by the South Indian Pandyan dynasty. However, this temporary invasion reinforced the steady flow of the presence of various [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] merchant ethnic groups, from [[Sri Lankan Malays|Sumatrans]] (Indonesia) to [[Philippines–Sri Lanka relations|Lucoes]] (Philippines) into Sri Lanka which occurred since 200 BCE. Chinese admiral [[Zheng He]] and his naval expeditionary force landed at Galle, Sri Lanka in 1409 and got into [[Ming-Kotte War|battle]] with the local king [[Vira Alakesvara of Gampola]]. Zheng He captured King Vira Alakesvara and later released him. Zheng He erected the [[Galle Trilingual Inscription]], a stone tablet at [[Galle]] written in three [[languages]] ([[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[Persian language|Persian]]), to commemorate his visit. The [[stele]] was discovered by S. H. Thomlin at Galle in 1911 and is now preserved in the [[National Museum of Colombo|Colombo National Museum]].

[[File:Laor Sri Lanka Map (Cropped).jpg|thumb|left|alt=A 1595 map of Sri Lanka created by Dutch cartographer [[Petrus Plancius]]|A 1595 map of Sri Lanka created by [[Dutch colonial empire|Dutch]] cartographer [[Petrus Plancius]]]]
The early modern period of Sri Lanka begins with the arrival of Portuguese soldier and explorer [[Lourenço de Almeida]], the son of [[Francisco de Almeida]], in 1505. In 1517, the Portuguese built a fort at the port city of [[Colombo]] and gradually extended their control over the coastal areas. In 1592, after decades of intermittent warfare with the Portuguese, [[Vimaladharmasuriya I]] moved his kingdom to the inland city of [[Kingdom of Kandy|Kandy]], a location he thought more secure from attack. In 1619, succumbing to attacks by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], the independent existence of the [[Jaffna kingdom]] came to an end.

During the reign of the [[Rajasinha II]], Dutch explorers arrived on the island. In 1638, the king signed a [[Kandyan Treaty of 1638|treaty]] with the [[Dutch East India Company]] to get rid of the Portuguese who ruled most of the coastal areas. The following [[Dutch–Portuguese War]] resulted in a Dutch victory, with Colombo falling into Dutch hands by 1656. The Dutch remained in the areas they had captured, thereby violating the treaty they had signed in 1638. The [[Burgher people]], a distinct ethnic group, emerged as a result of intermingling between the Dutch and native Sri Lankans in this period.

The Kingdom of Kandy was the last independent monarchy of Sri Lanka. In 1595, Vimaladharmasurya brought the sacred [[Relic of the tooth of the Buddha|Tooth Relic]]—the traditional symbol of royal and religious authority amongst the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]]—to Kandy and built the [[Temple of the Tooth]]. The new king was crowned [[Sri Vijaya Rajasinha]] later that year. Kings of the Nayakkar dynasty launched several attacks on Dutch controlled areas, which proved to be unsuccessful.

[[File:Sri Vikrama Rajasinha.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]] of Kandy, the last ruling native Sri Lankan monarch]]
During the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], fearing that French control of the Netherlands might deliver Sri Lanka to the French, the [[British Empire]] occupied the coastal areas of the island (which they called the colony of [[British Ceylon]]) with little difficulty in 1796. Two years later, in 1798, [[Sri Rajadhi Rajasinha]], third of the four Nayakkar kings of Sri Lanka, died of a fever. Following his death, a nephew of Rajadhi Rajasinha, eighteen-year-old Kannasamy, was crowned. The young king, now named [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]], faced a [[British Empire|British]] invasion in 1803 but successfully retaliated. The First Kandyan War ended in a stalemate. The [[Kandyan Convention]] formally ceded the entire country to the British Empire. Attempts by Sri Lankan noblemen to undermine British power in 1818 during the [[Great Rebellion of 1817–1818|Uva Rebellion]] were thwarted by [[governors of British Ceylon|Governor]] [[Robert Brownrigg]].

The beginning of the modern period of Sri Lanka is marked by the [[Colebrooke–Cameron Commission|Colebrooke–Cameron reforms]] of 1833.

Soon, coffee became the primary commodity export of Sri Lanka. Falling coffee prices as a result of the [[Panic of 1847|depression of 1847]] stalled economic development and prompted the governor to introduce a series of taxes on firearms, dogs, shops, boats, etc., and to reintroduce a form of ''rajakariya'', requiring six days free labour on roads or payment of a cash equivalent. A devastating leaf disease, ''[[Hemileia vastatrix]]'', struck the coffee plantations in 1869, destroying the entire industry within fifteen years. The British quickly found a replacement: abandoning coffee, they began cultivating tea instead. [[Tea production in Sri Lanka]] thrived in the following decades. Large-scale rubber plantations began in the early 20th century.

[[File:Kandyan Chiefs in 1905.JPG|upright=1.4|thumb|left|British appointed [[Native headmen of Ceylon|Kandyan chief headmen]] in 1905.]]
By the end of the 19th century, a new educated [[social class]] transcending race and [[caste]] arose through British attempts to staff the [[Ceylon Civil Service]] and the legal, educational, engineering, and medical professions with natives. New leaders represented the various ethnic groups of the population in the [[Legislative Council of Ceylon|Ceylon Legislative Council]] on a communal basis. Buddhist and Hindu revivalists reacted against [[Christian missionary]] activities. The first two decades in the 20th century are noted by the unique harmony among Sinhalese and [[Tamils|Tamil]] political leadership, which has since been lost.

The [[1906 malaria outbreak in Ceylon]] actually started in the early 1900s, but the first case was documented in 1906.

In 1919, major Sinhalese and Tamil political organisations united to form the Ceylon National Congress, under the leadership of [[Ponnambalam Arunachalam]], pressing colonial masters for more constitutional reforms. But without massive popular support, and with the governor's encouragement for "communal representation" by creating a "Colombo seat" that dangled between Sinhalese and Tamils, the Congress lost momentum towards the mid-1920s.

The [[Donoughmore Constitution|Donoughmore reforms]] of 1931 repudiated the communal representation and introduced [[Universal suffrage|universal adult franchise]] (the franchise stood at 4% before the reforms). This step was strongly criticised by the Tamil political leadership, who realised that they would be reduced to a minority in the newly created [[State Council of Ceylon]], which succeeded the legislative council. In 1937, Tamil leader [[G. G. Ponnambalam]] demanded a 50–50 representation (50% for the Sinhalese and 50% for other ethnic groups) in the State Council. However, this demand was not met by the [[Soulbury Commission|Soulbury reforms]] of 1944–45.

[[File:SL Independence.jpg|thumb|The formal ceremony marking the start of self-rule, with the opening of the first parliament at [[Independence Square, Colombo|Independence Square]]]]
[[File:J. R. Jayawardene, President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka on June 20, 1984.jpg|thumb|197x197px|J. R. Jayewardene was the most influential political figure of Sri Lanka in the 1970s and 1980s.]]
The Soulbury constitution ushered in [[Dominion of Ceylon|dominion status]], with independence proclaimed on 4 February 1948. [[Don Stephen Senanayake|D. S. Senanayake]] became the first [[Prime Minister of Sri Lanka|Prime Minister of Ceylon]]. Prominent [[Tamils|Tamil]] leaders including Ponnambalam and [[Arunachalam Mahadeva]] joined his cabinet. The [[Royal Navy|British Royal Navy]] remained stationed at [[Trincomalee]] until 1956. A countrywide [[1953 Ceylonese Hartal|popular demonstration]] against withdrawal of the rice rations resulted in the resignation of prime minister [[Dudley Senanayake]].

[[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike]] was elected prime minister in 1956. His three-year rule had a profound influence through his self-proclaimed role of "defender of the besieged Sinhalese culture". He introduced the controversial [[Sinhala Only Act]], recognising [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] as the only official language of the government. Although partially reversed in 1958, the bill posed a grave concern for the Tamil community, which perceived in it a threat to their language and culture.

The [[Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi|Federal Party]] (FP) launched a movement of non-violent resistance ([[satyagraha]]) against the bill, which prompted Bandaranaike to reach an agreement ([[Bandaranaike–Chelvanayakam Pact]]) with [[S. J. V. Chelvanayakam]], leader of the FP, to resolve the looming ethnic conflict. The pact proved ineffective in the face of ongoing protests by opposition and the Buddhist clergy. The bill, together with various government [[Sri Lankan state-sponsored colonisation schemes|colonisation schemes]], contributed much towards the political rancour between Sinhalese and Tamil political leaders. Bandaranaike was [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike#Assassination|assassinated]] by an extremist Buddhist monk in 1959.

[[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]], the widow of Bandaranaike, took office as prime minister in 1960, and withstood an [[1962 Ceylonese coup d'état attempt|attempted coup d'état]] in 1962. During her second term as prime minister, the government instituted socialist economic policies, strengthening ties with the [[Soviet Union]] and China, while promoting a policy of non-alignment. In 1971, Ceylon experienced a [[1971 JVP insurrection|Marxist insurrection]], which was quickly suppressed. In 1972, the country became a [[republic]] named Sri Lanka, repudiating its dominion status. Prolonged minority grievances and the use of communal emotionalism as an election campaign weapon by both Sinhalese and Tamil leaders abetted a fledgling Tamil militancy in the north during the 1970s. The [[policy of standardisation]] by the Sirimavo government to rectify disparities created in university enrolment, which was in essence an [[affirmative action]] to assist geographically disadvantaged students to obtain tertiary education, resulted in reducing the proportion of Tamil students at university level and acted as the immediate catalyst for the rise of militancy. The assassination of [[Jaffna]] [[Mayor]] [[Alfred Duraiyappah]] in 1975 by the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) marked a crisis point.

The government of [[J. R. Jayawardene]] swept to power in 1977, defeating the [[United Front (Sri Lanka)|United Front]] government. Jayawardene introduced a [[Constitution of Sri Lanka|new constitution]], together with a [[free-market economy]] and a powerful [[Executive president|executive presidency]] modelled after that of France. It made Sri Lanka the first [[South Asia]]n country to [[Liberalism|liberalise]] its economy.

Lapses in foreign policy resulted in India strengthening the Tigers by providing arms and training. In 1987, the [[Indo-Sri Lanka Accord]] was signed and the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF) was deployed in northern Sri Lanka to stabilise the region by neutralising the LTTE. The same year, the [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna|JVP]] launched its [[1987–89 JVP Insurrection|second insurrection]] in Southern Sri Lanka, necessitating redeployment of the IPKF in 1990. In October 1990, the LTTE [[Expulsion of Muslims from the Northern province by LTTE|expelled Sri Lankan Moors]] (Muslims by religion) from northern Sri Lanka. In 2002, the Sri Lankan government and LTTE signed a Norwegian-mediated ceasefire agreement. From 1985 to 2006, the Sri Lankan government and Tamil insurgents held four rounds of peace talks without success. Both LTTE and the government resumed fighting in 2006, and the government officially backed out of the ceasefire in 2008. and re-established control of the entire country by the Sri Lankan Government. Overall, between 60,000 and 100,000 people were killed during the course of the 26 year long conflict.

[[2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings]] carried out by the terrorist group [[National Thowheeth Jama'ath]] on 21 April 2019 resulted in the brutal death of 261 innocent people. On 26 April 2019 an anti [[Sainthamaruthu shootout|terrorist operation]] was carried out against the National Thowheeth Jama'ath by the [[Sri Lanka Army]] with the operation being successful and National Thowheeth Jama'ath's insurgency ending.
[[File:Anti-government protest in Sri Lanka 2022.jpg|thumb|[[2022 Sri Lankan protests|Sri Lankans protesting]] in front of the [[Presidential Secretariat (Sri Lanka)|Presidential Secretariat]] in Colombo, 13 April 2022]]
Economic troubles in Sri Lanka began in 2019, when a [[2019–present Sri Lankan economic crisis|severe economic crisis]] occurred caused by rapidly increasing foreign debt, massive government budget deficits due to tax cuts, falling foreign remittances, a food crisis caused by mandatory organic farming along with a ban on chemical fertilisers, and a multitude of other factors. The Sri Lankan Government officially declared the ongoing crisis to be the worst [[Economy of Sri Lanka|economic crisis in the country]] in 73 years. In August 2021, a food emergency was declared. In June 2022, Prime Minister [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]] declared the collapse of the Sri Lankan economy in parliament. The crisis resulted in Sri Lanka defaulting on its $51 billion sovereign debt for the first time in its history, along with double-digit inflation, a crippling energy crisis that led to approximately 15 hour power cuts, severe fuel shortages leading to the suspension of fuel to all non-essential vehicles, and more such economic disorder. Due to the crisis, massive [[2022 Sri Lankan protests|street protests]] erupted all over the country, with protesters demanding the resignation of the President [[Gotabaya Rajapaksa]]. The protests culminated with the storming and siege of the [[President's House, Colombo|President's House]] on 9 July 2022, and resulted in President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fleeing to Singapore and later emailing his resignation to parliament, formally announcing his resignation and making him the first Sri Lankan president to resign in the middle of his term. On the same day the President's House was stormed, protesters besieged and stormed the [[115 Fifth Lane|private residence of the prime minister]] and burnt it down.

After [[Parliament of Sri Lanka|Parliament]] elected the new president as [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]] on [[2022 Sri Lankan presidential election|20 July 2022]], Wickremesinghe took oath as the ninth President of Sri Lanka. He implemented various economic reforms in efforts to stabilise Sri Lanka's economy, which has shown slight improvement since. On 23 September 2024, [[Anura Kumara Dissanayake]] was sworn in as Sri Lanka's new president after winning the presidential [[2024 Sri Lankan presidential election|election]] as a left-wing candidate. On 14 November 2024, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's [[National People's Power]] (NPP), a left-leaning alliance, received a two-thirds majority in parliament in Sri Lankan [[2024 Sri Lankan parliamentary election|parliamentary election.]]
