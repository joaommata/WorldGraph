===Indigenous peoples===
The [[Settlement of the Americas|first inhabitants of North America]] are generally hypothesized to have migrated from [[Siberia]] by way of the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] and arrived at least 14,000 years ago. The [[Paleo-Indian]] archeological sites at [[Old Crow Flats]] and [[Bluefish Caves]] are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada. The [[Technological and industrial history of Canada#The Stone Age: Fire (14,000 BC – AD 1600)|characteristics of Indigenous societies]] included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations. [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada]] include the [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]], [[Inuit]], and [[Métis people in Canada|Métis]], the last being of [[mixed-blood|mixed descent]] who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and their offspring subsequently developed their own identity.]]

The [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous population]] at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million, with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]]. As a consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent. The decline is attributed to several causes, including the [[Columbian exchange|transfer of European diseases]], to which they had no natural immunity, conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.

Although not without conflict, [[European Canadians]]' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of [[Former colonies and territories in Canada|European colonies in Canada]], particularly for their role in assisting European [[coureur des bois|coureurs des bois]] and [[voyageurs]] in their explorations of the continent during the [[North American fur trade]]. These early European interactions with First Nations would change from [[Peace and Friendship Treaties|friendship and peace treaties]] to the [[Numbered Treaties|dispossession of Indigenous lands through treaties]]. From the late 18th century, European Canadians forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a western Canadian society. [[Settler colonialism in Canada|Settler colonialism]] reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A period of redress began with the formation of a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|reconciliation commission]] by the [[Government of Canada]] in 2008. This included acknowledgment of [[Canadian genocide of Indigenous peoples|cultural genocide]], [[Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement|settlement agreements]],

===European colonization===

It is believed that the first documented European to explore the east coast of Canada was [[Vikings|Norse]] explorer [[Leif Erikson]]. In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] on the northern tip of [[Newfoundland]]. No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when seafarer [[John Cabot]] explored and claimed Canada's [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic coast]] in the name of [[Henry VII of England]]. In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] where, on July 24, he planted a {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} cross bearing the words, "long live the King of France", and took possession of the territory New France in the name of [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]]. The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the [[Basques|Basque]] and [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese]] establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast. In general, early settlements during the [[Age of Discovery]] appear to have been [[Population of Canada#Ephemeral European settlements|short-lived]] due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia.

In 1583, Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]], by the [[royal prerogative]] of Queen [[Elizabeth I]], founded [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's, Newfoundland]], as the first North American [[English overseas possessions|English seasonal camp]]. In 1600, the French established their first seasonal trading post at [[Tadoussac]] along the Saint Lawrence. French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at [[Port-Royal (Acadia)|Port Royal]] (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608). Among the [[French colonization of the Americas|colonists]] of New France, ''[[French Canadians|Canadiens]]'' extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and [[Acadians]] settled the present-day [[The Maritimes|Maritimes]], while fur traders and [[Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery|Catholic missionaries]] explored the [[Great Lakes]], [[Hudson Bay]], and the [[Mississippi watershed]] to [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. The [[Beaver Wars]] broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade.

The English established additional settlements in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in 1610 along with settlements in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to the south. A series of [[French and Indian Wars|four wars]] erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the [[Seven Years' War]]. Mainland [[Nova Scotia]] came under British rule with the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]] and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War.

===British North America===
[[File:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of General Wolfe dying in front of the British flag while attended by officers and native allies|[[Benjamin West]]'s ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1771) dramatizes [[James Wolfe]]'s death during the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] at [[Quebec City]].]]

The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] established First Nation treaty rights, created the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]] out of New France, and annexed [[Cape Breton Island]] to Nova Scotia. To avert conflict in [[Quebec]], the British Parliament passed the [[Quebec Act]] 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and [[Ohio River|Ohio Valley]]. More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule. It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and [[Law of France|French civil law]] there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies. The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the [[American Revolution]]. The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of [[Loyalists]], the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. [[New Brunswick]] was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the incorporation of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], as Canada's first city. To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in Central Canada, the [[Constitutional Act 1791|Constitutional Act of 1791]] divided the province of Canada into French-speaking Lower Canada (later [[Quebec]]) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later [[Ontario#Canada West (1841–1867)|Ontario]]), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.

The Canadas were the main front in the [[War of 1812]] between the United States and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed. Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over {{formatnum:960000}} arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850. New arrivals included refugees escaping the [[Great Irish Famine]] as well as [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking Scots displaced by the [[Highland Clearances]]. Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891. The [[Durham Report]] subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture. The signing of the [[Oregon Treaty]] by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the [[Oregon boundary dispute]], extending the border westward along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]]. This paved the way for British colonies on [[Colony of Vancouver Island|Vancouver Island (1849)]] and in [[Colony of British Columbia (1858–1866)|British Columbia (1858)]]. The Anglo-Russian [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825)]] established the border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US [[Alaska Purchase]] of 1867, disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska–Yukon and Alaska–British Columbia border.

===Confederation and expansion===
[[File:Canada provinces evolution 2.gif|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Refer to caption|Animated map showing [[Territorial evolution of Canada|the growth and change of Canada's provinces and territories]] since Confederation in 1867]]

Following three constitutional conferences, the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]]'' officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: [[Ontario]], Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Canada assumed control of [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] to form the [[Northwest Territories]], where the Métis' grievances ignited the [[Red River Rebellion]] and the creation of the province of [[Manitoba]] in July 1870. British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which [[Colony of British Columbia (1866–1871)|had been united]] in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years, while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873. In 1898, during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory. [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] became provinces in 1905.

To open [[Western Canada|the West]] and encourage European immigration, the Government of Canada sponsored the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]), passed the ''[[Dominion Lands Act]]'' to regulate settlement and established the [[North-West Mounted Police]] to assert authority over the territory. This [[Post-Confederation Canada (1867–1914)#Expansion|period of westward expansion]] and [[National Policy|nation building]] resulted in the displacement of many [[Plains Indians|Indigenous peoples of the Canadian Prairies]] to "[[Indian reserve]]s", clearing the way for ethnic European [[block settlement]]s. This caused the collapse of the [[History of bison conservation in Canada#Plains bison|Plains Bison in western Canada]] and the introduction of European [[Agriculture in Canada|cattle farms and wheat fields]] dominating the land. The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands. The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves. During this time, Canada introduced the ''[[Indian Act]]'' extending its control over the First Nations to education, government and legal rights.

Because Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the British North America Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought [[Military history of Canada during World War I|Canada into the First World War]]. Volunteers sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] later became part of the [[Canadian Corps]], which played a substantial role in the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] and other major engagements of the war. The [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]] erupted when the [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist]] Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with [[conscription]] was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers. In 1919, Canada joined the [[League of Nations]] independently of Britain,

The [[Great Depression in Canada]] during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country. In response to the downturn, the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a [[welfare state]] (as pioneered by [[Tommy Douglas]]) in the 1940s and 1950s. On the advice of Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], [[Declaration of war by Canada#Nazi Germany|war with Germany was declared]] effective September 10, 1939, by King [[George VI]], seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence. Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 [[Dieppe Raid]], the [[Allied invasion of Italy]], the [[Normandy landings]], the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]], and the [[Battle of the Scheldt]] in 1944. Despite another [[Conscription Crisis of 1944|conscription crisis in Quebec in 1944]], Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.

===Contemporary era===
The financial crisis of the Great Depression led the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a [[Crown colony]] ruled by a British governor. After two [[1948 Newfoundland referendums|referendums]], Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.

Canada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new [[Canadian identity]], marked by the adoption of the [[Flag of Canada|maple leaf flag]] in 1965, the implementation of [[official bilingualism]] (English and French) in 1969, and the institution of [[Multiculturalism#Canada|official multiculturalism]] in 1971. [[Socially democratic]] programs were also instituted, such as [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]], the [[Canada Pension Plan]], and [[Student financial aid in Canada|Canada Student Loans]]; though, provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.
[[File:Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (English).jpg|thumb|A copy of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''|alt=refer to caption]]

Finally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the ''Canada Act 1982'', the [[patriation]] of Canada's constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country under [[Monarchy of Canada|its own monarchy]]. In 1999, [[Nunavut]] became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government.

At the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s, giving birth to a secular [[Quebec nationalism|nationalist]] movement. The radical [[Front de libération du Québec]] (FLQ) ignited the [[October Crisis]] with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970, and the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|{{Not a typo|sovereigntist}}]] [[Parti Québécois]] was elected in 1976, organizing an [[1980 Quebec referendum|unsuccessful referendum]] on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the [[Meech Lake Accord]] failed in 1990. This led to the formation of the [[Bloc Québécois]] in Quebec and the invigoration of the [[Reform Party of Canada]] in the West. A [[1995 Quebec referendum|second referendum]] followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent. In 1997, the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] ruled [[Reference Re Secession of Quebec|unilateral secession]] by a province would be unconstitutional, and the [[Clarity Act]] was passed by Parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation. the [[École Polytechnique massacre]] in 1989, a [[School shooting|university shooting]] targeting female students; and the [[Oka Crisis]] of 1990, the first of a number of violent confrontations between provincial governments and Indigenous groups. Canada joined the [[Gulf War]] in 1990 and was active in [[List of Canadian peacekeeping missions|several peacekeeping missions]] in the 1990s, including operations in the [[Balkans]] during and after the [[Yugoslav Wars]], and in [[Somalia]], resulting in an incident that has been described as "[[Somalia affair|the darkest era in the history of the Canadian military]]". Canada sent [[Canada in the War in Afghanistan|troops to Afghanistan in 2001]], resulting in the largest amount of [[Canadian Forces casualties in Afghanistan|Canadian deaths]] for any single military mission since the [[Canada in the Korean War|Korean War]] in the early 1950s.

In 2011, Canadian forces participated in the [[NATO]]-led intervention into the [[First Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] and also became involved in battling the [[Islamic State]] insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s. The [[COVID-19 pandemic in Canada]] began on January 27, 2020, causing widespread social and economic disruption. In 2021, [[Canadian Indian residential school gravesites|possible gravesites of Indigenous children]] were found near former [[Canadian Indian residential school system|Canadian residential schools]], highlighting the [[Canadian genocide of Indigenous peoples|cultural genocide against Indigenous peoples]]. A [[2025 United States trade war with Canada and Mexico|trade war involving the United States]] began on February 1, 2025, when U.S. president [[Donald Trump]] signed [[Second Trump tariffs|orders imposing tariffs]] on goods entering the United States.
