The area that is now Finland was settled in, at the latest, around 8,500 BC during the [[Stone Age]] towards the end of the [[last glacial period]]. The [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] the first settlers left behind present characteristics that are shared with those found in [[Estonia]], Russia, and Norway. The earliest people were [[hunter-gatherer]]s, using stone tools.

The first pottery appeared in 5200&nbsp;BC, when the [[Comb Ceramic culture]] was introduced. The area of present-day Finland was in the western limits of the culture, which produced pottery with a distinct [[Comb Ceramic|comb pattern]].{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=2}} The arrival of the [[Corded Ware culture]] in the south of coastal Finland between 3000 and 2500 BC may have coincided with the start of agriculture. Even with the introduction of agriculture, hunting and fishing continued to be important parts of the subsistence economy.

Based upon linguistic evidence, Finland seems to have been primarily inhabited by speakers of [[Paleo-European languages|Paleo-European]] languages prior to the migration of the Finno-Ugric peoples, which influenced the [[Sámi languages]] who were the first Finno-Ugric peoples to move towards Finland. These languages have been divided into [[Paleo-Laplandic languages]] which was spoken around Lappland, and the Lakelandic languages spoken in most of modern-day Finland. Many toponyms in Finland such as Inari, Saimaa, Päijänne and Imatra seem to derive from these Paleo-European languages, as their etymologies are not explainable by either Indo-European or Finno-Ugric roots.

In the [[Bronze Age]], permanent all-year-round cultivation and [[animal husbandry]] spread, but the cold climate slowed the change. The [[Seima-Turbino phenomenon]] brought the first bronze artefacts to the region and possibly also the [[Finno-Ugric languages]]. Commercial contacts that had so far mostly been to Estonia started to extend to Scandinavia. Domestic manufacture of bronze artefacts started 1300 BC.

In the [[Iron Age]], population grew. [[Finland Proper]] was the most densely populated area. Commercial contacts in the [[Baltic Sea]] region grew and extended during the eighth and ninth centuries. Main exports from Finland were furs, slaves, [[castoreum]], and falcons to European courts. Imports included silk and other fabrics, jewelry, [[Ulfberht swords]], and, in lesser extent, glass. Production of iron started approximately in 500 BC. At the end of the ninth century, indigenous artefact culture, especially weapons and women's jewelry, had more common local features than ever before. This has been interpreted to be expressing common Finnish identity.

An early form of [[Finnic languages]] spread to the Baltic Sea region approximately 1900 BC. Common Finnic language was spoken around [[Gulf of Finland]] 2000 years ago. The dialects from which the modern-day Finnish language was developed came into existence during the Iron Age. Contacts with the ancient [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] and eastern [[Germanic peoples]] greatly influenced the [[Proto-Finnic language]].{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=2}} Although distantly related, the [[Sámi people]] retained the hunter-gatherer lifestyle longer than the Finns. The Sámi cultural identity and the [[Sámi languages]] have survived in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], the northernmost province.

===Swedish era===
{{Main|Finland under Swedish rule}}
[[File:Erik den helige och biskop Henrik.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eric IX of Sweden]] and [[Henry (bishop of Finland)|Bishop Henry]] en [[First Swedish Crusade|route to Finland]]. Late medieval depiction from [[Uppland]].]]
The 12th and 13th centuries were a violent time in the northern Baltic Sea. The [[Livonian Crusade]] was ongoing and the [[Finnish tribes]] such as the [[Tavastians]] and [[Karelia (historical province of Finland)|Karelians]] were in [[Early Finnish wars|frequent conflicts]] with [[Republic of Novgorod|Novgorod]] and with each other. Also, during the 12th and 13th centuries several crusades from the Catholic realms of the Baltic Sea area were made against the Finnish tribes. [[Danes]] waged at least three crusades to Finland, in 1187 or slightly earlier, in 1191 and in 1202, and [[Swedes]], possibly the so-called [[Second Swedish Crusade|second Crusade to Finland]], in 1249 against Tavastians and the [[Third Swedish Crusade|third Crusade to Finland]] in 1293 against the Karelians. The so-called [[First Swedish Crusade|first Crusade to Finland]], possibly in 1155, most likely never occurred.

As a result of the Crusades, mostly with the Second Swedish Crusade led by [[Birger Jarl]], and the [[Swedish colonisation of Finland|colonization of some Finnish coastal areas]] with Christian [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedes]] during the Middle Ages, Finland gradually became part of the kingdom of Sweden and the sphere of influence of the [[Catholic Church]]. Under Sweden, Finland was annexed as part of the cultural order of [[Western Europe]]. The Swedes built fortresses in [[Häme]] and [[Turku]], while a Swedish royal council was instituted, an administrative structure and fiscal apparatus was created, and law codes were codified during the reigns of [[Magnus Ladulås]] (1275–1290) and [[Magnus Eriksson]] (1319–1364).{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=9}} As a result, the Finnish lands were firmly integrated into the Swedish realm.{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=9}}

[[File:Swedish Empire.svg|thumb|left|The [[Swedish Empire]] following the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] of 1658]]
[[Finland Swedish|Swedish]] was the dominant language of the nobility, administration, and education; [[Finnish language|Finnish]] was chiefly a language for the [[peasant]]ry, clergy, and local [[court]]s in predominantly Finnish-speaking areas. During the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[Finns]] gradually converted to [[Lutheranism]]. The end of the [[Kalmar Union]] ushered in an era of religious, social, and economic changes.{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=28}} [[Gustav Vasa]] ({{reign|1523|1560}}) made his second son [[John III of Sweden|Johan]] the [[duke of Finland]], while [[Gustavus Adolphus|Gustav Adolf]] ({{reign|1611|1632}}) created the office of [[Governor-General of Finland|governor-general]] for Finland as part of his restructuring of the administration of the Swedish realm.{{sfn|Kirby|2006|pp=37–38}}

In the 16th century, a bishop and Lutheran Reformer [[Mikael Agricola]] published the first written works in Finnish; and Finland's current capital city, [[Helsinki]], was founded by King [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] in 1555. The first university in Finland, the [[Royal Academy of Turku]], was established by Queen [[Christina of Sweden]] at the proposal of Count [[Per Brahe the Younger|Per Brahe]] in 1640.

The Finns reaped a reputation in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) as a well-trained [[cavalrymen]] called "[[Hakkapeliitta]]". Finland suffered a severe [[Great Famine of Finland (1695–1697)|famine in 1695–1697]], during which about one third of the Finnish population died, It is estimated that almost an entire generation of young men was lost during the Great Wrath, due mainly to the destruction of homes and farms, and the burning of Helsinki.

===Grand Duchy of Finland===
{{Main|Grand Duchy of Finland}}
The Swedish era ended with the [[Finnish War]] of 1809. On 29 March 1809, after being conquered by the armies of [[Alexander I of Russia]], Finland became [[Grand Duchy of Finland|an autonomous grand duchy]] within the [[Russian Empire]], as recognised by the [[Diet of Porvoo]]. This situation continued until the end of 1917.

[[File:Suomineito.jpg|thumb|190px|right|[[Edvard Isto]], ''[[The Attack (painting)|The Attack]]'', 1899. The [[Russian eagle]] is attacking the [[Finnish Maiden]], trying to steal her book of laws.]]
Although Swedish was still widely spoken, the Finnish language began to gain recognition during this period. From the 1860s, a strong Finnish [[Ethnic nationalism|nationalist movement]], known as the [[Fennoman movement]], grew. One of the movement's most prominent leaders was the philosopher and politician [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman|J.V. Snellman]], who worked to stabilise the status of the Finnish language and its own currency, the [[Finnish markka]], in the Grand Duchy of Finland. Milestones included the publication of what would become Finland's [[national epic]], the ''[[Kalevala]]'', in 1835 and the legal equality of the Finnish language with Swedish in 1892. In the spirit of [[Adolf Ivar Arwidsson]] – "we are not Swedes, we do not want to become Russians, so let us be Finns" – a Finnish national identity was established. Nevertheless, there was no real independence movement in Finland until the early 20th century.

The [[Finnish famine of 1866–1868]] occurred after freezing temperatures in early September devastated crops and killed around 15% of the population, making it one of the worst [[famine]]s in European history. The famine led the Russian Empire to relax financial regulations, and investment increased in the following decades. Economic development was rapid. The [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) per capita was still half of that of the United States and a third of that of Britain. and [[Socialism|socialists]], partly driven by a declaration called the'' [[February Manifesto]]'' by the last tsar of the Russian Empire, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], on 15 February 1899.

===Civil war and early independence===
{{Main|Independence of Finland|Finnish Civil War}}
After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, Finland's position as a Grand Duchy under the rule of the Russian Empire was questioned. The [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish parliament]], controlled by the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]], passed the so-called [[Independence of Finland#Power act|Power Act]] to give the parliament supreme authority. This was rejected by the [[Russian Provisional Government]], which decided to dissolve the parliament. New elections were held in which the right-wing parties won by a small majority. Some social democrats refused to accept the result, claiming that the dissolution of parliament and the subsequent elections were extra-legal. The two almost equally powerful political blocs, the right-wing parties and the Social Democratic Party, were deeply divided.

The [[October Revolution]] in Russia changed the geopolitical situation once again. Suddenly the right-wing parties in Finland began to reconsider their decision to block the transfer of supreme executive power from the Russian government to Finland when the [[Bolsheviks]] came to power in Russia. The right-wing government, led by Prime Minister [[P. E. Svinhufvud]], presented the [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on 4 December 1917, which was officially approved by the Finnish Parliament on 6 December. The [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR), led by [[Vladimir Lenin]] was the first country to recognise Finland's independence on 4 January 1918.

On 27 January 1918, the government began to disarm the Russian forces in [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia]]. The socialists took control of southern Finland and Helsinki, but the white government continued in exile in [[Vaasa]]. This led to a short but bitter [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]]. The [[White Guard (Finland)|Whites]], backed by [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]], prevailed over the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]] and their self-proclaimed [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic]]. After the war, tens of thousands of Reds were interned in camps where thousands were executed or died of malnutrition and disease. A deep social and political enmity was sown between the Reds and the Whites that would last until the [[Winter War]] and beyond. The civil war and the activist expeditions to Soviet Russia in 1918–1920, known as the "[[Heimosodat|Kinship Wars]]", strained relations with the East.

After a [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|brief experiment with monarchy]], when an attempt to make [[Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse]] the king of Finland failed, a [[Constitution of Finland|republican constitution]] was adopted and Finland became a [[presidential republic]], with [[K. J. Ståhlberg]] elected as its first president on 25 July 1919. A [[Civic nationalism|liberal nationalist]] with a legal background, Ståhlberg anchored the state in [[liberal democracy]], promoted the [[rule of law]] and initiated internal reforms. Finland was also one of the first European countries to strongly promote [[Women's rights|women's equality]], with [[Miina Sillanpää]] becoming the first female minister in Finnish history in [[Tanner Cabinet|Väinö Tanner's cabinet]] in 1926–1927. The Finnish-Russian border was established in 1920 by the [[Treaty of Tartu (Finland–Russia)|Treaty of Tartu]], which largely followed the historical border but gave Finland [[Pechengsky District|Pechenga]] ({{langx|fi|Petsamo}}) and its [[Barents Sea]] port.

===World War II===
{{Main|Finland in World War II}}

The [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]] signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] on 23 August 1939, which divided Europe into spheres of influence between the two dictatorships. In accordance with the pact, the Soviet Union launched the [[Winter War]] on 30 November 1939 in order to annex Finland. The [[Finnish Democratic Republic]] was set up by [[Joseph Stalin]] at the beginning of the war to govern Finland after Soviet conquest. There was widespread international condemnation of the unprovoked attack and it led to the Soviet Union being expelled from the [[League of Nations]]. The [[Red Army]] was defeated in numerous battles, most notably the [[Battle of Suomussalmi]]. After two months of negligible progress on the battlefield, as well as heavy losses in men and material, Soviet forces began to advance in February and [[Battle of Vyborg Bay (1940)|reached Vyborg]] ({{langx|fi|Viipuri}}) in March. The [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] was signed on 12 March 1940, and the war ended the following day. Finland had defended its independence, but ceded 9% of its territory to the Soviet Union. Between 1939 and 1944, some 400,000 people were [[Evacuation of Finnish Karelia|evacuated from Karelia]]. 

[[File:Finnish areas ceded in 1944.png|thumb|upright|Areas ceded by Finland to the [[Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]]. The [[Porkkala]] land lease was returned to Finland in 1956.]]
Hostilities resumed in June 1941 with the [[Continuation War]], when Finland allied itself with Germany following the [[Operation Barbarossa|latter's invasion of the Soviet Union]]; the main aim was to regain the territory lost to the Soviets barely a year earlier. Finnish troops [[Finnish military administration in Eastern Karelia|occupied Eastern Karelia]] from 1941 to 1944 and assisted the German army in the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. The massive Soviet [[Vyborg–Petrozavodsk offensive]] in the summer of 1944 led to a breakthrough until the Finns finally repulsed it at [[Battle of Tali–Ihantala|Tali–Ihantala]]. This partial Soviet success led to a stalemate and later an [[Moscow Armistice|armistice]]. This was followed by the [[Lapland War]] of 1944–1945, when Finland fought retreating German forces in northern Finland. 

The [[Moscow Armistice|Armistice]] and [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|treaty]] signed with the Soviet Union in 1944 and 1948 included Finnish obligations, restraints, and reparations, as well as further territorial concessions. As a result of the two wars, Finland lost 12% of its land area, 20% of its industrial capacity, its second largest city, [[Vyborg]] ({{langx|fi|Viipuri}}), and the ice-free port of [[Liinakhamari]] ({{langx|fi|Liinahamari}}). However, the country avoided occupation by Soviet forces and managed to retain its independence. Along with [[Great Britain]], Finland emerged from the war as one of the only European countries to have taken part in hostilities that was never occupied and managed to preserve its democracy throughout.

In the decades following World War II, the [[Communist Party of Finland|Communists]] were a strong political party. Furthermore, the Soviet Union persuaded Finland to refuse [[Marshall Plan]] aid. However, in the hope of preserving Finland's independence, the United States provided secret development aid and supported the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]].

===After the war===
[[File:Urho-Kekkonen-1975b (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Urho Kekkonen]] was Finland's longest-serving president in 1956–1982.]]
The development of trade with the Western powers, such as the United Kingdom, and the payment of reparations to the Soviet Union led to Finland's transformation from a primarily [[agrarian society]] to an industrialised one. [[Valmet]], originally a shipyard and then several metal workshops, was established to produce materials for war reparations. After the reparations were paid, Finland continued to trade with the Soviet Union as part of [[bilateral trade]].

In 1950, 46% of Finnish workers were employed in agriculture and a third lived in urban areas, but new jobs in manufacturing, services and trade quickly attracted people to the cities. The average number of births per woman fell from a [[baby boom]] peak of 3.5 in 1947 to 1.5 in 1973. As the baby boomers entered the workforce, the economy failed to create jobs fast enough and hundreds of thousands emigrated to more industrialised Sweden, with emigration peaking in 1969 and 1970.

[[File:2018_Helsinki,_Finland_(41401402010).jpg|thumb|left|[[Alvar Aalto]]'s [[Finlandia Hall]] hosted the [[Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in 1975.]]
A [[market economy]] was maintained in Finland. Various industries benefited from trade privileges with the Soviets. Economic growth was rapid in the post-war period, and by 1975 Finland's GDP per capita was the 15th highest in the world. During the 1970s and 1980s, Finland built one of the most extensive [[welfare state]]s in the world. In 1973, Finland negotiated a treaty with the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) that reduced tariffs, enhancing trade relations.

Miscalculated macroeconomic decisions, a [[Finnish banking crisis of 1990s|banking crisis]], the collapse of its largest trading partner, the Soviet Union, and a global economic downturn caused a deep recession in Finland in the [[Early 1990s depression in Finland|early 1990s]]. The recession bottomed out in 1993 and Finland enjoyed more than a decade of steady economic growth. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Finland began to integrate more closely with the West. Finland [[1995 enlargement of the European Union|joined]] the [[European Union]] in 1995 and the [[euro zone]] in 1999. Much of the economic growth of the late 1990s was fuelled by the success of mobile phone manufacturer [[Nokia]].

===21st century===

The Finnish people elected [[Tarja Halonen]] in the [[2000 Finnish presidential election|2000 Presidential election]], making her the first female President of Finland. Her predecessor, President [[Martti Ahtisaari]], later won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2008. The [[2008 financial crisis]] paralysed <!--DO NOT change to paralyzed, see [[Oxford spelling#Defining feature]].--> Finland's exports in 2008, leading to weaker economic growth throughout the decade. [[Sauli Niinistö]] was elected President of Finland from 2012 until 2024, when [[Alexander Stubb]] took over.

Finnish support for [[NATO]] rose sharply after the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022]]. Before February 2022, opinion polls showed a narrow but decisive majority against NATO membership; by April, a supermajority was in favour of membership. On 11 May 2022, Finland signed a mutual security pact with the United Kingdom. On 12 May, Finland's president and Prime Minister called for NATO membership "without delay". Subsequently, on 17 May, the Finnish Parliament voted 188–8 in favour of Finland's accession to NATO. [[Finland–NATO relations|Finland became a member of NATO]] on 4 April 2023.
