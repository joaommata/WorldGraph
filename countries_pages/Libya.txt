=== Ancient Libya ===
{{Main|Ancient Libya|Libu}}
[[File:Leptis Magna Arch of Septimus Severus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leptis Magna]]]]
The coastal plain of Libya was inhabited by [[Neolithic]] peoples from as early as 8000 BC. The [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] ancestors of the [[Berber people]] are assumed to have spread into the area by the [[Late Bronze Age]]. The earliest known name of such a tribe was the [[Garamantes]], based in [[Germa]]. The [[Phoenicia]]ns were the first to establish trading posts in Libya. By the 5th century BC, the greatest of the Phoenician colonies, [[Carthage]], had extended its [[hegemony]] across much of North Africa, where a distinctive civilisation, known as [[Punic]], came into being.

In 630 BC, the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] colonised the area around [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]] in Eastern Libya and founded the city of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]. Within 200 years, four more important Greek cities were established in the area that became known as [[Cyrenaica]]. The area was home to the renowned philosophy school of the [[Cyrenaics]]. In 525 BC the [[Persian people|Persian]] army of [[Cambyses II]] overran Cyrenaica, which for the next two centuries remained under Persian or Egyptian rule. [[Alexander the Great]] ended Persian rule in 331 BC and received tribute from Cyrenaica. Eastern Libya again fell under the control of the Greeks, this time as part of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]].

After the fall of [[Carthage]] the Romans did not immediately occupy [[Tripolitania]] (the region around Tripoli), but left it instead under control of the kings of [[Numidia]], until the coastal cities asked and obtained its protection. [[Ptolemy Apion]], the last Greek ruler, bequeathed Cyrenaica to Rome, which formally annexed the region in 74 BC and joined it to Crete as [[Creta et Cyrenaica|a Roman province]]. As part of the [[Africa Nova]] province, Tripolitania was prosperous, and reached a golden age in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, when the city of [[Leptis Magna]], home to the [[Severan dynasty]], was at its height.

On the eastern side, Cyrenaica's first Christian communities were established by the time of the Emperor [[Claudius]]. It was heavily devastated during the [[Kitos War]] and almost depopulated of Greeks and Jews alike. Although repopulated by [[Trajan]] with military colonies, from then started its decline. Libya was early to convert to [[Nicene Christianity]] and was the home of [[Pope Victor I]]; however, Libya was also home to many non-Nicene varieties of early Christianity, such as [[Arianism]] and [[Donatism]].

=== Islamic Libya: 647–1556 ===
{{Main|Islamic Tripolitania and Cyrenaica}}
[[File:Awjila (Libia) - The Mosque of Atiq.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Atiq Mosque, Awjila|Atiq Mosque]] in [[Awjila]] is the oldest mosque in the [[Sahara]].]]
Under the command of [[Amr ibn al-As]], the [[Rashidun army]] conquered [[Cyrenaica]]. In 647 an army led by [[Abdullah ibn Saad]] took Tripoli from the Byzantines definitively. The [[Fezzan]] was conquered by [[Uqba ibn Nafi]] in 663. The Berber tribes of the hinterland accepted Islam, however they resisted Arab political rule. For the next several decades, Libya was under the purview of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Caliph of Damascus]] until the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] overthrew the Umayyads in 750, and Libya came under the rule of Baghdad. When Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] appointed [[Ibrahim I ibn al-Aghlab|Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab]] as his governor of [[Ifriqiya]] in 800, Libya enjoyed considerable local autonomy under the [[Aghlabid]] dynasty. By the 10th century, the Shiite [[Fatimids]] controlled Western Libya, and ruled the entire region in 972 and appointed [[Bologhine ibn Ziri]] as governor.

Ibn Ziri's Berber [[Zirid dynasty]] ultimately broke away from the Shiite Fatimids, and recognised the Sunni Abbasids of Baghdad as rightful Caliphs. In retaliation, the Fatimids brought about the migration of thousands from mainly two Arab Qaisi tribes, the [[Banu Sulaym]] and [[Banu Hilal]] to [[North Africa]]. This act drastically altered the fabric of the Libyan countryside, and cemented the cultural and linguistic Arabisation of the region.

Zirid rule in Tripolitania was short-lived though, and already in 1001 the Berbers of the [[Banu Khazrun]] broke away. Tripolitania remained under their control until 1146, when the region was overtaken by the [[Normans of Sicily]]. For the next 50 years, Tripolitania was the scene of numerous battles among [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]], the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] rulers and insurgents of the [[Banu Ghaniya]]. Later, a general of the Almohads, Muhammad ibn Abu Hafs, ruled Libya from 1207 to 1221 before the later establishment of the Tunisian [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsid Kingdom]] independent from the Almohads. In the 14th century, the [[Banu Thabit]] dynasty ruled Tripolitania before reverting to direct Hafsid control. By the 16th century, the Hafsids became increasingly caught up in the power struggle between Spain and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

After Abbasid control was weakened, Cyrenaica was under Egypt-based states such as the [[Tulunids]], [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshidids]], Ayyubids, and [[Mamluk Sultanate|Mamluks]] before Ottoman conquest in 1517. [[Fezzan]] acquired independence under Awlad Muhammad dynasty after [[Kanem–Bornu Empire|Kanem]] rule. Ottomans finally conquered Fezzan between 1556 and 1577.

=== Ottoman Tripolitania: 1556–1911 ===
{{Main|Ottoman Tripolitania}}
[[File:Capture of Tripoli by the Ottomans 1551.jpg|thumb|The [[Siege of Tripoli (1551)|siege of Tripoli]] in 1551 allowed the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottomans]] to capture the city from the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John]].]]

After a successful invasion of Tripoli by [[Habsburg Spain]] in 1510, and its handover to the [[Knights Hospitaller]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] admiral [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] took control of Libya in 1551. His successor [[Turgut Reis]] was named the [[Bey]] of Tripoli and later [[Pasha of Tripoli]] in 1556. By 1565, administrative authority as regent in Tripoli was vested in a ''[[pasha]]'' appointed directly by the ''[[sultan]]'' in [[Constantinople]]/[[Istanbul]]. In the 1580s, the rulers of [[Fezzan]] gave their allegiance to the sultan, and although Ottoman authority was absent in [[Cyrenaica]], a ''bey'' was stationed in Benghazi late in the next century to act as agent of the government in Tripoli. European [[Barbary slave trade|slaves]] and large numbers of enslaved Blacks transported from Sudan were also a feature of everyday life in Tripoli. In 1551, [[Turgut Reis]] enslaved almost the entire population of the Maltese island of [[Gozo]], some 5,000 people, sending them to Libya.

In time, real power came to rest with the pasha's corps of [[janissaries]]. In 1611 the ''[[dey]]s'' staged a coup against the pasha, and Dey Sulayman Safar was appointed as head of government. For the next hundred years, a series of ''deys'' effectively ruled Tripolitania. The two most important Deys were [[Mehmed Saqizli]] (r. 1631–49) and [[Osman Saqizli]] (r. 1649–72), both also Pasha, who ruled effectively the region. The latter conquered also Cyrenaica.
[[File:La città di Tripoli, capitale del regno dello stesso nome sulla costa di Barbaria, nell'Africa, 1766 – BEIC IE8943210.jpg|thumb|left|A view of Tripoli, {{Circa|1766}}]]
Lacking direction from the Ottoman government, Tripoli lapsed into a period of military anarchy during which coup followed coup and few deys survived in office more than a year. One such coup was led by Turkish officer [[Ahmed Karamanli]]. The [[Karamanli dynasty|Karamanlis]] ruled from 1711 until 1835 mainly in Tripolitania, and had influence in Cyrenaica and Fezzan as well by the mid-18th century. Ahmed's successors proved to be less capable than himself, however, the region's delicate balance of power allowed the Karamanli. The [[1793–95 Tripolitanian civil war]] occurred in those years. In 1793, Turkish officer [[Trabluslu Ali Pasha|Ali Pasha]] deposed Hamet Karamanli and briefly restored Tripolitania to Ottoman rule. Hamet's brother [[Yusuf Karamanli|Yusuf]] (r. 1795–1832) re-established Tripolitania's independence. In 1816, Yusuf ordered the [[Al-Jawazi massacre|massacre of the al-Jawazi tribe]]. 
[[File:Decatur Boarding the Tripolitan Gunboat.jpg|thumb|U.S. naval officer [[Stephen Decatur]] boarding a Tripolitan gunboat during the [[First Barbary War]], 1804]]
In the early 19th century war broke out between the United States and Tripolitania, and a series of battles ensued in what came to be known as the [[First Barbary War]] and the [[Second Barbary War]]. By 1819, the various treaties of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] had forced the Barbary states to give up piracy almost entirely, and Tripolitania's economy began to crumble. As Yusuf weakened, factions sprung up around his three sons. Civil war soon resulted.

Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]] sent in troops ostensibly to restore order, marking the end of both the Karamanli dynasty and an independent Tripolitania. Order was not recovered easily, and the revolt of the Libyan under Abd-El-Gelil and Gûma ben Khalifa lasted until the death of the latter in 1858. The second period of direct Ottoman rule saw administrative changes, and greater order in the governance of the three provinces of Libya. Ottoman rule finally reasserted to Fezzan between 1850 and 1875 for earning income from Saharan commerce.

=== Italian colonisation and Allied occupation (1911–1951) ===
{{Main|Italian Tripolitania|Italian Cyrenaica|Italian Libya}}
{{See also|Italian colonization of Libya}}
[[File:Omar Mukhtar 13.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|[[Omar Mukhtar]] was a prominent leader of Libyan resistance in Cyrenaica against Italian colonisation.]]
After the [[Italo-Turkish War]] (1911–1912), Italy simultaneously turned the three regions into colonies. From 1912 to 1927, the territory of Libya was known as [[Italian Libya|Italian North Africa]]. From 1927 to 1934, the territory was split into two colonies, [[Italian Cyrenaica]] and [[Italian Tripolitania]], run by Italian governors. Some 150,000 Italians settled in Libya, constituting roughly 20% of the total population.

[[Omar Mukhtar]] rose to prominence as a [[Libyan resistance movement|resistance leader]] against Italian colonisation and became a national hero despite his capture and execution on 16 September 1931. His face is currently printed on the Libyan ten dinar note in memory and recognition of his patriotism. Another prominent resistance leader, Idris al-Mahdi as-Senussi (later [[Idris of Libya|King Idris I]]), Emir of Cyrenaica, continued to lead the Libyan resistance until the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]].

The so-called "[[pacification of Libya]]" by the Italians resulted in mass deaths of the indigenous people in Cyrenaica, killing approximately one quarter of Cyrenaica's population of 225,000. [[Ilan Pappé]] estimates that between 1928 and 1932 the Italian military "killed half the Bedouin population (directly or through disease and starvation in [[Italian concentration camps in Libya]])."
[[File:Cartolina Giovanni Pastorelli.jpg|thumb|Italian propaganda postcard depicting the [[Italian invasion of Libya]] in 1911]]

In 1934, Italy combined [[Cyrenaica]], [[Tripolitania]] and [[Fezzan]] and adopted the name "Libya" (used by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] for all of [[North Africa]] except [[Egypt]]) for the unified colony, with [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]] as its [[Capital city|capital]]. The Italians emphasised infrastructure improvements and public works. In particular, they greatly expanded Libyan railway and road networks from 1934 to 1940, building hundreds of kilometres of new roads and railways and encouraging the establishment of new industries and dozens of new agricultural villages.

In June 1940, [[Military history of Italy during World War II|Italy entered World War II]]. Libya became the setting for the hard-fought [[North African Campaign]] that ultimately ended in defeat for Italy and its [[Afrika Korps|German ally]] in 1943. From 1943 to 1951, Libya was under [[Allied occupation of Libya|Allied occupation]]. The British military [[British Military Administration (Libya)|administered]] the two former Italian Libyan provinces of Tripolitana and Cyrenaïca, while the French [[French Fezzan|administered]] the province of Fezzan. In 1944, Idris returned from exile in [[Cairo]] but declined to resume permanent residence in Cyrenaica until the removal of some aspects of foreign control in 1947. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|1947 peace treaty]] with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], Italy relinquished all claims to Libya.

=== Independent Kingdom (1951–1969) ===
{{Main|Kingdom of Libya|}}
[[File:IdrisI3.jpg|thumb|[[King Idris]] of Libya|223x223px]]
A national assembly crafted a constitution that established a [[monarchy]] and extended an offer for the throne to [[Idris of Libya|Sayyid Idris]], the [[Emir of Cyrenaica]]. Sayyid Idris held the esteemed position as the leader of the influential [[Senusiyya|Senussi religious brotherhood]], which was founded by his grandfather in the preceding century as a response to Western influence in the [[Arab world]]. This devout Islamic movement garnered significant support from the [[Bedouin|desert Bedouin]] and became a major political force in Libya. During the declining years of the [[Ottoman Empire]], it effectively governed the Libyan interior.
Born in an oasis in [[Cyrenaica]] in 1890, Sayyid Idris assumed leadership of the Senussi at a young age. He spent a considerable period of exile in [[Egypt]] under Italian rule and returned to Libya after the [[Axis powers]] were ousted in 1943. On 24 December 1951, as King Idris I, he addressed the nation via radio from [[Benghazi]]. On 21 November 1949, the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] passed a resolution stating that Libya should become independent before 1 January 1952. Idris represented Libya in the subsequent UN negotiations. By 24 December 1951, Libya declared its independence as the [[Kingdom of Libya|United Kingdom of Libya]], a constitutional and hereditary [[monarchy]] under King [[Idris I of Libya|Idris]].

However, the new kingdom faced challenging prospects. It lacked significant industry and agricultural resources. The kingdom's primary exports consisted of hides, wool, horses, and ostrich feathers. Despite having one of the lowest income per capita figures globally, it also suffered from one of the highest illiteracy rates. King Idris I, already in his sixties, had no direct heir to succeed him. His cousin, whom he had married in 1932, reportedly experienced numerous miscarriages, and their son, born in 1953, tragically died shortly after birth. Crown Prince Rida, Idris's brother, was the designated heir, but the royal family was riddled with incessant disputes. King Idris's devout Muslim piety, which solidified his support among the [[Bedouin|Bedouin population]], clashed with the modernising and urban intellectual currents in Libya. To address the rivalry between [[Cyrenaica]] and [[Tripolitania]], [[Benghazi]] and [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]] alternated as the capital every two years.

The swift emergence of a large number of bureaucrats resulted in a costly royal government. The discovery of significant [[oil reserves]] in 1959 and the subsequent income from [[petroleum]] sales enabled one of the world's poorest nations to establish an extremely wealthy state. Although oil drastically improved the Libyan government's finances, popular resentment began to build over the increased concentration of the nation's wealth in the hands of King Idris and the national elite. This discontent continued to mount with the rise of [[Nasserism]] and [[Arab nationalism]] throughout [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], that inspire many anti-royal coups across the [[Arab world]].

=== Republic of Libya under Gaddafi (1969–2011) ===
{{Main|History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi}}
On 1 September 1969, a group of rebel military officers led by [[Muammar Gaddafi]] launched a [[1969 Libyan coup d'état|coup d'état against King Idris]], which became known as the Al Fateh Revolution. Gaddafi was referred to as the "[[Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution|Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution]]" in government statements and the official Libyan press. He began dominating history and politics of Libya for the next four decades. Moving to reduce Italian influence, in October 1970 all Italian-owned assets were expropriated and the 12,000-strong [[Italian settlers in Libya|Italian community]] was [[1970 expulsion of Italians from Libya|expelled]] from Libya alongside the smaller community of [[History of the Jews in Libya|Italian Libyan Jews]]. The day became a [[Public holiday|national holiday]] known as "[[Day of Revenge]]"; it was later renamed the "Day of Friendship" because of an improvement in [[Italy–Libya relations]].
[[File:Gaddafi 1972.jpg|left|thumb|246x246px|[[Muammar Gaddafi]], leader of Libya ({{reign|1969|2011}})]]
Libya's increase in prosperity was accompanied by increased internal political repression, and political dissent was made illegal under Law 75 of 1973. Widespread surveillance of the population was carried out through Gaddafi's Revolutionary Committees. Gaddafi also wanted to ease the strict social restrictions imposed on women by the previous regime, establishing the [[Revolutionary Women's Formation]] to encourage reform. In 1970, a law was introduced affirming equality of the sexes and wage parity. In 1971, Gaddafi sponsored the creation of a Libyan General Women's Federation. In 1972, a law was passed criminalising the marriage of girls under the age of sixteen and making the woman's consent a necessary prerequisite for a marriage.

On 25 October 1975, a coup attempt was launched by a group of 20 military officers, mostly from the city of [[Misrata]]. This resulted in the arrest and executions of the coup plotters. In March 1977, Libya officially became the "Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya". Gaddafi officially passed power to the [[General People's Committee]]s and henceforth claimed to be no more than a symbolic figurehead. The new ''jamahiriya'' (Arab for "republic") governance structure he established was officially referred to as "[[direct democracy]]". Gaddafi, in his vision of democratic government and [[political philosophy]], published ''[[The Green Book (Gaddafi)|The Green Book]]'' in 1975. His short book inscribed a representative mix of utopian socialism and Arab nationalism with a streak of [[Bedouin]] supremacy.[[File:F-4J of VF-74 with Libyan MiG-23 over Gulf of Sidra 1981.jpg|thumb|F-4J of VF-74 with Libyan MiG-23 over Gulf of Sidra in 1981]]In February 1977, Libya started delivering military supplies to [[Goukouni Oueddei]] and the [[People's Armed Forces]] in Chad. The [[Chadian–Libyan War]] began in earnest when Libya's support of rebel forces in northern Chad escalated into an [[Toyota war|invasion]]. Later that same year, Libya and [[Egypt]] fought a four-day border war that came to be known as the [[Egyptian–Libyan War]]. Both nations agreed to a [[ceasefire]] under the mediation of the Algerian president [[Houari Boumédiène]]. Hundreds of Libyans lost their lives in the country's support for [[Idi Amin]]'s [[Uganda]] in [[Uganda–Tanzania War|its war against Tanzania]]. Gaddafi financed various other groups from anti-nuclear movements to [[Australia|Australian]] trade unions. On 2 March 1977, Libya officially became the [[History_of_Libya_under_Muammar_Gaddafi#Great_Socialist_People's_Libyan_Arab_Jamahiriya_(1977–2011)|Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]].

Libya adopted its plain green national flag on 19 November 1977. The country had the only plain-coloured flag in the world until 2011, when Libya adopted [[Flag of Libya|its current flag]].{{citation needed|date=April 2023}} From 1977 onward, per capita income in the country rose to more than US$11,000, the fifth-highest in Africa, while the [[Human Development Index]] became the highest in Africa and greater than that of [[Saudi Arabia]]. This was achieved without borrowing any foreign loans, keeping Libya [[List of sovereign states by public debt|debt-free]]. The [[Great Manmade River]] was also built to allow free access to fresh water across large parts of the country. In addition, financial support was provided for university scholarships and employment programs. Much of Libya's income from oil, which soared in the 1970s, was spent on arms purchases and on sponsoring dozens of paramilitaries and terrorist groups around the world.

[[1986 United States bombing of Libya|An American airstrike]] led by then U.S. president [[Ronald Reagan]] intended to kill Gaddafi failed in 1986. Libya was finally put under sanctions by the [[United Nations]] after [[Lockerbie bombing|the bombing]] of a commercial flight at [[Lockerbie]] in 1988 killed 270 people. In the 1990s, the government's rule was threatened by militant Islamism and an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Gaddafi. The government responded with repressive measures. Riots and Islamic activisim were crushed by [[Revolutionary Guard Corps]]. Nevertheless, [[Cyrenaica]] between 1995 and 1998 was politically unstable, due to the tribal allegiances of the local troops. In 2003, Gaddafi announced that all of his regime's [[Libya and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] were disassembled, and that Libya was transitioning toward [[nuclear power]].

=== First Libyan Civil War and the fall of Gaddafi (2011) ===
{{Main|First Libyan Civil War|2011 military intervention in Libya}}
[[File:Ambassador Cretz Stands by Fist Crushing a U.S. Fighter Plane Sculpture.jpg|thumb|[[List of ambassadors of the United States to Libya|U.S. Ambassador]] [[Gene A. Cretz|Cretz]] Stands by Fist Crushing a US Fighter Plane Sculpture which was captured after the [[2011 Battle of Tripoli|fall of Tripoli]]]]
The first civil war came during the [[Arab Spring]] movements which overturned the rulers of [[Tunisia]] and [[Egypt]]. Libya first experienced protests against Gaddafi's regime on 15 February 2011, with a full-scale revolt beginning on [[Revolution Day|17 February]]. Libya's authoritarian regime led by Muammar Gaddafi put up much more of a resistance compared to the regimes in Egypt and Tunisia. While overthrowing the regimes in Egypt and Tunisia was a relatively quick process, Gaddafi's campaign posed significant stalls on the uprising in Libya. The first announcement of a competing political authority appeared online and declared the [[Interim Transitional National Council]] as an alternative government. One of Gaddafi's senior advisors responded by posting a tweet, wherein he resigned, defected, and advised Gaddafi to flee. By 20 February, the unrest had spread to [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]]. On 27 February 2011, the [[National Transitional Council]] was established to administer the areas of Libya under rebel control. On 10 March 2011, the [[United States]] and many other nations recognised the council headed by [[Mahmoud Jibril]] as acting prime minister and as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people and withdrawing the recognition of Gaddafi's regime.
[[File:Green square protests in Tripoli, Libya.jpg|thumb|A protest against the anti-Gaddafi supporters in Tripoli]]
Pro-Gaddafi forces were able to respond militarily to rebel pushes in [[Tripolitania|Western Libya]] and launched a counterattack along the coast toward Benghazi, the ''de facto'' centre of the uprising. The town of [[Zawiya, Libya|Zawiya]], {{convert|48|km}} from Tripoli, was bombarded by [[Libyan Air Force (1951–2011)|air force planes]] and army tanks and seized by [[Armed Forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Jamahiriya troops]], "exercising a level of brutality not yet seen in the conflict." Organizations of the United Nations, including [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] and the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], condemned the crackdown as violating international law, with the latter body expelling Libya outright in an unprecedented action. On 17 March 2011, the UN Security Council passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973|Resolution 1973]], with a 10–0 vote and five abstentions including [[Russia]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Brazil]] and [[Germany]]. The resolution sanctioned the establishment of a [[no-fly zone]] and the use of "all means necessary" to protect civilians within Libya. On 19 March, the first act of [[NATO]] allies to secure the no-fly zone began by destroying Libyan air defences when French military jets entered Libyan airspace on a [[reconnaissance]] mission heralding attacks on enemy targets.

In the weeks that followed, U.S. American forces were in the forefront of NATO operations against Libya. More than 8,000 US personnel in warships and aircraft were deployed in the area. At least 3,000 targets were struck in 14,202 strike sorties, 716 of them in Tripoli and 492 in [[Brega]]. The U.S. air offensive included flights of [[Northrop B-2 Spirit|B-2 stealth bombers]], each bomber armed with sixteen 2000-pound bombs, flying out of and returning to their base in [[Missouri]]. The support provided by the NATO air forces contributed to the ultimate success of the revolution. By 22 August 2011, [[National Liberation Army (Libya)|rebel fighters]] had entered Tripoli and occupied [[Martyrs' Square, Tripoli|Green Square]], which they renamed Martyrs' Square in honour of those killed since 17 February 2011. On 20 October 2011, the last heavy fighting of the uprising came to an end in the city of [[Sirte]]. The [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|Battle of Sirte]] was both the last decisive battle and the last one in general of the [[First Libyan Civil War]] where Gaddafi was captured and killed by NATO-backed forces on 20 October 2011. Sirte was the last Gaddafi loyalist stronghold and his place of birth. The defeat of [[loyalist]] forces was celebrated on 23 October 2011, three days after the fall of Sirte. At least 30,000 Libyans died in the civil war. In addition, the [[National Transitional Council]] estimated 50,000 wounded.

=== Interwar period and the Second Libyan Civil War (2011–2020) ===

Following the defeat of loyalist forces, Libya was torn among numerous rival, armed militias affiliated with distinct regions, cities and tribes, while the central government had been weak and unable to effectively exert its authority over the country. Competing militias pitted themselves against each other in a political struggle between [[Islamism|Islamist]] politicians and their opponents. On 7 July 2012, Libyans held their first parliamentary elections since the end of the former regime. On 8 August, the [[National Transitional Council]] officially handed power over to the wholly elected [[General National Congress]], which was then tasked with the formation of an interim government and the drafting of a new [[Libyan interim Constitutional Declaration|Libyan Constitution]] to be approved in a general [[Next Libyan referendum|referendum]]. On 25 August 2012, in what Reuters reported as "the most blatant sectarian attack" since the end of the civil war, unnamed organised assailants bulldozed a [[Sufism|Sufi]] mosque with graves in the centre of the Libyan capital [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]]. It was the second such razing of a Sufi site in two days. Numerous acts of vandalism and destruction of heritage were carried out by suspected Islamist militias, including the removal of the Nude Gazelle Statue and the destruction and desecration of [[World War II]]-era British grave sites near [[Benghazi]]. Many other cases of heritage vandalism were reported to be carried out by Islamist-related radical militias and mobs that either destroyed, robbed, or looted a number of historic sites.

[[File:LE Eithne Operation Triton.jpg|thumb|left|Libya has emerged as a major transit point for [[European migrant crisis|people trying to reach Europe]].]]
On 11 September 2012, Islamist militants mounted an [[2012 Benghazi attack|attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi]], killing the U.S. ambassador to Libya, [[J. Christopher Stevens]], and three others. The incident generated outrage in the [[United States]] and Libya. On 7 October 2012, Libya's Prime Minister-elect [[Mustafa A. G. Abushagur|Mustafa A.G. Abushagur]] was ousted after failing a second time to win parliamentary approval for a new cabinet. On 14 October 2012, the General National Congress elected former GNC member and human rights lawyer [[Ali Zeidan]] as prime minister-designate. Zeidan was sworn in after his cabinet was approved by the GNC. On 11 March 2014, after having been ousted by the GNC for his inability to halt a rogue oil shipment, Prime Minister Zeidan stepped down, and was replaced by Prime Minister [[Abdullah al-Thani]].

The [[Second Libyan Civil War|Second Civil War]] began in May 2014 following fighting between rival parliaments with tribal militias and [[jihad]]ist groups soon taking advantage of the power vacuum. Most notably, radical Islamist fighters seized [[Derna, Libya|Derna]] in 2014 and [[Sirte]] in 2015 in the name of the [[Islamic State]]. In February 2015, neighbouring [[Egypt]] [[February 2015 Egyptian airstrikes in Libya|launched airstrikes]] against IS in support of the Tobruk government. In June 2014, [[2014 Libyan parliamentary election|elections were held]] to the [[House of Representatives (Libya)|House of Representatives]], a new legislative body intended to take over from the [[General National Congress]]. The elections were marred by violence and low turnout, with voting stations closed in some areas. Secularists and liberals did well in the elections, to the consternation of Islamist lawmakers in the GNC, who reconvened and declared a continuing mandate for the GNC, refusing to recognise the new House of Representatives. Armed supporters of the General National Congress occupied Tripoli, forcing the newly elected parliament to flee to [[Tobruk]].
[[File:Libyan General Khalifa Haftar in 2023.jpg|thumb|[[Khalifa Haftar]], the head of the [[Libyan National Army]], one of the main factions in the [[Libyan civil war (2014–2020)|2014 civil war]]]]
In January 2015, meetings were held with the aim to find a peaceful agreement between the rival parties in Libya. The so-called Geneva-Ghadames talks were supposed to bring the GNC and the Tobruk government together at one table to find a solution of the internal conflict. However, the GNC actually never participated, a sign that internal division not only affected the "Tobruk Camp", but also the "Tripoli Camp". Meanwhile, terrorism within Libya steadily increased, also affecting neighbouring countries. The [[Bardo National Museum attack|terrorist attack against the Bardo Museum]] in [[Tunisia]] on 18 March 2015 was reportedly carried out by two Libyan-trained militants. During 2015 an extended series of diplomatic meetings and peace negotiations were supported by the United Nations, as conducted by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG), Spanish diplomat [[Bernardino León]]. UN support for the SRSG-led process of dialogue carried on in addition to the usual work of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL). In July 2015 SRSG Leon reported to the UN Security Council on the progress of the negotiations, which at that point had just achieved a political agreement on 11 July setting out "a comprehensive framework... includ[ing] guiding principles... institutions and decision-making mechanisms to guide the transition until the adoption of a permanent constitution."
Talks, negotiations and dialogue continued on during mid-2015 at various international locations, culminating at Skhirat in Morocco in early September.

Also in 2015, as part of the ongoing support from the international community, the UN Human Rights Council requested a report about the Libyan situation and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, [[Zeid bin Ra'ad|Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein]], established an investigative body (OIOL) to report on human rights and rebuilding the Libyan justice system. Chaos-ridden Libya emerged as a major transit point for [[2015 European migrant crisis|people trying to reach Europe]]. Between 2013 and 2018, nearly 700,000 migrants reached Italy by boat, many of them from Libya. In May 2018 Libya's rival leaders agreed to hold parliamentary and presidential elections following a meeting in [[Paris]]. In April 2019, [[Khalifa Haftar]] launched [[Western Libya campaign|Operation Flood of Dignity]], in an offensive by the [[Libyan National Army]] aimed to seize Western territories from the [[Government of National Accord]] (GNA). In June 2019, forces allied to Libya's UN-recognised Government of National Accord successfully captured [[Gharyan]], a strategic town where military commander Khalifa Haftar and his fighters were based. According to a spokesman for GNA forces, Mustafa al-Mejii, dozens of LNA fighters under Haftar were killed, while at least 18 were taken prisoner.

In March 2020, Prime Minister of the GNA [[Fayez al-Sarraj|Fayez Al-Sarraj]] commenced Operation Peace Storm. The government initiated the bid in response to the state of assaults carried by [[Field Marshal]] [[Khalifa Haftar|Haftar]]'s [[Libyan National Army|LNA]]. "We are a legitimate, civilian government that respects its obligations to the international community, but is committed primarily to its people and has an obligation to protect its citizens," Sarraj said in line with his decision. On 28 August 2020, the ''[[BBC]] Africa Eye'' and ''BBC Arabic Documentaries'' revealed that a drone operated by the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) killed 26 young cadets at a military academy in Tripoli, on 4 January. Most of the cadets were teenagers and none of them were armed. The Chinese-made drone [[CAIG Wing Loong II|Wing Loong II]] fired Blue Arrow 7 missile, which was operated from UAE-run Al-Khadim Libyan air base. In February, these drones stationed in Libya were moved to an air base near [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] in the western Egyptian desert. ''[[The Guardian]]'' probed and discovered the blatant violation of [[United Nations|UN]] arms embargo by the UAE and [[Turkey]] on 7 October 2020. As per the reporting, both the nations sent large-scale military cargo planes to Libya in support of their respective parties. On 23 October 2020, [[Libyan peace process|a permanent ceasefire]] was signed to end the war.

In December 2021, the [[2022 Libyan presidential election|country's first presidential election]] was scheduled, but was delayed to June 2022 and later postponed further.

[[Fathi Bashagha]] was appointed prime minister by the parliament in February 2022 to lead a transitional administration, but standing prime minister [[Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh]] refused to hand over power as of April 2022. In protest against the Dbeibah government, tribal leaders from the desert town of [[Ubari]] shut down the [[El Sharara oil field]], Libya's largest oil field, on 18 April 2022. The shut down threatened to cause oil shortages domestically in Libya, and preclude the state-run National Oil Corp. from exploiting the high oil prices on the international market resulting from the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]]. On 2 July, the [[House of Representatives (Libya)|House of Representatives]] was burned down by protesters.

On 10 September 2023, catastrophic floods due to [[Derna dam collapses|dam failure]]s generated by [[Storm Daniel]] devastated the port city of [[Derna, Libya|Derna]], killing more than 5,900 and possibly as many as 24,000. The floods were the worst natural disaster in Libya's modern history.

In November 2024, the [[Government of National Unity (Libya)|Government of National Unity]] announced it would instate a morality police to crack-down on "weird haircuts", enforce "modest" clothing, and require male guardians for women.
