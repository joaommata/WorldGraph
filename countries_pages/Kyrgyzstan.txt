===Early history===
[[File:Sary_-_Kamysh,_Kyrgyz_Republic_petroglyphs.jpg|thumb|Petroglyphs of local [[Urial|sheep]], Sary Kamysh]]
The [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] state reached its greatest expansion after defeating the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] in 840 AD. From the tenth century, the Kyrgyz migrated as far as the Tian Shan range and maintained their dominance over this territory for about 200 years.

There is a storytelling tradition of the ''[[Epic of Manas]]'', which involves a warrior who unified all of the scattered tribes into a single nation in the 9th century. The trilogy, an element of the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List]], expresses the memory of the nomadic Kyrgyz people.

In the 12th century, the Kyrgyz dominion had shrunk to the [[Altay Mountains|Altay]] Range and [[Sayan Mountains]] as a result of the [[Mongols before Genghis Khan|Mongol expansion]]. With the rise of the [[Mongol Empire]] in the thirteenth century, the Kyrgyz migrated south. The Kyrgyz peacefully became a part of the Mongol Empire in 1207.

[[Issyk Kul Lake]] was a stopover on the Silk Road, a land route for traders, merchants, and other travelers from the Far East to Europe.
Kyrgyz tribes were overrun in the 17th century by the Mongols, in the mid-18th century by the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and in the early 19th century by the Uzbek [[Khanate of Kokand]]. In 1842, the Kyrgyz tribes broke away from Kokand and united into the [[Kara-Kyrgyz Khanate]], led by [[Ormon Khan]]. Following Ormon's death in 1854, the khanate disintegrated.

===Russian conquest===
In the late nineteenth century, the eastern part of what is today Kyrgyzstan, mainly the [[Issyk-Kul Region]], was ceded to the [[Russian Empire]] by [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] through the [[Treaty of Tarbagatai]]. The territory, then known in Russian as "Kirghizia", was formally incorporated into the Empire in 1876. The Russian takeover was met with numerous revolts, and many of the Kyrgyz opted to relocate to the [[Pamir Mountains]] and Afghanistan.{{Citation needed|date=November 2025}}

In addition, the suppression of the [[Central Asian revolt of 1916|1916 rebellion]] against Russian rule in Central Asia caused many Kyrgyz later to migrate to China. Since many ethnic groups in the region were, and still are, split between neighboring states at a time when borders were more porous and less regulated, it was common to move back and forth over the mountains, depending on where life was perceived as better; this might mean better rains for pasture or better government during oppression.<sup>&#x5B;''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]''&#x5D;</sup>

===Soviet Kyrgyzstan===
Soviet power was initially established in the region in 1919, and the Kara-Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast was created within the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (SFSR). The phrase Kara-Kirghiz was used until the mid-1920s by the Russians to distinguish them from the [[Kazakhs]], who were also referred to as Kirghiz. On 5 December 1936, the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]] was established as a constituent [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Union Republic]] of the [[Soviet Union]].{{efn|The Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic was initially part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic as the Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic before being elevated to a full Union Republic on 5 December 1936.}}

After the [[Russian Civil War]], the period of the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), began, which lasted roughly to 1928. The [[Bolsheviks]] made an effort to establish a standardized tax system, with higher taxes for nomads to discourage the wandering livelihood and they divided the Central Asia region into five nation-states. Kyrgyzstan developed considerably in cultural, educational, and social life, literacy was greatly improved. Economic and social development also was notable. In a region that did not previously know national institutions or consciousness, the process of nation-building was, from the indigenous perspective, a difficult and ambivalent one. Because of the plan's reliance on rapidity, major economic and cultural changes had to occur, which led to conflicts. In Kyrgyzstan, Russian settlers acquired the best pasture land, creating much hardship for most of its original inhabitants, [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]], Kyrgyz and [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] nomads, who were also forced to settle down on soil that hadn't enough agricultural potential. The changes caused unrest, and between 1928 and 1932, nomads and peasants made it clear through methods like passive resistance that they did not agree with these policies, in the Kirgiziya area also guerrilla opposition occurred. However, the Republic's press was permitted to adopt a more liberal stance and to establish a new publication, ''Literaturny Kirghizstan'', by the Union of Writers. Unofficial political groups were forbidden, but several groups that emerged in 1989 to deal with the acute housing crisis were permitted to function.<sup>&#x5B;''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]''&#x5D;</sup>

According to the last Soviet census in 1989, ethnic Kyrgyz made up only 22% of the residents of the northern city of [[Bishkek|Frunze]] (now Bishkek), while more than 60% were Russians, Ukrainians, and people from other [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] nations. Nearly 10% of the capital's population were Jewish (very unusual in the Soviet Union, the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]] being an exception).

In June 1990, ethnic tensions between [[Uzbeks]] and Kyrgyz surfaced in the [[Osh Region]] (southern Kyrgyzstan), where Uzbeks form a minority of the population. The tensions between Kyrgyzs and Uzbeks in Osis led to 186 deaths. Attempts to appropriate Uzbek collective farms for housing development triggered the [[Osh riots (1990)|Osh Riots]]. A state of emergency and curfew were introduced and [[Askar Akayev]], the youngest of five sons born into a family of collective farm workers (in northern Kyrgyzstan), was elected president in October of that same year. By then, the [[Democratic Movement of Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyzstan Democratic Movement]] (KDM) had developed into a significant political force with support in Parliament. On 15 December 1990, the Supreme Soviet voted to change the republic's name to the ''Republic of Kyrgyzstan''. The following January, Akayev introduced new government structures and appointed a new cabinet composed mainly of younger, reform-oriented politicians. In February 1991, the name of the capital, Frunze, was changed back to its pre-revolutionary name of Bishkek.

Despite these political moves toward independence, economic realities seemed to work against secession from the Soviet Union. In a referendum on the preservation of the Soviet Union in March 1991, 88.7% of the voters approved the proposal to retain the Soviet Union as a "renewed federation".

According to a 2013 [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] poll, 62% of Kyrgyz people say that the collapse of the Soviet Union harmed their country, while only 16% said that the collapse benefitted it.

===Independence===
In October 1991, Akayev ran unopposed and was elected president of the new independent republic by direct ballot, receiving 95 percent of the votes cast. Together with representatives of seven other Republics that same month, he signed the [[Treaty of the Economic Community]]. The new leaders of three out of four Soviet Union's founding republics, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, on 8 December 1991 signed the [[Belavezha Accords]], denouncing the [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|Union Treaty of 1922]], declaring that the Union would cease to exist and proclaimed the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) in its place.

On 21 December 1991, Kyrgyzstan{{efn|Kyrgyzstan declared independence from the Soviet Union on 31 August 1991, following a vote by its Supreme Soviet.}} agreed with the other four Central Asian Republics, Tajikistan,{{efn|Tajikistan declared independence from the Soviet Union on 9 September 1991, by decision of its Supreme Soviet.}} [[Turkmenistan]],{{efn|Turkmenistan declared independence from the Soviet Union on 27 October 1991, following a unanimous vote in its Supreme Council.}} Uzbekistan,{{efn|Uzbekistan declared independence on 31 August 1991, and the decision was confirmed by a law passed the same day.}} and Kazakhstan{{efn|Kazakhstan declared independence on 16 December 1991, becoming the last Soviet republic to do so.}} to the Alma-Ata Protocols, formally entering the Commonwealth with [[Armenia]],{{efn|Armenia declared independence on 21 September 1991, confirmed by a nationwide referendum held on the same day.}} [[Azerbaijan]],{{efn|Azerbaijan declared independence on 30 August 1991, through a resolution adopted by its Supreme Soviet.}} [[Moldova]],{{efn|Moldova declared independence on 27 August 1991, through a vote of its parliament following the failed Soviet coup.}} and [[Ukraine]].{{efn|Ukraine declared independence on 24 August 1991; this was confirmed by over 90% of voters in a national referendum on 1 December 1991.}} Finally, Kyrgyzstan gained full independence on 25 December 1991. The following day, on 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. In 1992, Kyrgyzstan joined the United Nations and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE). On 5 May 1993, the official name changed from the ''Republic of Kyrgyzstan'' to the ''Kyrgyz Republic'' following the adoption of a new [[Constitution of Kyrgyzstan|constitution]].

Kyrgyzstan celebrates its Independence Day annually on 31 August, the anniversary of its declaration of independence in 1991.

=== 21st century ===
==== 2000–2009 ====
In February and March 2005, parliamentary elections were held, which the opposition and international observers criticized for alleged irregularities. Widespread protests erupted, leading to the ousting of President Askar Akayev, who fled the country and resigned in April 2005. This series of events became known as the [[Tulip Revolution]]. Subsequently, [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]], a former prime minister and opposition leader, assumed the presidency after winning the July 2005 presidential election with a significant majority.

After assuming office, President Bakiyev faced challenges, including political unrest and demands for constitutional reforms. In 2006 and 2007, large-scale protests occurred, with citizens calling for a reduction in presidential powers and increased governmental transparency. In response, Bakiyev implemented constitutional amendments and appointed opposition figures to key positions. Despite these measures, tensions persisted throughout his tenure.

In 2009, Bakiyev announced the eviction of the U.S. military from the [[Transit Center at Manas|Manas Air Base]], a strategic transit center supporting operations in Afghanistan. The Manas Air Base, hosting approximately 1,000 U.S. military personnel since 2001, served as a crucial staging post for coalition forces in Afghanistan.

==== 2010–2019 ====
In April 2010, widespread protests erupted against President Kurmanbek Bakiyev's administration, driven by public discontent over corruption and rising energy prices. These demonstrations [[2010 Kyrgyz Revolution|culminated in Bakiyev's ousting]] and the establishment of a provisional government led by [[Roza Otunbayeva]]. Subsequently, in June 2010, violent ethnic clashes occurred in the southern cities of [[Osh]] and [[Jalal-Abad]] between Kyrgyz and Uzbek communities, resulting in over 400 deaths and displacing thousands.

Following these events, a referendum was held in June 2010 to adopt a new constitution aimed at reducing presidential powers and enhancing parliamentary authority. The referendum passed with approximately 90% approval and a 70% voter turnout, despite challenges posed by recent unrest. This constitution introduced a single six-year term for the president without the possibility of re-election and limited any single political party to 65 of the 120 parliamentary seats to prevent power concentration.

Following his election, President Japarov initiated a series of constitutional reforms aimed at shifting the country's governance structure from a parliamentary to a presidential system. A referendum held in January 2021 approved these changes, granting the president expanded powers, including the authority to appoint judges and diminishing the role of parliament. Critics labeled the new constitution the "Khanstitution," expressing concerns over the potential for authoritarian rule.

The period also witnessed increased pressure on independent media and civil society organizations. In 2024, the Kyrgyz government implemented measures to intimidate and silence journalists and critics. The [[Supreme Court of Kyrgyzstan|Supreme Court]] ordered the closure of a leading investigative media outlet, sentencing two journalists to prison terms and placing two others on probation for their reporting. Additionally, a "[[foreign agent|foreign representatives]]" law came into effect in April 2024, imposing strict government oversight on NGOs receiving foreign funding.

Kyrgyzstan's longstanding border disputes with neighboring Tajikistan escalated into violent clashes, notably around the town of [[Batken]] in 2021 and 2022, culminating in a six-day conflict in September 2022. In March 2025, Presidents Japarov and [[Emomali Rahmon]] of Tajikistan signed an agreement to demarcate their shared border, aiming to resolve the territorial conflicts and reopen transportation links that had been closed since the 2022 clashes.<ref name=turgunbayeva/>

In December 2024, President Japarov dismissed [[Akylbek Japarov|Prime Minister Akylbek Japarov]], who had served since 2021, citing a transfer to another position. [[Adylbek Kasymaliev|First Deputy Prime Minister Adylbek Kasymaliyev]] was appointed as acting prime minister.<ref name=":7" />

On 26 September 2025, Kyrgyzstan signed the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]], for the use of nuclear weapons illegal on Kyrgyz sovereign territory. The treaty was ratified a few days later on 30 September.<sup>&#x5B;''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]''&#x5D;</sup>
