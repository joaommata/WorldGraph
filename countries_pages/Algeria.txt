Around ~1.8-million-year-old stone artifacts from Ain Hanech (Algeria) were considered to represent the oldest archaeological materials in North Africa. Stone artifacts and cut-marked bones that were excavated from two nearby deposits at Ain Boucherit are estimated to be ~1.9&nbsp;million years old, and even older stone artifacts to be as old as ~2.4&nbsp;million years. Hence, the Ain Boucherit evidence shows that ancestral hominins inhabited the Mediterranean fringe in northern Africa much earlier than previously thought. The evidence strongly argues for early dispersal of stone tool manufacture and use from East Africa, or a possible multiple-origin scenario of stone technology in both East and North Africa.

Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] and [[Mousterian]] styles (43,000 BC) similar to those in the [[Levant]]. Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of [[Middle Paleolithic]] [[Flake tool]] techniques. Tools of this era, starting about 30,000 BC, are called [[Aterian]] (after the archaeological site of [[Bir el Ater]], south of [[Tébessa|Tebessa]]).

The earliest blade industries in North Africa are called [[Iberomaurusian]] (located mainly in the [[Oran]] region). This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the [[Maghreb]] between 15,000 and 10,000 BC. [[neolithic|Neolithic civilisation]] (animal domestication and agriculture) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghreb perhaps as early as 11,000 BC or as late as between 6000 and 2000 BC. This life, richly depicted in the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] paintings, predominated in Algeria until the classical period. The mixture of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called [[Berber people|Berbers]], who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa.

From their principal center of power at [[Carthage]], the [[Carthaginians]] expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a [[Phoenicia]]n presence existed at [[Tipasa]], east of [[Cherchell]], [[Hippo Regius]] (modern [[Annaba]]) and [[Rusicade]] (modern [[Skikda]]). These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.

As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. Berber civilisation was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organisation supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.

By the early 4th century BC, The north is divided into two [[Masaesyli|Masaesyli kingdom]] in west led by [[Syphax]] and [[Massylii|Massylii kingdom]] in east. Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army. In the [[Mercenary War|Revolt of the Mercenaries]], Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]]. They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]].

In 146 BC, the city of [[Carthage]] was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay [[Mauretania]], which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in modern-day [[Morocco]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilisation, unequalled until the coming of the [[Almohads]] and [[Almoravids]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC.

After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Masinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].

For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region. Algeria is home to the second-largest number of Roman sites and remains after Italy. Rome, after getting rid of its powerful rival Carthage in the year 146 BC, decided a century later to include Numidia to become the new master of North Africa. They built more than 500 cities. Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was the bishop of [[Hippo Regius]] (modern-day Annaba, Algeria), located in the Roman province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. The Germanic [[Vandals]] of [[Geiseric]] moved into North Africa in 429, and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia.When the Byzantines arrived, [[Leptis Magna]] was abandoned and the Msellata region was occupied by the indigenous [[Amazigh|Laguatan]] who  facilitated an [[Amazigh]] political, military and cultural revival. During the rule of the Romans, Byzantines, Vandals, Carthaginians, and Ottomans the Berber people were  one of the few in North Africa who remained independent. The Berber people were so resistant that even during the Muslim conquest of North Africa they still had control and possession over their mountains.

The collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] led to the establishment of a native Kingdom based in [[Altava]] (modern-day Algeria) known as the [[Mauro-Roman Kingdom]]. It was succeeded by another Kingdom based in Altava, the [[Kingdom of Altava]]. During the reign of [[Kusaila]] its territory extended from the region of modern-day [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] in the west to the western [[Aurès]] and later [[Kairouan|Kairaouan]] and the interior of Ifriqiya in the east.

=== Middle Ages ===
{{main|Medieval Muslim Algeria}}
After negligible resistance from the locals, [[Muslims|Muslim]] [[Arabs]] of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] conquered Algeria in the early 8th century.

Large numbers of the indigenous Berber people converted to Islam. Christians, Berber and Latin speakers remained in the great majority in Tunisia until the end of the 9th century and Muslims only became a vast majority some time in the 10th. After the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate, numerous local dynasties emerged, including the [[Rustamids]], [[Aghlabids]], [[Fatimids]], [[Zirids]], [[Hammadids]], [[Almoravids]], [[Almohads]] and the [[Abdalwadid|Zayyanids]]. The Christians left in three waves: after the initial conquest, in the 10th century and the 11th. The last were evacuated to [[Sicily]] by the [[Normans]] and the few remaining died out in the 14th century.

During the [[Middle Ages]], North Africa was home to the Jewish scholar [[Judah ibn Kuraishi]], the first grammarian to write about Semitic and Berber languages, as well as the  [[Sufism|Sufi]] masters [[Abu Madyan|Sidi Boumediene (Abu Madyan)]] and [[Sidi El Houari]], and the Emirs [[Abd al-Mu'min|Abd Al Mu'min]] and [[Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan|Yāghmūrasen]]. It was during this time that the [[Fatimids]] or children of [[Fatima]], daughter of [[Muhammad]], came to the [[Maghreb]]. These "Fatimids" went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, [[Hejaz]] and the [[Levant]], boasting a secular inner government, as well as a powerful army and navy, made up primarily of [[Arabs]] and [[Levant]]ines extending from Algeria to their capital state of [[Cairo]]. The [[Fatimid caliphate]] began to collapse when its governors the [[Zirids]] seceded. To punish them the Fatimids sent the Arab [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] against them. The resultant war is recounted in the epic [[Taghribat Bani Hilal|Tāghribāt]]. In Al-Tāghrībāt the Amazigh Zirid Hero [[Khalifa al-Zanati|Khālīfā Al-Zānatī]] asks daily, for duels, to defeat the Hilalan hero [[Abu Zayd al-Hilali|Ābu Zayd al-Hilalī]] and many other Arab knights in a string of victories. The [[Zirid]]s, however, were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of Arab customs and culture. The indigenous [[Berber people|Amazigh]] tribes, however, remained largely independent, and depending on tribe, location and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times unifying it (as under the Fatimids). The Fatimid Islamic state, also known as [[Fatimid Caliphate]] made an Islamic empire that included North Africa, Sicily, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], the [[Red Sea]] coast of Africa, Tihamah, [[Hejaz]] and [[Yemen]]. Caliphates from Northern Africa traded with the other empires of their time, as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the Islamic Era.

The [[Berber people]] historically consisted of several tribes. The two main branches were the Botr and Barnès tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, [[Sanhadja]], [[Houara]], [[Zenata]], [[Masmuda|Masmouda]], [[Kutama]], Awarba, and [[Berghwata]]). All these tribes made independent territorial decisions.

Several [[Berber people|Amazigh]] dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in the Maghreb and other nearby lands. [[Ibn Khaldun]] provides a table summarising the Amazigh dynasties of the Maghreb region, the [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]], [[Emirate of Tlemcen|Ifranid]], [[Maghrawid Dynasty|Maghrawa]], [[Almoravid]], [[Hammadid]], [[Almohad]], [[Merinid]], [[Zayyanid dynasty|Abdalwadid]], [[Wattasid]], [[Meknassa]] and [[Hafsid]] dynasties. Both of the [[Hammadid]] and [[Zirid]] empires as well as the [[Fatimid]]s established their rule in all of the Maghreb countries. The [[Zirid dynasty|Zirids]] ruled land in what is now Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Spain, Malta and Italy. The [[Hammadid dynasty|Hammadids]] captured and held important regions such as Ouargla, Constantine, Sfax, Susa, Algiers, Tripoli and Fez establishing their rule in every country in the Maghreb region. The [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] which was created and established by the Kutama Berbers conquered all of North Africa as well as Sicily and parts of the Middle East.

[[File:Maghrawa dynasty - dynastie maghraoua.jpg|thumb|Territories controlled by the [[Maghrawid Dynasty|Maghrawa]]]]
Following the Berber revolt numerous independent states emerged across the Maghreb. In Algeria the [[Rustamid dynasty|Rustamid Kingdom]] was established. The Rustamid realm stretched from Tafilalt in Morocco to the Nafusa mountains in Libya including south, central and western Tunisia therefore including territory in all of the modern day Maghreb countries, in the south the Rustamid realm expanded to the modern borders of [[Mali]] and included territory in [[Mauritania]].

Once extending their control over all of the Maghreb, part of Spain and briefly over Sicily, originating from modern Algeria, the [[Zirids]] only controlled modern [[Ifriqiya]] by the 11th century. The Zirids recognised nominal suzerainty of the Fatimid caliphs of Cairo. [[Al-Mu'izz ibn Badis|El Mu'izz]] the Zirid ruler decided to end this recognition and declared his independence. The Zirids also fought against other Zenata Kingdoms, for example the [[Maghrawa]], a Berber dynasty originating from Algeria and which at one point was a dominant power in the Maghreb ruling over much of Morocco and western Algeria including Fez, [[Sijilmasa]], [[Aghmat]], [[Oujda]], most of the Sous and Draa and reaching as far as M'sila and the Zab in Algeria.

As the Fatimid state was at the time too weak to attempt a direct invasion, they found another means of revenge. Between the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]] were living [[Bedouin]] nomad tribes expelled from [[Arabia]] for their disruption and turbulency. The [[Banu Hilal]] and the [[Banu Sulaym]] for example, who regularly disrupted farmers in the [[Nile Valley]] since the nomads would often loot their farms. The then [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] vizier decided to destroy what he could not control, and broke a deal with the chiefs of these Bedouin tribes. The Fatimids even gave them money to leave.

Whole tribes set off with women, children, elders, animals and camping equipment. Some stopped on the way, especially in [[Cyrenaica]], where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in [[Ifriqiya]] by the [[Gabès Governorate|Gabe]]s region, arriving 1051. The [[Zirid]] ruler tried to stop this rising tide, but with each encounter, the last under the walls of [[Kairouan]], his troops were defeated and the Arabs remained masters of the battlefield. The Arabs usually did not take control over the cities, instead looting them and destroying them.
[[File:Mosquée de Mansourah, Tlemcen, 2024.jpg|thumb|[[Mansourah Mosque]], Tlemcen]]
The invasion kept going, and in 1057 the Arabs spread on the high plains of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] where they encircled the [[Beni Hammad Fort|Qalaa of Banu Hammad]] (capital of the [[Hammadid dynasty|Hammadid Emirate]]), as they had done in Kairouan a few decades ago. From there they gradually gained the upper [[Algiers]] and [[Oran]] plains. Some of these territories were forcibly taken back by the [[Almohads]] in the second half of the 12th century. The influx of [[Bedouin]] tribes was a major factor in the linguistic, cultural [[Arabization|Arabisation]] of the Maghreb and in the spread of [[nomad]]ism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant. [[Ibn Khaldun]] noted that the lands ravaged by the [[Banu Hilal]] tribes had become completely arid desert.

The [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] originating from modern day Morocco, although founded by a man originating from modern day Algeria known as [[Abd al-Mu'min]] would soon take control over the Maghreb. During the time of the Almohad Dynasty [[Abd al-Mu'min]]'s tribe, the Koumïa, were the main supporters of the throne and the most important body of the empire. Defeating the weakening [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid Empire]] and taking control over Morocco in 1147, they pushed into Algeria in 1152, taking control over Tlemcen, Oran, and Algiers, wrestling control from the Hilian Arabs, and by the same year they defeated Hammadids who controlled Eastern Algeria.

Following their decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] in 1212, the Almohads began to collapse. In 1235, the governor of modern-day western Algeria, [[Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan]], declared independence and established the [[Kingdom of Tlemcen]] under the [[Zayyanid dynasty]]. After warring with the Almohads for 13 years, the Zayyanids decisively defeated them in 1248 by ambushing and killing the Almohad caliph near Oujda.

[[File:Maghreb 15th Century.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Kingdom of Tlemcen|Zayyanid kingdom]] of Tlemcen in the fifteenth century and its neighbours]]
The Zayyanids retained control over much of Algeria for the next three centuries. While eastern Algeria largely fell under the [[Hafsid dynasty]], the [[Hafsids of Bejaïa|Emirate of Bejaia]], which encompassed the Hafsid territories in Algeria, was at times independent from central Tunisian authority. At their peak, the Zayyanids held Morocco as a western vassal expanded eastward as far as [[Tunis]], which was captured during the reign of Abu Tashfin.

Following several conflicts with local [[Barbary pirates]] sponsored by the Zayyanid sultans, Spain launched a campaign to invade Algeria and defeat the Kingdom of Tlemcen. In 1505, Spanish forces [[Capture of Mers-el-Kébir (1505)|invaded and captured Mers el Kébir]], and in 1509, they [[Spanish conquest of Oran (1509)|conquered Oran]] after a deadly siege. Following their decisive victories over the Algerians in the western-coastal areas of Algeria, the Spanish expanded their campaign across the western Algerian coast. In 1510, they captured Bejaia after [[Capture of Bejaia (1510)|a major siege]], launched an assault on Algiers, and besieged Tlemcen. In 1511, they seized [[Cherchell]] and [[Jijel]], and attacked [[Mostaganem]], which they failed to conquer but succeeded in forcing into tribute.

=== Early modern era ===
{{main|Regency of Algiers}}
[[File:Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hayreddin Barbarossa]]]]
In 1516, the Turkish privateer brothers [[Aruj]] and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], who operated successfully under the [[Hafsids]], moved their base of operations to Algiers. They succeeded in conquering Jijel and Algiers from the [[Spain|Spaniards]] with help from the locals who saw them as liberators from the Christians, but the brothers eventually assassinated the local noble Salim al-Tumi and took control over the city and the surrounding regions. Their state is known as the [[Regency of Algiers]]. When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his [[Fall of Tlemcen (1518)|invasion of Tlemcen]], [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Hayreddin]] succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|sultan]] gave him the title of [[beylerbey]] and a contingent of some 2,000 [[janissaries]]. With the aid of this force and native Algerians, Hayreddin conquered the whole area between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1792).

The next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son [[Hasan Pasha (son of Barbarossa)|Hasan]], who assumed the position in 1544. He was a [[Kouloughlis|Kouloughli]] or of mixed origins, as his mother was an Algerian Mooresse. Until 1587 Beylerbeylik of Algiers was governed by Beylerbeys who served terms with no fixed limits. Subsequently, with the institution of a regular administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by an autonomous janissary unit, known in Algeria as the [[Odjak of Algiers|Ojaq]] who were led by an [[Agha of the Janissaries|agha]]. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.

[[Plague (disease)|Plague]] had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost between 30,000 and 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21, and had high fatalities in 1654–57, 1665, 1691 and 1740–42.[[File:North Africa, from the "Physical And Political Map Of Africa ... 1822".png|left|thumb|Map of the Regency of Algiers in early 19th century]]
The [[Barbary pirates]] preyed on Christian and other non-Islamic shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea. The pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as [[slavery|slaves]]. They also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives. According to Robert Davis, from the 16th to 19th century, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25&nbsp;million Europeans as slaves. They often made raids on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell at [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|slave markets]] in North Africa and other parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1544, for example, [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] captured the island of [[Ischia]], taking 4,000 prisoners, and enslaved some 9,000 inhabitants of [[Lipari]], almost the entire population. In 1551, the Ottoman governor of Algiers, [[Turgut Reis]], enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island of [[Gozo]]. Barbary pirates often attacked the [[Balearic Islands]]. The threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of [[Formentera]]. The introduction of broad-sail ships from the beginning of the 17th century allowed them to branch out into the Atlantic.

In July 1627 two pirate ships from Algiers under the command of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] pirate [[Jan Janszoon]] sailed as far as [[History of Iceland|Iceland]], [[Turkish Abductions|raiding and capturing slaves]]. Two weeks earlier another pirate ship from [[Sale, Morocco|Salé]] in [[Saadi dynasty|Morocco]] had also raided in Iceland. Some of the slaves brought to Algiers were later ransomed back to Iceland, but some chose to stay in Algeria. In 1629, pirate ships from Algeria raided the [[Faroe Islands]].

[[File:Portrait de Baba Ali, Dey d'Alger.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Baba Ali Chaouch]], Dey of Algiers]]

In 1659, the Janissaries stationed in Algiers, known as the [[Odjak of Algiers|Odjak]] of Algiers, joined a company of corsair captains called the Reis in overthrowing the Ottoman [[viceroy]]. A new local leader was installed known as the "Agha"; the position became the "[[Dey]]" in 1671, who would be selected by the [[divan]], a council of some sixty military senior officers. Thus, Algiers became a sovereign military republic. The odjak initially dominated the system, but by the 18th century were the dey's instrument. Although Algiers remained nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, in reality it acted independently from the rest of the Empire, and often had wars with other Ottoman subjects and territories such as the [[Beylik of Tunis]].

The [[dey]] was in effect a constitutional autocrat. Though elected for a life term, over the next 159 years (1671–1830), fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of the Deylikal government was remarkably orderly. Although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest. Autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regency's authority was seldom applied in the [[Kabylie|Kabylia]], although in 1730 the Regency was able to take control of the [[Kingdom of Kuku]] in western Kabylia. Many cities in the northern Algerian desert paid taxes to Algiers or one of its Beys.

Barbary raids in the Mediterranean continued to attack Spanish merchant shipping, resulting in the [[Spanish Empire]] attempting to [[Invasion of Algiers (1775)|invade Algiers in 1775]]. The [[Spanish Navy]] bombarded the city in [[Bombardment of Algiers (1783)|1783]] but failed to pacify it; a subsequent bombing campaign in [[Bombardment of Algiers (1784)|1784]] was joined by the naval forces of other traditional enemies of Algiers, including [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]]. Over 20,000 cannonballs were fired, but the effort ultimately failed; Spain sued for peace in 1786 and paid 1&nbsp;million pesos to the Dey. In 1792, Algiers recaptured the two remaining Spanish strongholds at Oran and Mers el Kébir. In the same year, they conquered the Moroccan [[Rif]] and [[Oujda]], which they then abandoned in 1795.

In the 19th century, Algerian pirates remained a formidable force in the Mediterranean, even forging affiliations with Caribbean powers, paying a "license tax" in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels. Attacks on American merchantmen resulted in the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]]s, which ended the targeting of U.S. ships in 1815. A year later, a combined [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Anglo]]-[[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch]] fleet, under the command of [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]], [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|bombarded Algiers]] to stop similar attacks on European fishermen. These efforts proved successful, although Algerian piracy would continue until the [[French conquest of Algeria|French conquest]] in 1830.

Under the pretext of a slight to their consul, the [[July Monarchy|French]] invaded and [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830|captured Algiers]] in 1830. According to several historians, the methods used by the French to establish control over Algeria reached [[Algerian genocide|genocidal]] proportions. Historian [[Ben Kiernan]] wrote on the French conquest of Algeria: "By 1875, the French conquest was complete. The war had killed approximately 825,000 indigenous Algerians since 1830". French losses from 1831 to 1851 were 92,329 dead in the hospital and only 3,336 killed in action. In 1872, The Algerian population stood at about 2.9&nbsp;million.{{unreliable source?|date=November 2018}} French policy was predicated on "civilising" the country. The slave trade and piracy in Algeria ceased following the French conquest. The [[French conquest of Algeria|conquest of Algeria]] by the French took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed. A combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] Algerian population to decline by nearly one-third from 1830 to 1872.{{unreliable source?|date=February 2013}} On 17 September 1860, [[Napoleon III]] declared "Our first duty is to take care of the happiness of the three million Arabs, whom the fate of arms has brought under our domination." During this time, only Kabylia resisted, the Kabylians were not colonised until after the [[Mokrani Revolt]] in 1871.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

[[Alexis de Tocqueville]] wrote and never completed an unpublished essay outlining his ideas for how to transform Algeria from an occupied tributary state to a colonial regime, wherein he advocated for a mixed system of "total domination and total colonisation" whereby French military would wage total war against civilian populations while a colonial administration would provide rule of law and property rights to settlers within French occupied cities.

From 1848 until independence, France administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and ''département'' of the nation. One of France's longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigrants, who became known as ''colons'' and later, as ''[[Pied-Noir]]s.'' Between 1825 and 1847, 50,000 French people emigrated to Algeria. These settlers benefited from the French government's confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land. Many Europeans settled in [[Oran]] and [[Algiers]], and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities.

[[File:Six chefs FLN - 1954.jpg|thumb|The six historical Leaders of the FLN: [[Rabah Bitat]], [[Mustapha Benboulaïd|Mostefa Ben Boulaïd]], [[Mourad Didouche]], [[Mohammed Boudiaf]], [[Krim Belkacem]] and [[Larbi Ben M'Hidi]].]]

During the late 19th and early 20th century, the [[White Africans of European ancestry|European share]] was almost a fifth of the population. The French government aimed at making Algeria an assimilated part of France, and this included substantial educational investments especially after 1900. The indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency, but in contrast to the other colonised countries' path in central Asia and [[Caucasus]], Algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively human-capital intensive agriculture.

During the [[Second World War]], Algeria came under [[Vichy France|Vichy control]] before being liberated by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in [[Operation Torch]], which saw the first large-scale deployment of [[Military history of the United States during World War II|American troops]] in the [[North African campaign]].

Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, which lacked political and economic status under the colonial system, gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|France]]. In May 1945, the uprising against the occupying French forces was suppressed through what is now known as the [[Sétif and Guelma massacre]]. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the [[Algerian War]] began after the publication of the [[Declaration of 1 November 1954]]. Historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 [[Harki]]s and their dependents were killed by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) or by [[lynching|lynch]] mobs in Algeria. The [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] used hit and run attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war, and the French conducted [[Torture during the Algerian War of Independence|severe reprisals]]. In addition, the French destroyed over 8,000 villages and relocated over 2 million Algerians to [[Internment camps in France#Algerian War|concentration camps]].

The war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of Algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries. Historians, like [[Alistair Horne]] and [[Raymond Aron]], state that the actual number of Algerian Muslim war dead was far greater than the original FLN and official French estimates but was less than the 1&nbsp;million deaths claimed by the Algerian government after independence. Horne estimated Algerian casualties during the span of eight years to be around 700,000. The war uprooted more than 2&nbsp;million Algerians.

The war against French rule concluded in 1962, when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 [[Evian agreements]] and the July 1962 [[Algerian self-determination referendum, 1962|self-determination referendum]].

=== The first three decades of independence (1962–1991) ===
{{main|History of Algeria (1962–1999)}}

The number of European ''[[Pied-Noir]]s'' who fled Algeria totalled more than 900,000 between 1962 and 1964. The exodus to mainland France accelerated after the [[Oran massacre of 1962]], in which hundreds of militants entered European sections of the city and began attacking civilians.

Algeria's first president was the Front de Libération Nationale ([[FLN (Algeria)|FLN]]) leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. Morocco's claim to [[Greater Morocco|portions of western Algeria]] led to the [[Sand War]] in 1963. Ben Bella was [[1965 Algerian coup d'état|overthrown in 1965]] by [[Houari Boumédiène]], his former ally and defence minister. Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly [[Socialism|socialist]] and authoritarian; Boumédienne continued this trend. However, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role. He [[collective farming|collectivised]] agriculture and launched a massive industrialisation drive. [[Extraction of petroleum|Oil extraction]] facilities were nationalised. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international [[1973 oil crisis]].

Boumédienne's successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], introduced some liberal economic reforms. He promoted a policy of [[Arabisation]] in Algerian society and public life. Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread conventional Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to Orthodox Islam.

The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the [[1980s oil glut]]. Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system. Political parties developed, such as the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS), a broad coalition of Muslim groups.

In December 1991 the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] dominated the first of two rounds of [[Algerian legislative election, 1991|legislative elections]]. Fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992, cancelling the elections. Bendjedid resigned and a [[High Council of State (Algeria)|High Council of State]] was installed to act as the Presidency. It banned the FIS, triggering a civil [[insurgency]] between the Front's armed wing, the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 people are thought to have died. The Islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of [[List of massacres during the Algerian Civil War|civilian massacres]].{{Failed verification|date=November 2023|reason=Graphic description of one massacre, but no mention of 100k or a "campaign"}} At several points in the conflict, the situation in Algeria became a point of international concern, most notably during the crisis surrounding [[Air France Flight 8969]], a hijacking perpetrated by the Armed Islamic Group. The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October 1997.

Algeria held [[Algerian presidential election, 1999|elections in 1999]], considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups which were won by President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]]. He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a "Civil Concord" initiative, approved in a [[Algerian Civil Concord referendum, 1999|referendum]], under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000. The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly. The [[Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat]] (GSPC), a splinter group of the Armed Islamic Group, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.

Bouteflika was re-elected in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2004|April 2004 presidential election]] after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation. The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation. It also included a second amnesty initiative, the [[Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation]], which was approved in a [[Algerian national reconciliation referendum, 2005|referendum in September 2005]]. It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.

In November 2008, the [[Algerian Constitution]] was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents. This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]], and he was re-elected in April 2009. During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.

A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010, inspired by similar [[Arab Spring|protests across the Middle East and North Africa]]. On 24 February 2011, the government lifted Algeria's 19-year-old [[state of emergency]]. The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties, the electoral code, and the representation of women in elected bodies. In April 2011, Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform. However, elections are routinely criticised by opposition groups as unfair and international human rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue.

On 2 April 2019, Bouteflika resigned from the presidency after [[2019–2020 Algerian protests|mass protests]] against his candidacy for a fifth term in office.

In December 2019, [[Abdelmadjid Tebboune]] became Algeria's president, after winning the first round of the [[2019 Algerian presidential election|presidential election]] with a record abstention rate – the highest of all presidential elections since Algeria's democracy in 1989. Tebboune is accused of being close to the military and being loyal to the deposed president. Tebboune rejects these accusations, claiming to be the victim of a witch hunt. He also reminds his detractors that he was expelled from the Government in August 2017 at the instigation of oligarchs languishing in prison. In [[2024 Algerian presidential election|September 2024]], President Tebboune won a second term with a landslide 84.3 percent of the vote, although his opponents called the results fraud.
