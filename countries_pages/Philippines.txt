There is [[Archaeology of the Philippines|evidence]] of early [[hominins]] living in what is now the Philippines as early as 709,000 years ago. Bones from [[Callao Cave]] potentially represent an otherwise unknown species, ''[[Homo luzonensis]]'', who lived 50,000 to 67,000 years ago. The oldest [[modern human]] remains on the islands are from the [[Tabon Caves]] of [[Palawan]], [[U/Th-dated]] to 47,000 ± 11–10,000 years ago. [[Tabon Man]] is presumably a [[Negrito]], among the archipelago's earliest inhabitants descended from the first human migrations out of Africa via the coastal route along [[South Asia|southern Asia]] to the now-sunken landmasses of [[Sundaland]] and [[Sahul]].

The first Austronesians reached the Philippines from Taiwan around 2200 BC, settling the [[Batanes]] Islands (where they built stone fortresses known as ''[[ijang]]s'') and northern [[Luzon]]. Jade artifacts have been dated to 2000 BC, with [[lingling-o]] jade items made in Luzon with raw materials from Taiwan. By 1000 BC, the inhabitants of the archipelago had developed into four societies: [[hunter-gatherer]] tribes, warrior societies, highland [[plutocracies]], and port principalities.

=== Early states (900–1565) ===
{{Main|History of the Philippines (900–1565)}}The earliest known surviving written record in the Philippines is the 900 AD [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]], which was written in [[Old Malay]] using the early [[Kawi alphabet|Kawi]] script. By the 14th century, several large coastal settlements emerged as trading centers and became the focus of [[Cultural achievements of pre-colonial Philippines|societal changes]]. Some [[polities]] had exchanges with other states throughout Asia.{{rp|page=3}} Trade with China began during the late [[Tang dynasty]], and expanded during the [[Song dynasty]].{{rp|pages=177–178}} who would gradually settle and intermix in the Philippines. Indian cultural traits such as linguistic terms and religious practices [[Indian influences in early Philippine polities|began to spread]] in the Philippines during the 14th century, via the Indianized Hindu [[Majapahit|Majapahit Empire]]. By the 15th century, Islam was established in the [[Sulu Archipelago]] and spread from there. [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]], [[Namayan]], [[Pangasinan (historical polity)|Pangasinan]], [[Caboloan]], [[Cebu (historical state)|Cebu]], [[Butuan (historical polity)|Butuan]], [[Sultanate of Maguindanao|Maguindanao]], [[Confederate States of Lanao|Lanao]], [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sulu]], and [[Ma-i]]. The early polities typically had a three-tier social structure: nobility, freemen, and dependent debtor-bondsmen.{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Pn0Pfh1Cl0C&pg=PA672|name=672}}}} Among the nobility were leaders known as [[datu]]s, who were responsible for ruling autonomous groups ([[Precolonial barangay|barangays]] or dulohan). When the barangays banded together to form a larger settlement or a geographically looser alliance, their more-esteemed members would be recognized as a "[[Paramount rulers in early Philippine history|paramount datu]]",{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A40BEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA58|name=58}}}} and would rule the community. Population density is thought to have been low during the 14th to 16th centuries Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] arrived in 1521, claimed the islands for Spain, and was killed by [[Lapulapu]]'s men in the [[Battle of Mactan]].{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Z-n_kDTxf0C&pg=PT46|name=21}}}}{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wmgX9M_yETIC&pg=PA261|name=261}}}}

[[File:Vista del Puente de Manila (1847).png|alt=See caption|thumb|[[Manila]], 1847]]

Unification and colonization by the [[Crown of Castile]] began when Spanish explorer [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] arrived from [[New Spain]] in 1565.{{rp|pages=20–23}} Many [[Filipinos]] were brought to New Spain [[History of Spanish slavery in the Philippines|as slaves]] and forced crew, whereas many [[Latin American Asian|Latin Americans]] were brought to the Philippines as soldiers and colonists. The Philippines hosts the only Latin American established districts in Asia. [[Intramuros|Spanish Manila]] became the capital of the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines]] and the [[Spanish East Indies]] in 1571, Spanish territories in Asia and the Pacific. The Spanish invaded local states using the principle of [[divide and rule|divide and conquer]],

Disparate barangays were deliberately [[Reductions|consolidated into towns]], where [[Friars in Spanish Philippines|Catholic missionaries]] could more easily convert their inhabitants to [[Christianity]],{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xiOQdEzgP9kC&pg=PA53|name=53}}, {{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xiOQdEzgP9kC&pg=PA68|name=68}}}} which was initially [[Religious Syncretism|Syncretist]]. [[Christianization]] by the [[Friars in Spanish Philippines|Spanish friars]] occurred mostly across the settled lowlands over the course of time. From 1565 to 1821, the Philippines was governed as a territory of the [[Mexico City]]-based Viceroyalty of New Spain; it was then administered from [[Madrid]] after the [[Mexican War of Independence]].{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC&pg=PA81|name=81}}}} Manila became the western hub of [[Spanish treasure fleet|trans-Pacific trade]] by [[Manila galleon]]s built in [[Bicol Region|Bicol]] and [[Cavite]].

During its rule, Spain spent a significant sum of its treasury quelling [[Philippine revolts against Spain|indigenous revolts]]{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&pg=PA1077|name=1077}}}} including [[Piracy in the Sulu and Celebes Seas|Moro piracy]], a 17th-century [[Battles of La Naval de Manila|war against the Dutch]], 18th-century [[British occupation of Manila]], and conflict with Muslims in the south.{{rp|loc={{plain link|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927161256/http://countrystudies.us/philippines/4.htm|name=4}}}}

Administration of the Philippines was considered a drain on the economy of New Spain, The colony survived on an annual subsidy from the Spanish crown [[British occupation of Manila|British forces occupied Manila]] from 1762 to 1764 during the [[Seven Years' War]]. Spanish rule was restored with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]]. The [[Spanish–Moro conflict]] lasted for several hundred years. Spain conquered portions of [[Mindanao]] and [[Jolo]] during the last quarter of the 19th century, and the Muslim [[Moro people|Moro]] in the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] acknowledged Spanish sovereignty.

Philippine ports opened to world trade during the 19th century, and Filipino society began to change. Social identity changed, with the term ''Filipino'' encompassing all residents of the archipelago instead of solely referring to [[Spanish Filipino|Spaniards born in the Philippines]].

Revolutionary sentiment grew in 1872 after 200 locally recruited [[colonial troops]] and laborers alongside [[Gomburza|three activist Catholic priests]] were executed on [[1872 Cavite mutiny|questionable grounds]]. This inspired the [[Propaganda Movement]], organized by [[Marcelo H. del Pilar]], [[José Rizal]], [[Graciano López Jaena]], and [[Mariano Ponce]], which advocated political reform in the Philippines. Rizal was executed on December 30, 1896, for rebellion, and his death radicalized many who had been loyal to Spain. Attempts at reform met with resistance; [[Andrés Bonifacio]] founded the [[Katipunan]] secret society, which sought independence from Spain through armed revolt, in 1892. Internal disputes led to the [[Tejeros Convention]], at which Bonifacio lost his position and [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] was elected the new leader of the revolution.{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wk8yqCEmJUC&pg=PA147|name=145–147}}}} The 1897 [[Pact of Biak-na-Bato]] resulted in the [[Hong Kong Junta]] government in exile. The [[Spanish–American War]] began the following year, and reached the Philippines; Aguinaldo returned, resumed the revolution, and [[Philippine Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] from Spain on June 12, 1898.{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Hd3EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA26|name=26}}}} In December 1898, the islands were [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|ceded by Spain]] to the United States with [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Guam]] after the Spanish–American War. [[Spain]] ruled the Philippines for 333 years.

The [[First Philippine Republic]] was promulgated on January 21, 1899. Lack of recognition by the United States led to an [[Battle of Manila (1899)|outbreak of hostilities]] that, after refusal by the U.S. on-scene military commander of a cease-fire proposal and a declaration of war by the nascent Republic,{{efn|This is a summary, omitting significant detail.

The war resulted in the deaths of 250,000 to 1&nbsp;million civilians, primarily due to famine and disease. Many Filipinos were transported by the Americans to [[List of concentration and internment camps#Philippines|concentration camps]], where thousands died. After the fall of the First Philippine Republic in 1902, an [[Insular Government of the Philippine Islands|American civilian government]] was established with the [[Philippine Organic Act (1902)|Philippine Organic Act]]. American forces continued to secure and extend their control of the islands, suppressing an attempted [[Tagalog Republic#Sakay|extension of the Philippine Republic]], establishing control of interior mountainous areas which had resisted Spanish conquest, and encouraging large-scale resettlement of Christians in once-predominantly-Muslim Mindanao.

The [[Empire of Japan]] invaded the Philippines in December 1941 [[Military history of the Philippines during World War II|during World War II]], and the [[Second Philippine Republic]] was established as a [[puppet state]] governed by [[Jose P.

Efforts at post-war reconstruction and ending the [[Hukbalahap Rebellion]] succeeded during [[Ramon Magsaysay]]'s presidency, but sporadic communist insurgency continued to flare up long afterward. Under Magsaysay's successor, [[Carlos P. Garcia]], the government initiated a [[Filipino First policy]] which promoted Filipino-owned businesses. and pursued [[North Borneo dispute|a claim]] on eastern [[North Borneo]].

In 1965, Macapagal [[1965 Philippine presidential election|lost]] the presidential election to [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. [[First term of the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos|Early in his presidency]], Marcos began infrastructure projects funded mostly by foreign loans; this improved the economy, and contributed to his [[1969 Philippine presidential election|reelection in 1969]].{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NkBO2RhI4NUC&pg=PA58|name=58}}}} Near the end of his last constitutionally-permitted term, Marcos [[Proclamation No. 1081|declared martial law]] on September 21, 1972 using the specter of communism and began to [[rule by decree]]; the period was characterized by [[Political detainees under the Marcos dictatorship|political repression]], [[Journalism during the Marcos dictatorship|censorship]], and [[Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship|human rights violations]]. [[Monopolies in the Philippines (1965–1986)|Monopolies]] controlled by [[Cronies of Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos's cronies]] were established in key industries, including [[Deforestation in the Philippines#Deforestation during the martial law era|logging]] and broadcasting; With his wife, [[Imelda Marcos|Imelda]], Marcos was accused of corruption and [[Unexplained wealth of the Marcos family|embezzling billions of dollars]] of public funds. Marcos's heavy borrowing [[1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis|early in his presidency]] resulted in [[Economic history of the Philippines (1965–1986)|economic crashes]], exacerbated by an [[early 1980s recession]] where the economy contracted by 7.3 percent annually in 1984 and 1985.{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DmkPEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA212|name=212}}}}

On August 21, 1983, opposition leader [[Ninoy Aquino|Benigno Aquino Jr.]] (Marcos's chief rival) was [[Assassination of Ninoy Aquino|assassinated on the tarmac]] at [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport|Manila International Airport]]. Marcos called a snap [[1986 Philippine presidential election|presidential election in 1986]] which proclaimed him the winner, but the results were widely regarded as fraudulent. The resulting protests led to the [[People Power Revolution]], which forced Marcos and his allies to flee to [[Hawaii]]. Aquino's widow, [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon]], was installed as president

The return of democracy and government reforms which began in 1986 were hampered by [[National debt of the Philippines|national debt]], government corruption, and [[Coup attempts against Corazon Aquino|coup attempts]]. and military conflict with [[Moro conflict|Moro separatists]] persisted; the administration also faced a series of disasters, including the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in June 1991. Ramos's economic gains were overshadowed by the onset of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. His successor, [[Joseph Estrada]], prioritized public housing but faced corruption allegations which led to his overthrow by the [[Second EDSA Revolution|2001 EDSA Revolution]] and the succession of Vice President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] on January 20, 2001.

Arroyo's [[Presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo|nine-year administration]] was marked by economic growth, including [[Hello Garci scandal|electoral fraud allegations]] during the [[2004 Philippine presidential election|2004 presidential election]]. Economic growth continued during [[Benigno Aquino III]]'s administration, which advocated good governance and transparency.{{rp|pages=1, 3}} Aquino III signed [[Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro|a peace agreement]] with the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF) resulting in the [[Bangsamoro Organic Law]] establishing an autonomous [[Bangsamoro]] region, but a [[Mamasapano clash|shootout with MILF rebels in Mamasapano]] delayed passage of the law.

Growing public frustration with post-[[People Power Revolution|EDSA]] governance led to the [[2016 Philippine presidential election|2016 election]] of populist [[Rodrigo Duterte]], whose [[Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte|presidency]] saw the decline of [[liberalism in the Philippines|liberalism in the country]] albeit largely retaining liberal economic policies. the enactment of the Bangsamoro Organic Law; an intensified crackdown on crime and communist insurgencies; and [[Philippine drug war|an anti-drug campaign]] that reduced drug proliferation but that has also led to [[extrajudicial killing]]s. In early 2020, the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines|COVID-19 pandemic]] reached the Philippines, necessitating [[COVID-19 community quarantines in the Philippines|nationwide lockdowns]] that caused a brief but severe [[COVID-19 recession|economic recession]]. Under a promise of continuing Duterte's policies, Marcos's son, [[Bongbong Marcos]], ran with Duterte's daughter, [[Sara Duterte|Sara]], and won the [[2022 Philippine presidential election|2022 election]]. Marcos's renewal of a pro-US foreign policy, however, has been viewed as a reversal of Duterte's cordiality with China, and [[territorial disputes in the South China Sea]] have since escalated. The Marcos administration also [[Arrest of Rodrigo Duterte|arrested]] his predecessor Duterte, who was sent to the [[International Criminal Court]] in [[The Netherlands]] for trial of [[crimes against humanity]], which led to the collapse of the Marcos-Duterte alliance. Later on, a series of [[Flood control projects controversy in the Philippines|corruption, mismanagement and irregularities in government-funded flood management projects]] occurred under his administration, resulting in [[September 2025 Philippine protests|numerous protests nationwide]].
