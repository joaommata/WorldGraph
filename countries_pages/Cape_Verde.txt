The archipelago was formed approximately 40–50 million years ago during the [[Eocene]] epoch. Before the arrival of Europeans, the Cape Verde Islands were uninhabited. They were discovered by [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and Portuguese navigators around 1456. According to Portuguese official records, the first discoveries were made by Genoa-born [[António de Noli]], who was afterwards appointed governor of Cape Verde by Portuguese King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]]. Other navigators mentioned as contributing to discoveries on the Cape Verde archipelago are [[Diogo Dias]], Diogo Afonso, [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[Alvise Cadamosto]] and [[Diogo Gomes]] (who had accompanied António de Noli on his voyage of discovery, and who claimed to have been the first to land on [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] and the first to name that island).

In 1462, Portuguese settlers arrived at Santiago and founded a settlement they called Ribeira Grande. Today it is called [[Cidade Velha]] ("Old City"), to distinguish it from [[Ribeira Grande, Cape Verde|Ribeira Grande]]. The original Ribeira Grande was the first permanent European settlement in the [[tropics]].

In the 16th century, the archipelago prospered from the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Pirates occasionally attacked the Portuguese settlements. [[Francis Drake]], an English [[privateer]], twice sacked Ribeira Grande in 1585 when it was a part of the [[Iberian Union]]. After a French attack in 1712, the town declined in importance relative to nearby [[Praia]], which became the capital in 1770.

The decline in the slave trade in the 19th century resulted in an economic crisis. Cape Verde's early prosperity slowly vanished. However, the islands' position astride mid-Atlantic shipping lanes made Cape Verde an ideal location for re-supplying ships. Because of its excellent harbour [[Mindelo]], located on the island of [[São Vicente, Cape Verde|São Vicente]], became an important commercial centre. Diplomat [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]] visited Cape Verde in 1832. Cape Verde was the first stop of [[Charles Darwin]]'s voyage with {{HMS|Beagle}} in 1832.

With few natural resources and inadequate sustainable investment from the Portuguese, the citizens grew increasingly discontented with the colonial masters, who refused to provide the local authorities with more autonomy. In 1951, Portugal changed Cape Verde's status from a colony to an overseas province in an attempt to blunt growing nationalism.

In 1956, [[Amílcar Cabral]] and a group of fellow Cape Verdeans and Guineans organised (in [[Portuguese Guinea]]) the clandestine [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC). It demanded improvement in economic, social, and political conditions in Cape Verde and Portuguese Guinea and formed the basis of the two nations' independence movement. Moving its headquarters to [[Conakry]], Guinea, in 1960, the PAIGC began an armed rebellion against Portugal in 1961. Acts of sabotage eventually grew into a [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence|war in Portuguese Guinea]] that pitted 10,000 [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]]-supported PAIGC soldiers against 35,000 Portuguese and African troops.

By 1972, the PAIGC controlled much of Portuguese Guinea despite the presence of the Portuguese troops, but the organisation did not attempt to disrupt Portuguese control in Cape Verde. Portuguese Guinea declared independence in 1973 and was granted ''[[de jure]]'' independence in 1974. A budding independence movement—originally led by [[Amílcar Cabral]] who was assassinated in 1973—passed on to his half-brother [[Luís Cabral]] and culminated in independence for the archipelago in 1975.

=== Independence (1975) ===
Following the [[Carnation Revolution|April 1974 revolution in Portugal]], the PAIGC became an active political movement in Cape Verde. In December 1974, the PAIGC and Portugal signed an agreement providing for a transitional government composed of Portuguese and Cape Verdeans. On 30 June 1975, Cape Verdeans elected a National Assembly which received the instruments of independence from Portugal on 5 July 1975.

On 2 February 2024, Cape Verde became the third African country to be free of [[malaria]].
