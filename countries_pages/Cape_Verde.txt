The archipelago was formed approximately 40–50 million years ago during the [[Eocene]] era. Before the arrival of Europeans, the Cape Verde Islands were uninhabited. They were discovered by [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and Portuguese navigators around 1456. According to Portuguese official records, the first discoveries were made by Genoa-born [[António de Noli]], who was afterwards appointed governor of Cape Verde by Portuguese King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]]. Other navigators mentioned as contributing to discoveries on the Cape Verde archipelago are [[Diogo Dias]], Diogo Afonso, [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[Alvise Cadamosto]] and [[Diogo Gomes]] (who had accompanied António de Noli on his voyage of discovery, and who claimed to have been the first to land on [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] and the first to name that island).

In 1462, Portuguese settlers arrived at Santiago and founded a settlement they called Ribeira Grande. Today it is called [[Cidade Velha]] ("Old City"), to distinguish it from [[Ribeira Grande, Cape Verde|Ribeira Grande]]. The original Ribeira Grande was the first permanent European settlement in the [[tropics]].

In the 16th century, the archipelago prospered from the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Cape Verde was the first stop of [[Charles Darwin]]'s voyage with {{HMS|Beagle}} in 1832.

With few natural resources and inadequate sustainable investment from the Portuguese, the citizens grew increasingly discontented with the colonial masters, who refused to provide the local authorities with more autonomy. In 1951, Portugal changed Cape Verde's status from a colony to an overseas province in an attempt to blunt growing nationalism.
