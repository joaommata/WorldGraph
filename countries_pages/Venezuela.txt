Evidence exists of human habitation in the area now known as Venezuela from about 15,000 years ago. Tools have been found on the high [[fluvial terrace|riverine terrace]]s of the [[Pedregal River|Rio Pedregal]] in western Venezuela.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|p=91}} [[Late Pleistocene]] hunting artifacts, including spear tips, have been found at a similar series of sites in northwestern Venezuela; according to [[radiocarbon dating]], these date from 13,000 to 7,000 BC.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|p=172}}

It is unknown how many people lived in Venezuela before the Spanish conquest; it has been estimated at one million.{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}} In addition to Indigenous peoples known today, the population included groups such as the [[Kalina people|Kalina]] (Caribs), [[Auaké people|Auaké]], [[Caquetio]], [[Mariche]], and [[Timoto–Cuica people|Timoto–Cuicas]]. The Timoto–Cuica culture was the most complex society in Pre-Columbian Venezuela, with pre-planned permanent villages, surrounded by irrigated, terraced fields.{{sfn|Mahoney|p=89}} Their houses were made of stone and wood with thatched roofs. They were peaceful and depended on growing crops. Regional crops included potatoes and [[ulluco]]s. They left behind art, particularly anthropomorphic ceramics, but no major monuments. They spun vegetable fibers to weave into textiles and mats for housing. They are credited with having invented the [[arepa]], a staple in [[Venezuelan cuisine]].{{sfn|Salas|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6-1QnKS6xG4C&pg=PA142 142]}}

After the conquest, the population dropped markedly, mainly through the spread of infectious diseases from Europe.{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}} Two main north–south axes of pre-Columbian population were present, who cultivated maize in the west and [[manioc]] in the east.{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}} Large parts of the ''[[llanos]]'' were cultivated through a combination of [[slash and burn]] and permanent settled agriculture.{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}}

=== Colonization ===

In 1498, during his third voyage to the Americas, [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed near the [[Orinoco Delta]] and landed in the [[Gulf of Paria]].{{sfn|Dickey|1892|p=103}} Amazed by the great offshore current of freshwater which deflected his course eastward, Columbus expressed in a letter to Isabella and Ferdinand that he must have reached Heaven on Earth (terrestrial paradise):
{{blockquote|Great signs are these of the Terrestrial Paradise... for I have never read or heard of such a large quantity of fresh water being inside and in such close proximity to salt water; the very mild temperateness also corroborates this; and if the water of which I speak does not proceed from Paradise then it is an even greater marvel, because I do not believe such a large and deep river has ever been known to exist in this world.{{sfn|Zamora|1993|loc=Voyage to Paradise}}}}

[[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spain's colonization of mainland Venezuela]] started in 1522, establishing its first permanent South American settlement in the {{As of |2008 |alt=present-day}} city of [[Cumaná]].

==== German colonization ====
In the 16th century, the king of Spain granted a concession to the German [[Welser family]]. [[Klein-Venedig]]{{Refn|"Little Venice"; additionally the etymology of the name "Venezuela"}} became the most extensive initiative in the [[German colonization of the Americas]] from 1528 to 1546. The Welsers were bankers to the Habsburgs and financiers of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]], who was King of Spain and had borrowed heavily from them to pay bribes for his [[Imperial election, 1519|Imperial election]].

In 1528, Charles V granted the Welsers the right to explore, rule and colonize the territory, as well as to seek the mythical golden town of [[El Dorado]]. The first expedition was led by [[Ambrosius Ehinger]], who established [[Maracaibo]] in 1529. After the deaths of first Ehinger (1533), then [[Nikolaus Federmann]], and [[Georg von Speyer]] (1540), [[Philipp von Hutten]] persisted in exploring the interior. In absence of von Hutten from the capital of the province, the crown of Spain claimed the right to appoint a governor. 

On Hutten's return to the capital, [[Santa Ana de Coro]], in 1546, the Spanish governor [[Juan de Carvajal]] had Hutten and [[Bartholomeus VI. Welser]] executed. Subsequently, [[Emperor Charles V|Charles V]] revoked Welser's concession. The Welsers transported German miners to the colony, in addition to 4,000 African [[slaves]] to plant [[sugar cane]] plantations. Many German colonists died from tropical diseases, to which they had no [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]], or through wars with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous inhabitants]].

=== Late 15th century to early 17th century ===
Native ''[[cacique]]s'' (leaders) such as [[Guaicaipuro]] ({{circa|1530–1568}}) and [[Tamanaco]] (died 1573) attempted to resist Spanish incursions, but the newcomers ultimately subdued them.

In the 16th century, during the Spanish colonization, indigenous peoples such as the [[Mariches]], themselves descendants of the Kalina, were converted to [[Roman Catholicism]]. Some resisting tribes or leaders are commemorated in place names, including Caracas, [[Chacao Municipality|Chacao]] and [[Los Teques]]. The early colonial settlements focused on the northern coast,{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}} but in the mid-18th century, the Spanish pushed farther inland along the [[Orinoco River]]. Here, the [[Ye'kuana]] organized resistance in 1775–76.{{sfn|Gott|2005|p=203}}

Spain's eastern Venezuelan settlements were incorporated into [[New Andalusia Province]]. Administered by the [[Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo]] from the early 16th century, most of Venezuela became part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] in the early 18th century, and was then reorganized as an autonomous [[Captaincy General of Venezuela|Captaincy General]] starting in 1777. Caracas, founded in the central coastal region in 1567, was well-placed to become a key location, being near the coastal port of [[La Guaira]] and in a valley, in a mountain range, providing defensive strength against [[pirate]]s and a more fertile and healthy climate.{{sfn|Ewell|1984|p=4}}

=== Independence and 19th century ===
{{Main|Venezuelan War of Independence}}
[[File:Simón Bolívar by Ricardo Acevedo Bernal.jpg|thumb|upright|''El Libertador'', [[Simón Bolívar]]]]

After unsuccessful uprisings, Venezuela, under the leadership of [[Francisco de Miranda]], a Venezuelan marshal who had fought in the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s, [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] as the [[First Republic of Venezuela]] on 5 July 1811. This began the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]]. A devastating [[1812 Caracas earthquake]], together with the rebellion of the Venezuelan ''[[llanero]]s'', helped bring down the republic.{{sfn|Chasteen|2001|p=103}} [[Simón Bolívar]], new leader of the independentist forces, launched his [[Admirable Campaign]] in 1813 from [[United Provinces of New Granada|New Granada]], retaking most of the territory and being proclaimed as ''El Libertador'' ("The Liberator"). A [[Second Republic of Venezuela]] was proclaimed on 7 August 1813, but lasted only a few months before being crushed by [[Royalist (Spanish American independence)|royalist]] caudillo [[José Tomás Boves]] and his personal army of ''llaneros''.

The end of the [[Peninsular War|French invasion]] of homeland Spain in 1814 allowed a large expeditionary force to come under general [[Pablo Morillo]], with the goal to regain the lost territory in Venezuela and New Granada. As the war reached a stalemate on 1817, Bolívar reestablished the [[Third Republic of Venezuela]] on the territory still controlled by the patriots, mainly in the [[Guayana Province|Guayana]] and [[Llanos]] regions. This republic was short-lived as only two years later, during the [[Congress of Angostura]] of 1819, the union of Venezuela with New Granada was decreed to form the Republic of Colombia.{{sfn|Gregory|1992|pp=89–90}} 

The war continued until full victory and sovereignty was attained after the [[Battle of Carabobo]] on 24 June 1821.{{sfn|Gregory|1992|pp=89–90}} On 24 July 1823, [[José Prudencio Padilla]] and [[Rafael Urdaneta]] helped seal Venezuelan independence with their victory in the [[Battle of Lake Maracaibo]]. New Granada's congress gave Bolívar control of the Granadian army; leading it, he liberated several countries and founded the Republic of Colombia ([[Gran Colombia]]).{{sfn|Gregory|1992|pp=89–90}}

[[File:19 de abril.jpg|thumb|''Revolution of 19 April 1810'', the beginning of Venezuela's independence, by [[Martín Tovar y Tovar]]|alt=]]
Sucre went on to liberate [[Ecuador]] and become the second president of [[Bolivia]]. Venezuela remained part of Gran Colombia until 1830, when a rebellion led by [[José Antonio Páez]] allowed the proclamation of a newly independent Venezuela, on 22 September; Páez became the first president of the new [[State of Venezuela]]. Between one-quarter and one-third of Venezuela's population was lost during these two decades of war (including about half the [[Venezuelans of European descent]]), which by 1830, was estimated at 800,000. In the [[Flag of Venezuela]], the yellow stands for land wealth, the blue for the sea that separates Venezuela from Spain, and the red for the blood shed by the heroes of independence.

[[Slavery]] in Venezuela was abolished in 1854.

In 1899, [[Cipriano Castro]], assisted by his friend [[Juan Vicente Gómez]], seized power in Caracas. Castro defaulted on Venezuela's considerable foreign debts and declined to pay compensation to foreigners caught up in Venezuela's [[Venezuelan civil wars|civil wars]]. This led to the [[Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903]], in which Britain, Germany and Italy imposed a naval blockade before international arbitration at the new [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] was agreed. In 1908, [[Dutch-Venezuela War|another dispute]] broke out with the Netherlands, which was resolved when Castro left for medical treatment in Germany and was promptly overthrown by [[Juan Vicente Gómez]] (1908–35).

=== 20th century ===
[[File:Rómulo Betancourt, 1961.jpg|thumb|[[Rómulo Betancourt]] (president; 1945–1948, 1959–1964), one of the major democratic leaders of Venezuela]]
The discovery of massive [[oil field|oil deposits]] in Lake Maracaibo during World War I proved pivotal for Venezuela and transformed its economy from a heavy dependence on agricultural exports. It prompted a boom that lasted into the 1980s; by 1935, Venezuela's per capita gross domestic product was Latin America's highest.{{sfn|Crow|1980|pp=616–617}} Gómez benefited handsomely from this, as corruption thrived, but at the same time, the new source of income helped him centralize the state and develop its authority.

Gómez remained the most powerful man in Venezuela until his death in 1935. The ''gomecista'' dictatorship (1935–1945) system largely continued under [[Eleazar López Contreras]], but from 1941, under [[Isaías Medina Angarita]], was relaxed. Angarita granted a range of reforms, including the legalization of all political parties. After World War II, immigration from Southern Europe and poorer Latin American countries markedly diversified Venezuelan society.

In 1945, a civilian-military coup overthrew Medina Angarita and ushered in [[El Trienio Adeco|a period of democratic rule]] (1945–1948) under the mass membership party [[Democratic Action (Venezuela)|Democratic Action]], initially under [[Rómulo Betancourt]], until [[Rómulo Gallegos]] won the [[1947 Venezuelan presidential election]] (the first free and fair elections in Venezuela). Gallegos governed until overthrown by a military junta led by the triumvirate {{Interlanguage link|Luis Felipe Llovera Páez|es|Luis Llovera Páez}}, [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]], and Gallegos' Defense Minister, [[Carlos Delgado Chalbaud]], in the [[1948 Venezuelan coup d'état|1948 Venezuelan ''coup d'état'']].

[[File:Carlos Andrés Pérez.jpg|thumb|upright|President [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] was [[impeached]] on corruption charges in 1993.]]
The most powerful man in the military ''junta'' (1948–58) was Pérez Jiménez and he was suspected of being behind the death of Chalbaud, who died in a bungled kidnapping in 1950. When the junta unexpectedly lost the [[1952 Venezuelan presidential election|1952 presidential election]], it ignored the results and Jiménez was installed as president.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}} Jiménez was forced out on 23 January 1958.

In the 1980s, the Presidential Commission for State Reform (COPRE) emerged as a mechanism of political innovation. Venezuela decentralized its political system and diversified its economy, reducing the size of the state. COPRE operated as an innovation mechanism, also by incorporating issues into the political agenda, that were excluded from public deliberation by the main actors of the democratic system. The most discussed topics were incorporated into the public agenda: decentralization, political participation, municipalization, judicial order reforms and the role of the state in a new economic strategy. The social reality made the changes difficult to apply.

Economic crises in the 1980s and 1990s led to a political crisis. Hundreds of people were killed by security forces and the military in the ''[[Caracazo]]'' riots of 1989, during the second presidential term of Carlos Andrés Pérez (1989–1993) and after the implementation of economic austerity measures. [[Hugo Chávez]], who in 1982 had promised to depose the bipartisanship governments, used the growing anger at economic austerity measures to justify a [[1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts|coup attempt in February 1992]]; 

President Carlos Andrés Pérez (re-elected in 1988) was impeached under embezzlement charges in 1993, leading to the interim presidency of [[Ramón José Velásquez]] (1993–1994). Coup leader Chávez [[Rafael Caldera#Amnesty to the 1992 coup participants|was pardoned in March 1994]] by president Rafael Caldera (1994–1999, his second term), with a clean slate and his political rights reinstated, allowing Chávez to win and maintain the presidency continuously from 1999 until his death in 2013. Chávez won the elections of 1998, 2000, 2006 and 2012 and the presidential referendum of 2004.

=== Bolivarian government under Chávez: 1999–2013 ===
{{main|Bolivarian Revolution|History of Venezuela (1999–present)}}

[[File:Chavez Kirch Lula141597.jpg|thumb|[[Hugo Chávez]] with fellow leftist South American presidents [[Néstor Kirchner]] of Argentina and [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]] of Brazil]]
A collapse in confidence in the existing parties led to [[Hugo Chávez]] being elected president in 1998 and the subsequent launch of a "Bolivarian Revolution", beginning with a 1999 [[constituent assembly]] to write a new Constitution. The Revolution refers to a [[left-wing populism]] [[social movement]] and political process led by Chávez, who founded the [[Fifth Republic Movement]] in 1997 and the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] in 2007. The "Bolivarian Revolution" is named after [[Simón Bolívar]]. 

According to Chávez and other supporters, the "Bolivarian Revolution" sought to build a mass movement to implement [[Bolivarianism]]—[[popular democracy]], economic independence, equitable distribution of revenues, and an end to political corruption. They interpret Bolívar's ideas from a [[populism|populist]] perspective, using [[Socialism|socialist]] rhetoric. This led to formation of the '''Fifth Republic of Venezuela''', commonly known as the '''Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela''', that continues to the present day. Venezuela has been considered the Bolivarian Republic following the adoption of the new [[Constitution of Venezuela|Constitution of 1999]]. 

Following Chávez's election, Venezuela developed into a [[dominant-party system]], dominated by the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]]. In April 2002, Chávez was briefly ousted from power in the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt]] following popular demonstrations by his opponents, but Chavez returned after two days as a result of demonstrations by poor Chávez supporters and actions by the military.{{sfn|Cannon|2004|p=295}}{{sfn|López Maya|2005|p=16}} Chávez remained in power after an all-out national strike that lasted [[Venezuelan general strike of 2002–2003|from December 2002 to February 2003]], including a strike/lockout in the state oil company [[PDVSA]]. 

[[Capital flight]] before and during the strike led to the reimposition of [[Foreign exchange controls|currency control]]s. In the subsequent decade, the government was forced into currency devaluations. These devaluations did not improve the situation{{Vague|date=August 2024}} of the people who rely on imported products or locally produced products that depend on imported inputs, while dollar-denominated oil sales account for the majority of exports. The profits of the oil industry were lost to "social engineering" and corruption, instead of investments needed to maintain oil production.

Chávez survived further political tests, including an [[2004 Venezuelan recall referendum|August 2004 recall referendum]]. He was elected for another term [[2006 Venezuelan presidential election|in December 2006]] and for a third term in October 2012. However, he was never sworn in due to medical complications; he died in March 2013.

=== Bolivarian government under Maduro: 2013–present ===
{{main|Presidency of Nicolás Maduro}}
{{further|Crisis in Venezuela}}
The presidential election that took place in April 2013, was the first since Chávez took office in 1999 in which his name did not appear on the ballot.{{Self-published inline|date=October 2022}}
Under the Bolivarian government, Venezuela went from being one of the richest countries in Latin America to one of the poorest. [[Economic policy of the Hugo Chávez administration|Hugo Chávez's socioeconomic policies]] of relying on oil sales and importing goods resulted in large amounts of debt, no change to [[corruption in Venezuela]] and culminated into a [[crisis in Venezuela]]. occurred, with over 7 million – about 20% of the country's population – emigrating. Chávez initiated [[Bolivarian missions]], programs aimed at helping the poor.

[[File:Dilma Rousseff receiving a Hugo Chávez picture from Nicolás Maduro.jpg|thumb|[[Nicolás Maduro]] with Brazilian President [[Dilma Rousseff]], 9 May 2013]]
Poverty began to increase into the 2010s. [[Nicolás Maduro]] was picked by Chavez as his successor, appointing him vice president in 2013.

Maduro has been [[president of Venezuela]] since 14 April 2013, when he won the [[2013 Venezuelan presidential election|presidential election]] after Chavez' death, with 51% of the vote, against [[Henrique Capriles]] on 49%. The [[Democratic Unity Roundtable]] contested Maduro's election as fraud, but an audit of 56% of the vote showed no discrepancies, and the [[Supreme Court of Venezuela]] ruled Maduro was the legitimate president. Opposition leaders and some international media consider Maduro's government a dictatorship. 

Since February 2014, hundreds of thousands have protested over high levels of criminal violence, corruption, hyperinflation, and chronic scarcity of basic goods due to government policies. Demonstrations and riots have resulted in over 40 fatalities in the unrest between Chavistas and opposition protesters and opposition leaders, including [[Leopoldo López]] and [[Antonio Ledezma]] were arrested. Human rights groups condemned the arrest of López. In the [[2015 Venezuelan parliamentary election]], the opposition gained a majority.
[[File:We Are Millions march Venezuela.jpg|right|thumb|[[2017 Venezuelan protests]]]]
Venezuela devalued its currency in February 2013 due to rising shortages, The economy had become dependent on the exportation of oil, with crude accounting for 86% of exports, and a high price per barrel to support social programs. Beginning in 2014 the [[price of oil]] plummeted from over $100 to $40. This placed pressure on the economy, which was no longer able to afford vast social programs. The Government began taking more money from [[PDVSA]], the state oil company, resulting in a lack of reinvestment in fields and employees. Production decreased from its height of nearly {{convert|3|to|1|e6oilbbl|e3m3|abbr=off|lk=on}} per day. 

In 2014, Venezuela entered a [[recession]], and in 2015, had the world's highest inflation, surpassing 100%. In 2017, [[Donald Trump]]'s administration imposed more [[economic sanctions]] against PDVSA and Venezuelan officials. Economic problems, as well as crime, were the causes of the [[Venezuelan protests (2014–present)|2014–present Venezuelan protests]]. Since 2014, roughly 5.6 million people have [[Venezuelan refugee crisis|fled Venezuela]].

In January 2016, Maduro decreed an "economic emergency", revealing the extent of the crisis and expanding his powers. In July 2016, Colombian border crossings were temporarily opened to allow Venezuelans to purchase food and basic health items. In September 2016, a study indicated 15% of Venezuelans were eating "[[food waste]] discarded by commercial establishments". 200 prison riots had occurred by October 2016.

[[File:The TSJ chamber at Maduro 2019 inauguration.jpg|thumb|Maduro was [[Second inauguration of Nicolás Maduro|inaugurated]] for a [[2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis|contested]] and controversial second term in January 2019.]]
The Maduro-aligned [[Supreme Tribunal of Justice (Venezuela)|Supreme Tribunal]], which had been overturning [[National Assembly (Venezuela)|National Assembly]] decisions since the opposition took control, took over the functions of the assembly, creating the [[2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis]]. In August 2017, the [[2017 Constituent National Assembly]] was elected and stripped the National Assembly of its powers.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} The election raised concerns of an emerging dictatorship. In December 2017, Maduro declared opposition parties barred from the following year's presidential vote after they boycotted mayoral polls.

Maduro won the [[2018 Venezuelan presidential election|2018 election]] with 68% of the vote. The result was challenged by Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, France and the US who deemed it fraudulent and recognized [[Juan Guaidó]] as president. Other countries continued to recognize Maduro, although China, facing financial pressure over its position, began hedging by decreasing loans, cancelling joint ventures, and signaling willingness to work with all parties. In August 2019, Trump imposed an economic embargo against Venezuela. In March 2020, Trump indicted Maduro and Venezuelan officials, on charges of drug trafficking, [[narcoterrorism]], and corruption.

In June 2020, a report documented [[enforced disappearance]]s that occurred in 2018–19. 724 enforced disappearances of [[Political prisoner|political detainees]] were reported. The report stated that security forces subjected victims to [[Torture in Venezuela|torture]]. The report stated the government used enforced disappearances to silence opponents and other critical voices.

[[File:Protestas en Caracas contra la reelección de Nicolás Maduro, 2024.jpg|thumb|Protesters in Caracas fighting against the public forces during the [[2024 Venezuelan protests]]]]
[[Nicolás Maduro|Maduro]] ran for a third consecutive term in the [[2024 Venezuelan presidential election|2024 presidential election]], while former diplomat [[Edmundo González Urrutia]] represented the [[Unitary Platform]] ({{langx|es|Plataforma Unitaria Democrática}}; PUD), the main opposition political alliance. Polls conducted before the election indicated that González would win by a wide margin. After the government-controlled [[National Electoral Council (Venezuela)|National Electoral Council]] (CNE) announced partial results showing a narrow Maduro victory on 29 July, [[International reactions to the 2024 Venezuelan presidential election|world leaders predominantly expressed skepticism of the claimed results]] and did not recognize the CNE claims with only some exceptions. 

Both González and Maduro proclaimed themselves winners of the election. The results of the election were not recognized by the [[Carter Center]] and [[Organization of American States]] due to the lack of granular results, and disputed by the opposition, which claimed a landslide victory and released access to vote tallies collected by [[poll watchers]] from a majority of polling centers as proof.

In the [[2024 Venezuelan presidential election#Aftermath|aftermath]] of the announcement of results by the election authorities, [[2024 Venezuelan protests|protests broke out across the country]].
