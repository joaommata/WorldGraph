===Prehistory===
{{Main|Prehistory of France}}

The oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now France date from approximately 1.8&nbsp;million years ago. [[Neanderthal]]s occupied the region into the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era but were slowly replaced by ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'' around 35,000 BC. This period witnessed the emergence of [[cave painting]] in the [[Dordogne]] and [[Pyrenees]], including at [[Lascaux]], dated to {{Circa|18,000}} BC. At the end of the [[Last Glacial Period]] (10,000 BC), the climate became milder; from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of Western Europe entered the [[Neolithic]] era, and its inhabitants became [[Sedentism|sedentary]].

After demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia BC, [[Three-age system|metallurgy appeared]], initially working gold, [[Chalcolithic|copper]] and [[Bronze Age|bronze]], then later [[Iron Age|iron]]. France has numerous [[megalith]]ic sites from the Neolithic, including the [[Carnac stones]] site (approximately 3,300 BC).

===Antiquity (6th century BC – 5th century AD)===
In 600 BC, [[Ionia]]n [[Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul|Greeks]] from [[Phocaea]] founded the colony of [[Massalia]] (present-day [[Marseille]]). Celtic tribes penetrated parts of eastern and northern France, spreading through the rest of the country between the 5th and 3rd century BC. Around 390 BC, the Gallic chieftain [[Brennus (leader of the Senones)|Brennus]] and his troops made their way to [[Roman Italy]], defeated the Romans in the [[Battle of the Allia]], and besieged and ransomed Rome. This left Rome weakened, and the Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC when they entered into a peace treaty. But the Romans and the Gauls remained adversaries for centuries.
[[File:France-002364 - Square House (15867600545).jpg|thumb|alt=Maison Carrée temple in Nemausus Corinthian columns and portico|The [[Maison carrée]] was a temple of the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] city of [[Nemausus]] (present-day [[Nîmes]]) and is one of the best-preserved [[Roman temple]]s anywhere.]]
Around 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region {{Lang|la|[[Gallia Narbonensis|Provincia Nostra]]}} ("Our Province"), which evolved into [[Provence]] in French. [[Julius Caesar]] conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt by Gallic chieftain [[Vercingetorix]] in 52 BC. Gaul was divided by [[Augustus]] into provinces, and many cities were founded during the [[Roman Gaul|Gallo-Roman period]], including [[Lugdunum]] (present-day [[Lyon]]), the capital of the Gauls. In 250–290 AD, Roman Gaul suffered a crisis with its [[Limes (Roman Empire)|fortified borders]] attacked by barbarians. The situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, a period of revival and prosperity. In 312, Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|converted to Christianity]]. Christians, who had been persecuted, increased. But from the 5th century, the [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]] resumed. [[Teutons|Teutonic]] tribes invaded the region, the [[Visigoths]] settling in the southwest, the [[Burgundians]] along the [[Rhine Valley]], and the Franks in the north.

===Early Middle Ages (5th–10th century)===
In [[late antiquity]], Gaul was divided into Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory. [[Celtic Britons]], fleeing the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]], settled in west [[Armorica]]; the Armorican peninsula was renamed [[Brittany]], and [[Celts|Celtic culture]] was revived.

The first leader to unite all Franks was [[Clovis I]], who began his reign as king of the [[Salian Franks]] in 481, routing the last forces of the Roman governors in 486. Clovis said he would be baptised a Christian in the event of victory against the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], which was said to have guaranteed the battle. Clovis [[Franco-Visigothic Wars|regained the southwest from the Visigoths]] and was baptised in 508. Clovis was the first [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] conqueror after the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]] to convert to Catholic Christianity; thus France was given the title "Eldest daughter of the Church" by the papacy, and French kings were called "the Most Christian Kings of France".

[[File:Chlodwigs taufe.jpg|thumb|alt=painting of Clovis I conversion to Catholicism in 498, a king being baptised in a tub in a cathedral surrounded by bishop and monks|With [[Clovis I|Clovis]]'s conversion to Catholicism in 498, the [[List of Frankish kings|Frankish monarchy]], [[Elective monarchy|elective]] and [[Secular state|secular]] until then, became [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary]] and of [[Divine right of kings|divine right]].]]
The Franks embraced the Christian [[Gallo-Roman culture]], and Gaul was renamed ''[[Francia]]'' ("Land of the Franks"). The Germanic Franks adopted [[Romance languages|Romanic languages]]. Clovis made [[Paris]] his capital and established the [[Merovingian dynasty]], but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from that of Clovis: Paris, [[Orléans]], [[Soissons]], and [[Reims|Rheims]]. The [[Roi fainéant|last Merovingian kings]] [[Power behind the throne|lost power]] to their [[Mayor of the palace|mayors of the palace]] (head of household). One mayor of the palace, [[Charles Martel]], defeated an [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] invasion at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732. His son, [[Pepin the Short]], seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Pepin's son [[Charlemagne]] reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built an empire across Western and [[Central Europe]].

Proclaimed [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Pope Leo III]] and thus establishing the French government's longtime [[History of the Catholic Church in France|historical association]] with the [[Catholic Church]], Charlemagne tried to revive the [[Western Roman Empire]] and its cultural grandeur. Charlemagne's son [[Louis the Pious|Louis I]] kept the empire united, however in 843 it was divided between Louis' three sons into [[East Francia]], [[Middle Francia]] and [[West Francia]]. West Francia approximated the area occupied by modern France and was its precursor.

During the 9th and 10th centuries, threatened by [[Viking expansion|Viking invasions]], France became a decentralised state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and so was less effective and challenged by noblemen. Thus was established [[feudalism]] in France. Some king's vassals grew so powerful they posed a threat to the king. After the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] added "King of England" to his titles, becoming vassal and the equal of the king of France, creating recurring tensions.

===High and Late Middle Ages (10th–15th century)===

[[File:Joan of Arc miniature graded.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|[[Joan of Arc]] led the [[French Army]] to several important victories during the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337–1453), which paved the way for the final victory.]]

The Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when [[Hugh Capet]] was crowned [[List of French monarchs|king of the Franks]]. His descendants unified the country through wars and inheritance. From 1190, the [[Capetian dynasty|Capetian rulers]] began to be referred as "kings of France" rather than "kings of the Franks". Later kings expanded their directly possessed [[Crown lands of France|''domaine royal'']] to cover over half of modern France by the 15th century. Royal authority became more assertive, centred on a [[Estates of the realm|hierarchically conceived society]] distinguishing [[French nobility|nobility]], clergy, and [[Estates General (France)|commoners]].

The nobility played a prominent role in [[Crusades]] to restore Christian access to the [[Holy Land]]. French knights made up most reinforcements in the 200 years of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs referred to crusaders as ''Franj''. French Crusaders imported French into the [[Levant]], making [[Old French]] the base of the ''[[lingua franca]]'' ("Frankish language") of the [[Crusader states]]. The [[Albigensian Crusade]] was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical [[Catharism|Cathars]] in the southwest of modern-day France.

From the 11th century, the [[House of Plantagenet]], rulers of the [[County of Anjou]], established its dominion over the surrounding provinces of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] and [[Touraine]], then built an "empire" from England to the [[Pyrenees]], covering half of modern France. Tensions between France and the [[Angevin Empire|Plantagenet empire]] would last a hundred years, until [[Philip II of France]] conquered, between 1202 and 1214, most continental possessions of the empire, leaving England and [[Aquitaine]] to the Plantagenets.

[[Charles IV of France|Charles IV the Fair]] died without an heir in 1328. The crown passed to [[Philip VI of France|Philip of Valois]] rather than Edward of Plantagenet, who became [[Edward III of England]]. During the reign of Philip, the monarchy reached the height of its medieval power. However Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward in 1337, and England and France entered the off-and-on [[Hundred Years' War]]. Boundaries changed, but landholdings inside France by English kings remained extensive for decades. With charismatic leaders such as [[Joan of Arc]], French counterattacks won back most English continental territories. France was struck by the [[Black Death]], from which half of the 17&nbsp;million population died.

===Early modern period (15th century–1789)===
{{Main|France in the early modern period}}

The [[French Renaissance]] saw cultural development and standardisation of French, which became the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts|official language of France]] and Europe's aristocracy. France became rivals of the [[House of Habsburg]] during the [[Italian Wars]], which would dictate much of their later foreign policy until the mid-18th century. French explorers claimed lands in the Americas, paving expansion of the [[French colonial empire]]. The rise of Protestantism led France to a civil war known as the [[French Wars of Religion]]. This forced [[Huguenots]] to flee to Protestant regions such as the [[British Isles]] and [[Switzerland]]. The wars were ended by [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]'s [[Edict of Nantes]], which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots. [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] troops assisted the Catholics from 1589 to 1594 and invaded France in 1597. Spain and France returned to all-out war between 1635 and 1659. The [[Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659)|Franco-Spanish War]] cost France 300,000 casualties.

Under [[Louis XIII]], [[Cardinal Richelieu]] promoted centralisation of the state and reinforced royal power. He destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private armies. By the end of the 1620s, Richelieu established "the royal monopoly of force". France fought in the [[Thirty Years' War]], supporting the Protestant side against the Habsburgs. From the 16th to the 19th century, France was responsible for about 10% of the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]].

[[File:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|alt=Louis XIV of France standing in plate armour and blue sash facing left holding baton|[[Louis XIV]], the "Sun King", was the [[Absolute monarchy in France|absolute monarch of France]] who made the country the [[leading power]] in Europe.]]

During [[Louis XIV]]'s minority, trouble known as [[The Fronde]] occurred. This rebellion was driven by feudal lords and [[Parliament|sovereign courts]] as a reaction to the [[Absolutism (European history)|royal absolute power]]. The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and reign of Louis XIV, during which France further increased its influence. By turning lords into [[courtier]]s at the [[Palace of Versailles]], his command of the military went unchallenged. The "Sun King" made France the leading European power. France became the [[Demographics of France|most populous European country]] and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the most-used language in diplomacy, [[Languages of science|science]], and literature until the 20th century. France took control of territories in the Americas, Africa and Asia. In 1685, Louis XIV [[Edict of Fontainebleau|revoked the Edict of Nantes]], forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile and published the ''[[Code Noir]]'' providing the legal framework for slavery and expelling Jews from French colonies.

Under the wars of [[Louis XV]], France lost [[New France]] and most [[French India|Indian possessions]] after its defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763). Its [[Metropolitan France|European territory]] kept growing, however, with acquisitions such as [[Lorraine]] and [[Corsica]]. Louis XV's weak rule, including the decadence of his court, discredited the monarchy, which in part paved the way for the [[French Revolution]].

[[Louis XVI]] [[France in the American Revolutionary War|supported America with money, fleets and armies]], helping them win [[American Revolutionary War|independence from Great Britain]]. France gained revenge but verged on bankruptcy—a factor that contributed to the Revolution. Some of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] occurred in French intellectual circles, and scientific breakthroughs, such as the [[Antoine Lavoisier|naming of oxygen]] and the first [[Montgolfier brothers|hot air balloon carrying passengers]], were achieved by French scientists. French explorers took part in the [[European and American voyages of scientific exploration|voyages of scientific exploration]] through maritime expeditions. Enlightenment philosophy, in which [[Rationalism|reason]] is advocated as the primary source of [[Political legitimacy|legitimacy]], undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and was a factor in the Revolution.

===Revolutionary France (1789–1799)===
[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|alt=drawing of the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, smoke of gunfire enveloping stone castle|The [[Storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789 was the most emblematic event of the [[French Revolution]].]]
The French Revolution was a period of political and societal change that began with the [[Estates General of 1789]], and ended with the [[coup of 18 Brumaire]] in 1799 and the formation of the [[French Consulate]]. Many of its ideas are fundamental principles of [[liberal democracy]], while its values and institutions remain central to modern political discourse.

[[Causes of the French Revolution|Its causes]] were a combination of social, political and economic factors, which the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien Régime]]}} proved unable to manage. A financial crisis and social distress led in May 1789 to the [[convocation]] of the [[Estates General of 1789|Estates General]], which was converted into a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] in June. The [[Storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, among them the [[Abolition of feudalism in France|abolition of feudalism]], state control over the [[Catholic Church in France]], and a [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|declaration of rights]].

The next three years were dominated by struggle for political control, exacerbated by [[economic depression]]. Military defeats following the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in April 1792 resulted in the [[insurrection of 10 August 1792]]. The [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|monarchy was abolished]] and replaced by the [[French First Republic]] in September, while [[execution of Louis XVI|Louis XVI was executed]] in January 1793.

After another [[Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793|revolt in June 1793]], the constitution was suspended and power passed from the [[National Convention]] to the [[Committee of Public Safety]]. About 16,000 people were executed in a [[Reign of Terror]], which [[Thermidorian Reaction|ended in July 1794]]. Weakened by external threats and internal opposition, the Republic was replaced in 1795 by the [[French Directory|Directory]]. Four years later in 1799, the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] seized power in a [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|coup]] led by [[Napoleon]].

===Napoleonic France (1799–1815)===
{{Main|France in the long nineteenth century}}

[[File:Jacques-Louis David - The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=painting of Napoleon in 1806 standing with hand in vest attended by staff and Imperial guard regiment|[[Napoleon]], [[Emperor of the French]], built [[First French Empire|a vast empire across Europe]].]]
[[Napoleon]] became [[French Consulate|First Consul]] in 1799 and later [[Constitution of the Year XII|Emperor]] of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. Changing sets of [[French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars|European coalitions]] declared [[Napoleonic Wars|wars on Napoleon's empire]]. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt|battles of Jena-Auerstadt]] and [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]]. Members of the [[House of Bonaparte|Bonaparte]] family were appointed monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.

These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the [[metric system]], [[Napoleonic Code]] and [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|Declaration of the Rights of Man]]. In 1812 Napoleon [[French invasion of Russia|attacked Russia]], reaching [[Moscow]]. Thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease, Russian attacks, and finally winter. After this catastrophic campaign and the ensuing [[War of the Sixth Coalition|uprising of European monarchies]] against his rule, Napoleon was defeated. About a million Frenchmen [[Napoleonic Wars casualties|died during the Napoleonic Wars]]. After his [[Hundred Days|brief return]] from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and the [[Bourbon Restoration in France|Bourbon monarchy was restored]] with new constitutional limitations.

===Colonial empire===

The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the [[July Revolution]] of 1830, which established the constitutional [[July Monarchy]]; French troops began the [[French conquest of Algeria|conquest of Algeria]]. Unrest led to the [[French Revolution of 1848]] and the end of the July Monarchy. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of male universal suffrage was re-enacted in 1848. In 1852, president of the French Republic, [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]], Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], as Napoleon III. He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially in [[Crimean War|Crimea]], [[Second French intervention in Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Second Italian War of Independence|Italy]]. Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, and his regime was replaced by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. By 1875, the French conquest of Algeria was complete, with approximately 825,000 Algerians killed from famine, disease, and violence.

[[File:France colonial Empire10.png|thumb|upright=1.6|[[French colonial empire]]s: {{legend|#118cb4|First}} {{legend|#002c74|Second}}]]

France had [[French colonial empire|colonial possessions]] since the beginning of the 17th century, but in the 19th and 20th centuries its empire extended greatly and became [[List of largest empires|the second-largest]] behind the [[British Empire]]. Including metropolitan France, the total area reached almost 13&nbsp;million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s, 9% of the world's land. Known as the ''[[Belle Époque]]'', the turn of the century was characterised by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. In 1905, [[Secular state|state secularism]] was [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|officially established]].

===Early to mid-20th century (1914–1946)===
{{Main|History of France (1900–present)}}

[[File:El 114 de infantería, en París, el 14 de julio de 1917, León Gimpel.jpg|thumb|French [[Poilu]]s posing with their war-torn flag in 1917, during World War I]]
France was [[French entry into World War I|invaded by Germany and defended by Great Britain]] at the start of [[World War I]] in August 1914. A rich industrial area in the north was occupied. France and the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] emerged victorious against the [[Central Powers]] at tremendous human cost. It left 1.4 million French soldiers dead, 4% of its population. Interwar was marked by [[Events preceding World War II in Europe|intense international tensions]] and social reforms introduced by the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front government]] (e.g., [[annual leave]], [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour workdays]], [[women in government]]).

In 1940, France was [[Battle of France|invaded and quickly defeated]] by [[Nazi Germany]]. France was divided into a [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation zone]] in the north, an [[Italian occupation of France|Italian occupation zone]] and an unoccupied territory, the rest of France, which consisted of southern France and the French empire. The [[Vichy France|Vichy government]], an authoritarian regime collaborating with Germany, ruled the unoccupied territory. [[Free France]], the government-in-exile led by&nbsp;[[Charles de Gaulle]], was set up in London.

From 1942 to 1944, about 160,000 French citizens, including around [[The Holocaust in France|75,000 Jews]], were deported to [[Extermination camp|death]] and [[Internment|concentration camps]]. On 6 June 1944, the Allies [[Operation Overlord|invaded Normandy]], and in August they [[Operation Dragoon|invaded Provence]]. The Allies and [[French Resistance]] emerged victorious, and French sovereignty was restored with the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] (GPRF). This interim government, established by de Gaulle, continued to [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|wage war against Germany]] and to [[Épuration légale|purge collaborators from office]]. It made important reforms e.g. suffrage extended to women and the creation of a [[Social security in France|social security]] system.

===1946–present===
[[File:De Gaulle-OWI.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|alt=Charles de Gaulle seated in uniform looking left with folded arms|[[Charles de Gaulle]], a hero of World War I, leader of the [[Free French Forces|Free French]] during [[World War II]], and [[President of France]]]]
A new constitution resulted in the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] (1946–1958), which saw strong economic growth (''les [[Trente Glorieuses]]''). France was a founding member of [[NATO]] and attempted to [[First Indochina War|regain control of French Indochina]], but was defeated by the [[Viet Minh]] in 1954. France faced another [[anti-colonialist]] [[Algerian War|conflict in Algeria]], then part of France and home to over one million European settlers ([[Pied-Noir]]). The French systematically used torture and repression, including extrajudicial killings to keep control. This conflict nearly led to a coup and civil war.

During the [[May 1958 crisis in France|May 1958 crisis]], the weak Fourth Republic gave way to the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]], which included a strengthened presidency. The war concluded with the [[Évian Accords]] in 1962 which led to [[1962 Algerian independence referendum|Algerian independence]], at a high price: between half a million and one million deaths and over 2&nbsp;million internally-displaced Algerians. Around one million Pied-Noirs and [[Harki]]s fled from Algeria to France. A vestige of the empire is the [[Overseas France|French overseas departments and territories]].

During the [[Cold War]], de Gaulle pursued a policy of "national independence" towards the [[Western Bloc|Western]] and [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern blocs]]. He withdrew from NATO's military-integrated command (while remaining within the alliance), launched a [[Force de dissuasion|nuclear development programme]] and made France the [[France and weapons of mass destruction|fourth nuclear power]]. He [[Élysée Treaty|restored]] cordial [[France–Germany relations|Franco-German relations]] to create a European counterweight between American and Soviet spheres of influence. However, he opposed any development of a [[Supranational union|supranational Europe]], favouring [[Sovereign state|sovereign nations]]. The revolt of [[May 68|May 1968]] had an enormous social impact; it was a watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted to a more liberal moral ideal (secularism, individualism, sexual revolution). Although the revolt was a political failure (the [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] party emerged stronger than before) it announced a split between the French and de Gaulle, who resigned.

In the post-Gaullist era, France remained one of the most developed [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|economies in the world]] but faced crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, France has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational [[European Union]], notably by signing the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in 1992, establishing the [[eurozone]] in 1999 and signing the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] in 2007. France has fully reintegrated into NATO and since participated in most NATO-sponsored wars. Since the 19th century, France has [[Immigration to France|received many immigrants]], often male [[foreign worker]]s from European Catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed. During the 1970s France faced an economic crisis and allowed new immigrants (mostly from the [[Maghreb]], in northwest Africa) to permanently [[Family reunification|settle in France with their families]] and acquire citizenship. It resulted in hundreds of thousands of Muslims living in subsidised public housing and suffering from high unemployment rates. The government had a policy of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of immigrants, where they were expected to adhere to French values and norms.

Since the [[1995 France bombings|1995 public transport bombings]], France has been targeted by Islamist organisations, notably the [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks|''Charlie Hebdo'' attack]] in 2015 which provoked the [[Republican marches|largest public rallies]] in French history, gathering 4.4&nbsp;million people, the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]] which resulted in 130 deaths, the deadliest attack on French soil since World War II and the deadliest in the European Union since the [[2004 Madrid train bombings|Madrid train bombings in 2004]]. [[Opération Chammal]], France's military efforts to contain [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], killed over 1,000 ISIS troops between 2014 and 2015.
