According to [[mythology]], a [[jinn]]i dropped a [[Gemstone|jewel]], which formed a great circular inferno. This became the [[Mount Karthala|Karthala volcano]], which created the island of Ngazidja (Grande Comore). [[King Solomon]] is also said to have visited the island accompanied by his queen [[Queen of Sheba|Bilqis]].

The first attested human inhabitants of the Comoro Islands are now thought to have been [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] settlers travelling by boat from [[Island Southeast Asia|islands in Southeast Asia]]. These people arrived in the area no later than the eighth century AD, the date of the earliest known archaeological site, found on [[Mayotte]], although settlement beginning in the first century has been postulated.

Subsequent settlers came from the east coast of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Malay Archipelago]], and [[Madagascar]]. [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking settlers were present on the islands from the beginnings of settlement. {{Chronology citation needed|date=October 2024}} 

Development of the Comoros is divided into phases. The earliest reliably recorded phase is the Dembeni phase (eighth to tenth centuries), during which there were several small settlements on each island. From the eleventh to the fifteenth centuries, trade with the island of Madagascar and merchants from the [[Swahili coast]] and the [[Middle East]] flourished, more villages were founded and existing villages grew. Settlers from the Arabian peninsula, particularly [[Hadhramaut]], arrived during this period.

=== Medieval Comoros ===
According to legend, in 632, upon hearing of [[Islam]], islanders are said to have dispatched an emissary, Mtswa-Mwindza, to [[Mecca]]—but by the time he arrived there, the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] had died. Nonetheless, after a stay in Mecca, he returned to Ngazidja, where he built a mosque in his home town of Ntsaweni, and led the gradual conversion of the islanders to Islam.

In 933, the Comoros was referred to by [[Oman]]i sailors as the Perfume Islands.

Among the earliest accounts of East Africa, the works of [[Al-Masudi]] describe early Islamic trade routes, and how the coast and islands were frequently visited by [[Muslim]]s including [[Persia]]n and [[Arab]] merchants and sailors in search of [[coral]], [[ambergris]], [[ivory]], [[tortoiseshell]], [[gold]] and slaves for the [[Arabic slave trade]]. They also brought Islam to the people of the [[Zanj]] including the Comoros. As the importance of the Comoros grew along the East African coast, both small and large [[mosque]]s were constructed. The Comoros are part of the [[Swahili Coast|Swahili]] cultural and economic complex and the islands became a major hub of trade and an important location in a network of trading towns that included [[Kilwa]], in present-day Tanzania, Sofala (an outlet for [[Zimbabwe]]an gold), in [[Mozambique]], and [[Mombasa]] in [[Kenya]].

The Portuguese arrived in the Indian Ocean at the end of the 15th century and the first Portuguese visit to the islands seems to have been that of [[Vasco da Gama]]'s second fleet in 1503. For much of the 16th century the islands provided provisions to the Portuguese fort at Mozambique and although there was no formal attempt by the Portuguese crown to take possession, a number of Portuguese traders settled and married local women.

By the end of the 16th century local rulers on the African mainland were beginning to push back and, with the support of the Omani Sultan [[Saif bin Sultan]] they began to defeat the Dutch and the Portuguese. One of his successors, [[Said bin Sultan]], increased Omani Arab influence in the region, moving his administration to nearby [[Zanzibar]], which came under [[Oman]]i rule. Nevertheless, the Comoros remained independent, and although the three smaller islands were usually [[List of sultans on the Comoros|politically unified]], the largest island, Ngazidja, was divided into a number of [[List of sultans on the Comoros|autonomous kingdoms]] (''ntsi'').

The islands were well placed to meet the needs of Europeans, initially supplying the Portuguese in Mozambique, then ships, particularly the English, on the route to India, and, later, slaves to the plantation islands in the [[Mascarenes]].

=== European contact and French colonisation ===

In the last decade of the 18th century, Malagasy warriors, mostly [[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]] and [[Sakalava]], started raiding the Comoros for [[slave]]s and the islands were devastated as crops were destroyed and the people were slaughtered, taken into captivity or fled to the African mainland: it is said that by the time the raids finally ended in the second decade of the 19th century only one man remained on Mwali. The islands were [[Slavery in the Comoros|repopulated by slaves]] from the mainland, who were [[Comoros slave trade|traded to the French]] in Mayotte and the Mascarenes. On the Comoros, it was estimated in 1865 that as much as 40% of the population consisted of slaves.

France first established colonial rule in the Comoros by taking possession of Mayotte in 1841 when the [[Sakalava]] usurper sultan {{ill|Andriantsoly|fr}} (also known as Tsy Levalo) signed the Treaty of April 1841, which ceded the island to the French authorities. After its annexation, France attempted to convert Mayotte into a sugar plantation colony.

Meanwhile, Ndzwani (or Johanna as it was known to the British) continued to serve as a way station for English merchants sailing to India and the Far East, as well as American whalers, although the British gradually abandoned it following their possession of [[British Mauritius|Mauritius]] in 1814, and by the time the [[Suez Canal]] opened in 1869 there was no longer any significant supply trade at Ndzwani. Local commodities exported by the Comoros were, in addition to slaves, coconuts, timber, cattle and tortoiseshell. British and American settlers, as well as the island's sultan, established a plantation-based economy that used about one-third of the land for export crops. In addition to sugar on Mayotte, ylang-ylang and other perfume plants, vanilla, cloves, coffee, cocoa beans, and sisal were introduced.

In 1886, Mwali was placed under French protection by its Sultan Mardjani Abdou Cheikh. That same year, Sultan Said Ali of [[Sultanate of Bambao|Bambao]], one of the sultanates on Ngazidja, placed the island under French protection in exchange for French support of his claim to the entire island, which he retained until his abdication in 1910. In 1908 the four islands were unified under a single administration (''Colonie de Mayotte et dépendances'') and placed under the authority of the French colonial [[Governor-General of Madagascar]]. In 1909, Sultan Said Muhamed of Ndzwani abdicated in favour of French rule and in 1912 the protectorates were abolished and the islands administered as a single colony. Two years later the colony was abolished and the islands became a province of the [[French Madagascar|colony of Madagascar]].

Agreement was reached with France in 1973 for the Comoros to become independent in 1978, despite the deputies of [[Mayotte]] voting for increased integration with France. A [[1974 Comorian independence referendum|referendum]] was held on all four of the islands. Three voted for independence by large margins, while Mayotte voted against. On 6 July 1975, however, the Comorian parliament passed a unilateral resolution declaring independence. Ahmed Abdallah proclaimed the independence of the Comorian State (''État comorien''; دولة القمر) and became its first president. France did not recognise the new state until 31 December, and retained control of Mayotte.

The next 30 years were a period of political turmoil. On 3 August 1975, less than one month after independence, president [[Ahmed Abdallah]] was removed from office in an armed coup and replaced with United National Front of the Comoros (FNUK) member [[Said Mohamed Jaffar]]. Months later, in January 1976, Jaffar was ousted in favour of his Minister of Defence [[Ali Soilihi]].

The population of [[Mayotte]] voted against independence from France in three referendums during this period. The [[1974 Comorian independence referendum|first]], held on all the islands on 22 December 1974, won 63.8% support for maintaining ties with France on Mayotte; the [[1976 Mahoran status referendum|second]], held in February 1976, confirmed that vote with an overwhelming 99.4%, while the third, in April 1976, confirmed that the people of Mayotte wished to remain a French territory. The three remaining islands, ruled by President Soilihi, instituted a number of socialist and isolationist policies that soon strained relations with France. On 13 May 1978, [[Bob Denard]], once again commissioned by the French intelligence service ([[SDECE]]), returned to [[1978 Comorian coup d'état|overthrow]] President Soilihi and reinstate Abdallah with the support of the French, Rhodesian and South African governments. Ali Soilihi was captured and executed a few weeks later.

In contrast to Soilihi, Abdallah's presidency was marked by authoritarian rule and increased adherence to traditional Islam and the country was renamed the Federal [[Islamic Republic]] of the Comoros (''République Fédérale Islamique des Comores''; جمهورية القمر الإتحادية الإسلامية). Bob Denard served as Abdallah's first advisor; nicknamed the "Viceroy of the Comoros", he was considered the real strongman of the regime. Very close to South Africa, which financed his "presidential guard", he allowed Paris to circumvent the international embargo on the apartheid regime via Moroni. He also set up from the archipelago a permanent mercenary corps, called upon to intervene at the request of Paris or Pretoria in conflicts in Africa. Abdallah continued as president until 1989 when, fearing a probable coup, he signed a decree ordering the Presidential Guard, led by Bob Denard, to disarm the armed forces. Shortly after the signing of the decree, Abdallah was allegedly shot dead in his office by a disgruntled military officer, though later sources claim an antitank missile was launched into his bedroom and killed him. Although Denard was also injured, it is suspected that Abdallah's killer was a soldier under his command.

A few days later, Bob Denard was evacuated to South Africa by French paratroopers. [[Said Mohamed Djohar]], Soilihi's older half-brother, then became president, and served until September 1995, when Bob Denard returned and attempted another coup. This time France intervened with paratroopers and forced Denard to surrender. The French removed Djohar to Reunion, and the Paris-backed [[Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim]] became president by election. He led the country from 1996, during a time of labour crises, government suppression, and secessionist conflicts, until his death in November 1998. He was succeeded by Interim President [[Tadjidine Ben Said Massounde]].

The islands of [[Ndzwani]] and [[Mwali]] declared their independence from the Comoros in 1997, in an attempt to restore French rule. But France rejected their request, leading to bloody confrontations between federal troops and rebels. In April 1999, Colonel [[Azali Assoumani]], Army Chief of Staff, seized power in a [[1999 Comorian coup d'état|bloodless coup]], overthrowing the Interim President Massounde, citing weak leadership in the face of the crisis. This was the Comoros' 18th coup, or attempted coup d'état since independence in 1975.

Assoumani failed to consolidate power and reestablish control over the islands, which was the subject of international criticism. The [[African Union]], under the auspices of President [[Thabo Mbeki]] of South Africa, imposed sanctions on Ndzwani to help broker negotiations and effect reconciliation. Under the terms of the Fomboni Accords, signed in December 2001 by the leaders of all three islands, the official name of the country was changed to the Union of the Comoros; the new state was to be highly decentralised and the central union government would devolve most powers to the new island governments, each led by a president. The Union president, although elected by national elections, would be chosen in rotation from each of the islands every five years.

Assoumani stepped down in 2002 to run in the democratic election of the President of the Comoros, which he won. Under ongoing international pressure, as a military ruler who had originally come to power by force, and was not always democratic while in office, Assoumani led the Comoros through constitutional changes that enabled new elections. A ''Loi des compétences'' law was passed in early 2005 that defines the responsibilities of each governmental body, and is in the process of implementation. The elections in 2006 were won by [[Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi]], a Sunni Muslim cleric nicknamed the "Ayatollah" for his time spent studying Islam in Iran. Assoumani honoured the election results, thus allowing the first peaceful and democratic exchange of power for the archipelago.

Colonel [[Mohammed Bacar]], a French-trained former gendarme elected President of Ndzwani in 2001, refused to step down at the end of his five-year mandate. He staged a vote in June 2007 to confirm his leadership that was rejected as illegal by the Comoros federal government and the African Union. On 25 March 2008 hundreds of soldiers from the African Union and the Comoros seized rebel-held Ndzwani, generally welcomed by the population: there have been reports of hundreds, if not thousands, of people tortured during Bacar's tenure.
Some rebels were killed and injured, but there are no official figures. At least 11 civilians were wounded. Some officials were imprisoned. Bacar fled in a speedboat to Mayotte to seek asylum. Anti-French protests followed in the Comoros (see [[2008 invasion of Anjouan]]). Bacar was eventually granted asylum in Benin.

Since independence from France, the Comoros experienced more than 20 coups or attempted coups.

Following elections in late 2010, former Vice-president [[Ikililou Dhoinine]] was inaugurated as president on 26 May 2011. Dhoinine is the first President of the Comoros from the island of Mwali. Following the 2016 elections, [[Azali Assoumani]], from Ngazidja, became president for a third term. In 2018 Assoumani held a [[2018 Comorian constitutional referendum|referendum]] on constitutional reform that would permit a president to serve two terms. The amendments passed, although the vote was widely contested and boycotted by the opposition, and in April 2019, and to widespread opposition, Assoumani was [[2019 Comorian presidential election|re-elected]] president to serve the first of potentially two five-year terms. In January 2020, the legislative [[2020 Comorian legislative election|elections]] in Comoros were dominated by President Azali Assoumani's party, the [[Convention for the Renewal of the Comoros]], CRC. It took an overwhelming majority in the parliament.

In 2021, Comoros signed and ratified the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]], making it a nuclear-weapon-free state. and in 2023, Comoros was invited as a non-member guest to the G7 summit in [[Hiroshima]]. On 18 February 2023 the Comoros assumed the presidency of the [[African Union]].

In January 2024, President Azali Assoumani was re-elected with 63% of the vote in the disputed presidential [[2024 Comorian presidential election|election]]. In January 2025, the ruling party of president Azali Assoumani won parliamentary [[2025 Comorian parliamentary election|election]], taking 28 out of 33 parliamentary seats. The opposition parties rejected the results.
