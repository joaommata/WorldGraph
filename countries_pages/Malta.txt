===Prehistory===
{{See also|Megalithic Temples of Malta|Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum|Għar Dalam}}

Malta has been inhabited from at least {{Circa|6500 BC}}, with the arrival of [[Mesolithic]] hunter-gatherers likely originating from Sicily. Discoveries at [[Latnija Cave]] led by the Maltese archaeologist Eleanor Scerri included the remains of hearths, stone tools and an abundant and diverse range of animal bones. These included indigenous red deer that are now extinct, fish and marine mammals, as well as abundant edible marine [[gastropods]]. To arrive on Malta, these hunter-gatherers had to cross around 100&nbsp;km of open water, documenting the longest yet-known sea crossing by hunter-gatherers in the Mediterranean. The extinction of the [[Hippopotamus melitensis|dwarf hippos]], [[Cygnus falconeri|giant swans]] and [[Palaeoloxodon falconeri|dwarf elephants]] has historically been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on Malta. However this seems unlikely since recent work suggests these animals went extinct many thousands of years before the arrival of the first people, and no such animals were found in association with the earliest known Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. The Neolithic population on Malta grew [[cereals]], raised livestock and, in common with other ancient Mediterranean cultures, worshipped a [[mother goddess|fertility figure]].

A culture of [[megalith]]ic temple builders then either supplanted or arose from this early period. Around 3500 BC, these people built some of the oldest existing free-standing structures in the world in the form of the megalithic [[Ġgantija]] temples on [[Gozo]]; other early temples include those at [[Ħaġar Qim]] and [[Mnajdra]]. The temples have distinctive architecture, typically a complex [[trefoil]] design, and were used from 4000 to 2500 BC. Tentative information suggests that [[animal sacrifice]]s were made to the goddess of fertility, whose statue is now in the National Museum of Archaeology in Valletta. Another archaeological feature of the Maltese Islands often attributed to these ancient builders is equidistant uniform grooves dubbed "cart tracks" or "cart ruts", which can be found in several locations throughout the islands, with the most prominent being those found in [[Misraħ Għar il-Kbir|Misraħ Għar il-Kbir ("Clapham Junction")]]. These may have been caused by wooden-wheeled carts eroding soft limestone. The culture apparently disappeared from the islands around 2500 BC, possibly due to famine or disease.

After 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until an influx of [[Bronze Age]] immigrants, a culture that [[Cremation|cremated]] its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called [[dolmen]]s. They are claimed to belong to a population certainly different from that which built the previous megalithic temples. It is presumed the population arrived from [[Sicily]] because of the similarity of Maltese dolmens to some small constructions found there.

===Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Romans===

[[File:Justinian555AD.png|thumb|right| The lands which comprise modern-day Malta were a part of the Byzantine Empire (the empire in 555 under [[Justinian the Great]], at its greatest extent since the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] (its [[vassal state|vassals]] in pink)).]]
[[Phoenicia]]n traders [[Phoenician colonization|colonised]] the islands under the name Ann ({{lang|phn|𐤀𐤍𐤍‎}}, {{sc|ʾnn}}){{sfnp|Culican|1992}}{{sfnp|Filigheddu|2006}} as a stop on their trade routes from the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] to [[Cornwall]]. Their seat of government was apparently at [[Mdina]], which shared the island's name;{{sfnp|Culican|1992}}{{sfnp|Filigheddu|2006}} the primary port was at [[Cospicua]] on the [[Grand Harbour]], which they called Maleth. During this time, the people on Malta mainly cultivated [[olive]]s and [[Ceratonia siliqua|carob]] and produced textiles. After the failure of his expedition, the island fell back in the hands of Carthage, only to be [[Capture of Malta (218 BC)|conquered again]] during the [[Second Punic War]] in {{nowrap|218 BC}} by the [[Roman consul]] [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 218 BC)|Tiberius Sempronius Longus]]. Local Roman coinage, which ceased in the first {{nowrap|century BC,}} indicates the slow pace of the island's Romanisation: the last locally minted coins still bear inscriptions in [[Ancient Greek]] and Punic motifs, showing the resistance of the Greek and Punic cultures.

In the second century, Emperor [[Hadrian]] upgraded the status of Malta to a {{nowrap|[[municipium]]}} or free town: the island's local affairs were administered by four [[duumviri|duumvirs]] and a municipal senate, while a Roman [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]] living in [[Mdina]] represented the [[proconsul]] of Sicily.

In 395, when the [[Division of the Roman Empire|Roman Empire was divided for the last time]] at the death of [[Theodosius I]], Malta, following Sicily, fell under the control of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. During the [[Migration Period]] as the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|Western Roman Empire declined]], Malta was conquered or occupied a number of times. Malta remained under the [[Byzantine Empire]] until 870, when it was conquered by the [[Arabs]].

===Arab period and the Middle Ages===
{{see also|Arab–Byzantine wars|Islam in Malta}}
Malta became involved in the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]], and the conquest of Malta is closely linked with [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|that of Sicily]] that began in 827 after [[Euphemius (Sicily)|Admiral Euphemius]]' betrayal of his fellow Byzantines, requesting that the [[Aghlabids]] invade the island. The [[Muslims|Muslim]] chronicler and geographer [[Kitab al-Rawd al-Mitar|al-Himyari]] recounts that in 870, following [[Siege of Melite (870)|a violent struggle]] against the defending Byzantines, the Arab invaders, first led by Halaf al-Hadim, and later by Sawada ibn Muhammad, pillaged the island, destroying the most important buildings, and leaving it practically uninhabited until it was recolonised by the Arabs from Sicily in 1048–1049. The [[Arab Agricultural Revolution]] introduced new irrigation, cotton, and some fruits. The [[Siculo-Arabic]] language was adopted on the island from Sicily; it eventually evolved into the [[Maltese language]].

===Norman conquest===
{{main|Norman invasion of Malta}}
[[File:Roger I of Sicily (Troina).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Roger I of Sicily]] returned Malta to Christian rule.]]
The [[Normans]] attacked Malta in 1091, as part of their [[Norman conquest of Sicily|conquest of Sicily]]. The Norman leader, [[Roger I of Sicily]], was welcomed by Christian captives,

Malta became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Sicily]], which also covered the island of Sicily and the southern [[Italian Peninsula]]. Malta was declared a county and a [[Marquess|marquisate]], but its trade was totally ruined. For a long time it remained solely a fortified [[garrison]].

A mass expulsion of Arabs occurred in 1224, and the entire Christian male population of [[Celano]] in Abruzzo was deported to Malta in the same year. or compelled to convert.

For a brief period, the kingdom passed to the [[Capetian House of Anjou]], but high taxes made the dynasty unpopular in Malta, due in part to [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]]'s war against the Republic of Genoa, and the island of [[Gozo]] was sacked in 1275. with the Aragonese aiding the Maltese insurgents in the [[Sicilian Vespers]] in [[Battle of Malta (1283)|the naval battle]] in [[Grand Harbour]] in 1283.

Relatives of the [[kings of Aragon]] ruled the island until 1409 when it formally passed to the Crown of Aragon. Early on in the Aragonese ascendancy, the sons of the monarchs received the title [[Count of Malta]]. During this time much of the local nobility was created. By 1397, however, the bearing of the comital title reverted to a feudal basis, with two families fighting over the distinction. This led King [[Martin I of Sicily]] to abolish the title. The dispute over the title returned when the title was reinstated a few years later and the Maltese, led by the local nobility, rose up against Count [[Gonsalvo Monroy]].

On 23 March 1530, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], gave the islands to the [[Knights Hospitaller]] under the leadership of Frenchman [[Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam]], in perpetual lease for which they had to pay an annual [[Tribute of the Maltese Falcon|tribute of a single Maltese Falcon]]. These knights, a military religious order also known as the Order of St John and later as the Knights of Malta, had been driven out of [[Rhodes]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1522.

[[Knights Hospitaller|The Knights Hospitaller]] ruled Malta and Gozo between 1530 and 1798. During this period, the strategic and military importance of the island grew greatly as the small yet efficient fleet of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] launched their attacks from this new base targeting the shipping lanes of the Ottoman territories around the Mediterranean Sea.

In 1551, the population of the island of [[Gozo]] (around 5,000 people) were [[Barbary slave trade|enslaved]] by [[Barbary pirates]] and taken to the [[Barbary Coast]] in North Africa.

The knights, led by Frenchman [[Jean Parisot de Valette]], withstood the [[Great Siege of Malta]] by the Ottomans in 1565. After the siege they decided to increase Malta's [[fortification]]s, particularly in the inner-harbour area, where the new city of [[Valletta]], named in honour of Valette, was built. They also established [[watchtower]]s along the coasts&nbsp;– the [[Wignacourt towers|Wignacourt]], [[Lascaris towers|Lascaris]] and [[De Redin towers]]&nbsp;– named after the Grand Masters who ordered the work. The Knights saw the completion of many architectural and cultural projects, including the embellishment of Città Vittoriosa (modern [[Birgu]]) and the construction of new cities including Città Rohan (modern [[Ħaż-Żebbuġ]]). However, by the late 1700s the power of the Knights had declined.

===French period and British conquest===

[[File:Napoleonbonapartemalta.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Bust of Bonaparte at [[Palazzo Parisio (Valletta)|Palazzo Parisio]] in Valletta]]
The Knights' reign ended when [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] captured Malta on his way to [[Egypt]] during the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1798|French Revolutionary Wars]] in 1798. During 12–18 June 1798, Napoleon resided at the [[Palazzo Parisio (Valletta)|Palazzo Parisio]] in Valletta. He reformed national administration with the creation of a Government Commission, twelve municipalities, a public finance administration, the abolition of all feudal rights and privileges, the [[Abolitionism in France|abolition of slavery]] and the granting of freedom to all [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and [[Jews|Jewish]] slaves. On the judicial level, a family code was framed and twelve judges were nominated. [[Public education]] was organised along principles laid down by Bonaparte himself, providing for primary and secondary education. He then sailed for Egypt, leaving a substantial garrison in Malta.

The French forces left behind became unpopular with the Maltese, due particularly to the French forces' hostility towards Catholicism and pillaging of local churches to fund war efforts. French financial and religious policies so angered the Maltese that they rebelled, forcing the French to depart. Great Britain, along with the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], sent ammunition and aid to the Maltese, and Britain also sent [[Royal Navy|its navy]], which blockaded the islands.

General [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois]] surrendered his French forces in 1800.

===British Empire and the Second World War===

[[File:BombDamageMalta.jpg|thumb|The heavily bomb-damaged Kingsway (now Republic Street) in Valletta during the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|siege of Malta]], 1942]]
In 1814, as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]], Malta officially became a part of the British Empire and was used as a shipping way-station and fleet headquarters. After the [[Suez Canal]] opened in 1869, Malta's position halfway between the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and Egypt proved to be its main asset, and it was considered an important stop on the way to India, a central trade route for the British. A [[Turkish Military Cemetery]] was commissioned by [[Sultan Abdul Aziz]] and built between 1873 and 1874 for the fallen Ottoman soldiers of the [[Great Siege of Malta]].

Between 1915 and 1918, during the [[First World War]], Malta became known as ''the Nurse of the Mediterranean'' due to the large number of wounded soldiers who were accommodated there. On 7 June 1919, the Maltese public rioted in response to a [[cost-of-living crisis]]; British troops eventually managed to suppress the riots, killing four in the process. The event, known as [[Sette Giugno]] ("7 June"), is commemorated every year and is one of five National Days. Until the [[Second World War]], Maltese politics was dominated by the [[Language Question (Malta)|Language Question]] fought out by [[Italophone]] and [[Anglophone]] parties.

Before the Second World War, Valletta was the location of the Royal Navy's Mediterranean fleet headquarters; however, despite [[Winston Churchill]]'s objections, the command was moved to [[Alexandria]], Egypt, in 1937 out of fear that it was too susceptible to air attacks from Europe. During the war Malta played an important role for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]; being a British colony, situated close to Sicily and the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] shipping lanes, Malta was bombarded by the Italian and German air forces. Malta was used by the British to launch attacks on the Italian Navy and had a submarine base. It was also used as a listening post, intercepting German radio messages including [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] traffic. The bravery of the Maltese people during the second [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|siege of Malta]] moved [[King George VI]] to [[Award of the George Cross to Malta|award the George Cross to Malta]] on a collective basis on 15 April 1942. Some historians argue that the award caused Britain to incur disproportionate losses in defending Malta, as British credibility would have suffered if Malta had surrendered, [[Battle of Singapore|as British forces in Singapore had done]]. A depiction of the George Cross now appears on the [[Flag of Malta]] and the country's [[Coat of arms of Malta|arms]].

===Independence and Republic===
{{see also|State of Malta}}

[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|Malta joined the European Union in 2004 and signed the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007.]]

Malta achieved its independence as the [[State of Malta]] on 21 September 1964 ([[Independence Day (Malta)|Independence Day]]). Under its 1964 constitution, Malta initially retained [[Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of Malta]] and thus head of state, with a [[governor-general]] exercising executive authority on her behalf. In 1971, the [[Malta Labour Party]] led by [[Dom Mintoff]] won the general elections, resulting in Malta declaring itself a republic on 13 December 1974 ([[Republic Day (Malta)|Republic Day]]) within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. A defence agreement was signed soon after independence, and after being re-negotiated in 1972, expired on 31 March 1979 ([[Freedom Day (Malta)|Freedom Day]]). Upon its expiry, the British base closed and lands formerly controlled by the British were given to the Maltese government.

In the aftermath of the departure of the remaining British troops in 1979, the country intensified [[Malta and the Non-Aligned Movement|its participation in the Non-Aligned Movement]]. Malta adopted a policy of [[Neutral country|neutrality]] in 1980. In that same year, three of Malta's sites, including the capital [[Valletta]], were inscribed on the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]]. In 1989, Malta was the venue of a [[Malta Summit|summit]] between US President [[George H. W. Bush]] and Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], their first face-to-face encounter, which signalled the end of the [[Cold War]]. [[Malta International Airport]] was inaugurated and became fully operational on 25 March 1992, boosting the local aircraft and tourism industry. A [[2003 Maltese European Union membership referendum|referendum on joining the European Union]] was held on 8 March 2003, with 53.65% in favour. Malta joined the [[European Union]] on 1 May 2004 and the [[eurozone]] on 1 January 2008.
