{{Main|History of the Bahamas}}

===Pre-Hispanic era===
The first inhabitants of the Bahamas were the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] people, who moved into the uninhabited southern islands from [[Hispaniola]] and Cuba sometime between AD 500 and 800, having migrated there from mainland [[South America]]; they came to be known as the [[Lucayan people]]. An estimated 30,000 Lucayans inhabited the Bahamas at the time of [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in 1492.

===Arrival of the Spanish===

Columbus' first landfall in what was to Europeans a "New World" was on an island he named San Salvador (known to the Lucayans as ''[[Guanahani]]''). While there is a general consensus that this island lay within the Bahamas, precisely which island Columbus landed on is a matter of scholarly debate. Some researchers believe the site to be present-day [[San Salvador Island]] (formerly known as Watling's Island), situated in the southeastern Bahamas, whilst an alternative theory holds that Columbus landed to the southeast on [[Samana Cay]], according to calculations made in 1986 by ''[[National Geographic]]'' writer and editor [[Joseph Judge]], based on Columbus' log. On the landfall island, Columbus made first contact with the Lucayans and exchanged goods with them, claiming the islands for the [[Crown of Castile]], before proceeding to explore the larger isles of the [[Greater Antilles]].

The 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] theoretically divided the new territories between the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], placing the Bahamas in the Spanish sphere; however, they did little to press their claim on the ground. The Spanish did, however, exploit the native Lucayan peoples, many of whom were enslaved and sent to Hispaniola for use as forced labour. As a result of these depredations the population of the Bahamas was severely diminished.

===Arrival of the English===
The English had expressed an interest in the Bahamas as early as 1629. However, it was not until 1648 that the first English settlers arrived on the islands. Known as the [[Eleutherian Adventurers]] and led by [[William Sayle]], they migrated from [[Bermuda]] seeking greater religious freedom. These English [[Puritans]] established the first permanent European settlement on an island which they named [[Eleuthera]], Greek for ''free''. They later settled [[New Providence]], naming it Sayle's Island. Life proved harder than envisaged however, and many – including Sayle – chose to return to Bermuda. and in 1703 a joint Franco-Spanish expedition [[Raid on Nassau|briefly occupied Nassau]] during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

===18th century===

During proprietary rule the Bahamas became a haven for [[Piracy|pirates]], including [[Blackbeard]] (''circa'' 1680–1718). To put an end to the "[[Pirates' republic]]" and restore orderly government, Britain made the Bahamas a [[crown colony]] in 1718, which they dubbed "the Bahama islands" under the governorship of [[Woodes Rogers]]. In 1720 the [[Raid on Nassau (1720)|Spanish attacked Nassau]] during the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]]. In 1729 a local assembly was established giving a degree of self-governance for British settlers. The reforms had been planned by the previous Governor George Phenney and authorised in July 1728.

During the [[American War of Independence]] in the late 18th century, the islands became a target for US naval forces. Under the command of Commodore [[Esek Hopkins]], [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]], the US Navy occupied Nassau in 1776, before being evacuated a few days later. In 1782 a Spanish fleet appeared off the coast of Nassau, and the city [[Capture of the Bahamas (1782)|surrendered without a fight]]. Later, in April 1783, on a visit made by Prince William of the United Kingdom (later [[King William IV]]) to [[Luis de Unzaga]] at his residence in the Captaincy General of Havana, they made prisoner exchange agreements and also dealt with the preliminaries of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], in which the recently conquered Bahamas would be exchanged for [[Spanish Florida|East Florida]], which would still have to conquer the city of [[St. Augustine, Florida]] in 1784 by order of Luis de Unzaga; after that, also in 1784, the Bahamas would be declared a British colony.

After US independence, the British resettled some 7,300 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] with their African slaves in the Bahamas, including 2,000 from New York and at least 1,033 Europeans, 2,214 African descendants, and a few Native American [[Creek people|Creeks]] from [[East Florida]]. Most of the refugees resettled from New York had fled from other colonies, including [[West Florida]], which the Spanish captured during the war. The government granted land to the planters to help compensate for losses on the continent. These Loyalists, who included Deveaux and also [[Lord Dunmore]], established plantations on several islands and became a political force in the capital. Thousands of Africans liberated from slave ships by the Royal Navy were resettled in the Bahamas.

In the 1820s during the period of the [[Seminole Wars]] in Florida, hundreds of North American slaves and African Seminoles escaped from [[Cape Florida]] to the Bahamas. They settled mostly on northwest [[Andros Island]], where they developed the village of [[Red Bays, The Bahamas|Red Bays]]. From eyewitness accounts, 300 escaped in a mass flight in 1823, aided by Bahamians in 27 [[sloop]]s, with others using canoes for the journey. This was commemorated in 2004 by a large sign at [[Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park]]. Some of their descendants in Red Bays continue African Seminole traditions in basket making and grave marking.

In 1818 the [[Home Office]] ruled that "any slave brought to the Bahamas from outside the [[British West Indies]] would be manumitted." This led to a total of nearly 300 enslaved people owned by US nationals being freed from 1830 to 1835. The American slave ships ''Comet'' and ''Encomium'' used in the United States domestic [[coastwise slave trade]], were wrecked off Abaco Island in December 1830 and February 1834, respectively. When wreckers took the masters, passengers and slaves into Nassau, customs officers seized the slaves and British colonial officials freed them, over the protests of the Americans. There were 165 slaves on the ''Comet'' and 48 on the ''Encomium''. The United Kingdom finally paid an indemnity to the United States in those two cases in 1855, under the Treaty of Claims of 1853, which settled several compensation cases between the two countries.

Slavery was [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|abolished in the British Empire]] on 1 August 1834. The most notable case was that of the ''[[Creole case|Creole]]'' in 1841: as a result of a [[slave revolt]] on board, the leaders ordered the US brig to Nassau. It was carrying 135 slaves from Virginia destined for sale in [[New Orleans]]. The Bahamian officials freed the 128 slaves who chose to stay in the islands.

These incidents, in which a total of 447 enslaved people belonging to US nationals were freed from 1830 to 1842, increased tension between the United States and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. They had been co-operating in patrols to suppress the international slave trade. However, worried about the stability of its large domestic slave trade and its value, the United States argued that the United Kingdom should not treat its domestic ships that came to its colonial ports under duress as part of the international trade. The United States worried that the success of the ''Creole'' slaves in gaining freedom would encourage more slave revolts on merchant ships.

During the [[American Civil War]] of the 1860s, the islands briefly prospered as a focus for [[blockade runners]] aiding the [[Confederate States]].

===Early 20th century===

The early decades of the 20th century were ones of hardship for many Bahamians, characterised by a stagnant economy and widespread poverty. Many eked out a living via subsistence agriculture or fishing. He did not enjoy the position, and referred to the islands as "a third-class British colony". He opened the small local parliament on 29 October 1940. The couple visited the "Out Islands" that November, on [[Axel Wenner-Gren]]'s yacht, which caused controversy; the [[British Foreign Office]] strenuously objected because they had been advised by United States intelligence that Wenner-Gren was a close friend of the [[Luftwaffe]] commander [[Hermann Göring]] of Nazi Germany.

The Duke was praised at the time for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands. A 1991 biography by Philip Ziegler, however, described him as contemptuous of the Bahamians and other non-European peoples of the Empire. He was praised for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] in June 1942, when there was a "full-scale riot". Ziegler said that the Duke blamed the trouble on "mischief makers – [[communists]]" and "men of Central European [[Jewish]] descent, who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of draft". The Duke resigned from the post on 16 March 1945.

===Post-Second World War===
[[File:Flag of the Bahamas (1964–1973).svg|thumb|The Bahamas was a [[Crown colony of the bahamas|Crown colony]] until it gained independence in 1973.]]{{see also|Monarchy of the Bahamas}}Modern political development began after the [[Second World War]]. The first political parties were formed in the 1950s, split broadly along ethnic lines, with the [[United Bahamian Party]] (UBP) representing the English-descended Bahamians (known informally as the "Bay Street Boys") and the [[Progressive Liberal Party]] (PLP) representing the Black-Bahamian majority.{{rp|p.73}} In 1967 [[Lynden Pindling|Sir Lynden Pindling]] of the PLP became the first black premier of the Bahamian colony; in 1968 the title of the position was changed to prime minister. In 1968 Pindling announced that the Bahamas would seek full independence. A new constitution giving the Bahamas increased control over its own affairs was adopted in 1968. In 1971, the UBP merged with a disaffected faction of the PLP to form a new party, the [[Free National Movement]] (FNM), a centre-right party which aimed to counter the growing power of Pindling's PLP.

[[Her Majesty's Government]] gave the Bahamas its independence by an [[Order in Council]] dated 20 June 1973. The Order came into force on 10 July 1973, on which date [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], delivered the official documents to Pindling, the prime minister. This date is now celebrated as [[List of national independence days|Independence Day]]. It joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on the same day. [[Milo Butler|Sir Milo Butler]] was appointed the first [[Governor-General of the Bahamas|governor-general of the Bahamas]] (the official representative of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]) shortly after independence.

===Post-independence===

Shortly after independence, the Bahamas joined the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] on 22 August 1973, and later the [[United Nations]] on 18 September 1973.

Politically, the first two decades were dominated by Pindling's PLP, who went on to win a string of electoral victories. Allegations of corruption, links with drug cartels and financial malfeasance within the Bahamian government failed to dent Pindling's popularity. Meanwhile, the economy underwent a dramatic growth period fuelled by the twin pillars of tourism and [[offshore finance]], significantly raising the [[standard of living]] on the islands. The Bahamas' booming economy led to it becoming a beacon for immigrants, most notably from [[Haiti]]. with 1,300 people missing after two weeks.

The [[COVID-19 pandemic in the Bahamas|COVID-19 pandemic]] reached the Bahamas on 15 March 2020.

At the [[2021 Bahamian general election|2021 general election]] the governing [[Free National Movement]] (FNM) lost to the opposition [[Progressive Liberal Party]] (PLP) as the economy struggled to recover from its deepest crash since at least 1971. On 17 September 2021 the chairman of the PLP, [[Philip Davis (Bahamian politician)|Phillip Davis]], was sworn in as the new prime minister, succeeding [[Hubert Minnis]].
