At Aybut Al Auwal, in the [[Dhofar|Dhofar Governorate]] of Oman, a site was discovered in 2011 containing more than 100 surface scatters of stone tools, belonging to a regionally specific African [[lithic industry]]—the late [[Nubia]]n Complex—known previously only from the northeast and [[Horn of Africa]]. Two optically stimulated luminescence age estimates place the Arabian Nubian Complex at 106,000 years old. This supports the proposition that early human populations moved from Africa into Arabia during the [[Late Pleistocene]].

In recent years{{when|date=April 2025}} surveys have uncovered Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites on the eastern coast. Main Palaeolithic sites include Saiwan-Ghunaim in the Barr al-Hikman. Archaeological remains are particularly numerous for the Bronze Age [[Umm an-Nar]] and [[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq]] periods. At the archaeological sites of Bat, Al-Janah, and Al-Ayn wheel-turned pottery, hand-made stone vessels, metals industry artifacts, and monumental architecture have been preserved.

=== Ancient history ===

==== Magan civilisation ====
{{Main|Magan (civilization)}}

[[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] tablets referred to Oman as "[[Magan (civilization)|Magan]]" and in the [[Akkadian language]] "Makan", a name that links Oman's ancient copper resources. This is a clear reference to the Magan civilisation, an ancient region in what is now modern day Oman and [[United Arab Emirates]], which was referred to in [[Sumer]]ian [[Cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] texts of around 2300 BCE and existed until 550 BCE as a source of [[copper]] and [[diorite]] for [[Mesopotamia]].

==== Iron Age to pre-Islamic period ====
There is considerable agreement in sources that [[frankincense]] was used by traders in 1500 BCE. The [[Land of Frankincense]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], dramatically illustrates that the incense constituted testimony to [[South Arabia]]n civilisations.

During the 8th century BCE, it is believed that the Yaarub, the descendant of [[Qahtanite|Qahtan]], ruled the entire region of Yemen, including Oman. Wathil bin Himyar bin [[Sheba|Abd-Shams (Saba)]] bin Yashjub ([[Yemen|Yaman]]) bin Yarub bin [[Joktan|Qahtan]] later ruled Oman. believed by virtue of oral history that in the 6th century BCE, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] exerted control over the Omani peninsula, most likely ruling from a coastal centre such as [[Suhar]]. Central Oman has its own indigenous Samad Late Iron Age cultural assemblage named eponymously from [[Samad al-Shan]]. In the northern part of the Oman Peninsula the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|Recent Pre-Islamic Period]] begins in the 3rd century BCE and extends into the 3rd century CE. Whether or not Persians brought south-eastern Arabia under their control is a moot point, since the lack of Persian archeological finds speak against this belief. [[Armand-Pierre Caussin de Perceval]] suggests that Shammir bin Wathil bin Himyar recognised the authority of [[Cyrus the Great]] over Oman in 536 BCE.

===Azd tribal migration===
Over centuries, tribes from western Arabia settled in Oman; they made a living by fishing, farming, herding or stock breeding. Further, many present-day Omani families trace their ancestral roots to other parts of Arabia. Arab migration to Oman started from northern-western and south-western Arabia and those who chose to settle had to compete with the indigenous population for the best arable land. When Arab tribes started to migrate to Oman, there were two distinct groups. One group, a segment of the [[Azd]] tribe migrated from [[Yemen]] in 120 According to Al-Kalbi, Malik bin Fahm was the first settler of Alazd. He is said to have first settled in [[Qalhat]]. By this account, Malik, with an armed force of more than 6000 men and horses, fought against the [[Marzban]], who served an ambiguously named Persian king in the battle of Salut in Oman and eventually defeated the Persian forces.{{sfn|Maisel|Shoup|2009|p=193}} This account is, however, semi-legendary and seems to condense multiple centuries of migration and conflict as well as an amalgamation of various traditions from not only the Arab tribes but also the region's original inhabitants.

During the 7th century CE, Omanis came in contact with and accepted [[Islam]]. The conversion of Omanis to Islam is ascribed to [[Amr ibn al-As]], who was sent by the prophet [[Muhammad]] during the [[Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha (Hisma)]]. Amr was dispatched to meet with Jaifer and Abd, the sons of Julanda who ruled Oman. They appear to have readily embraced Islam.

===Imamate of Oman===
{{Main|Imamate of Oman}}

Omani [[Azd]] used to travel to [[Basra]] for trade, which was a centre of Islam, during the [[Umayyad]] empire. Omani Azd were granted a section of Basra, where they could settle and attend to their needs. Many of the Omani Azd who settled in Basra became wealthy merchants and, under their leader [[al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra]], started to expand their influence of power eastwards towards [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. [[Ibadism]] originated in Basra through its founder, [[Abdallah ibn Ibad|Abd Allah ibn Ibad]], around the year 650; the Omani Azd in Iraq would subsequently adopt this as their predominant faith. Later, [[Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf|al-Hajjaj]], the governor of Iraq, came into conflict with the Ibadis, which forced them back to Oman. Among those who returned was the scholar [[Jābir ibn Zayd|Jaber bin Zaid]]. His return (and the return of many other scholars) greatly enhanced the Ibadhi movement in Oman.
[[File:Bahla Fort-109699.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Bahla Fort]], a UNESCO World Heritage site, was built between 12th and 15th c. by the [[Nabhani dynasty]].]]
The first elective [[Imamate of Oman]] is believed to have been established shortly after the fall of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Dynasty]] in 750/755 CE, when Janaħ bin ʕibadah Alħinnawi was elected. Other scholars claim that Janaħ bin Ibadah served as a [[Wāli]] (governor) under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] dynasty (and later ratified the Imamate), and that Julanda bin Masud was the first elected Imam of Oman, in 751 CE. The first Imamate reached its peak power in the ninth century CE. The authority of the Imams started to decline due to power struggles, the constant interventions of Abbasid, and the rise of the [[Seljuk Empire]]. The Nabhanis ruled as ''muluk'', or kings, while the Imams were reduced to largely symbolic significance. The capital of the dynasty was [[Bahla]]. The Banu Nabhan controlled the trade in frankincense on the overland route via [[Sohar]] to the [[Yabrin]] oasis, and then north to Bahrain, Baghdad and Damascus. The mango-tree was introduced to Oman during the time of Nabhani dynasty, by ElFellah bin Muhsin. The Nabhani dynasty started to deteriorate in 1507 when Portuguese colonisers captured the coastal city of [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], and gradually extended their control along the coast up to [[Sohar]] in the north and down to [[Sur, Oman|Sur]] in the southeast. Other historians argue that the Nabhani dynasty ended earlier in 1435 CE when conflicts between the dynasty and Alhinawis arose, which led to the restoration of the elective Imamate. In need of an outpost to protect their sea lanes, the Portuguese built up and fortified the city. Remnants of Portuguese architectural style still exist. Later, several more Omani cities were colonised in the early 16th century by the Portuguese, to control the entrances of the [[Persian Gulf]] and trade in the region as part of a web of fortresses in the region, from [[Basra]] to [[Hormuz Island]].

Later in the 17th century, using its bases in Oman, Portugal engaged in the [[Battle off Hormuz (1625)|largest naval battle ever fought in the Persian Gulf]]. The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] force fought against a combined armada of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) and [[English East India Company]] supported by the Safavid empire. The result of the battle was a draw but it resulted in the loss of Portuguese influence in the Gulf.

===Yaruba dynasty (1624–1744)===
{{further|Omani Empire}}
[[File:Areas under Omani influence 18th-19th century.svg|thumb|Following the expulsion of the [[Portuguese Empire]], Oman became one of the powers in the western Indian Ocean from 1698 onwards.]]
The [[Ottoman Empire]] temporarily captured Muscat from the Portuguese again in 1581 and held it until 1588. During the 17th century, the Omanis were reunited by the [[Yaruba dynasty|Yaruba Imams]]. Nasir bin Murshid became the first Yaarubah Imam in 1624, when he was elected in Rustaq. Imam Nasir and his successor succeeded in the 1650s in expelling the Portuguese from their coastal domains in Oman. The Omanis over time established a maritime empire that pursued the Portuguese and expelled them from all their possessions in East Africa, which were then incorporated into the Omani domains. To capture Zanzibar [[Saif bin Sultan]], the [[Imam]] of Oman, pressed down the [[Swahili Coast]]. A major obstacle to his progress was [[Fort Jesus]], housing the garrison of a Portuguese settlement at [[Mombasa]]. After a two-year siege, the fort fell to Imam Saif bin Sultan in 1698. Saif bin Sultan occupied Bahrain in 1700.  The rivalry within the house of Yaruba over power after the death of Imam Sultan in 1718 weakened the dynasty. With the power of the Yaruba Dynasty dwindling, Imam Saif bin Sultan II eventually asked for help against his rivals from [[Nader Shah]] of Persia. A Persian force arrived in March 1737 to aid Saif. From their base at Julfar, the Persian forces eventually rebelled against the Yaruba in 1743. The Persian empire then tried to take possession of the coast of Oman until 1747.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
[[File:Dares 222.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Palace Museum, Zanzibar|Sultan's Palace]] in [[Zanzibar]], which was once Oman's capital and residence of its sultans]]
After the Omanis expelled the [[Persians]], [[Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi|Ahmed bin Sa'id Albusaidi]] became the elected Imam of Oman on 20 November 1744, with [[Rustaq]] serving as the capital. His dynasty, the Al Bu Said, continues to rule Oman into the year 2025. Since the revival of the Imamate, the Omanis continued with the elective system but, provided that the person is deemed qualified, gave preference to a member of the ruling family.

Following Imam Ahmed's death in 1783, his son, [[Said bin Ahmad Al Busaidi|Said bin Ahmed]] became the elected Imam. Said's son, [[Hamad bin Said|Hamed bin Said]], overthrew the governor of Muscat and soon obtained the possession of most of the fortress' in the region, giving himself the title of "Seyyid". Afterwards, Seyyid [[Sultan bin Ahmad|Sultan bin Ahmed]], the uncle of Seyyid Hamed, took over power. Sultan's son, Seyyid [[Said bin Sultan]] succeeded him. 

During the entire 19th century, in addition to Imam Said bin Ahmed who retained the title until he died in 1803, [[Azzan bin Qais]] was the only elected Imam of Oman. His rule started in 1868. However, the British refused to accept Imam Azzan as a ruler, as he was viewed as inimical to their interests. This view played an instrumental role in supporting the deposition of Imam Azzan in 1871 by his cousin, [[Turki bin Said|Sayyid Turki]], a son of the late Sayyid Said bin Sultan, and brother of [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Sultan Barghash of Zanzibar]], who Britain deemed to be more acceptable. 

Oman's Imam Sultan, defeated ruler of Muscat, was granted sovereignty over [[Gwadar]], an area of modern-day Pakistan.

==== British protectorate status ====
The [[British Empire]] was keen to dominate southeast Arabia to stifle the growing power of other European states and to curb the Omani maritime power that grew during the 17th century. In 1798, the first treaty between the British [[East India Company]] and the Albusaidi dynasty was signed by Sayyid Sultan bin Ahmed. The treaty aimed to block commercial competition of the French and the Dutch as well as obtain a concession to build a British factory at [[Bandar Abbas]]. A second treaty was signed in 1800, which stipulated that a British representative shall reside at the port of Muscat and manage all external affairs with other states.
}}
In 1854, a deed of cession of the Omani [[Kuria Muria]] islands to Britain was signed by the sultan of Muscat and the British government. The British government achieved predominating control over Muscat, which, for the most part, impeded competition from other nations. Between 1862 and 1892, the Political Residents, [[Lewis Pelly]] and Edward Ross, played an instrumental role in securing British supremacy over the Persian Gulf and Muscat by a system of indirect governance. The Sultanate thus came ''de facto'' under the British sphere.

==== Treaty of Seeb ====
[[File:Maskat & Oman map.png|thumb|left|The split between the interior region (orange) and the coastal region (red) of Oman and Muscat]]
The [[Hajar Mountains]], of which the [[Jebel Akhdar (Oman)|Jebel Akhdar]] is a part, separate the country into two distinct regions: the interior, and the coastal area dominated by the capital, Muscat.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}} The British imperial development over Muscat and Oman during the 19th century led to the renewed revival of the cause of the Imamate in the interior of Oman, which has appeared in cycles for more than 1,200 years in Oman. In 1913, Imam Salim Alkharusi instigated an anti-Muscat rebellion that lasted until 1920 when the Sultanate established peace with the Imamate by signing the [[Treaty of Seeb]]. The treaty was brokered by Britain, which had no economic interest in the interior of Oman during that point of time. The treaty granted autonomous rule to the Imamate in the interior of Oman and recognised the sovereignty of the coast of Oman, the [[Muscat and Oman|Sultanate of Muscat]]. In 1920, Imam Salim Alkharusi died and Muhammad Alkhalili was elected. On 31 July 1928, the [[Red Line Agreement]] was signed between Anglo-Persian Company (later renamed British Petroleum), Royal Dutch/Shell, Compagnie Française des Pétroles (later renamed Total), Near East Development Corporation (later renamed ExxonMobil) and Calouste Gulbenkian (an Armenian businessman) to collectively produce oil in the post-[[Ottoman Empire]] region, which included the Arabian peninsula, with each of the four major companies holding 23.75 percent of the shares while [[Calouste Gulbenkian]] held the remaining 5 percent shares. The agreement stipulated that none of the signatories was allowed to pursue the establishment of oil concessions within the agreed on area without including all other stakeholders. In 1929, the members of the agreement established [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC). On 13 November 1931, Sultan Taimur bin Faisal abdicated.

=== Reign of Sultan Said (1932–1970) ===
[[File:Said bin Taimur (cropped).png|thumb|right|upright|Sultan [[Said bin Taimur]] ruled from 1932 to 1970]]
[[Said bin Taimur]] became the sultan of Muscat officially on 10 February 1932. The rule of sultan Said, a very complex character, was backed by the British government, and has been characterised as being [[feudal]], [[reactionary]] and isolationist. In 1937, an agreement between the sultan and [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), a consortium of oil companies that was 23.75% British owned, was signed to grant oil concessions to IPC. After failing to discover oil in the Sultanate, IPC was intensely interested in some promising geological formations near [[Fahud]], an area located within the Imamate. IPC offered financial support to the sultan to raise an armed force against any potential resistance by the Imamate.

Upon the outbreak of [[World War II]], the sultan of Oman declared war on Germany on September 10, 1939. Gwadar then became a [[tehsil]] in the Makran district.

====Jebel Akhdar War====
{{further|Jebel Akhdar War}}
Sultan Said bin Taimur expressed his interest in occupying the Imamate right after the death of Imam Alkhalili, thus taking advantage of any potential instability that might occur within the Imamate when elections were due, to the British government. The British political agent in Muscat believed that the only method of gaining access to the oil reserves in the interior was by assisting the sultan in taking over the Imamate. In 1946, the British government offered arms and ammunition, auxiliary supplies and officers to prepare the sultan to attack the interior of Oman. In May 1954, Imam Alkhalili died and [[Ghalib Alhinai]] was elected Imam. Relations between the Sultan Said bin Taimur, and Imam Ghalib Alhinai frayed over their dispute about oil concessions.

In December 1955, Sultan Said bin Taimur sent troops of the Muscat and Oman Field Force to occupy the main centres in Oman, including [[Nizwa]], the capital of the Imamate of Oman, and [[Ibri]]. The Omanis in the interior led by Imam Ghalib Alhinai, Talib Alhinai, the brother of the Imam and the Wali (governor) of Rustaq, and Suleiman bin Hamyar, who was the Wali (governor) of Jebel Akhdar, defended the Imamate in the [[Jebel Akhdar War]] against British-backed attacks by the Sultanate. In July 1957, the Sultan's forces were withdrawing, but they were repeatedly ambushed, sustaining heavy casualties. The Imamate's forces retreated to the inaccessible [[Jebel Akhdar (Oman)|Jebel Akhdar]]. On 27 January 1959, the Sultanate's forces occupied the mountain in a surprise operation. The exiled partisans of the now abolished Imamate of Oman presented the case of Oman to the [[Arab League]] and the United Nations. On 11 December 1963, the UN General Assembly decided to establish an Ad-Hoc Committee on Oman to study the 'Question of Oman' and report back to the General Assembly. The UN General Assembly adopted the 'Question of Oman' resolution in 1965, 1966 and again in 1967 that called upon the British government to cease all repressive action against the locals, end British control over Oman and reaffirmed the inalienable right of the Omani people to self-determination and independence.

====Dhofar War====
{{further|Dhofar War}}
In the [[Dhofar War]], which began in 1963, pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces were pitted against government troops. As the rebellion threatened the Sultan's control of [[Dhofar]], Sultan Said bin Taimur was deposed in a [[1970 Omani coup d'état|bloodless coup]] in 1970 by his son [[Qaboos bin Said]] with [[United Kingdom|British]] support. Qaboos expanded the [[Sultan of Oman's Armed Forces]], modernised the state's administration and introduced social reforms. The uprising was finally put down in 1976 with the help of forces from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan and Britain.{{Citation needed|date=August 2025}}

After deposing his father in 1970, [[Sultan Qaboos]] opened up the country, removed "Muscat and" from the country's name, embarked on economic reforms, and followed a policy of modernisation marked by increased spending on health, education and welfare. Saudi Arabia invested in the development of the Omani education system, sending Saudi teachers on its own expense. [[Indian Ocean slave trade|Slavery]], once a cornerstone of the country's trade and development, was outlawed in 1970.

In 1971, Oman joined the United Nations, along with Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.{{cn|date=July 2025}}

In 1981, Oman became a founding member of the six-nation [[Gulf Cooperation Council]]. Political reforms were eventually introduced. The country adopted its present [[Flag of Oman|national flag]] in 1995, resembling the previous flag but with a thicker stripe. In 1997, a royal decree was issued granting women the right to vote, and stand for election to the Majlis al-Shura, the [[Consultative Assembly of Oman]]. Two women were duly elected to the body. In 2002, voting rights were extended to all citizens over the age of 21, and the first elections to the Consultative Assembly under the new rules were held in 2003. In 2004, the Sultan appointed Oman's first female minister with portfolio, [[Aisha bint Khalfan bin Jameel|Sheikha Aisha bint Khalfan bin Jameel al-Sayabiyah]], to the post of National Authority for Industrial Craftsmanship. Despite these changes, there was little change to the actual political makeup of the government. The Sultan continued to rule by decree. Nearly 100 suspected Islamists were arrested in 2005 and 31 people were convicted of trying to overthrow the government. They were ultimately pardoned in June of the same year.

In 2013, Oman achieved its status as the elimination of [[malaria]] diagnoses, according to the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]] (WHO).{{cn|date=July 2025}}

Qaboos, at the time the Arab world's longest-serving ruler, died on 10 January 2020. He was succeeded by his first cousin [[Haitham bin Tariq]]. On 12 January 2021, Haitham named his eldest son, [[Theyazin bin Haitham]], as the country's first [[Crown Prince of Oman|crown prince]] and heir to the throne with an amendment to the [[Basic Statute of Oman|Basic Statute]].
