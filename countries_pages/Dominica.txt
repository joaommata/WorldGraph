{{main|History of Dominica}}

=== Geologic history ===
Dominica first emerged from the sea during the [[Oligocene]] Epoch approximately 27 million years ago, making it one of the last Caribbean islands to be formed by [[Volcanism|volcanic activity]].{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

=== Pre-colonial period and early European contact ===

Dominica's precolonial indigenous inhabitants were the [[Island Carib]] people, who are thought to have driven out the previous [[Arawak]] population. However, this may be a partial misconception as ancestral Kalinago narratives mention the two groups coexisting and intermarrying. The Arawak were not the primary indigenous group. It is believed that before them were a group of paleo-Indians who arrived towards the end of the late Pleistocene period.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

In 1493, [[Christopher Columbus]] first spotted the island during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|second voyage]] to the Americas. Because he saw the island on a Sunday (November 3, 1493), Columbus named the island Dominica (Latin for 'Sunday'). In 1690, the French established their first permanent settlements. French woodcutters from [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]] began to set up timber camps to supply the French islands with wood, and they gradually became permanent settlers. They brought the first enslaved Africans from West Africa to ''Dominique'', as they called it in French.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

In 1715, a revolt of "poor white" smallholders in the north of Martinique, known as La Gaoulé, caused settlers to migrate to southern Dominique, where they set up [[smallholding]]s. Meanwhile, French families and others from Guadeloupe settled in the north. In 1727, the first French commander, [[M. Le Grand]], took charge of the island with a basic French government. Dominique formally became a [[colony]] of France, and the island was divided into districts or "quarters". The French had already developed plantation agriculture on Martinique and Guadeloupe, where they cultivated [[sugarcane]] with enslaved African workers. In Dominique they gradually developed coffee plantations. Because of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the general population came to consist primarily of black-African slaves.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

In 1761, during the [[Seven Years' War]] in Europe, a [[British expedition against Dominica]], led by [[Andrew Rollo, 5th Lord Rollo|Andrew Rollo]], conquered the island and several other Caribbean islands. In 1763, France lost the war and ceded the island to Great Britain in 1763 under the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]].

In 1831, reflecting a liberalisation of official British racial attitudes, the Brown Privilege Bill conferred political and social rights on [[free black]]s (mostly [[free people of colour]], who generally were of [[mixed race]], with African and European ancestry). With the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]], Britain ended the institution of slavery throughout [[British Empire|its empire]], except in India.

With freedom came enfranchisement. In 1835, the first three men of African descent were elected to the legislative assembly of Dominica. Many slaves from the neighbouring French colonial islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique fled to Dominica. In 1838, Dominica became the first colony of the [[British West Indies]] to have an elected legislature controlled by an ethnic African majority. Most of these legislators had been free people of colour and smallholders or merchants before the abolition of slavery. Their economic and social views were different from the interests of the small, wealthy English [[plantation|planter]] class. Reacting to a perceived threat to their power, the planters lobbied for more direct British rule.

=== Post-independence ===
In mid-1979, political discontent with founding prime minister Patrick John's administration climaxed in a civilian coup and ended in the passage of a [[motion of no confidence]] against John in the House of Assembly, Dominica's legislature, collapsing his administration. An Interim Government was formed under Dominica's second Prime Minister [[Oliver Seraphin]]; [[Hurricane Allen]] the following year caused further damage.

In 1981, Charles's government was threatened with two attempted coups. The first was led by [[Frederick Newton]], commander of the [[Military of Dominica]], who organised an attack on the police headquarters in Roseau which resulted in the death of a police officer. Newton and five other soldiers were found guilty in the attack and sentenced to death in 1983; the sentences of the five accomplices were later commuted to life in prison, but Newton was executed in 1986. led by [[Mike Perdue]] and [[Wolfgang Droege]] in [[Operation Red Dog]]. They tried to overthrow Charles as prime minister and reinstate ex-prime minister John in exchange for control over the country's development. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was tipped off, and the ship hired to transport the mercenaries never left dock. The mercenaries lacked formal military experience or training, and most of the crew had been misled into joining by the ringleader Mike Perdue. [[White supremacy|White supremacist]] [[Don Black (white nationalist)|Don Black]] was jailed for his part in the attempted coup, which violated US [[Neutrality Act of 1794|neutrality]] laws.

The Charles government supported the 1983 American [[invasion of Grenada]], earning Dominica praise from the US government of [[Ronald Reagan]], and an increase in financial aid.

By the middle of the 1980s, the economy had begun to recover, and was replaced by [[Pierre Charles (Dominican politician)|Pierre Charles]], who died in office on 6 January 2004. [[Roosevelt Skerrit]], also of the DLP, replaced Pierre Charles as prime minister, becoming the world's youngest head of government at the age of 31. With his 2005 election win, Skerrit became only the second incumbent prime minister to be popularly re-elected.

In the [[2009 Dominican general election|2009 election]], the DLP won 18 of 21 seats. The UWP claimed campaign improprieties and embarked on a wide range of protest actions, including boycott of Parliament. UWP's boycott caused at least three unauthorised absences from Parliament for two of their three elected representatives in violation of Parliamentary procedure, leading to their two seats being declared vacant and by-elections called to fill them in July 2010 The UWP held both seats. The DLP under Skerrit went on to win the [[2014 Dominican general election]].

On 17 September 2012 [[Eliud Williams|Eliud Thaddeus Williams]] was sworn in as president (a largely ceremonial role), replacing [[Nicholas Liverpool|Dr. Nicholas Liverpool]] who was reportedly removed from office due to ill health. On 30 September 2013 former trade union leader and former DFP leader [[Charles Savarin]] was elected president, having only days before resigned as a minister of government. He is Dominica's eighth president.

[[Tropical Storm Erika]] devastated the island in August 2015, killing 30 and causing severe environmental and economic damage. Early estimates of damage suggested 90% of the buildings on the island had been destroyed, with infrastructure left in ruins. The UK, France and the Netherlands set up shipping and air lifts to take aid to the island, the scale of destruction having left most people homeless.

Dominica won its first two Commonwealth Games medals in silver (men's triple jump) and bronze (women's triple jump) in the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]].

President Charles Angelo Savarin was re-elected in 2018 for a new five-year term.

In December 2019, incumbent prime minister Roosevelt Skerrit won his fourth consecutive general [[2019 Dominican general election|election]] 18 seats to 3, becoming the first prime minister of Dominica to do so.

Dominica received its first Olympic gold medal in the [[2024 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]] when [[Thea LaFond]] won the [[Athletics at the 2024 Summer Olympics – Women's triple jump|women's triple jump]] with a length of 15.02 metres.
