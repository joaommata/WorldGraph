===Pre-colonial period===

The earliest known inhabitants of Saint Kitts and Nevis were pre-ceramic, pre-agricultural peoples who arrived as early as 3000 BCE. These groups, often referred to as "Archaic people," were hunter-gatherers who migrated down the archipelago from [[Florida]]. Due to the absence of pottery and other durable artifacts, their cultural affiliations remain uncertain. Around 100 BCE, the islands saw the arrival of the [[Saladoid]] people, a ceramic-using, agricultural society that migrated northward from the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]] region in present-day [[Venezuela]]. They introduced agriculture and pottery to the islands and established settled communities.

By approximately 800 CE, the [[Igneri]] people, associated with the [[Arawak]] linguistic group, had settled on the islands. The Igneri were known for their peaceful nature and religious practices, and they continued the agricultural traditions of their predecessors.

Around 1300 CE, the [[Kalinago]] people, also known as the [[Kalinago|Island Caribs]], migrated to Saint Kitts and Nevis. Renowned for their seafaring skills and warrior culture, the Kalinago displaced the Igneri and established dominance over the islands. They named [[Saint Kitts]] "Liamuiga," meaning "fertile land," and [[Nevis]] "Oualie," meaning "land of beautiful waters."

===European arrival and early colonial period (1493–1700)===
[[Christopher Columbus]] was the first European to sight the islands in 1493. The first settlers were the English in 1623, led by [[Thomas Warner (explorer)|Thomas Warner]], who established a settlement at [[Old Road Town]] on the west coast of St Kitts after achieving an agreement with the Carib chief [[Ouboutou Tegremante]].{{rp|15–18}} The French later also settled on St Kitts in 1625 under [[Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc]]. As a result, both parties agreed to partition the island into French and English sectors. From 1628 onward the English also began settling on Nevis.

The French and English, intent on exploitation of the island's resources, encountered resistance from the native Caribs (Kalinago), who waged war during the first three years of the settlements' existence. The Europeans resolved to rid themselves of this problem. An ideological campaign was waged by colonial chroniclers, dating back to the Spanish, as they produced literature which denied the Kalinagos' humanity (a literary tradition carried through the late-seventeenth century by such authors as [[Jean-Baptiste du Tertre]] and Pere Labat). In 1626 the Anglo-French settlers joined forces to [[Kalinago Genocide of 1626|massacre the Kalinago]] at a place that became known as [[Bloody Point]], allegedly to preempt a Carib plan to expel or kill all European settlers. Thereafter, the English and French established large sugar plantations which were worked by imported African slaves. This made the planter-colonists rich, but drastically altered the islands' demographics as black slaves soon came to outnumber Europeans.{{rp|26–31}}

A Spanish expedition of 1629 sent to enforce Spanish claims [[Battle of St. Kitts (1629)|destroyed the English and French colonies]] and deported the settlers back to their respective countries. As part of [[Anglo-Spanish War (1625-1630)|the war]] settlement in 1630, the Spanish permitted the re-establishment of the English and French colonies.{{rp|19–23}} Spain later formally recognised Britain's claim to St Kitts with the [[Treaty of Madrid (1670)]], in return for British cooperation in the fight against piracy.

As Spanish power declined, Saint Kitts became a key base for English and French expansion in the Caribbean. From St Kitts the British settled the islands of [[Antigua]], [[Montserrat]], [[Anguilla]] and [[Tortola]], and the French settled [[Martinique]], the [[Guadeloupe]] archipelago and [[Saint Barthélemy]]. During the late 17th century, France and England fought for control over St Kitts and Nevis, fighting wars in [[Battle of Nevis|1667]],{{rp|41–50}} [[Nine Years' War#Asia and the Caribbean|1689–90]]{{rp|51–55}} and [[War of the Spanish Succession|1701–13]]. The French renounced their claim to the islands with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713.{{rp|55–60}} The islands' economy, already shattered by war, was further harmed by natural disasters: In 1690 an earthquake destroyed Jamestown, capital of Nevis, forcing the construction of a new capital at [[Charlestown, Nevis|Charlestown]]. Further damage was caused by a hurricane in 1707.{{rp|105–108}}

===British colonial period (1700–1983)===
The colony had recovered by the turn of the 18th century, and St Kitts had become the richest British Crown Colony per capita in the Caribbean as result of its slave-based [[sugar industry]] by the close of the 1700s. The 18th century also saw Nevis, formerly the richer of the two islands, being eclipsed by St Kitts in economic importance.{{rp|75}}{{rp|126,137}} [[Alexander Hamilton]], the future U.S. secretary of the Treasury, was born on Nevis in 1755 or 1757.

As Britain became embroiled in [[American Revolutionary War|war with its American colonies]], the French decided to use the opportunity to [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|re-capture St Kitts]] in 1782; however St Kitts was given back and recognised as British territory in the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)]].

The African slave trade was terminated within the British Empire in 1807, and slavery outlawed completely in 1834. A four-year "apprenticeship" period followed for each slave, in which they worked for their former owners for wages. On Nevis 8,815 slaves were freed, while St Kitts freed 19,780.{{rp|174}}{{rp|110,114–117}}

Saint Kitts and Nevis, along with Anguilla, were federated in 1882. In the first few decades of the 20th century economic hardship and lack of opportunities led to the growth of a labour movement; [[the Great Depression]] prompted sugar workers to go on strike in 1935. The 1940s saw the founding of the [[Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party|St Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla Labour Party]] (later renamed the Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party, or SKNLP) under [[Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw]]. Bradshaw later became Chief Minister and then Premier of the colony from 1966 to 1978; he sought to gradually bring the sugar-based economy under greater state control.{{rp|151–152}} The more conservative-leaning [[People's Action Movement]] party (PAM) was founded in 1965.

After a brief period as part of the [[West Indies Federation]] (1958–62), the islands became an [[Saint Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla|associated state]] with full internal autonomy in 1967. Residents of Nevis and Anguilla were unhappy with St Kitts's domination of the federation, and Anguilla unilaterally declared independence in 1967. In 1971 Britain resumed full control of Anguilla, but it was formally separated in 1980.{{rp|147–149}} Attention then focused on Nevis, with the [[Nevis Reformation Party]] seeking to safeguard the smaller island's interests in any future independent state. Eventually it was agreed that the island would have a degree of autonomy with its own [[Premier of Nevis|Premier]] and [[Nevis Island Assembly|Assembly]], as well as the constitutionally-protected right to unilaterally secede if a referendum on independence resulted in a two-thirds majority in favour.

===Post independence era (1983–present)===

St Kitts and Nevis achieved full independence on 19 September 1983. [[Kennedy Simmonds]] of the PAM, Premier since 1980, duly became the country's first [[List of Prime Ministers of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Prime Minister]]. St Kitts and Nevis opted to remain within the [[British Commonwealth]], at that time retaining Queen Elizabeth as [[Monarchy of St Kitts and Nevis|Monarch]], represented locally by a [[Governor-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Governor-General]].
Kennedy Simmonds went on to win elections in [[1984 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election|1984]], [[1989 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election|1989]] and [[1993 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election|1993]], before being unseated when the SKNLP returned to power in 1995 under [[Denzil Douglas]].

In Nevis, growing discontent with their perceived marginalisation within the federation led to a [[Nevis independence referendum, 1998|referendum to separate]] from St Kitts in 1998, which though resulting a 62% vote to secede, fell short of the required two-thirds majority to be legally enacted.

In late-September 1998, [[Hurricane Georges]] caused approximately $458,000,000 in damages and limited GDP growth for the year and beyond. Meanwhile, the sugar industry, in decline for years and propped up only by government subsidies, was closed completely in 2005.

In 2012, Saint Kitts and Nevis was declared free of [[malaria]], according to the [[World Health Organization]].

The [[2015 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election]] was won by [[Timothy Harris]] and his recently formed [[People's Labour Party (Saint Kitts and Nevis)|People's Labour Party]], with backing from the PAM and the Nevis-based [[Concerned Citizens' Movement]] under the '[[Team Unity (Saint Kitts and Nevis)|Team Unity]]' banner.

In June 2020, Team Unity coalition of the incumbent government, led by Prime Minister Timothy Harris, won general [[2020 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election|elections]] by defeating Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP).

In [[2022 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election|snap general elections held in August 2022]], the SKNLP again won, and [[Terrance Drew]] became the fourth prime minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis.
