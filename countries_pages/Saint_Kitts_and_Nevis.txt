===Pre-colonial period===

The earliest known inhabitants of Saint Kitts and Nevis were pre-ceramic, pre-agricultural peoples who arrived as early as 3000 BCE. These groups, often referred to as "Archaic people," were hunter-gatherers who migrated down the archipelago from [[Florida]]. Due to the absence of pottery and other durable artifacts, their cultural affiliations remain uncertain. Around 100 BCE, the islands saw the arrival of the [[Saladoid]] people, a ceramic-using, agricultural society that migrated northward from the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]] region in present-day [[Venezuela]]. They introduced agriculture and pottery to the islands and established settled communities. encountered resistance from the native Caribs (Kalinago), who waged war during the first three years of the settlements' existence. The Europeans resolved to rid themselves of this problem. An ideological campaign was waged by colonial chroniclers, dating back to the Spanish, as they produced literature which denied the Kalinagos' humanity (a literary tradition carried through the late-seventeenth century by such authors as [[Jean-Baptiste du Tertre]] and Pere Labat). Thereafter, the English and French established large sugar plantations which were worked by imported African slaves. This made the planter-colonists rich, but drastically altered the islands' demographics as black slaves soon came to outnumber Europeans.

As Spanish power declined, Saint Kitts became a key base for English and French expansion in the Caribbean. From St Kitts the British settled the islands of [[Antigua]], [[Montserrat]], [[Anguilla]] and [[Tortola]], and the French settled [[Martinique]], the [[Guadeloupe]] archipelago and [[Saint Barthélemy]]. During the late 17th century, France and England fought for control over St Kitts and Nevis, fighting wars in [[Battle of Nevis|1667]],{{rp|105–108}}

===British colonial period (1700–1983)===
The colony had recovered by the turn of the 18th century, and St Kitts had become the richest British Crown Colony per capita in the Caribbean as result of its slave-based [[sugar industry]] by the close of the 1700s. The 18th century also saw Nevis, formerly the richer of the two islands, being eclipsed by St Kitts in economic importance.

As Britain became embroiled in [[American Revolutionary War|war with its American colonies]], the French decided to use the opportunity to [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|re-capture St Kitts]] in 1782; however St Kitts was given back and recognised as British territory in the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)]]. The 1940s saw the founding of the [[Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party|St Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla Labour Party]] (later renamed the Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party, or SKNLP) under [[Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw]]. Bradshaw later became Chief Minister and then Premier of the colony from 1966 to 1978; he sought to gradually bring the sugar-based economy under greater state control.

After a brief period as part of the [[West Indies Federation]] (1958–62), the islands became an [[Saint Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla|associated state]] with full internal autonomy in 1967.

===Post independence era (1983–present)===

St Kitts and Nevis achieved full independence on 19 September 1983.
Kennedy Simmonds went on to win elections in [[1984 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election|1984]], [[1989 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election|1989]] and [[1993 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election|1993]], before being unseated when the SKNLP returned to power in 1995 under [[Denzil Douglas]]. led to a [[Nevis independence referendum, 1998|referendum to separate]] from St Kitts in 1998, which though resulting a 62% vote to secede, fell short of the required two-thirds majority to be legally enacted.

In 2012, Saint Kitts and Nevis was declared free of [[malaria]], according to the [[World Health Organization]].

The [[2015 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election]] was won by [[Timothy Harris]] and his recently formed [[People's Labour Party (Saint Kitts and Nevis)|People's Labour Party]], with backing from the PAM and the Nevis-based [[Concerned Citizens' Movement]] under the '[[Team Unity (Saint Kitts and Nevis)|Team Unity]]' banner.

In June 2020, Team Unity coalition of the incumbent government, led by Prime Minister Timothy Harris, won general [[2020 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election|elections]] by defeating Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP).

In [[2022 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election|snap general elections held in August 2022]], the SKNLP again won, and [[Terrance Drew]] became the fourth prime minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis.
