{{main|History of Grenada}}

=== Precolumbian history ===
Grenada is thought to have been first populated by peoples from South America during the Caribbean [[Ortoiroid people|Archaic Age]], although definitive evidence is lacking. The earliest potential human presence comes from [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]] evidence of lake cores, beginning {{circa|3600 BC}}. Less ephemeral, permanent villages began {{circa|100–200}}. The population peaked between 750 and 1250, with major changes in population afterward, potentially the result of either the [[Island Caribs|"Carib Invasion"]] (although highly contested), regional droughts, or both.

===European arrival===
In 1498, Christopher Columbus was the first European to report sighting Grenada during his third voyage, naming it 'La Concepción', but Amerigo Vespucci may have renamed it 'Mayo' in 1499. Although it was deemed the property of the King of Spain, there are no records to suggest the Spanish attempted to settle. However, various Europeans are known to have passed and both fought and traded with the indigenous peoples there. The first known settlement attempt was a failed venture by the English in 1609 who were massacred and driven away by the native "Carib" peoples.{{sfn|Steele|2003|pp=35–36}}

===French colony and slavery (1649–1763)===
{{Main|French West Indies}}
In 1649, a French expedition of 203 men from [[Martinique]], led by [[Jacques Dyel du Parquet]], founded a permanent settlement on Grenada.{{sfn|Steele|2003|pp=35–36}} They signed a peace treaty with the Carib chief [[Chief Kairouane|Kairouane]], but within months conflict broke out between the two communities.{{sfn|Steele|2003|pp=39–48}} This lasted until 1654 when the island was completely subjugated by the French.{{sfn|Steele|2003|pp=35–44}} Warfare continued during the 1600s between the French on Grenada and the Caribs of present-day [[Dominica]] and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]].

[[History of chocolate|Chocolate]] was brought to Grenada in 1714 with the introduction of [[cocoa bean]]s.

The French named their [[French colonial empires|new colony]] La Grenade, and the economy was initially based on [[sugar cane]] and [[indigo]], worked by African slaves via the transatlantic slave trade.{{sfn|Steele|2003|p=59}} According to records, during the French colonial period (circa 1659–1762), the enslaved population on Grenada rose from about 222 in 1669 to roughly 15,200 by 1763'''.''' The French established a capital known as Fort Royal (later St. George's). To shelter from hurricanes, the French navy would often take refuge in the capital's natural harbour, as no nearby French islands had a natural harbour to compare with that of Fort Royal. The British captured Grenada in the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1762.

Grenada was formally ceded to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] by the Treaty of Paris in 1763. The French [[French capture of Grenada 1779|re-captured the island]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], after [[Comte d'Estaing]] won the bloody land and naval [[Battle of Grenada]] in July 1779. However, the island was restored to Britain with the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] in 1783. A decade later, dissatisfaction with British rule led to a [[Fédon's rebellion|pro-French revolt]] in 1795–96 led by [[Julien Fédon]], which was successfully defeated by the British.

As Grenada's economy grew, more and more enslaved Africans transported to the island. In 1785, Grenada had 23,926 enslaved Africans and 1,115 free people of colour, with around 996 European settlers. According to the Voyages Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, by 1807 Britain had brought 114,000 slaves to Grenada'''.''' Britain eventually outlawed the slave trade within the British Empire in 1807, after transporting approximately 3.1 million Africans, between 1640 and 1807, with roughly 2.7 million surviving the Middle Passage and arriving in the Americas. Slavery was completely outlawed in 1833, leading to the emancipation of all enslaved Africans by 1838. To ease the subsequent labour shortage, migrants from India were brought to Grenada in 1857.{{sfn|Steele|2003|pp=35–36}}

[[Nutmeg]] was introduced to Grenada in 1843 when a merchant ship called in on its way to England from the East Indies.{{sfn|Steele|2003|pp=35–36}} The ship had a small quantity of nutmeg trees on board, which they left in Grenada. Nutmeg continues to be an important crop for the Grenadine economy.

==== Later colonial period after slavery ====
In 1877, Grenada was made a [[Crown colony]]. [[Theophilus A. Marryshow]] founded the Representative Government Association (RGA) in 1918 to agitate for a new and participative constitutional dispensation for the Grenadian people. Due to Marryshow's lobbying, the Wood Commission of 1921–22 concluded that Grenada was ready for constitutional reform in the form of a modified Crown colony government. This modification granted Grenadians the right to elect five of the 15 Legislative Council members on a restricted property franchise, enabling the wealthiest 4% of adult Grenadians to vote. Marryshow was named a [[1943 Birthday Honours#Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE)|Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1943]].

In 1950, [[Eric Gairy]] founded the [[Grenada United Labour Party]] (GULP), initially as a trade union, which led to the 1951 [[general strike]] for better working conditions.{{sfn|Steele|2003|pp=35–36}} This sparked great unrest, and so many buildings were set ablaze that the disturbances became known as the "sky red" days. On 10 October 1951, Grenada held its [[1951 Grenadian general election|first general elections]] based on universal adult suffrage, with Gairy's party winning six of the eight seats contested.

From 1958 to 1962, Grenada was part of the [[Federation of the West Indies]].{{sfn|Steele|2003|pp=35–36}} After the federation's collapse, Grenada was granted full autonomy over its internal affairs as an Associated State on 3 March 1967. [[Herbert Blaize]] of the [[Grenada National Party]] (GNP) was the first Premier of the Associated State of Grenada from March to August 1967. Eric Gairy served as [[Premier of Grenada|Premier]] from August 1967 until February 1974.

=== Post-independence era ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-0610-101, Berlin, Besuch Regierungsdelegation Grenada, Bootsfahrt.jpg|thumb|[[Maurice Bishop]] visiting East Germany, 1982]]

Independence was granted on 7 February 1974 under the leadership of Eric Gairy, who became the first [[prime minister of Grenada]].{{sfn|Steele|2003|pp=35–36}} This is annually commemorated as [[Independence Day (Grenada)|Independence Day]]. Grenada opted to remain within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], retaining Queen Elizabeth as [[Monarchy of Grenada|Monarch]], represented locally by a [[Governor-General of Grenada|governor-general]]. Civil conflict gradually broke out between Eric Gairy's government and some opposition parties, including the Marxist [[New JEWEL Movement]] (NJM). Gairy and the GULP won the [[1976 Grenadian general election]], albeit with a reduced majority; however, the opposition deemed the results invalid due to fraud and the violent intimidation performed by the so-called '[[Mongoose Gang]]', a private militia loyal to Gairy.

On 13 March 1979, whilst Gairy was out of the country, the NJM launched a [[bloodless coup]] which removed Gairy, suspended the constitution, and established a [[People's Revolutionary Government]] (PRG), headed by [[Maurice Bishop]], who declared himself prime minister. His [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] government established close ties with [[Cuba]], [[Nicaragua]], and other [[communist bloc]] countries. All political parties except for the New Jewel Movement were banned and no elections were held during the four years of PRG rule.

=== Invasion by the United States (1983) ===

==== Coup and execution of Maurice Bishop ====
Some years later,{{when|date=August 2021}} a dispute developed between Bishop and certain high-ranking members of the NJM. Though Bishop cooperated with Cuba and the [[USSR]] on various trade and foreign policy issues, he sought to maintain a [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned status]]. Hardline [[Marxist]] party members, including [[communist]] Deputy Prime Minister [[Bernard Coard]], deemed Bishop insufficiently revolutionary and demanded that he either step down or enter into a power-sharing arrangement.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

On 16 October 1983, Bernard Coard and his wife, Phyllis, backed by the Grenadian Army, led a coup against the government of Maurice Bishop and placed Bishop under [[house arrest]]. These actions led to street demonstrations in various parts of the island because Bishop had widespread support from the population. Because Bishop was a widely popular leader, he was freed by impassioned supporters who marched en masse to his guarded residence from a rally in the capital's central square. Bishop then led the crowd to the island's military headquarters to reassert his power. Grenadian soldiers were dispatched in armoured vehicles by the Coard faction to retake the fort. A confrontation between soldiers and civilians at the fort ended in gunfire and panic. Three soldiers and at least eight civilians died in the tumult that also injured 100 others, a school-sponsored study later found in 2000. When the initial shooting ended with Bishop's surrender, he and a group of seven of his closest supporters were taken prisoner and executed by firing squad. Besides Bishop, the group included three of his cabinet ministers, a trade union leader, and three service-industry workers.

After the execution of Bishop, the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (PRA) formed a military Marxist government with General [[Hudson Austin]] as chairman. The army declared a four-day total curfew, during which anyone leaving their home without approval would be shot on sight.

==== United States and allied response and reaction ====

US President [[Ronald Reagan]] stated that particularly worrying was the presence of Cuban construction workers and military personnel building a {{convert|10000|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Point Salines International Airport|airstrip]] on Grenada. Bishop had stated the purpose of the airstrip was to allow commercial jets to land, but some US military analysts argued that the only reason for constructing such a long and reinforced runway was so that it could be used by heavy military transport planes. The contractors, American and European companies, and the [[European Economic Community|EEC]], which provided partial funding, all claimed the airstrip did not have military capabilities. Reagan asserted that Cuba, under the direction of the Soviet Union, would use Grenada as a refuelling stop for Cuban and Soviet airplanes loaded with weapons destined for Central American communist insurgents.

The Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), [[Barbados]], and Jamaica all appealed to the United States for assistance. On 25 October 1983, combined forces from the United States and the [[Regional Security System]] (RSS) based in Barbados invaded Grenada in an operation codenamed ''[[Invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]]''. The US stated this was done at the behest of Barbados, [[Dominica]]{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} and Governor-General [[Paul Scoon]]. Scoon had requested the invasion through secret diplomatic channels, but it was not made public for his safety. Progress was rapid, and within four days the Americans had removed the military government of Hudson Austin.{{fact|date=July 2025}}

The invasion was criticised by the governments of Britain, [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and Canada. The [[United Nations General Assembly]] condemned it as "a flagrant violation of international law" by a vote of 108 to 9, with 27 abstentions. The [[United Nations Security Council]] considered a similar resolution, which was supported by 11 countries. However, the United States vetoed the motion.

==== Post-invasion arrests ====
After the invasion, the pre-revolutionary Grenadian constitution came into operation once again. Eighteen members of the PRG/PRA were arrested on charges related to the murder of Maurice Bishop and seven others. The 18 included the top political leadership of Grenada at the time of the execution, along with the entire military chain of command directly responsible for the operation that led to the executions. Fourteen were [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]], one was found not guilty, and three were sentenced to 45 years in prison. The death sentences were eventually commuted to terms of imprisonment. Those in prison have become known as the "[[Grenada 17]]".

=== Since 1983 ===
When US troops withdrew from Grenada in December 1983, Governor-General Scoon appointed an interim advisory council chaired by [[Nicholas Brathwaite]] to organise new elections. The first democratic elections since 1976 were [[1984 Grenadian general election|held in December 1984]], and were won by the [[New National Party (Grenada)|New National Party]] under Herbert Blaize, who served as prime minister until his death in December 1989.

[[Ben Jones (Grenada)|Ben Jones]] briefly succeeded Blaize as prime minister and served until the [[1990 Grenadian general election|March 1990 election]]. This election was won by the [[National Democratic Congress (Grenada)|National Democratic Congress]] under Nicholas Brathwaite, who served as prime minister until he resigned in February 1995. He was succeeded by [[George Brizan]] for a brief period until the [[1995 Grenadian general election|June 1995 election]] which was won by the [[New National Party (Grenada)|New National Party]] under [[Keith Mitchell]], who went on to win the [[1999 Grenadian general election|1999]] and [[2003 Grenadian general election|2003 elections]], serving for a record 13 years until 2008. Mitchell re-established relations with Cuba and also reformed the country's banking system, which had come under criticism over potential money laundering concerns.{{sfn|Steele|2003|pp=35–36}}

In 2000–02, much of the controversy of the late 1970s and early 1980s was once again brought into the public consciousness with the opening of the [[truth and reconciliation commission]]. The commission was chaired by a [[Holy Orders|Roman Catholic priest]], Father Mark Haynes, and was tasked with uncovering injustices arising from the PRA, Bishop's regime, and before. It held a number of hearings around the country. Brother Robert Fanovich, head of Presentation Brothers' College (PBC) in St. George's, tasked some of his senior students with conducting a research project into the era and specifically into the fact that Maurice Bishop's body was never discovered.
[[File:Grenada ivan.jpg|thumb|right|Aftermath of Hurricane Ivan in Grenada]]

On 7 September 2004, after being hurricane-free for 49 years, the island was directly hit by [[Hurricane Ivan]]. Ivan struck as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3 hurricane]], resulting in 39 deaths and damage or destruction to 90% of the island's homes.{{sfn|Steele|2003|pp=35–36}} On 14 July 2005, [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Hurricane Emily]], a Category 1 hurricane at the time, struck the northern part of the island with {{convert|80|kn|km/h mph|adj=on}} winds, killing one person and causing an estimated US$110&nbsp;million (EC$297&nbsp;million) worth of damage.{{sfn|Steele|2003|pp=35–36}} Agriculture, and in particular the nutmeg industry, suffered serious losses, but that event caused changes in crop management and it is hoped that as new nutmeg trees mature, the industry will gradually rebuild.

Mitchell was defeated in the [[2008 Grenadian general election|2008 election]] by the NDC under [[Tillman Thomas]]; however, he won the [[2013 Grenadian general election]] by a landslide and the NNP returned to power, winning again by another landslide [[2018 Grenadian general election|in 2018]]. In March 2020, [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Grenada|Grenada confirmed its first case of COVID-19]] and, {{as of|2022|3|17|lc=on}}, 13,921 cases and 217 deaths had been recorded.

On 23 June 2022, the NDC won the [[2022 Grenadian general election|general election]] under [[Dickon Mitchell]], who became prime minister the following day.

On 1 July 2024, [[Hurricane Beryl (2024)|Hurricane Beryl]] struck the island of Carriacou as a Category 4 hurricane, causing widespread damage across all of Grenada and Carriacou. On Carriacou, there was no electricity and limited communication. Throughout the rest of the country, 95% of customers had no power and telecommunications were also damaged.
