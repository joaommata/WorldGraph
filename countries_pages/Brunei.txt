=== Early history ===
{{stack |float=left |[[File:The Tomb of the King of Boni (Brunei) Nanjing.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Tomb of the King of Boni]] in [[Nanjing]], Jiangsu, China.]]}}

Areas comprising what is now Brunei participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archaeological research. The trading network existed for 3,000 years, between 2000 BC to 1000 AD. The settlement known as Vijayapura was a vassal-state to the Buddhist [[Srivijaya]] empire and was thought to be located in Borneo's Northwest which flourished in the 7th Century. Vijayapura itself upon earlier in its history, was a rump state of the fallen multi-ethnic: Austronesian, Austroasiatic and Indian, [[kingdom of Funan|Funan Civilization]]; previously located in what is now Cambodia.{{rp|36}} This alternative Srivijaya known as Vijayapura referring to Brunei, was known to Arabic sources as "Sribuza".

One of the earliest Chinese records of an independent kingdom in Borneo is the 977 AD letter to the Chinese emperor from the ruler of Boni, which some scholars believe to refer to Borneo. The Bruneians regained their independence from Srivijaya due to the onset of a Javanese-Sumatran war. In 1225, the Chinese official [[Zhao Rukuo]] reported that Boni had 100 warships to protect its trade, and that there was great wealth in the kingdom.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=43}} Marco Polo suggested in his memoirs that the Great Khan or the ruler of the Mongol Empire, attempted and failed many times in invading "Great Java" which was the European name for Bruneian controlled Borneo.{{Additional citation needed|date=December 2021}}

According to Wang Zhenping, in the 1300s, the ''Yuan Dade nanhai zhi'' or "Yuan dynasty Dade period southern sea records" reported that Brunei conquered or administered [[Sarawak]] and [[Sabah]] as well as the Philippine kingdoms of [[Rajahnate of Butuan|Butuan]], [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sulu]], [[Ma-i]] (Mindoro), Malilu 麻裏蘆 ([[Maynila (historical polity)|Manila]]), [[Sanmalan|Shahuchong]] 沙胡重 (Siocon or [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]]), Yachen 啞陳 [[Oton]], and 文杜陵 Wenduling ([[Sultanate of Maguindanao|Mindanao]]), which would regain their independence at a later date.

In the 14th century, the [[Java]]nese manuscript ''[[Nagarakretagama]]'', written by [[Mpu Prapanca|Prapanca]] in 1365, mentioned ''Barune'' as the constituent state of Hindu [[Majapahit]], which had to make an annual [[tribute]] of 40 [[catty|katis]] of [[camphor]]. In 1369, Sulu which was also formerly part of Majapahit, had successfully rebelled and then attacked Boni, and had invaded the Northeast Coast of Borneo and afterwards had looted the capital of its treasure and gold including sacking two sacred pearls. A fleet from Majapahit succeeded in driving away the Sulus, but Boni was left weaker after the attack.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=44}} A Chinese report from 1371 described Boni as poor and totally controlled by Majapahit.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=45}} When the Chinese admiral [[Zheng He]] visited the Brunei in the early 15th century, he founded a major trading port which included Chinese people who were actively trading with China.

During the 15th century, Boni had seceded from Majapahit and then converted to Islam. Thus transforming into the independent Sultanate of Brunei. Brunei became a [[Hashemite]] state when she allowed the Arab Emir of Mecca, [[Sharif Ali]], to become her third sultan.

As customary for close affiliation and alliances in Southeast Asia, the royal family of Luzon intermarried with the ruling houses of the [[Bruneian Empire|Sultanate of Brunei]]. Intermarriage was a common strategy for Southeast Asian states to extend their influence.  However, Islamic Brunei's power was not uncontested in Borneo since it had a Hindu rival in a state founded by Indians called [[Kutai]] in the south which they overpowered but didn't destroy.

Nevertheless, by the 16th century, Islam was firmly rooted in Brunei, and the country had built one of its biggest mosques. In 1578, Alonso Beltrán, a Spanish traveller, described it as being five stories tall and built on the water.

=== War with Spain and decline ===
[[File:Brunei territorial lose (1400–1890).gif|thumb|left|Brunei territorial losses from 1400 to 1890]] Brunei briefly rose to prominence in Southeast Asia when the Portuguese occupied [[Malacca]] and thereby forced the wealthy and powerful but displaced Muslim refugees there to relocate to nearby Sultanates such as Brunei. The Bruneian Sultan then intervened in a territorial conflict between [[Kingdom of Tondo|Hindu Tondo]] and [[Kingdom of Maynila|Muslim Manila]] in the Philippines by appointing the Bruneian descended [[Rajah Matanda|Rajah Ache]] of Manila as admiral of the Bruneian navy in a rivalry against Tondo and as the enforcer of Bruneian interests in the Philippines. He subsequently encountered the Magellan expedition wherein [[Antonio Pigafetta]] noted that under orders from his grandfather the Sultan of Brunei, Ache had previously sacked the Buddhist city of Loue in Southwest Borneo for being faithful to the old religion and rebelling against the authority of Sultanate. However, [[Colonialism|European influence]] gradually brought an end to Brunei's [[regional power]], as Brunei entered a period of decline compounded by internal strife over royal succession. In the face of these invasions by European Christian powers, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Caliphate]] aided the beleaguered Southeast Asian Sultanates by making [[Ottoman expedition to Aceh|Aceh]] a [[protectorate]] and sending expeditions to reinforce, train and equip the local [[mujahideen]]. Turks were routinely migrating to Brunei as evidenced by the complaints of Manila Oidor Melchor Davalos who in his 1585 report, say that Turks were coming to Sumatra, Borneo and Ternate every year, including defeated veterans from the [[Battle of Lepanto]].

Spain [[Castille War|declared war]] in 1578, planning to attack and capture [[Kota Batu, Brunei-Muara|Kota Batu]], Brunei's capital at the time. This was based in part on the assistance of two Bruneian [[Pengiran#Brunei|noblemen]], Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The former had travelled to [[Manila]], then the centre of the Spanish colony. Manila itself was captured from Brunei, Christianised and made a territory of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] which was centered in Mexico City. Pengiran Seri Lela came to offer Brunei as a [[tributary state|tributary]] to Spain for help to recover the throne usurped by his brother, Saiful Rijal. The Spanish agreed that if they succeeded in conquering Brunei, Pengiran Seri Lela would be appointed as the sultan, while Pengiran Seri Ratna would be the new [[Bendahara]].
[[File:万国来朝图 Brunei (汶莱國) delegates in Peking in 1761.jpg|thumb|Chinese depiction of delegates from Brunei arriving in Beijing. From the ''[[Ten Thousand Nations Coming to Pay Tribute]]'', 1761]]

In March 1578, a fresh Spanish fleet had arrived from Mexico and settled at the Philippines. They were led by [[Francisco de Sande|De Sande]], acting as [[Capitán-General]]. He organised an expedition from Manila for Brunei, consisting of 400 Spaniards and Mexicans, 1,500 [[Filipino people|Filipino]] natives, and 300 Borneans. The campaign was one of many, which also included action in [[Mindanao]] and [[Sulu Archipelago|Sulu]]. The racial make-up of the Christian side was diverse since it were usually made up of [[Mestizos]], [[Mulattoes]] and Amerindians ([[Aztecs]], [[Maya peoples|Mayans]] and [[Incans]]) who were gathered and sent from Mexico and were led by Spanish officers who had worked together with native Filipinos in military campaigns across the Southeast Asia. The Muslim side was also equally racially diverse. In addition to the native Malay warriors, the Ottomans had repeatedly sent military expeditions to nearby [[Ottoman expedition to Aceh|Aceh]]. The expeditions were composed mainly of [[Turkic people|Turks]], [[Egyptians]], [[Swahili people|Swahilis]], [[Somalis]], [[Sindhis]], [[Gujaratis]] and [[Malabars]]. These expeditionary forces had also spread to other nearby Sultanates such as Brunei and had taught new fighting tactics and techniques on how to forge cannons.

Eventually, the Spanish captured the capital on 16 April 1578, with the help of Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The Sultan Saiful Rijal and Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Abdul Kahar were forced to flee to Meragang then to [[Jerudong]]. In Jerudong, they made plans to chase the conquering army away from Brunei. Suffering high fatalities due to a [[cholera]] or [[dysentery]] outbreak, the Spanish decided to abandon Brunei and returned to Manila on 26 June 1578, after 72 days.

Pengiran Seri Lela died in August or September 1578, probably from the same illness suffered by his Spanish allies.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} There was suspicion that the legitimist sultan could have been poisoned by the ruling sultan.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} Seri Lela's daughter, a Bruneian princess, "Putri", had left with the Spanish, she abandoned her claim to the crown and then she married a Christian [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], named Agustín de Legazpi de Tondo. [[Agustin de Legaspi]] along with his family and associates were soon implicated in the [[Conspiracy of the Maharlikas]], an attempt by Filipinos to link up with the Brunei Sultanate and Japanese Shogunate to expel the Spaniards from the Philippines. However, upon the Spanish suppression of the conspiracy, the Bruneian descended aristocracy of precolonial Manila were exiled to [[Guerrero, Mexico]] which consequently later became a center of the [[Isidoro Montes de Oca|Mexican war of independence against Spain]].

The local Brunei accounts{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=41}} of the Castilian War differ greatly from the generally accepted view of events. What was called the Castilian War was seen as a heroic episode, with the Spaniards being driven out by [[Bendahara Sakam]], purportedly a brother of the ruling sultan, and a thousand native warriors. Most historians consider this to be a [[folk-hero]] account, which probably developed decades or centuries after.

Brunei eventually descended into anarchy. The country suffered a [[Bruneian Civil War of 1660|civil war]] from 1660 to 1673.

=== British intervention ===

[[File:Control of the island of Borneo.png|thumb|right|Boundaries of Brunei (green) since 1890]]
The British have intervened in the affairs of Brunei on several occasions. Britain attacked Brunei in July 1846 due to internal conflicts over who was the rightful Sultan.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=52}}

In the 1880s, the decline of the [[Bruneian Empire]] continued. The sultan granted land (now Sarawak) to [[James Brooke]], who had helped him quell a rebellion, and allowed him to establish the [[Raj of Sarawak]]. Over time, Brooke and his nephews (who succeeded him) leased or annexed more land. Brunei lost much of its territory to him and his dynasty, known as the [[White Rajahs]].

Sultan [[Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin]] appealed to the British to stop further encroachment by the Brookes.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=3}} The [[Protectorate Agreement of Brunei (1888)|Protectorate Agreement]] was negotiated by [[Sir Hugh Low]] and signed into effect on 17 September 1888. The treaty said that the sultan "could not cede or lease any territory to foreign powers without British consent"; it provided Britain effective control over Brunei's external affairs, making it a [[British protected state]] (which continued until 1984). But, when the Raj of Sarawak annexed Brunei's [[Limbang Division|Pandaruan District]] in 1890, the British did not take any action to stop it. They did not regard either Brunei or the Raj of Sarawak as 'foreign' (per the Treaty of Protection). This final annexation by Sarawak left Brunei with its current small land mass and separation into two parts.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=58}}

The British Foreign Office sent Consul [[Malcolm Stewart Hannibal McArthur]] to assess Brunei and make recommendations on future British foreign policy in the region. McArthur produced his [[Report On Brunei|Report On Brunei in 1904]] where he recommended the implementation of the [[Federated Malay States|Malayan British Residency system]] and the continued protection of Brunei. [[British resident]]s were introduced in Brunei under the Supplementary Protectorate Agreement in 1906.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=59}} The residents were to advise the sultan on all matters of administration. Over time, the resident assumed more executive control than the sultan. The residential system ended in 1959.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=67}}

=== Discovery of oil ===
Petroleum was discovered in 1929 after several fruitless attempts.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=12}} Two men, F. F. Marriot and T. G. Cochrane, smelled oil near the [[Seria]] river in late 1926.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=13}} They informed a [[geophysicist]], who conducted a survey there. In 1927, gas seepages were reported in the area. Seria Well Number One (S-1) was drilled on 12 July 1928. Oil was struck at {{convert|297|m}} on 5 April 1929. Seria Well Number 2 was drilled on 19 August 1929, and, {{As of|2009|lc=y}}, continues to produce oil.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=14}} Oil production was increased considerably in the 1930s with the development of more oil fields. In 1940, oil production was at more than six million barrels.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=14}} The British Malayan Petroleum Company (now [[Brunei Shell Petroleum]] Company) was formed on 22 July 1922.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=15}} The first offshore well was drilled in 1957. Oil and natural gas have been the basis of Brunei's development and wealth since the late 20th century.

=== Japanese occupation ===
{{Main|Japanese occupation of British Borneo}}
[[File:Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin (AWM P10841.001).JPG|thumb|[[Ahmad Tajuddin]], the [[List of Sultans of Brunei|27th Sultan of Brunei]], with members of his court in April 1941, eight months before the Japanese invaded Brunei]]
The Japanese invaded Brunei on 16 December 1941, eight days after their [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on the United States Navy. They landed 10,000 troops of the [[Kawaguchi Detachment]] from [[Cam Ranh Bay]] at [[Kuala Belait]]. After six days' fighting, they occupied the entire country. The only Allied troops in the area were the 2nd Battalion of the [[15th Punjab Regiment]] based at [[Kuching]], Sarawak.

Once the Japanese occupied Brunei, they made an agreement with [[Ahmad Tajuddin|Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin]] over governing the country. Inche Ibrahim (known later as Pehin Datu Perdana Menteri Dato Laila Utama Awang Haji Ibrahim), a former Secretary to the British Resident, Ernest Edgar Pengilly, was appointed [[chief administrative officer]] under the Japanese Governor. The Japanese had proposed that Pengilly retain his position under their administration, but he declined. Both he and other British nationals still in Brunei were interned by the Japanese at [[Batu Lintang camp]] in Sarawak. While the British officials were under Japanese guard, Ibrahim made a point of personally shaking each one by the hand and wishing him well.

The Sultan retained his throne and was given a pension and honours by the Japanese. During the later part of the occupation, he resided at Tantuya, [[Limbang]] and had little to do with the Japanese. Most of the Malay government officers were retained by the Japanese. Brunei's administration was reorganised into five prefectures, which included British [[North Borneo]]. The Prefectures included [[Miri Division|Baram]], Labuan, [[Lawas]], and [[Limbang]]. Ibrahim hid numerous significant government documents from the Japanese during the occupation. Pengiran Yusuf (later YAM Pengiran Setia Negara Pengiran [[Haji Mohd Yusuf]]), along with other Bruneians, was sent to Japan for training. Although in the area the day of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], Yusuf survived.

The British had anticipated a Japanese attack, but lacked the resources to defend the area because of their engagement in the war in Europe. The troops from the Punjab Regiment filled in the [[Seria]] oilfield oilwells with concrete in September 1941 to deny the Japanese their use. The remaining equipment and installations were destroyed when the [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|Japanese invaded Malaya]]. By the end of the war, 16 wells at [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]] and Seria had been restarted, with production reaching about half the pre-war level. Coal production at [[Muara, Brunei|Muara]] was also recommenced, but with little success.

[[File:Japanese Battleship Nagato 1944.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Japanese battleship Nagato|Nagato]]'', ''[[Japanese cruiser Tone (1937)|Tone]]'', ''[[Japanese battleship Yamato|Yamato]]'' and ''[[Japanese battleship Musashi|Musashi]]'' in Brunei Bay in October 1944|alt=]]
During the occupation, the Japanese had their language taught in schools, and Government officers were required to learn Japanese. The local currency was replaced by what was to become known as [[Banana money|''duit pisang'' (banana money)]]. From 1943 hyper-inflation destroyed the currency's value and, at the end of the war, this currency was worthless. Allied attacks on shipping eventually caused trade to cease. Food and medicine fell into short supply, and the population suffered from famine and disease.

The [[Brunei International Airport|airport]] runway was constructed by the Japanese during the occupation, and in 1943 Japanese naval units were based in [[Brunei Bay]] and Labuan. The naval base was destroyed by Allied bombing, but the airport runway survived. The facility was developed as a public airport. In 1944 the Allies began a bombing campaign against the occupying Japanese, which destroyed much of the town and Kuala Belait, but missed [[Kampong Ayer]].

[[File:Japanese Surrender, Labuan (AWM 115989).JPG|right|thumb|[[George Wootten|Major-General Wootten]] of the Australian 9th Division with [[Masao Baba|Lieutenant-General Masao Baba]] (signing) of the Japanese 37th Division at the surrender ceremony at Labuan on 10 September 1945]]
On 10 June 1945, the [[Australian 9th Division]] landed at Muara under [[Battle of North Borneo|Operation Oboe Six]] to recapture Borneo from the Japanese. They were supported by American air and naval units. Brunei town was bombed extensively and recaptured after three days of heavy fighting. Many buildings were destroyed, including the Mosque. The Japanese forces in Brunei, Borneo, and Sarawak, under Lieutenant-General Masao Baba, formally surrendered at Labuan on 10 September 1945. The British Military Administration took over from the Japanese and remained until July 1946.

=== Post-World War II ===
After [[World War II]], a new government was formed in Brunei under the [[British Military Administration (Borneo)|British Military Administration]] (BMA). It consisted mainly of Australian officers and servicemen.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=79}} The administration of Brunei was passed to the Civil Administration on 6 July 1945. The Brunei State Council was also revived that year.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=80}} The BMA was tasked to revive the Bruneian economy, which was extensively damaged by the Japanese during their occupation. They also had to put out the fires on the wells of Seria, which had been set by the Japanese prior to their defeat.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=80}}

Before 1941, the Governor of the Straits Settlements, based in Singapore, was responsible for the duties of British High Commissioner for Brunei, [[Kingdom of Sarawak|Sarawak]], and [[North Borneo]] (now [[Sabah]]).{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=81}} The first [[British High Commissioner]] for Brunei was the Governor of Sarawak, Sir Charles Ardon Clarke. The [[Barisan Pemuda]] ("Youth Front"; abbreviated as BARIP) was the first political party to be formed in Brunei, on 12 April 1946. The party intended to "preserve the sovereignty of the Sultan and the country, and to defend the rights of the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]]". BARIP also contributed to the composition of the country's national anthem. The party was dissolved in 1948 due to inactivity.

In 1959, a new constitution was written declaring Brunei a self-governing state, while its foreign affairs, security, and defence remained the responsibility of the United Kingdom. A small [[rebellion]] erupted against the monarchy in 1962, which was suppressed with help of the UK. Known as the [[Brunei Revolt]], the rebellion contributed to the Sultan's decision to opt out of joining the emerging state now called Malaysia under the umbrella of [[North Borneo Federation]].

Brunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984. The official National Day, which celebrates the country's independence, is held by tradition on 23 February.

=== Writing of the Constitution ===
[[File:Omar Ali Saifuddien III.jpg|thumb|Sultan [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]]]]
In July 1953, Sultan [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]] formed a seven-member committee named ''Tujuh Serangkai'', to determine the citizens' views regarding a written constitution for Brunei. In May 1954, the Sultan, Resident and High Commissioner met to discuss the findings of the committee. They agreed to authorise the drafting of a constitution. In March 1959, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III led a delegation to London to discuss the proposed Constitution.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=98}} The British delegation was led by Sir [[Alan Lennox-Boyd]], Secretary of State for the Colonies. The British Government later accepted the draft constitution.

On 29 September 1959, the Constitution Agreement was signed in [[Bandar Seri Begawan|Brunei Town]]. The agreement was signed by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III and Sir Robert Scott, the Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia.
It included the following provisions:{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=59}}
* The Sultan was made the Supreme Head of State.
* Brunei was responsible for its internal administration.
* The British Government was responsible for foreign and defence affairs only.
* The post of Resident was abolished and replaced by a British High Commissioner.

Five councils were established:{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=100}}
* The Executive Council
* [[Legislative Council of Brunei|The Legislative Council of Brunei]]
* The Privy Council
* The Council of Succession
* The State Religious Council

=== National development plans ===
A series of National Development Plans was initiated by the 28th Sultan of Brunei, [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]].

The first was introduced in 1953.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=92}} A total sum of B$100&nbsp;million was approved by the Brunei State Council for the plan. E.R. Bevington, from the Colonial Office in [[Fiji]], was appointed to implement it.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=129}} A US$14&nbsp;million Gas Plant was built under the plan. In 1954, survey and exploration work were undertaken by the Brunei Shell Petroleum on both offshore and onshore fields. By 1956, production reached 114,700 [[barrels per day|bpd]].

[[File:THE BRITISH ARMY IN BRUNEI, JANUARY 1963.jpg|thumb|British soldiers in the [[British protectorate]] of Brunei on guard in the [[Seria Field|Seria oilfield]], January 1963]]
The plan also aided the development of public education. By 1958, expenditure on education totalled at $4&nbsp;million.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=129}} Communications were improved, as new roads were built and reconstruction at [[Old Airport, Brunei|Berakas Airport]] was completed in 1954.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=21}}

The second National Development Plan was launched in 1962.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=21}} A major oil and gas field was discovered in 1963. Developments in the oil and gas sector have continued, and oil production has steadily increased since then.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=96}} The plan also promoted the production of meat and eggs for consumption by citizens. The fishing industry increased its output by 25% throughout the course of the plan. The [[List of Panamax ports|deepwater port]] at [[Muara, Brunei|Muara]] was also constructed during this period. Power requirements were met, and studies were made to provide electricity to rural areas.{{sfn|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009|p=96}} Efforts were made to eradicate [[malaria]], an endemic disease in the region, with the help of the [[World Health Organization]]. Malaria cases were reduced from 300 cases in 1953 to only 66 cases in 1959. The death rate was reduced from 20 per thousand in 1947 to 11.3 per thousand in 1953. Infectious disease has been prevented by public sanitation and improvement of drainage, and the provision of piped pure water to the population.

=== Independence ===
On 14 November 1971, Sultan [[Hassanal Bolkiah]] left for London to discuss matters regarding the amendments to the 1959 constitution. A new agreement was signed on 23 November 1971 with the British representative being [[Anthony Royle, Baron Fanshawe of Richmond|Anthony Royle]].

Under this agreement, the following terms were agreed upon:
* Brunei was granted full internal self-government
* The UK would still be responsible for external affairs and defence.
* Brunei and the UK agreed to share the responsibility for security and defence.

This agreement also caused [[British Military Garrison Brunei|Gurkha units]] to be deployed in Brunei, where they remain up to this day.

[[File:Sultan of Brunei with Janin Erih.jpg|thumb|Sultan [[Hassanal Bolkiah]] (right), handing his credentials to ambassador [[Janin Erih]] in 2004]]
On 7 January 1979, another treaty was signed between Brunei and the United Kingdom. It was signed with Lord Goronwy-Roberts being the representative of the UK. This agreement granted Brunei to take over international responsibilities as an independent nation. Britain agreed to assist Brunei in diplomatic matters. In May 1983, it was announced by the UK that the date of independence of Brunei would be 1 January 1984.

On 31 December 1983, a mass gathering was held on main mosques on all four of the districts of the country and at midnight, on 1 January 1984, the Proclamation of Independence was read by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. The sultan subsequently assumed the title "[[Majesty|His Majesty]]", rather than the previous "[[His Royal Highness]]". Brunei was [[Member states of the United Nations|admitted to the United Nations]] on 22 September 1984, becoming the organisation's 159th member.

=== 21st century ===
In October 2013, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah announced his intention to impose [[Penal Code]] from [[Sharia]] on the country's Muslims, which make up roughly two-thirds of the country's population. This would be implemented in three phases, culminating in 2016, and making Brunei the first and only country in East Asia to introduce Sharia into its penal code, excluding the subnational Indonesian special territory of [[Aceh]]. The move attracted international criticism, the United Nations expressing "deep concern".
