The area known as Croatia today was inhabited throughout the [[prehistoric period]]. [[Neanderthal]] fossils dating to the middle [[Palaeolithic]] period were unearthed in northern Croatia, best presented at the [[Krapina Neanderthal site|Krapina site]]. Remnants of [[Neolithic]] and [[Chalcolithic]] cultures were found in all regions. The largest proportion of sites is in the valleys of northern Croatia. The most significant are [[Baden culture|Baden]], [[Starčevo culture|Starčevo]], and [[Vučedol culture]]s. [[Iron Age]] hosted the early Illyrian [[Hallstatt culture]] and the Celtic [[La Tène culture]].

The region of modern-day Croatia was settled by [[Illyrians]] and [[Liburnians]], while the first Greek colonies were established on the islands of [[Hvar]], [[Korčula]], and [[Vis (island)|Vis]]. In 9&nbsp;AD, the territory of today's Croatia became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. Emperor [[Diocletian]] was native to the region. He [[Diocletian's Palace|had a large palace built]] in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], to which he retired after abdicating in AD 305.

During the 5th century, the [[last de jure Western Roman Emperor]] [[Julius Nepos]] ruled a small realm from the palace after fleeing Italy in 475.

[[File:Balkans925.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]] c.&nbsp;925, during the reign of [[King Tomislav]]]]
The Roman period ends with [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] and [[Croat]] invasions in the late 6th and first half of the 7th century and the destruction of almost all Roman towns. Roman survivors retreated to more favourable sites on the coast, islands, and mountains. The city of [[Dubrovnik]] was founded by such survivors from [[Epidaurum]].

There's some uncertainty about the [[Origin hypotheses of the Croats|ethnogenesis of Croats]]. The most accepted theory, the Slavic theory, proposes migration of [[White Croats]] from [[White Croatia]] during the [[Migration Period]]. Conversely, the Iranian theory proposes [[Sarmatian]]-[[Alans|Alanic]] origin of Proto-Croats, based on [[Tanais Tablets]] containing [[Ancient Greek]] inscriptions of given names ''Χορούαθος'', ''Χοροάθος'', and ''Χορόαθος'' (Khoroúathos, Khoroáthos, and Khoróathos) and their interpretation as [[anthroponym]]s related to the [[Names of the Croats and Croatia|Croatian ethnonym]].

According to the work ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' written by 10th-century Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine VII]], [[Croats]] settled in the [[Roman province of Dalmatia]] in the first half of the 7th century after they defeated the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]].{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=13}} Although there exist some scholarly disputes about the account's reliability and interpretation, recent archaeological data has established that the migration and settlement of the Slavs/Croats was in the late 6th and early 7th century. Eventually, a [[dukedom (administrative division)|dukedom]] was formed, [[Duchy of Croatia]], ruled by [[Borna (duke)|Borna]], as attested by chronicles of [[Einhard]] starting in 818. The record represents the first document of Croatian realms, [[vassal states]] of [[Francia]] at the time.{{sfn|Mužić|2007|pp=157–160}} Its neighbor to the North was [[Principality of Lower Pannonia]], at the time ruled by duke [[Ljudevit (Lower Pannonia)|Ljudevit]] who ruled the territories between the [[Drava]] and [[Sava]] rivers, centred from his fort at [[Sisak]]. This population and territory throughout history was tightly related and connected to Croats and Croatia.{{sfn|Budak|2018|pp=178–185}}

[[Christianisation]] of Croats began in the 7th century at the time of archon [[Porga of Croatia]], initially probably encompassed only the elite and related people,{{sfn|Budak|2018|pp=144–145}} but mostly finished by the 9th century. The Frankish overlordship ended during the reign of [[Mislav of Croatia|Mislav]],{{sfn|Mužić|2007|pp=169–170}} or his successor [[Trpimir I of Croatia|Trpimir I]].{{sfn|Budak|2018|pp=106}} The native Croatian royal dynasty was founded by duke Trpimir I in the mid 9th century, who defeated the Byzantine and Bulgarian forces.

The first native Croatian ruler recognised by the Pope was duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]], who received papal recognition from [[Pope John VIII]] on 7 June 879.{{sfn|Mužić|2007|p=|pp=195–198}} [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] was the first [[king of Croatia]], noted as such in a letter of [[Pope John X]] in 925. Tomislav defeated Hungarian and Bulgarian invasions. The medieval Croatian kingdom reached its peak in the 11th century during the reigns of [[Petar Krešimir IV]] (1058–1074) and [[Dmitar Zvonimir]] (1075–1089). When [[Stephen II of Croatia|Stjepan II]] died in 1091, ending the Trpimirović dynasty, Dmitar Zvonimir's brother-in-law [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]] claimed the Croatian crown. This led to a [[Battle of Gvozd Mountain|war]] and [[personal union of Croatia and Hungary|personal union with Hungary]] in 1102 under [[Coloman, King of Hungary|Coloman]].

For the next four centuries, the Kingdom of Croatia was ruled by the [[Sabor]] (parliament) and a [[Ban of Croatia|Ban]] (viceroy) appointed by the king. This period saw the rise of influential nobility such as the [[Frankopan]] and [[Šubić]] families to prominence, and ultimately numerous Bans from the two families.{{sfn|Font|2005|p=17}} An increasing threat of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest and a struggle against the [[Republic of Venice]] for control of coastal areas ensued. The Venetians controlled most of Dalmatia by 1428, except the [[city-state of Dubrovnik]], which became independent. [[Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War|Ottoman conquests]] led to the 1493 [[Battle of Krbava field]] and the 1526 [[Battle of Mohács]], both ending in decisive Ottoman victories. King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] died at Mohács, and in 1527, the [[Croatian Parliament met in Cetin]] and chose Ferdinand I of the [[House of Habsburg]] as the new ruler of Croatia, under the condition that he protects Croatia against the Ottoman Empire while respecting its political rights.{{sfn|Frucht|2005|p=|pp=422–423}}

Following the decisive Ottoman victories, Croatia was split into civilian and military territories in 1538. The military territories became known as the [[Croatian Military Frontier]] and were under direct Habsburg control. Ottoman advances in Croatia continued until the 1593 [[Battle of Sisak]], the first decisive Ottoman defeat, when borders stabilised.{{sfn|Frucht|2005|p=|pp=422–423}} During the [[Great Turkish War]] (1683–1698), [[Slavonia]] was regained, but western [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], which had been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest, remained outside Croatian control.{{sfn|Frucht|2005|p=|pp=422–423}} The present-day border between the two countries is a remnant of this outcome. [[Dalmatia]], the southern part of the border, was similarly defined by the [[Cretan War (1645–1669)|Fifth]] and the [[Seventh Ottoman–Venetian Wars]].{{sfn|Lane|1973|p=409}}

The [[Croatian–Ottoman wars|Ottoman wars]] drove demographic changes. During the 16th century, Croats from western and northern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], [[Lika]], [[Krbava]], the area between the rivers [[Una (Sava)|Una]] and [[Kupa]], and especially from western [[Slavonia]], migrated towards [[Austria]]. Present-day [[Burgenland Croats]] are direct descendants of these settlers. To replace the fleeing population, the Habsburgs encouraged Bosnians to provide military service in the [[Military Frontier]].

The [[Croatian Parliament]] supported [[Emperor Charles VI|King Charles III]]'s [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]] and signed their own [[Pragmatic Sanction in 1712]]. Subsequently, the emperor pledged to respect all privileges and political rights of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], and [[Queen Maria Theresa]] made significant contributions to Croatian affairs, such as introducing compulsory education.

[[File:Map of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia (1885).png|thumb|upright=1.3|right|The [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] was an autonomous kingdom within [[Austria-Hungary]] created in 1868 following the [[Croatian–Hungarian Settlement]].]]

Between 1797 and 1809, the [[First French Empire]] increasingly occupied the eastern [[Adriatic]] coastline and its hinterland, ending the Venetian and the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan republics]], establishing the [[Illyrian Provinces]].{{sfn|Frucht|2005|p=|pp=422–423}} In response, the [[Royal Navy]] [[blockade of the Adriatic Sea|blockaded the Adriatic Sea]], leading to the [[Battle of Lissa (1811)|Battle of Vis]] in 1811.{{sfn|Adkins|Adkins|2008|p=|pp=359–362}} The Illyrian provinces were captured by the Austrians in 1813 and absorbed by the [[Austrian Empire]] following the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. This led to the formation of the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] and the restoration of the [[Croatian Littoral]] to the Kingdom of Croatia under one crown. The 1830s and 1840s featured [[romantic nationalism]] that inspired the [[Croatian National Revival]], a political and cultural campaign advocating the unity of [[South Slavs]] within the empire. Its primary focus was establishing a standard language as a counterweight to [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] while promoting [[Croatian literature]] and culture. During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], Croatia sided with Austria. Ban [[Josip Jelačić]] helped defeat the Hungarians in 1849 and ushered in a [[Germanisation]] policy. This is around the time that [[Nikola Tesla]] was born in Smiljin.

By the 1860s, the failure of the policy became apparent, leading to the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]]. The creation of a [[personal union]] between the Austrian Empire and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] followed. The treaty left Croatia's status to Hungary, which was resolved by the [[Croatian–Hungarian Settlement]] of 1868 when the kingdoms of Croatia and Slavonia were united. The Kingdom of Dalmatia remained under de facto Austrian control, while [[Rijeka]] retained the status of [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)|''corpus separatum'']] previously introduced in 1779.

After [[Austria-Hungary]] [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina]] following the [[1878 Treaty of Berlin]], the Military Frontier was abolished. The Croatian and [[Slavonian Military Frontier|Slavonian]] sectors of the Frontier returned to Croatia in 1881,{{sfn|Frucht|2005|p=|pp=422–423}} under provisions of the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement. Renewed efforts to [[reform Austria-Hungary]], entailing [[federalisation]] with Croatia as a federal unit, were stopped by [[World War I]].

=== The World Wars and Yugoslavia ===
{{Main|Creation of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Banovina of Croatia|World War II in Yugoslavia|Socialist Republic of Croatia}}

[[File:Demonstracije u Zagrebu 1918.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|Mass protests in Zagreb against the unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] in 1918]]
On 29 October 1918, the Croatian Parliament (''Sabor'') declared independence and decided to join the newly formed [[State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs]], which in turn entered into union with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] on 4 December 1918 to form the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]. The Croatian Parliament never ratified the union with Serbia and Montenegro. The [[1921 constitution]] defining the country as a [[unitary state]] and abolition of Croatian Parliament and historical administrative divisions effectively ended Croatian autonomy.

The new constitution was opposed by the most widely supported national political party—the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (HSS) led by [[Stjepan Radić]].

The political situation deteriorated further as Radić was assassinated in the [[Yugoslav Parliament|National Assembly]] by [[People's Radical Party|NRS]] member, [[Serbs|Serbian]] nationalist politician [[Puniša Račić]] in 1928, culminating in King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]]'s establishment of the [[6 January Dictatorship]] in 1929. The dictatorship formally ended in 1931 when the king imposed a more unitary constitution. The HSS, now led by [[Vladko Maček]], continued to advocate federalisation, resulting in the [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement]] of August 1939 and the autonomous [[Banovina of Croatia]]. The Yugoslav government retained control of defence, internal security, foreign affairs, trade, and transport while other matters were left to the Croatian Sabor and a crown-appointed Ban.{{sfn|Klemenčič|Žagar|2004|p=|pp=121–123}}

In April 1941, [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia was occupied]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]]. Following the invasion, a German-Italian installed puppet state named the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) was established. Most of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the region of [[Syrmia]] were incorporated into this state. Parts of Dalmatia were [[Treaties of Rome (1941)|annexed by Italy]], Hungary annexed the northern Croatian regions of [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]] and [[Međimurje (region)|Međimurje]].{{sfn|Klemenčič|Žagar|2004|p=|pp=153–156}} The NDH regime was led by [[Ante Pavelić]] and ultranationalist [[Ustaše]], a fringe movement in pre-war Croatia.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=337}} With German and Italian military and political support,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=272}} the regime introduced [[Nazi racial theories|racial laws]] and launched a [[Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia|genocide campaign against Serbs]], [[History of the Jews in Croatia|Jews]], and [[Romani people in Croatia|Roma]].{{sfn|Klemenčič|Žagar|2004|p=184}} Many were imprisoned in [[Concentration camps in the Independent State of Croatia|concentration camps]]; the largest was the [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac complex]]. [[Croatian Partisans|Anti-fascist Croats]] were targeted by the regime as well.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=138}} Several [[Italian concentration camps|concentration camps]] (most notably the [[Rab concentration camp|Rab]], [[Gonars concentration camp|Gonars]] and [[Molat concentration camp|Molat]] camps) were established in Italian-occupied territories, mostly for [[Slovenes]] and Croats. At the same time, the Yugoslav Royalist and [[Serbian nationalism|Serbian nationalist]] [[Chetniks]] pursued a [[Chetnik war crimes in World War II|genocidal campaign]] against Croats and [[Bosniaks|Muslims]],{{sfn|Klemenčič|Žagar|2004|p=184}} aided by Italy.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=744}} Nazi German forces committed crimes and reprisals against civilians in retaliation for Partisan actions, such as in the villages of [[Massacre of villages under Kamešnica|Kamešnica]] and [[Memorial Centre Lipa Remembers|Lipa]] in 1944.

A [[National Liberation Movement in Croatia|resistance movement]] emerged. On 22 June 1941, the [[1st Sisak Partisan Detachment]] was formed near [[Sisak]], the first military unit formed by a resistance movement in [[German-occupied Europe|occupied Europe]]. That sparked the beginning of the [[Yugoslav Partisan]] movement, a communist, multi-ethnic anti-fascist resistance group led by [[Josip Broz Tito]]. In ethnic terms, Croats were the second-largest contributors to the Partisan movement after Serbs. In per capita terms, Croats contributed proportionately to their population within Yugoslavia. By May 1944 (according to Tito), Croats made up 30% of the Partisan's ethnic composition, despite making up 22% of the population. The movement grew fast, and at the [[Tehran Conference]] in December 1943, the Partisans gained recognition from the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].

With Allied support in logistics, equipment, training and airpower, and with the assistance of [[Red Army|Soviet troops]] taking part in the 1944 [[Belgrade Offensive]], the Partisans gained control of Yugoslavia and the border regions of [[Trieste#World War II and aftermath|Italy]] and [[Carinthia (state)#From 1920 to the Present|Austria]] by May 1945. Members of the [[Croatian Armed Forces (Independent State of Croatia)|NDH armed forces]] and other Axis troops, as well as civilians, were in retreat towards Austria. Following their surrender, many were killed in the [[Yugoslav death march of Nazi collaborators]]. In the following years, [[Germans of Croatia|ethnic Germans]] faced [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)#Yugoslavia|persecution in Yugoslavia]], and many were interned.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=158}}

The political aspirations of the Partisan movement were reflected in the [[State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia]], which developed in 1943 as the bearer of Croatian statehood and later transformed into the Parliament in 1945, and [[AVNOJ]]—its counterpart at the Yugoslav level.

Based on the studies on [[World War II in Yugoslavia casualties|wartime and post-war casualties]] by demographer [[Vladimir Žerjavić]] and statistician [[Bogoljub Kočović]], a total of 295,000 people from the territory (not including territories [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|ceded from Italy]] after the war) died, which amounted to 7.3% of the population, among whom were 125–137,000 Serbs, 118–124,000 Croats, 16–17,000 Jews, and 15,000 Roma.{{sfn|Žerjavić|1992|p=159}}{{sfn|Kočović|1985|p=173}} In addition, from areas joined to Croatia after the war, a total of 32,000 people died, among whom 16,000 were Italians and 15,000 were Croats.{{sfn|Žerjavić|1993b|pp=640–641}} Approximately 200,000 Croats from the entirety of Yugoslavia (including Croatia) and abroad were killed in total throughout the war and its immediate aftermath, approximately 5.4% of the population.{{sfn|Kočović|1985|p=126}}{{sfn|Geiger|2012|pp=117–118}}

After [[World War II]], Croatia became a [[single-party]] socialist [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|federal unit]] of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]], ruled by the [[League of Communists of Croatia|Communists]], but having a degree of autonomy within the federation. In 1967, Croatian authors and linguists published a [[Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Standard Language]] demanding equal treatment for their language.

The declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and redistribution of the Yugoslav economy, culminating in the [[Croatian Spring]] of 1971, which was suppressed by Yugoslav leadership. Still, the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]] gave increased autonomy to federal units, basically fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents. At the same time, there was a substantial Croatian diaspora during the Cold War, which included efforts aimed at forming a government in exile.

Following Tito's death in 1980, the political situation in Yugoslavia deteriorated. National tension was fanned by the 1986 [[SANU Memorandum]] and the [[1989 coups in Vojvodina, Kosovo and Montenegro|1989 coups in Vojvodina, Kosovo, and Montenegro]].{{sfn|Frucht|2005|p=433}} In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines, with the Croatian [[Political faction|faction]] demanding a looser federation. In the same year, the [[1990 Croatian parliamentary election|first multi-party elections]] were held in Croatia, while [[Franjo Tuđman]]'s win exacerbated nationalist tensions. Some of the [[Serbs in Croatia]] left Sabor and declared autonomy of the unrecognised [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]], intent on achieving independence from Croatia.

=== Independence ===
{{Main|Breakup of Yugoslavia|Croatian War of Independence|Independence of Croatia|History of Croatia since 1995}}

As tensions rose, Croatia [[Independence of Croatia|declared independence]] on 25 June 1991. However, the full implementation of the declaration only came into effect after a [[Brioni Agreement|three-month moratorium on the decision]] on 8 October 1991. In the meantime, tensions escalated into [[Croatian War of Independence|overt war]] when the Serbian-controlled [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) and various Serb paramilitary groups attacked Croatia.

[[File:Vukovar Memorial Cemetery – Eternal Flame, 20150429160745.jpg|thumb|left|[[National Memorial Cemetery of The Victims of Homeland War in Vukovar]], the central place of holding the [[Remembrance Day (Croatia)|National Remembrance Day]], public holiday on 18 November, for all the victims of the war in Croatia and the [[Vukovar massacre]], one of the symbolic and crucial events in the [[Croatian War of Independence]] 1991]]

By the end of 1991, a high-intensity conflict fought along a wide front reduced Croatia's control to about two-thirds of its territory. Serb paramilitary groups then began a campaign of killing, terror, and expulsion of the Croats in the occupied territories, killing thousands of Croat civilians and expelling or displacing as many as 400,000–500,000 Croats and other non-Serbs from their homes. Serbs living in Croatian towns, especially those near the front lines, were subjected to various forms of discrimination.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=233}} Croatian Serbs in Eastern and Western Slavonia and parts of the Krajina were forced to flee or were expelled by Croatian forces, though on a restricted scale and in lesser numbers. The [[Government of Croatia|Croatian Government]] publicly deplored these practices and sought to stop them, indicating that they were not a part of the Government's policy.{{sfn|Allen|1996|p=46}}

On 15 January 1992, Croatia gained [[diplomatic recognition]] by the [[European Economic Community]], followed by the United Nations. The war effectively ended in August 1995 with a [[Operation Storm|decisive victory]] by Croatia; the event is commemorated each year on 5 August as [[Victory Day (Croatia)|Victory and Homeland Thanksgiving Day and the Day of Croatian Defenders]]. Following the Croatian victory, about 200,000 Serbs from the self-proclaimed [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] fled the region and hundreds of mainly elderly Serb civilians were killed in the aftermath of the military operation, often in revenge attacks, accompanied by looting, seizing or burning down of their property. Approximately half have returned since then. Some 19,000 Serb homes were subsequently settled by Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The [[Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia (1995–1998)|remaining occupied areas]] were restored to Croatia following the [[Erdut Agreement]] of November 1995, concluding with the [[United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium|UNTAES]] mission in January 1998. Most sources number the war deaths at around 20,000.

After the end of the war, Croatia faced the challenges of post-war reconstruction, the return of refugees, establishing democracy, protecting human rights, and general social and economic development.

The 2000s were characterized by democratization, economic growth, structural and social reforms, and problems such as unemployment, corruption, and the inefficiency of public administration. In November 2000 and March 2001, the Parliament amended the Constitution, first adopted on 22 December 1990, changing its bicameral structure back into its historic unicameral form and reducing presidential powers.

Croatia joined the [[Partnership for Peace]] on 25 May 2000 and became a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] on 30 November 2000. On 29 October 2001, Croatia signed a [[Stabilisation and Association Agreement]] with the European Union, submitted a formal application for the EU membership in 2003, was given the status of a candidate country in 2004, and began [[2013 enlargement of the European Union#Negotiation progress|accession negotiations]] in 2005. Although the Croatian economy enjoyed a significant boom in the early 2000s, the [[2008 financial crisis]] forced the government to cut spending, thus provoking a public outcry.

Croatia served on the [[United Nations Security Council]] in the 2008–2009 term for the first time, assuming the non-permanent seat in December 2008. On 1 April 2009, Croatia joined [[NATO]].

[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|Croatia became the 28th EU member country on 1 July 2013.]]

A wave of anti-government protests in 2011 reflected a general dissatisfaction with the current political and economic situation. The protests brought together diverse political persuasions in response to recent government corruption scandals and called for early elections. On 28 October 2011 [[List of MPs elected in the Croatian parliamentary election, 2007|MPs]] voted to dissolve Parliament and the protests gradually subsided. [[President of Croatia|President]] Ivo Josipović agreed to a dissolution of [[Croatian Parliament|Sabor]] on Monday, 31 October and scheduled new elections for Sunday 4 December 2011.

On 30 June 2011, Croatia successfully completed EU accession negotiations. The country signed the [[Treaty of Accession 2011|Accession Treaty]] on 9 December 2011 and held a [[2012 Croatian European Union membership referendum|referendum]] on 22 January 2012, where Croatian citizens voted in favor of an EU membership. [[Croatia joined the European Union]] on 1 July 2013.

Croatia was affected by the [[2015 European migrant crisis]] when Hungary's closure of borders with Serbia pushed over 700,000 refugees and migrants to pass through Croatia on their way to other EU countries.

On 19 October 2016, [[Andrej Plenković]] began serving as the current Croatian Prime Minister. The most recent presidential elections, held on 5 January 2020, elected [[Zoran Milanović]] as president.

On 25 January 2022, the [[OECD]] Council decided to open accession negotiations with Croatia. Throughout the accession process, Croatia was to implement numerous reforms that will advance all spheres of activity – from public services and the justice system to education, transport, finance, health, and trade. In line with the OECD Accession Roadmap from June 2022, Croatia will undergo technical reviews by 25 OECD committees and is so far progressing at a faster pace than expected. Full membership is expected in 2025 and is the last big foreign policy goal Croatia still has to achieve.

On 1 January 2023, Croatia adopted the [[euro]] as its official currency, replacing the [[Croatian kuna|kuna]], and became the 20th [[Eurozone]] member. On the same day, Croatia became the 27th member of the border-free [[Schengen Area]], thus marking its full EU integration.
