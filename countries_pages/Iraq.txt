== History ==
{{main|Mesopotamia|History of Mesopotamia|History of Iraq}}Iraq largely coincides with the ancient region of [[Mesopotamia]], often referred to as the cradle of civilisation. The history of Mesopotamia extends back to the [[Lower Paleolithic]] period, with significant developments continuing through the establishment of the [[Caliphate]] in the late 7th century AD, after which the region became known as Iraq.

=== Bronze and Iron Age ===

Within its borders lies the ancient land of [[Sumer]], which emerged between 6000 and 5000 BC during the [[Neolithic]] [[Ubaid period]]. Sumer is recognised as the world's earliest civilisation, marking the beginning of urban development, written language, and monumental architecture. Iraq's territory also includes the heartlands of the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]], [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Neo-Sumerian]], [[Babylonia]]n, [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]], and [[Neo-Babylonian]] empires, which dominated Mesopotamia and much of the [[Ancient Near East]] during the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages.

The Iraq of antiquity was an innovation stronghold, producing early [[List of languages by first written accounts|written languages]], [[Sumerian literature|literary works]], and significant advancements in [[Babylonian astronomy|astronomy]], [[Babylonian mathematics|mathematics]], [[Babylonian law|law]], and [[Assyro-Babylonian literature#Philosophy|philosophy]]. This era of indigenous rule ended in 539 BC when the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] under [[Cyrus the Great]], who declared himself the "[[King of Babylon]]". The city of [[Babylon]], the ancient seat of Babylonian power, became one of the key capitals of the Achaemenid Empire. Ancient Iraq, known as the Mesopotamia, is home to world's first Jewish diaspora community, which emerged during the Babylonian exile.

The Babylonians were defeated by the Persian Empire, under the leadership of [[Cyrus the Great]]. Following the fall of Babylon, the [[Achaemenid Empire]] took control of the Mesopotamian region. Enslaved Jews were freed from the Babylonian captivity, though many remained in the land and thus the Jewish community grew in the region. Iraq is the location of numerous Jewish sites, which are also revered by the Muslims and Christians.

In the following centuries, the regions constituting modern Iraq came under the control of several empires, including the [[Seleucid Empire|Greeks]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], and [[Roman Empire|Romans]], establishing new centres like [[Seleucia]] and [[Ctesiphon]]. By the [[3rd century]] AD, the region fell under Persian control through the [[Sasanian Empire]], during which time Arab tribes from [[South Arabia]] migrated into Lower Mesopotamia, leading to the formation of the Sassanid-aligned [[Lakhmid kingdom]].

=== Middle Ages ===

[[File:Abbasid Caliphate 850AD.png|thumb|[[Abbasid Caliphate]] with capitals in Baghdad and [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]] c. 850]]
The Arabic name ''al-ʿIrāq'' likely originated during this period. The Sasanian Empire was eventually [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquered]] by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in the 7th century, bringing Iraq under Islamic rule after the [[Battle of al-Qadisiyyah]] in 636. The city of [[Kufa]], founded shortly thereafter, became a central hub for the Rashidun dynasty until their [[First Fitna|overthrow]] by the [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyads]] in 661. Karbala is considered as one of the holiest cities in Shia Islam, following the [[Battle of Karbala]], which took place in 680.

With the rise of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in the mid-8th century, Iraq became the centre of Islamic rule, with [[Baghdad]], founded in 762, serving as the capital. Baghdad flourished during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], becoming a global hub for culture, science, and intellectualism. However, the city's prosperity declined following the [[Buwayhid]] and [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuq]] invasions in the 10th century and suffered further with the [[Siege of Baghdad|Mongol invasion]] of 1258.

=== Early Modern Period: Ottoman Iraq (1534-1920) ===
{{Main|Ottoman Iraq}}
Iraq was conquered by [[Sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] in 1534 and became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Iraq was a major frontier of the [[Ottoman–Persian Wars|Ottoman–Safavid wars]], with Baghdad changing hands several times until the [[Treaty of Zuhab]] in 1639 confirmed Ottoman control. Administratively, Iraq was organised into the provinces of [[Baghdad Eyalet|Baghdad]], [[Basra Eyalet|Basra]], [[Mosul Eyalet|Mosul]], and [[Shahrizor Eyalet|Shahrizor]], which the Ottomans collectively referred to as Hıtta-i Irakiyye (“the Iraq region”).

From 1749 to 1831, Iraq was ruled by a [[Mamluk dynasty (Iraq)|Mamluk dynasty]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] origin with considerable autonomy while maintaining nominal allegiance to the Ottoman sultan. After the dynasty was overthrown in 1831, the centralisation of Iraq under Baghdad began. Under the two-time Ottoman Viceroy, [[Mehmed Namık Pasha|Namık Pasha]], Baghdad's authority was expanded through military and administrative reforms. [[Midhat Pasha]] introduced further reforms in taxation, land registration, infrastructure, education, and communications, reforms often seen as laying the groundwork for the modern Iraq.

Iraq remained under Ottoman control until the [[World War I|First World War]], when the British launched the [[Mesopotamian campaign]]. The campaign led to the [[Fall of Baghdad (1917)|occupation of Baghdad]] in 1917, and in 1920 Ottoman Iraq was formally dissolved with the establishment of the [[Mandate for Mesopotamia|British Mandate of Mesopotamia]].

=== Modern Iraq ===
{{Main|Mandatory Iraq|Kingdom of Iraq}}
[[File:Nouri_Al-Saeed,_1950s.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nuri al-Said|Nuri Pasha al-Said]] (1888–1958) served eight terms as [[Prime Minister of Iraq|prime minister]] during [[Mandatory Iraq]] and the [[Kingdom of Iraq|Hashemite Kingdom]]]]
Iraq's modern history began in the wake of World War I, as the region emerged from the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Arab forces, inspired by the promise of independence, had helped dismantle the Ottoman hold on the Middle East, but the dream of a united, sovereign Arab state was soon dashed. Despite agreements made with [[Hussein bin Ali, King of Hejaz|Hussein bin Ali]], the [[Sharif of Mecca|Sharif of Makkah]], the European powers had different plans for the region. Following the British withdrawal of support for a [[Arab state|unified Arab state]], Hussein's son, [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]], briefly declared the [[Kingdom of Syria]] in 1920, encompassing parts of what are now [[Lebanon]], [[Palestine]], [[Jordan]], and [[Syria]]. However, the kingdom was short-lived, crushed by local opposition and the military might of France, which had been granted a [[Mandatory Syria|mandate over Syria]].

In Iraq, under British mandate, tensions were rising as local forces increasingly resisted foreign control. A [[Iraqi Revolt|rebellion erupted]], challenging British authority, and the need for a new strategy became clear. In 1921, the [[Cairo Conference (1921)|Cairo Conference]], led by British officials including [[Winston Churchill]] and [[T. E. Lawrence]], decided that Faisal, now exiled in [[London]], would become the [[king of Iraq]]. This decision was seen as a way to maintain British influence in the region while placating local demands for leadership. Upon his coronation, he focused on unifying a land formerly divided into three [[Ottoman provinces]]—[[Mosul Province, Ottoman Empire|Mosul]], [[Baghdad Province, Ottoman Empire|Baghdad]], and [[Basra vilayet|Basra]]. He worked hard to gain the support of Iraq's diverse population, including both [[Sunnis]] and [[Shiites]], and paid special attention to the country's Shiite communities, symbolically choosing the date of his coronation to coincide with [[Eid al-Ghadir|Eid al-Ghadeer]], a key day for Shiite Muslims.

His reign laid the foundations of modern Iraq. Faisal worked to establish key state institutions and fostered a sense of national identity. His education reforms included the founding of [[Ahl al-Bayt University]] in Baghdad, and he encouraged the migration of Syrian exiles to Iraq to serve as doctors and educators. Faisal also envisioned infrastructural links between Iraq, Syria, and [[Emirate of Transjordan|Jordan]], including plans for a railway and an [[Kirkuk–Haifa oil pipeline|oil pipeline to the Mediterranean]]. Although Faisal succeeded in securing greater autonomy for Iraq, British influence remained strong, particularly in the country's oil industry. In 1930, [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930|Iraq signed a treaty with Britain]] that gave the country a measure of political independence while maintaining British control over key aspects, including military presence and oil rights. By 1932, Iraq gained formal independence, becoming a member of the [[League of Nations]]. Faisal's reign was marked by his efforts to balance the pressures of external influence and internal demands for sovereignty. He was admired for his diplomatic skill and his commitment to steering Iraq towards self-determination. Untimely, he died from a heart attack on 8 September 1933, leaving his son [[Ghazi of Iraq|Ghazi]] to inherit the throne. King Ghazi's reign was brief and turbulent, as Iraq was impacted by numerous coup attempts. He died in a motor accident in 1939, passing the throne to his young son, [[Faisal II]], who ascended to the throne at just 3 years old. Faisal II's uncle, [[Abd al-Ilah|Crown Prince Abdullah]], assumed regency until the young king came of age.

On 1 April 1941, [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] and members of the [[Golden Square (Iraq)|Golden Square]] staged a [[1941 Iraqi coup d'état|coup d'état]] and installed a [[Nazism|pro-German]] and [[Fascism|pro-Italian]] government. During the subsequent [[Anglo-Iraqi War]], the [[United Kingdom]] invaded Iraq for fear that the government might cut oil supplies to [[Western nations]] because of its links to the [[Axis powers]]. The war started on 2 May, and the British, together with loyal [[Assyrian Levies]], defeated the forces of Al-Gaylani, forcing an armistice on 31 May. Regency of King Faisal II began in 1953. The hopes for Iraq's future under Faisal II were high, but the nation remained divided. Iraq's Sunni-dominated monarchy struggled to reconcile the diverse ethnic and religious groups, particularly the Shiite, Assyrian, Jewish and Kurdish populations, who felt marginalised. In 1958, these tensions culminated in a military coup, inspired by the revolutionary wave sweeping across the Arab world, particularly the [[1952 Egyptian revolution]].

=== Republic and Ba'athist Iraq ===
{{Main|Iraqi Republic (1958–1968)|Ba'athist Iraq}}
[[File:Saddam_Hussein_1980.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|Saddam Hussein in 1980]]
Brigadier General and [[Iraqi nationalism|nationalist]] [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] led a coup d'état known as the [[14 July Revolution]] in 1958. This revolt was strongly anti-imperial and anti-monarchical in nature and had strong socialist elements. King [[Faysal II|Faisal II]], Prince [[Abd al-Ilah]], and [[Nuri al-Sa'id]], along with the royal family were killed brutally. Qasim controlled Iraq through military rule and in 1958 he began a process of forcibly reducing surplus land owned by a few citizens and having the state redistribute the land. In 1959, [[Abd al-Wahab al-Shawaf]] led an uprising in Mosul against Qasim. The uprising was crushed by the government forces. He claimed [[Kuwait]] as part of Iraq, when the former was granted independence in 1961. The [[Operation Vantage|United Kingdom deployed its army]] on the [[Iraq–Kuwait border]], which forced Qasim to back down. He was overthrown by the Ba'ath Party in [[Ramadan Revolution|February 1963 coup]]. However internal division within Ba'athist factions caused another coup in November, which brought Colonel Abdul Salam Arif to power. The new regime recognised Kuwait's independence. After the latter's death in 1966, he was succeeded by his brother, [[Abdul Rahman Arif]]. Under his rule, Iraq participated in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967.

The [[17 July Revolution]] overthrew Arif and brought the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Iraqi Ba'ath Party]] to power in 1968, with [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] as the president of Iraq. However, the government gradually came under the control of [[Saddam Hussein]], Iraq's then vice-president. Saddam sought to achieve stability between Iraq's ethnic and religious groups. The [[First Iraqi–Kurdish War|first Iraqi–Kurdish war]] ended in 1970, after which a peace treaty was signed between Saddam and Barzani, granting autonomy to [[Kurds]]. In the 1970s, the leadership offered peace initiatives to Assyrians in Iraq and invited exiled Iraqi Jews back to Iraq. The government introduced free healthcare and education, nationalised oil, promoted women's rights and developed infrastructure.

In 1974, the [[Second Iraqi–Kurdish War|second Iraqi–Kurdish war]] began and [[1974–75 Shatt al-Arab conflict|border clashes with Iran]] took place on [[Shatt al-Arab]]. Iran supported Kurdish militants. The [[1975 Algiers Agreement|Algiers Agreement]] signed in 1975 by [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] and Saddam resolved the dispute and Iran withdrew support for the Kurds, resulting in their defeat in the war. In 1973, Iraq participated in the [[Yom Kippur War]] against Israel, alongside [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]]. An attempt to ban an annual pilgrimage to Karbala in 1977 caused an [[1977 Shia uprising in Iraq|uprising by Shia Muslims across Iraq]]. Another Shia uprising took place from 1979 to 1980, as a followup to the [[Islamic Revolution]] in Iran. On 16 July 1979, Saddam acceded to the presidency and chairmanship of the [[Revolutionary Command Council (Iraq)|Revolutionary Command Council]], Iraq's then [[Executive (government)|supreme executive body]].

Following months of cross-border raids with Iran, Saddam declared war on Iran in September 1980, initiating the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. Taking advantage of the post-[[Iranian Revolution]] chaos in Iran, Iraq captured some territories in southwest Iran, but Iran recaptured all of the lost territories within two years, and for the next six years Iran was on the offensive.<sup>[''[[Wikipedia:Citing sources|page needed]]'']</sup> [[Arab countries|Sunni-led Arab countries]] and the [[United States support for Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War|United States supported Iraq throughout the war]]. In 1981, Israel destroyed a nuclear reactor of Iraq. In midst of the war, between 1983 and 1986, Kurds led [[1983–1986 Kurdish rebellions in Iraq|rebellion against the regime]]. In retaliation, the government-coordinated [[Anfal campaign]] led to the killing of 50,000–100,000 civilians. During the war, Saddam extensively used [[Iraqi chemical weapons program|chemical weapons]] against Iranians. The war, which ended in [[stalemate]] in 1988, killed between half a million and 1.5 million people.

Kuwait's refusal to waive Iraq's debt and reducing oil prices pushed Saddam to take military action against it. On 2 August 1990, the [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait|Iraqi forces invaded]] and annexed Kuwait as its [[Kuwait Governorate|19th governorate]], starting the [[Gulf War]]. This led to military intervention by the [[Coalition of the Gulf War|US-led alliance]]. The coalition forces proceeded with a bombing campaign targeting military targets and then launched a 100-hour-long ground assault against Iraqi forces in southern Iraq and Kuwait. Iraq also attempted to invade Saudi Arabia and attacked Israel. Iraq's armed forces were devastated during the war. Sanctions were imposed on Iraq, following the invasion of Kuwait, which resulted in economic decline. After the end of the war in 1991, Iraqi Kurds and Shi'ite Muslims in northern and southern Iraq led several [[1991 Iraqi uprisings|uprisings against Saddam's regime]], but these were repressed. It is estimated that as many as 100,000 people, including many civilians, were killed. During the uprisings, the US, UK, Turkey and France, claiming authority under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 688|UNSC Resolution 688]], established the [[Iraqi no-fly zones]] to protect Kurdish population from attacks and autonomy was given to Kurds. Iraq was also affected by the [[Iraqi Kurdish Civil War]] from 1994 to 1997. Around 40,000 fighters and civilians were killed. Between 2001 and 2003, the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] and [[Ansar al-Islam in Kurdistan|Ansar al-Islam]] engaged in conflict, which would merge with the upcoming war.

=== Post-invasion Iraq ===
{{Main|Occupation of Iraq (2003–2011)|Iraq War|History of Iraq (2011–present)}}
After the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]], [[George W. Bush]] began planning the overthrow of Saddam in what is now widely regarded as a [[Rationale for the Iraq War|false pretense]]. Saddam's Iraq was included in Bush's "[[axis of evil]]". The [[United States Congress|US Congress]] passed [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002|joint resolution]], which authorised the use of armed force against Iraq. In November 2002 the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441|resolution 1441]]. On 20 March 2003, the US-led coalition invaded Iraq, as part of [[global war on terror]]. Within weeks, coalition forces occupied much of Iraq, with the Iraqi Army adopting guerrilla tactics to confront coalition forces. Following the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|fall of Baghdad]] in the first week of April, Saddam's regime had completely lost control of Iraq. A [[Firdos Square statue destruction|statue of Saddam was toppled]] in Baghdad, symbolising the end of his rule.

====Insurgency and Civil war====
The [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] began disbanding the Ba'ath Army and expelling Ba'athists from the new government. The insurgents fought against the coalition forces and the newly installed government. Saddam was captured and executed. The Shia–Sunni civil war took place from 2006 to 2008. The coalition forces were accused of war crimes such as the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib torture]], the [[Fallujah killings of April 2003|Fallujah massacre]], the [[Mahmudiyah rape and killings]] and the [[Mukaradeeb wedding party massacre]]. Following the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007–2011)|withdrawal of US troops]] in 2011, the occupation ceased and war ended. The war in Iraq has resulted in [[Casualties of the Iraq War|between 151,000 and 1.2 million Iraqis being killed]].

The subsequent efforts to rebuild the country amidst sectarian violence was galvanised by continuing discontent over [[Nouri al-Maliki]]'s government, which led to [[2012–2013 Iraqi protests|protests]]. In 2013, taking advantage of the ensuing chaos and popular discontent against the Iraqi government, Ba'athist and other Sunni militants ([[Al Qaida]] and [[Islamic State|ISIS]]) launched a number of attacks against the government during what is known as the [[Anbar campaign (2013–2014)|Anbar campaign]]. What followed, was a large scale [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|offensive]] by ISIS in [[Mosul]], which marked the beginning of the rapid [[Territory of the Islamic State|territorial expansion]] of the group, initiating [[War in Iraq (2013–2017)|full-scale war in Iraq]]. Sunni insurgents belonging to the Islamic State group seized control of large swathes of land including several major cities, like [[Tikrit]], [[Fallujah]] and Mosul, creating hundreds of thousands of [[internally displaced persons]] amid reports of atrocities by ISIS fighters. An estimated 500,000 civilians fled from Mosul. Around 5,000 Yazidis were killed in the genocide by ISIS, as a part of the war. In June 2014, Iraq's leading Shii Grand Ayatollah, [[Ali al-Sistani]] issued a [[Fatwa]] calling on able-bodied men to join the Armed Forces to fight against ISIS. Even though the Fatwa specifically instructed Iraqis to join the official Armed Forces of the country (such as the Army or the Police), it nevertheless resulted in the creation of the [[Popular Mobilisation Forces]]. During that time, the government of Iraq, headed by [[Haider al-Abadi]] requested the international community to assist Iraq against ISIS, resulting in the creation of the [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–2021)|American-led Coalition against ISIS]]. Meanwhile, in an attempt to counter US influence, [[Khomeinism|Khomeinist]] anti-US militias prompted [[Iranian intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|Iranian intervention]], which resulted in the latter expanding its influence. The Iraqi armed forces, supported by the US-led coalition, as well as the Popular Mobilisation Forces, [[Peshmerga]] and other allied anti-ISIS militias then initiated a counter-offensive to retake and liberate ISIS-held territory. In December 2017, when ISIS had lost all its territory in Iraq, the government declared victory.

====2019-2021 protests====
{{main|2019–2021 Iraqi protests}}
One of the main causes for popular discontent in Iraq is the lack of reliable electricity infrastructure and clean water. The electrical grid faces systemic pressures due to climate change, fuel shortages, and an increase in demand. Corruption remains endemic throughout Iraqi governance while the United States-endorsed sectarian political system has driven increased levels of violent terrorism and sectarian conflicts. Climate change is driving wide-scale droughts while water reserves are rapidly depleting. Nationwide protests erupted in Iraq in October 2019, demanding systemic reform, and the end of the party-based quota system as well as the disarmament of non-state militias and end to foreign interference. Despite heavy repression, hundreds of deaths, and widespread injuries, the movement remained united around calls for institutional reform and increased accountability. In 2020, the sitting prime minister [[Adil Abdul Mahdi]] resigned in the face of popular demand. Succeeding him was prime minister [[Mustafa al-Kadhimi]], during whose tenure the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] erupted, causing a macroeconomic shock that plummeted oil prices, devastating the Iraqi economy which is dominated by the oil sector. The country has been in a [[Climate change in Iraq|prolonged drought]] since 2020 and experienced its second-driest season in the past four decades in 2021. Water flows in the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] were down 30-40% in 2023. Half the country's farmland is at risk of [[desertification]]. Nearly 40% of Iraq "has been overtaken by blowing desert sands that claim tens of thousands of acres of arable land every year". In 2024, Iraq experienced unprecedented rainfall that —according to the [[Ministry of Water Resources (Iraq)|Ministry of Water Resources]]— boosted Iraq's strategic water reserves by 10%, significantly easing the drought crisis.

==== Period of stability (2022-present)====
In October 2022, the Council of Representatives elected [[Abdul Latif Rashid]] as [[President of Iraq|president]], and [[Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani|Mohammed Shia al-Sudani]] became [[Prime Minister of Iraq|Prime Minister]]. Since assuming office in October 2022, Prime Minister al-Sudani has overseen a period of relative political, security, and economic stabilisation. Government officials have cited increased regional diplomacy, improved international relations, and economic diversification initiatives such as the [[Iraq–Europe Development Road]] project as key indicators of recovery. In August 2023, al-Sudani established the [[Development Fund (Iraq)|Iraq Development Fund]] whose purpose is to strengthen the private sector and finance projects of crucial social and environmental value. In February 2025, the fund had gained $7bn in [[foreign direct investments]], and signed Memoranda of Understanding with a number of countries including [[United Kingdom]] and [[Japan]]. In May 2025, Iraqi [[Ministry of Planning (Iraq)|Ministry of Planning]] announced that the unemployment rate in Iraq had dropped from 17% in 2022 to 13% in 2025. A report published on 24 July 2025 and submitted to the [[United Nations Security Council]], assessed that ISIS "is at its weakest" in Iraq since its emergence.
