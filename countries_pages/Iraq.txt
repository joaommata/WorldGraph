== History ==
{{main|Mesopotamia|History of Mesopotamia|History of Iraq}}Iraq largely coincides with the ancient region of [[Mesopotamia]], often referred to as the cradle of civilisation. The history of Mesopotamia extends back to the [[Lower Paleolithic]] period, with significant developments continuing through the establishment of the [[Caliphate]] in the late 7th century AD, after which the region became known as Iraq.

Within its borders lies the ancient land of [[Sumer]], which emerged between 6000 and 5000 BC during the [[Neolithic]] [[Ubaid period]]. Administratively, Iraq was organised into the provinces of [[Baghdad Eyalet|Baghdad]], [[Basra Eyalet|Basra]], [[Mosul Eyalet|Mosul]], and [[Shahrizor Eyalet|Shahrizor]], which the Ottomans collectively referred to as Hıtta-i Irakiyye (“the Iraq region”).

From 1749 to 1831, Iraq was ruled by a [[Mamluk dynasty (Iraq)|Mamluk dynasty]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] origin with considerable autonomy while maintaining nominal allegiance to the Ottoman sultan. After the dynasty was overthrown in 1831, the centralisation of Iraq under Baghdad began. Under the two-time Ottoman Viceroy, [[Mehmed Namık Pasha|Namık Pasha]], Baghdad's authority was expanded through military and administrative reforms. [[Midhat Pasha]] introduced further reforms in taxation, land registration, infrastructure, education, and communications, reforms often seen as laying the groundwork for the modern Iraq.

Iraq remained under Ottoman control until the [[World War I|First World War]], when the British launched the [[Mesopotamian campaign]]. The campaign led to the [[Fall of Baghdad (1917)|occupation of Baghdad]] in 1917, and in 1920 Ottoman Iraq was formally dissolved with the establishment of the [[Mandate for Mesopotamia|British Mandate of Mesopotamia]].

=== Modern Iraq ===

Iraq's modern history began in the wake of World War I, as the region emerged from the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. However, the government gradually came under the control of [[Saddam Hussein]], Iraq's then vice-president. In the 1970s, the leadership offered peace initiatives to Assyrians in Iraq and invited exiled Iraqi Jews back to Iraq. The government introduced free healthcare and education, nationalised oil, promoted women's rights and developed infrastructure.

In 1974, the [[Second Iraqi–Kurdish War|second Iraqi–Kurdish war]] began and [[1974–75 Shatt al-Arab conflict|border clashes with Iran]] took place on [[Shatt al-Arab]]. Iran supported Kurdish militants. In 1973, Iraq participated in the [[Yom Kippur War]] against Israel, alongside [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]]. A [[Firdos Square statue destruction|statue of Saddam was toppled]] in Baghdad, symbolising the end of his rule. During that time, the government of Iraq, headed by [[Haider al-Abadi]] requested the international community to assist Iraq against ISIS, resulting in the creation of the [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–2021)|American-led Coalition against ISIS]]. Meanwhile, in an attempt to counter US influence, [[Khomeinism|Khomeinist]] anti-US militias prompted [[Iranian intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|Iranian intervention]], which resulted in the latter expanding its influence. The Iraqi armed forces, supported by the US-led coalition, as well as the Popular Mobilisation Forces, [[Peshmerga]] and other allied anti-ISIS militias then initiated a counter-offensive to retake and liberate ISIS-held territory. In December 2017, when ISIS had lost all its territory in Iraq, the government declared victory.

One of the main causes for popular discontent in Iraq is the lack of reliable electricity infrastructure and clean water. The electrical grid faces systemic pressures due to climate change, fuel shortages, and an increase in demand.

==== Period of stability (2022-present)====
In October 2022, the Council of Representatives elected [[Abdul Latif Rashid]] as [[President of Iraq|president]], and [[Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani|Mohammed Shia al-Sudani]] became [[Prime Minister of Iraq|Prime Minister]]. Since assuming office in October 2022, Prime Minister al-Sudani has overseen a period of relative political, security, and economic stabilisation. Government officials have cited increased regional diplomacy, improved international relations, and economic diversification initiatives such as the [[Iraq–Europe Development Road]] project as key indicators of recovery. In August 2023, al-Sudani established the [[Development Fund (Iraq)|Iraq Development Fund]] whose purpose is to strengthen the private sector and finance projects of crucial social and environmental value. In February 2025, the fund had gained $7bn in [[foreign direct investments]], and signed Memoranda of Understanding with a number of countries including [[United Kingdom]] and [[Japan]]. In May 2025, Iraqi [[Ministry of Planning (Iraq)|Ministry of Planning]] announced that the unemployment rate in Iraq had dropped from 17% in 2022 to 13% in 2025. A report published on 24 July 2025 and submitted to the [[United Nations Security Council]], assessed that ISIS "is at its weakest" in Iraq since its emergence.
