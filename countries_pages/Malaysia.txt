Evidence of modern human habitation in Malaysia dates back 40,000&nbsp;years. In the Malay Peninsula, the first inhabitants are thought to be [[Negritos]]. Areas of Malaysia participated in the Maritime Jade Road between 2000 BC to 1000 AD. Traders and settlers from [[India]] and [[China]] arrived as early as the first century AD, establishing trading ports and coastal towns in the second and third centuries. Their presence resulted in strong [[India]]n and [[China|Chinese]] influences on the local cultures, and the people of the Malay Peninsula adopted the religions of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. [[Sanskrit]] inscriptions appear as early as the fourth or fifth century. The Kingdom of [[Langkasuka]] arose around the second century in the northern area of the Malay Peninsula, lasting until about the 15th century. In the early 15th century, [[Parameswara (king)|Parameswara]], a runaway king of the former [[Kingdom of Singapura]] linked to the old Srivijayan court, founded the [[Malacca Sultanate]]. The spread of Islam increased following Parameswara's conversion to that religion. Malacca was an important commercial centre during this time, attracting trade from around the region. and in 1824 took control of Malacca following the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]]. By 1826, the British directly controlled Penang, Malacca, Singapore, and the island of [[Crown Colony of Labuan|Labuan]], which they established as the crown colony of the [[Straits Settlements]]. By the 20th century, the states of [[Pahang]], [[Selangor]], [[Perak]], and [[Negeri Sembilan]], known together as the [[Federated Malay States]], had British [[resident (title)|residents]] appointed to advise the Malay rulers, to whom the rulers were bound to defer by treaty. The remaining five states on the peninsula, known as the [[Unfederated Malay States]], while not directly under British rule, also accepted British advisers around the turn of the 20th century. Development on the peninsula and Borneo were generally separate until the 19th century. Under British rule the [[immigration]] of Chinese and Indians to serve as labourers was encouraged. The area that is now [[Sabah]] came under British control as [[North Borneo]] when both the [[Sultanate of Brunei|Sultan of Brunei]] and the [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sultan of Sulu]] transferred their respective territorial rights of ownership, between 1877 and 1878. In 1842, Sarawak was ceded by the Sultan of Brunei to [[James Brooke]], whose successors ruled as the [[White Rajahs]] over an independent [[Raj of Sarawak|kingdom]] until 1946, when it became a [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|crown colony]].

In the [[Second World War]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|invaded]] and occupied [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|North Borneo, Sarawak]], and [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Singapore]] for over three years. During this time, ethnic tensions were raised and nationalism grew. Popular support for independence increased after Malaya was reconquered by Allied forces. Post-war British plans to unite the administration of Malaya under a single crown colony called the [[Malayan Union]] met with strong opposition from the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], who opposed the weakening of the Malay rulers and the granting of citizenship to the [[Malaysian Chinese|ethnic Chinese]]. The Malayan Union, established in 1946, and consisting of all the [[British possessions]] in the Malay Peninsula except for [[Colony of Singapore|Singapore]], was quickly dissolved and replaced on 1 February 1948 by the [[Federation of Malaya]], which restored the autonomy of the rulers of the Malay states under British protection.

During this time, the mostly ethnically Chinese rebels under the leadership of the [[Malayan Communist Party]] launched guerrilla operations designed to force the British out of Malaya. The [[Malayan Emergency|Malayan Emergency (1948–1960)]] involved a long anti-insurgency campaign by [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] troops in Malaya. On 31 August 1957, [[Malayan Declaration of Independence|Malaya became an independent member]] of the Commonwealth of Nations. Subsequently, a comprehensive plan was devised to unite Malaya with the crown colonies of North Borneo (known as [[Sabah]] upon joining), [[Sarawak]], and [[Singapore]]. The envisioned federation was originally intended to take place on 31 August 1963, to coincide with the commemoration of Malayan independence. However, due to the necessity of conducting a survey on the level of support for the federation in Sabah and Sarawak by the [[United Nations]], as requested by opponents of the federation such as [[Indonesia]]'s [[Sukarno]] and the [[Sarawak United Peoples' Party]], the date of the federation was postponed until 16 September 1963.

The federation brought heightened tensions including a [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|conflict with Indonesia]] as well as continual conflicts against the Communists in Borneo and the Malay Peninsula, which escalated to the [[Communist insurgency in Sarawak|Sarawak Communist Insurgency]] and [[Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968–89)|Second Malayan Emergency]] together with several other issues such as the [[Cross border attacks in Sabah|cross-border attacks into Sabah]] by [[Piracy in the Sulu Sea|Moro pirates]] from the southern islands of the Philippines, Singapore [[Singapore in Malaysia#Expulsion|being expelled from the Federation]] in 1965, and racial strife. This strife culminated in the [[13 May Incident|13 May race riots]] in 1969. After the riots, the controversial [[Malaysian New Economic Policy|New Economic Policy]] was launched by Prime Minister [[Tun Abdul Razak]], trying to increase the share of the economy held by the ''[[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|bumiputera]]''. Under Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] there was a period of rapid economic growth and urbanization beginning in the 1980s. The economy shifted from being agriculturally based to one based on manufacturing and industry. Numerous mega-projects were completed, such as the [[Petronas Towers]], the [[North–South Expressway (Malaysia)|North–South Expressway]], the [[MSC Malaysia|Multimedia Super Corridor]], and the new federal administrative capital of [[Putrajaya]].

In the late 1990s, the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|Asian financial crisis]] impacted the country, nearly causing their currency, stock, and property markets to crash; however, they later recovered. The [[1MDB scandal]] was a major global [[Corruption in Malaysia|corruption]] scandal that implicated then-Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]] in 2015. The scandal contributed to the first change in the ruling political party since independence in the [[2018 Malaysian general election|2018 general election]]. This was then followed by an earlier [[2022 Malaysian general election|general election]] in November 2022, which resulted in the first hung parliament in the nation's history. On 24 November 2022, [[Anwar Ibrahim]] was sworn in as the 10th [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], leading a [[Grand coalition#Malaysia|grand coalition]] government.
