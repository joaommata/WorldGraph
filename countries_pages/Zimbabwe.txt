Archaeological records date archaic human settlement of present-day Zimbabwe to at least 500,000 years ago. Zimbabwe's earliest known inhabitants were most likely the [[San people]], who left behind a legacy of arrowheads and cave paintings. Approximately 2,000 years ago, the first Bantu-speaking farmers arrived during the Bantu expansion.

Societies speaking proto-[[Shona languages]] first emerged in the middle [[Limpopo River]] valley in the 9th century before moving on to the Zimbabwean highlands. The Zimbabwean plateau became the centre of subsequent Shona states, beginning around the 10th century. Around the early 10th century, trade developed with [[Shirazi era|Arab merchants]] on the Indian Ocean coast, helping to develop the [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]] in the 13th century. This was the precursor to the Shona civilisations that dominated the region from the 13th century, evidenced by ruins at [[Great Zimbabwe]], near [[Masvingo]], and by other smaller sites. The main archaeological site used a unique dry stone architecture. The Kingdom of Mapungubwe was the first in a series of trading states which had developed in Zimbabwe by the time the first European explorers arrived from Portugal. These states traded gold, ivory, and copper for cloth and glass.

By 1300, the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]] eclipsed Mapungubwe. This Shona state further refined and expanded upon Mapungubwe's stone architecture. From {{circa}} 1450 to 1760, the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]] ruled much of the area of present-day Zimbabwe, plus parts of central Mozambique. It is known by many names including the Mutapa Empire, also known as ''Mwene Mutapa'' or ''Monomotapa'' as well as "Munhumutapa", and was renowned for its strategic trade routes with the Arabs and Portugal. The Portuguese sought to monopolise this influence and began a series of wars which left the empire in near collapse in the early 17th century.

As a direct response to increased European presence in the interior a new Shona state emerged, known as the [[Rozvi Empire|Rozwi Empire]]. Relying on centuries of military, political and religious development, the Rozwi (meaning "destroyers") expelled the Portuguese from the Zimbabwean plateau in 1683. Around 1821 the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] general [[Mzilikazi]] of the [[Khumalo clan]] successfully rebelled against King [[Shaka]] and established his own clan, the [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]]. The Ndebele fought their way northwards into the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], leaving a trail of destruction in their wake and beginning an era of widespread devastation known as the [[Mfecane]]. When Dutch [[Boers|trekboers]] converged on the Transvaal in 1836, they drove the tribe even further northward, with the assistance of [[Tswana people|Tswana]] [[Barolong]] warriors and [[Griqua people|Griqua]] commandos. By 1838 the Ndebele had conquered the Rozwi Empire, along with the other smaller Shona states, and reduced them to [[vassal]]dom.

After losing their remaining South African lands in 1840, Mzilikazi and his tribe permanently settled in the southwest of present-day Zimbabwe in what became known as Matabeleland, establishing [[Bulawayo]] as their capital. Mzilikazi then organised his society into a military system with regimental [[kraal]]s, similar to those of Shaka, which was stable enough to repel further Boer incursions. Mzilikazi died in 1868; following a violent power struggle, his son [[Lobengula]] succeeded him.

===Colonial era and Rhodesia (1888–1964)===

[[File:Hoisting the flag at Fort Salisbury.png|thumb|The [[Union Jack]] was raised over [[Harare|Fort Salisbury]] on 13 September 1890.]]
In the 1880s, European colonists arrived with [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[British South Africa Company]] (chartered in 1889). In 1888, Rhodes obtained a [[Rudd Concession|concession for mining rights]] from King [[Lobengula]] of the Ndebele peoples. He presented this concession to persuade the government of the United Kingdom to grant a [[royal charter]] to the company over Matabeleland, and its subject states such as [[Mashonaland]] as well. Rhodes used this document in 1890 to justify sending the [[Pioneer Column]], a group of Europeans protected by well-armed [[British South Africa Police]] (BSAP) through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury (present-day [[Harare]]), and thereby establish [[Company rule in Rhodesia|company rule]] over the area. In 1893 and 1894, with the help of their new [[Maxim gun|Maxim]] guns, the BSAP would go on to defeat the Ndebele in the [[First Matabele War]]. Rhodes additionally sought permission to negotiate similar concessions covering all territory between the Limpopo River and [[Lake Tanganyika]], then known as "Zambesia". In accordance with the terms of aforementioned concessions and treaties, mass settlement was encouraged, with the British maintaining control over labour as well as over precious metals and other mineral resources.

[[File:Battle of the Shangani.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of the Shangani]] on 25 October 1893]]

In 1895, the BSAC adopted the name [[Rhodesia (region)|"Rhodesia"]] for the territory, in honour of Rhodes. In 1898, "Southern Rhodesia" became the official name for the region south of the [[Zambezi]] river, which later adopted the name "Zimbabwe". The region to the north, administered separately, was later termed [[Northern Rhodesia]] (present-day Zambia). Shortly after the disastrous Rhodes-sponsored [[Jameson Raid]] on the [[South African Republic]], the Ndebele rebelled against white rule, led by their charismatic religious leader, Mlimo. The [[Second Matabele War]] of 1896–1897 lasted in Matabeleland until 1896, when Mlimo was assassinated by American scout [[Frederick Russell Burnham]]. Shona agitators staged unsuccessful revolts (known as ''[[Chimurenga]]'') against company rule during 1896 and 1897.{{citation needed|date= September 2015}} Following these failed insurrections, the Rhodes administration subdued the Ndebele and Shona groups and organised the land with a disproportionate bias favouring Europeans, thus displacing many indigenous peoples.

The United Kingdom annexed Southern Rhodesia on 12 September 1923. Shortly after annexation, on 1 October 1923, the first constitution for the new Colony of Southern Rhodesia came into force. Under the new constitution, Southern Rhodesia became a [[self-governing colony|self-governing]] [[British Empire|British colony]], subsequent to a [[1922 Southern Rhodesian government referendum|1922 referendum]]. Rhodesians of all races served on behalf of the United Kingdom during the two World Wars in the early-20th century. Proportional to the white population, Southern Rhodesia contributed more ''per capita'' to both the [[Southern Rhodesia in World War I|First]] and [[Southern Rhodesia in World War II|Second World Wars]] than any other part of the empire, including Britain.

The [[Land Apportionment Act of 1930|1930 Land Apportionment Act]] restricted black land ownership to certain segments of the country, setting aside large areas solely for the purchase of the white minority. This act, which led to rapidly rising inequality, became the subject of frequent calls for subsequent land reform. In 1953, in the face of African opposition, Britain consolidated the two Rhodesias with [[Nyasaland]] (Malawi) in the ill-fated [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland|Central African Federation]], which Southern Rhodesia essentially dominated. Growing [[African nationalism]] and general dissent, particularly in Nyasaland, persuaded Britain to dissolve the union in 1963, forming three separate divisions. While [[multiracial democracy]] was finally introduced to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Southern Rhodesians of European ancestry continued to enjoy [[Minoritarianism|minority rule]].

Following [[Zambia Independence Act 1964|Zambian independence]] (effective from October 1964), [[Ian Smith]]'s [[Rhodesian Front]] government in Salisbury dropped the designation "Southern" in 1964 (once ''Northern Rhodesia'' had changed its name to ''Zambia'', having the word ''Southern'' before the name ''Rhodesia'' became unnecessary and the country simply became known as ''Rhodesia'' afterwards). Intent on effectively repudiating the recently adopted British policy of "[[no independence before majority rule]]", Smith issued a [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] (UDI) from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965. This marked the first such course taken by a rebel British colony since the [[United States Declaration of Independence|American declaration]] of 1776, which Smith and others indeed claimed provided a suitable precedent to their own actions.

===Declaration of independence and civil war (1965–1980)===

The United Kingdom deemed the Rhodesian declaration an act of rebellion but did not re-establish control by force. The British government petitioned the United Nations for [[economic sanctions|sanctions]] against Rhodesia pending unsuccessful talks with Smith's administration in 1966 and 1968. In December 1966, the organisation complied, imposing the first mandatory trade embargo on an autonomous state. These sanctions were expanded again in 1968.

A civil war ensued when [[Joshua Nkomo]]'s [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) and Robert Mugabe's [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), supported actively by communist powers and neighbouring African nations, initiated [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla operations]] against Rhodesia's predominantly white government. ZAPU was supported by the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Warsaw Pact]] and associated nations such as Cuba, and adopted a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] ideology; ZANU meanwhile aligned itself with [[Maoism]] and the bloc headed by the People's Republic of China. Smith declared Rhodesia a republic in 1970, following the results of a [[1969 Rhodesian constitutional referendum|referendum the previous year]], but this went unrecognised internationally. Meanwhile, Rhodesia's internal conflict intensified, eventually forcing him to open negotiations with the militant communists.

[[File:Lancaster-House-Agreement.png|thumb|right|Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]] signs the Lancaster House Agreement seated next to [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]].]]
In March 1978, Smith reached an accord with three African leaders, led by Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]], who offered to leave the white population comfortably entrenched in exchange for the establishment of a biracial democracy. As a result of the [[Internal Settlement]], [[1979 Rhodesian general election|elections were held in April 1979]], concluding with the [[United African National Council]] (UANC) carrying a majority of parliamentary seats. On 1 June 1979, Muzorewa, the UANC head, became prime minister and the country's name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The Internal Settlement left control of the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]], civil service, judiciary, and a third of parliament seats to whites. On 12 June, the [[United States Senate]] voted to lift economic pressure on the former Rhodesia.

Following the [[1979 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|fifth Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]], held in [[Lusaka]], Zambia, from 1 to 7 August in 1979, the British government invited Muzorewa, Mugabe, and Nkomo to participate in a constitutional conference at [[Lancaster House]]. The purpose of the conference was to discuss and reach an agreement on the terms of an independence constitution, and provide for elections supervised under British authority allowing Zimbabwe Rhodesia to proceed to legal independence. With Lord Carrington, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom, in the chair, these discussions were mounted from 10 September to 15 December in 1979, producing a total of 47 [[plenary session]]s. On 21 December 1979, delegations from every major interest represented reached the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], effectively ending the guerrilla war. Under the terms of the agreement, the country would temporarily revert to British rule until an election could be conducted, after which it would be granted independence under black majority rule.

On 11 December 1979, the Rhodesian House of Assembly voted 90 to nil to revert to British colonial status. With the arrival of [[Christopher Soames]], the new governor on 12 December 1979, Britain formally took control of Zimbabwe Rhodesia as the Colony of Southern Rhodesia. Britain lifted sanctions on 12 December and the United Nations on 16 December. During the [[1980 Southern Rhodesian general election]], Mugabe and the ZANU party secured a landslide victory. On 11 April 1980, Southern Rhodesia became the independent nation of Zimbabwe. [[Charles III|Prince Charles]], as the representative of Britain, formally granted independence to Zimbabwe in a ceremony.

===Independence era (1980–present)===

[[President of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe's first president]] after its independence was [[Canaan Banana]] in what was originally a mainly ceremonial role as [[head of state]]. Mugabe was the country's first prime minister and head of government. In 1980, [[Samora Machel]] told Mugabe that Zimbabwe was the "Jewel of Africa" but added: "Don't tarnish it!".

New names for 32 places were gazetted on 18 April 1982 and by February 1984, there had been 42 changes, which included three rivers (Umniati/[[Munyati River|Munyati]]; Lundi/[[Runde River|Runde]]; Nuanetsi/[[Mwenezi River|Mwenezi]]), and several changes from colonial names (such as Salisbury/Harare; Enkeldoorn/[[Chivhu]]; Essexvale/[[Esigodini]]; Fort Victoria/[[Masvingo]])

Opposition to what was perceived as a Shona takeover immediately erupted around Matabeleland. The Matabele unrest led to what has become known as ''[[Gukurahundi]]'' (Shona: 'the early rain which washes away the [[chaff]] before the spring rains'). The [[5th Brigade (Zimbabwe)|Fifth Brigade]], a North Korean-trained elite unit that reported directly to Mugabe, entered Matabeleland and massacred thousands of civilians accused of supporting "dissidents". Estimates for the number of deaths during the five-year ''Gukurahundi'' campaign ranged from 3,750 to 80,000. Thousands of others were tortured in military internment camps. The campaign officially ended in 1987 after Nkomo and Mugabe reached a unity agreement that merged their respective parties, creating the Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front ([[ZANU–PF]]). [[1990 Zimbabwean general election|Elections in March 1990]] resulted in another victory for Mugabe and the ZANU–PF party, which claimed 117 of the 120 contested seats.

During the 1990s, students, trade unionists, and other workers often demonstrated to express their growing discontent with Mugabe and ZANU–PF party policies. In 1996, civil servants, nurses, and junior doctors went on strike over salary issues. The general health of the population also began to significantly decline; by 1997 an estimated 25% of the population had been infected by HIV in a pandemic that was affecting most of southern Africa. Land redistribution re-emerged as the main issue for the ZANU–PF government around 1997. Despite the existence of a "willing-buyer-willing-seller" land reform programme since the 1980s, the minority white Zimbabwean population continued to hold the majority of the country's most fertile agricultural land.

In 2000, the government pressed ahead with its [[Land reform in Zimbabwe#Fast-track land reform and violence|Fast Track Land Reform]] programme, a policy involving compulsory land acquisition aimed at redistributing land from the minority white population to the majority black population. Confiscations of white farmland, continuous droughts, and a serious drop in external finance and other support led to a sharp decline in agricultural exports, which were traditionally the country's leading export-producing sector. Some 58,000 independent black farmers have since experienced limited success in reviving the gutted cash crop sectors through efforts on a smaller scale.

President Mugabe and the ZANU–PF party leadership found themselves beset by a wide range of international sanctions. In 2002, the nation was suspended from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] due to the reckless farm seizures and blatant [[Electoral fraud|election tampering]]. The following year, Zimbabwean officials voluntarily terminated its Commonwealth membership. In 2001, the United States enacted the [[Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001|Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act]] (ZDERA). It came into effect in 2002 and froze credit to the Zimbabwean government.

By 2003, the country's economy had collapsed. It is estimated that up to a quarter of Zimbabwe's 11 million people had fled the country. Three-quarters of the remaining Zimbabweans were living on less than one U.S. dollar a day. Following [[Zimbabwean parliamentary election, 2005|elections in 2005]], the government initiated "[[Operation Murambatsvina]]", an effort to crack down on illegal markets and slums emerging in towns and cities, leaving a substantial section of urban poor homeless. The Zimbabwean government has described the operation as an attempt to provide decent housing to the population, although according to critics such as [[Amnesty International]], authorities have yet to properly substantiate their claims.

On 29 March 2008, Zimbabwe held a [[Zimbabwean presidential election, 2008|presidential election]] along with a [[Zimbabwean parliamentary election, 2008|parliamentary election]]. The results of this election were withheld for two weeks, after which it was generally acknowledged that the [[Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai]] (MDC-T) had achieved a majority of one seat in the lower house of parliament. In September 2008, a [[2008–2009 Zimbabwean political negotiations|power-sharing agreement]] was reached between [[Morgan Tsvangirai]] and President Mugabe, permitting the former to hold the office of prime minister. Due to ministerial differences between their respective political parties, the agreement was not fully implemented until 13 February 2009. By December 2010, Mugabe was threatening to completely expropriate remaining privately owned companies in Zimbabwe unless "western sanctions" were lifted.

In late 2008, problems in Zimbabwe reached crisis proportions in the areas of living standards, public health (with a major [[Zimbabwean cholera outbreak|cholera outbreak]] in December) and various basic affairs. During this period, NGOs took over from government as a primary provider of food during this period of food insecurity in Zimbabwe. A 2011 survey by [[Freedom House]] suggested that living conditions had improved since the power-sharing agreement. The United Nations [[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] stated in its 2012–2013 planning document that the "humanitarian situation has improved in Zimbabwe since 2009, but conditions remain precarious for many people".

A new constitution approved in the [[Zimbabwean constitutional referendum, 2013]] curtails presidential powers. Mugabe was re-elected president in the July 2013 [[2013 Zimbabwean general election|Zimbabwean general election]] which ''[[The Economist]]'' described as "rigged" and the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' as "stolen". The Movement for Democratic Change alleged massive fraud and tried to seek relief through the courts. In a surprising moment of candour at the ZANU–PF congress in December 2014, President Robert Mugabe accidentally let slip that the opposition had in fact won the contentious 2008 polls by an astounding 73%. After winning the election, the Mugabe ZANU–PF government re-instituted [[one party rule]], doubled the civil service and, according to ''The Economist'', embarked on "misrule and dazzling corruption". A 2017 study conducted by the [[Institute for Security Studies]] (ISS) concluded that due to the deterioration of government and the economy "the government encourages corruption to make up for its inability to fund its own institutions" with widespread and informal police roadblocks to issue fines to travellers being one manifestation of this.

In July 2016, [[2016 Zimbabwe protests|nationwide protests]] took place regarding the economic collapse in the country. In November 2017, [[2017 Zimbabwean coup d'état|the army led a coup d'état]] following the dismissal of Vice-president [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]], placing Mugabe under house arrest. The army denied that their actions constituted a [[coup]].  On 19 November 2017, ZANU–PF sacked Robert Mugabe as party leader and appointed former Vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa in his place. On 21 November 2017, Mugabe tendered his resignation prior to impeachment proceedings being completed. Although under the [[Constitution of Zimbabwe]] Mugabe should be succeeded by Vice-president [[Phelekezela Mphoko]], a supporter of [[Grace Mugabe]], ZANU–PF [[Chief Whip|chief whip]] Lovemore Matuke stated to the [[Reuters]] news agency that Mnangagwa would be appointed as president.

On 30 July 2018, Zimbabwe held its [[2018 Zimbabwean general election|general elections]], which were won by the ZANU-PF party led by Mnangagwa. [[Nelson Chamisa]] who was leading the main opposition party [[MDC Alliance]] contested the election results claiming voter fraud, and subsequently filed a petition to the Constitution Court of Zimbabwe. The court confirmed Mnangagwa's victory, making him the newly elected president after Mugabe.

In December 2017, the website Zimbabwe News, calculating the cost of the Mugabe era using various statistics, said that at the time of independence in 1980, the country was growing economically at about five per cent a year, and had done so for quite a long time. If this rate of growth had been maintained for the next 37 years, Zimbabwe would have, in 2016, a GDP of US$52 billion. Instead it had a formal sector GDP of only US$14 billion, a cost of US$38 billion in lost growth. The population growth in 1980 was among the highest in Africa at about 3.5 per cent per annum, doubling every 21 years. Had this growth been maintained, the population would have been 31 million. Instead, as of 2018, it is about 13 million. The discrepancies were believed to be partly caused by death from starvation and disease, and partly due to decreased fertility. The life expectancy has halved, and deaths from politically motivated violence sponsored by the government exceed 200,000 since 1980. The Mugabe government has directly or indirectly caused the deaths of at least three million Zimbabweans in 37 years. According to the [[World Food Programme]], over two million people are facing starvation because of the recent droughts the country is going through.

In 2018, President Mnangagwa announced that his government would seek to rejoin [[the Commonwealth]], which is as of 2023 conducting a fact-finding mission prior to asking the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] to issue a recommendation.

In August 2023, President Emmerson Mnangagwa won a second  term in an outcome of the [[2023 Zimbabwean general election|election]] rejected by the opposition and questioned by observers. In September 2023, Zimbabwe signed control over almost 20% of the country's land to the [[carbon credit|carbon offset]] company [[Blue Carbon (company)|Blue Carbon]].
