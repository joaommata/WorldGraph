==History==
{{Main|History of Monaco}}
Monaco was first mentioned by the Greek historian [[Hecataeus of Miletus]], who referred to it as "''Monoikos'', a [[Ligures|Ligurian]] town". [[Strabo]] referred to it as ''Monoikon [[wikt:λιμήν|limen]]'', explaining that ''Monoikos'' (Greek for "the solitary one") was another name for [[Heracles]], who had a temple here; it is likely, however, that it is in fact an alteration of an older Ligurian name.

In 1191, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] granted Monaco to the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] in return for cracking down on pirates. By the early 1200s, the Genoese had built a castle on the rock and were utilizing the port. An ousted branch of a Genoese family, the [[House of Grimaldi|Grimaldis]], captured it in 1297 by posing as monks, but then had to contest it for a century before gaining official control. Though the [[Republic of Genoa]] would last until the 19th century, it allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco. Likewise, both France and Spain left it alone for hundreds of years due to agreements with either of them, especially for defense. France annexed it in the [[French Revolution]] at the end of the 18th century, but after the defeat of Napoleon it was put under the care of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia (1720–1861)|Kingdom of Sardinia]].

In the 19th century, when [[Sardinia]] became a part of Italy, the region came under French influence but France allowed it to remain independent and it escaped being incorporated into Italy. However, it shrank considerably when it traded two nearby towns in exchange for sovereignty from France. Monaco relied on tourism from the late 19th century to remain financially solvent, and it was at this time the famous casino and hotels were established. Monaco was overrun by the [[Axis powers]] in the 1940s during the Second World War and for a short time was administered by Italy, then [[Nazi Germany]], before being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it resulted in the deportation of the [[Jews|Jewish]] population and execution of several [[French Resistance]] members from Monaco. Since then Monaco has been independent. It has taken some steps towards [[Microstates and the European Union|integration with the European Union]].

===Arrival of the Grimaldi family===

Following a grant of land from Emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] in 1191, Monaco was refounded in 1215 as a colony of Genoa. Monaco was first ruled by a member of the House of Grimaldi in 1297, when [[François Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]], known as "''Malizia''" (translated from Italian either as "The Malicious One" or "The Cunning One"), and his men captured the fortress protecting the [[Rock of Monaco]] while dressed as [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] [[friar]]s – a ''monaco'' in Italian – although this is a coincidence as the area was already known by this name.

Francesco was evicted a few years later by the Genoese forces, and the struggle over "the Rock" continued for another century. The Grimaldi family was Genoese and the struggle was something of a family feud. The Genoese engaged in other conflicts, and in the late 1300s Genoa lost Monaco after fighting the [[Crown of Aragon]] over [[Corsica]]. [[Aragon]] eventually became part of a united Spain, and other parts of the land grant came to be integrated piecemeal into other states. Between 1346 and 1355, Monaco annexed the towns of [[Menton]] and [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]], increasing its territory by almost ten times.

===1400–1800===

In 1419, the Grimaldi family purchased Monaco from the Crown of Aragon and became the official and undisputed rulers of "the Rock of Monaco". In 1612, [[Honoré II]] began to style himself "Prince" of Monaco. In the 1630s, he sought French protection against the Spanish forces and, in 1642, was received at the court of [[Louis XIII]] as a "duc et pair étranger".

The princes of Monaco became vassals of the French kings while at the same time remaining sovereign princes. Though successive princes and their families spent most of their lives in [[Paris]], and intermarried with French and Italian nobilities, the House of Grimaldi is of Genoese origin.  The principality continued its existence as a protectorate of France until the [[French Revolution]].

===19th century===

In 1793, Revolutionary forces captured Monaco and until 1814 it was occupied by the French (in this period much of Europe had been overrun by the French armies under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte). The principality was reestablished in 1814 under the Grimaldis. It was designated a protectorate of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia (1720–1861)|Kingdom of Sardinia]] by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. Monaco remained in this position until 1860 when, by the [[Treaty of Turin (1860)|Treaty of Turin]], the Sardinian forces pulled out of the principality; the surrounding [[County of Nice]] (as well as [[Savoy]]) was ceded to France. Monaco became a French protectorate once again. Italian was the official language in Monaco until 1860, when it was replaced by French.

Before this time there was unrest in [[Menton]] and [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]], where the townspeople had become weary of heavy taxation by the Grimaldi family. They declared their independence as the [[Free Cities of Menton and Roquebrune]], hoping for annexation by Sardinia. France protested. The unrest continued until [[Charles III, Prince of Monaco|Charles III of Monaco]] gave up his claim to the two mainland towns (some 95% of the principality at the time) that had been ruled by the Grimaldi family for over 500 years.

These were ceded to France in return for 4,100,000 francs. The transfer and Monaco's sovereignty were recognised by the [[Franco-Monégasque Treaties|Franco-Monégasque Treaty]] of 1861. In 1869, the principality stopped collecting income tax from its residents — an indulgence the Grimaldi family could afford to entertain thanks solely to the extraordinary success of the casino. This made Monaco a playground for the rich and a favoured place for them to live.

===20th century===

Until the [[Monégasque Revolution]] of 1910 forced the adoption of the 1911 [[Constitution of Monaco]], the [[List of rulers of Monaco|princes of Monaco]] were [[Absolute monarchy|absolute rulers]]. The new constitution slightly reduced the autocratic rule of the Grimaldi family and [[Albert I, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert I]] suspended it during the First World War.

In July 1918, a new [[Franco-Monégasque Treaties|Franco-Monégasque Treaty]] was signed, providing for limited French protection over Monaco. The treaty, endorsed in 1919 by the [[Treaty of Versailles]], established that Monégasque international policy would be aligned with French political, military and economic interests. It also resolved the [[Monaco succession crisis of 1918|Monaco succession crisis]].

In 1943, the Italian Army [[The invasion and Occupation of Monaco during World War II|invaded and occupied Monaco]], forming a [[Fascism|fascist]] administration. In September 1943, after Mussolini's fall from power, the German [[Wehrmacht]] occupied Italy and Monaco, and the Nazi deportation of the Jewish population began. [[René Blum (ballet)|René Blum]], the prominent French Jew who founded the Ballet de l'Opéra in Monte Carlo, was arrested in his [[Paris]] home and held in the [[Drancy internment camp|Drancy]] deportation camp outside the French capital before being transported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], where he was later murdered. Blum's colleague [[Raoul Gunsbourg]], the director of the [[Opéra de Monte-Carlo]], helped by the [[French Resistance]], escaped arrest and fled to [[Switzerland]]. In August 1944, the Germans executed René Borghini, Joseph-Henri Lajoux and Esther Poggio, who were Resistance leaders.

[[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Rainier III]], succeeded to the throne on the death of his grandfather, Prince [[Louis II, Prince of Monaco|Louis II]], in 1949, and ruled until 2005. On 19 April 1956, Prince Rainier married the American actress [[Grace Kelly]], an event that was widely televised and covered in the popular press, focusing the world's attention on the tiny principality.

A 1962 amendment to the constitution abolished capital punishment, provided for [[women's suffrage]] and established a [[Supreme Court of Monaco]] to guarantee fundamental liberties. In 1963, a crisis developed when [[Charles de Gaulle]] blockaded Monaco, angered by its status as a tax haven for wealthy French citizens.

In 1993, the Principality of Monaco became a member of the [[United Nations]], with full voting rights.

===21st century===

In 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco specified that, should there be no heirs to carry on the Grimaldi dynasty, the principality would still remain an independent nation rather than revert to France. Monaco's military defense is still the responsibility of France.

On 31 March 2005, [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Rainier III]], who was too ill to exercise his duties, relinquished them to his only son and heir, Albert. He died six days later, after a reign of 56 years, with his son succeeding him as [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Albert II]], [[Sovereign Prince of Monaco]]. Following a period of official mourning, Prince Albert II formally assumed the princely crown on 12 July 2005, in a celebration that began with a solemn Mass at [[Saint Nicholas Cathedral, Monaco|Saint Nicholas Cathedral]], where his father had been buried three months earlier. His accession to the Monégasque throne was a two-step event with a further ceremony, drawing heads of state for an elaborate reception, held on 18 November 2005, at the historic [[Prince's Palace of Monaco|Prince's Palace]] in [[Monaco-Ville]]. On 27 August 2015, Albert II apologised for Monaco's role during World War II in facilitating the deportation of a total of 90 Jews and resistance fighters, of whom only nine survived. "We committed the irreparable in handing over to the neighbouring authorities women, men and a child who had taken refuge with us to escape the persecutions they had suffered in France," Albert said at a ceremony in which a monument to the victims was unveiled at the Monaco cemetery. "In distress, they came specifically to take shelter with us, thinking they would find neutrality."

In 2015, Monaco unanimously approved a modest [[Land reclamation in Monaco|land reclamation]] expansion intended primarily to accommodate desperately needed housing and a small green/park area. Monaco had previously considered an expansion in 2008, but had called it off. The plan is for about six [[hectare]]s (15 acres) of apartment buildings, parks, shops and offices to a land value of about 1 billion [[euro]]s. The development will be adjacent to the [[Larvotto]] district and also will include a small marina. There were four main proposals, and the final mix of use will be finalised as the development progresses. The name for the new district is [[Le Portier|Anse du Portier]].

On 29 February 2020, Monaco announced its first case of [[COVID-19]], a man who was admitted to the [[Princess Grace Hospital Centre]] then transferred to [[Nice University]] Hospital in France.

On 3 September 2020, the first Monégasque satellite, OSM-1 CICERO, was launched into space from [[French Guiana]] aboard a [[Vega (rocket)|Vega rocket]]. The satellite was built in Monaco by Orbital Solutions Monaco.
