The [[Apidima Cave]] in [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]], in southern Greece, has been suggested to contain the oldest remains of [[early modern humans]] outside of Africa, dated to 200,000 years ago. However others suggest the remains represent [[archaic humans]]. All three stages of the [[Stone Age]] are represented in Greece, for example in the [[Franchthi Cave]]. [[Neolithic]] settlements in Greece, dating from the 7th millennium BC, are the oldest in Europe, as Greece lies on the route by which farming spread from the [[Near East]] to Europe.

Greece is home to the first advanced civilisations in Europe and is often considered the birthplace of Western civilisation.{{Sfn|Duchesne|2011|p=297: "The list of books which have celebrated Greece as the "cradle" of the West is endless; two more examples are Charles Freeman's The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World (1999) and Bruce Thornton's Greek Ways: How the Greeks Created Western Civilization (2000)"}}{{Sfn|Bottici|Challand|2013|p=88: "The reason why even such a sophisticated historian as Pagden can do it is that the idea that Greece is the cradle of civilisation is so much rooted in western minds and school curricula as to be taken for granted."}} The earliest of them was the [[Cycladic culture]] which flourished on the islands of the [[Aegean Sea]], starting around 3200 BC, and produced an abundance of folded-arm and other [[Cycladic art|marble figurines]]. From {{circa|3100}} BC to 1100 BC, [[Crete]], a major cultural and economic centre, was home to the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan civilisation]] known for its [[Minoan art|colourful art]], [[Minoan religion|religious figurines]], and [[Minoan palaces|monumental palaces]]. The Minoans wrote [[Minoan language|their undeciphered language]] using scripts known as [[Linear A]] and [[Cretan hieroglyphs]].{{Sfn|Tomas|2012|pp=340-351}}{{Sfn|Salgarella|2022}} On the mainland, the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilisation]] developed around 1750 BC and lasted until {{circa|1100}} BC.{{Sfn|Knodell|2021|p=7}} The Mycenaeans possessed an [[Military of Mycenaean Greece|advanced military]] and built [[Cyclopean masonry|large fortifications]].

===Ancient Greece===

{{see also|Greek Dark Ages|Archaic Greece|Classical Greece|Hellenistic Greece}}
[[File:Greek Colonization Archaic Period.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Greek territories and colonies during the Archaic period (750–550 BC)]]
The collapse of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilisation]] ushered in the [[Greek Dark Ages]], from which written records are absent. The end of the Dark Ages is traditionally dated to 776 BC, the year of the first [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. The ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the foundational texts of [[Western literature]], are believed to have been composed by [[Homer]] in the 7th or 8th centuries BC. [[Ancient Greek literature|Poetry]] shaped beliefs to the [[Greek mythology|Olympian gods]], but [[ancient Greek religion]] had no priestly class or systematic dogmas and encompassed other currents, such as popular cults, like [[Cult of Dionysus|that of Dionysus]], [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]] and [[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]. At this time there emerged numerous kingdoms and [[city-state]]s across the Greek peninsula, some of which went on to establish [[Greek colonisation|numerous colonies]] in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], the shores of the [[Black Sea]], and [[southern Italy]] (also known as [[Magna Grecia]]. The Greek city-states reached great prosperity that resulted in an unprecedented cultural boom, that of [[classical Greece]], expressed in [[Architecture of ancient Greece|architecture]], [[Theatre of ancient Greece|drama]], [[Ancient Greek science|science]], [[Greek mathematics|mathematics]] and [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophy]]. In 508 BC, [[Cleisthenes]] instituted the world's first [[Athenian democracy|democratic]] system of government in [[Athens]].

[[File:The Parthenon in Athens.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]] on the [[Acropolis of Athens]], icon of classical Greece]]

By 500 BC, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] controlled the Greek city states in Asia Minor and Macedonia. Attempts by Greek city-states of Asia Minor to overthrow Persian rule [[Ionian Revolt|failed]], and Persia [[First Persian invasion of Greece|invaded the states of mainland Greece]] in 492 BC, but was forced to withdraw after defeat at the [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490 BC. In response, the Greek city-states formed the Hellenic League in 481 BC, led by [[Sparta]], which was the first recorded union of Greek states since the mythical union of the [[Trojan War]]. The [[second Persian invasion of Greece]] was decisively defeated in 480&ndash;479 BC, at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] and [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]], marking the eventual withdrawal of the Persians from all their European territories. The Greek victories in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] are a pivotal moment in history, as the 50 years of peace afterwards are known as the [[Fifth-century Athens|Golden Age of Athens]], a seminal period that laid many foundations of Western civilisation. Lack of political unity resulted in frequent conflict between Greek states. The most devastating intra-Greek war was the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431–404 BC), which marked the demise of the [[Delian League|Athenian Empire]] and the emergence of [[Spartan hegemony|Spartan]] and later [[Theban hegemony]].{{Sfn|Worthington|2015|pp=42–43}} Weakened by constant wars among them during the 4th century BC, the Greek ''poleis'' were subjugated to the [[Rise of Macedon|rising power]] of the [[kingdom of Macedon]] under king [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] into an alliance known as the [[League of Corinth|Hellenic League]].

After Philip's assassination in 336 BC, his son and [[king of Macedon]], [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], established himself as leader of a [[Panhellenism|Panhellenic]] [[Wars of Alexander the Great|campaign]] against the [[Persian Empire]] and abolished it. Undefeated in battle, he marched, until his untimely death in 323 BC, to the banks of the [[Indus]]. Alexander's empire fragmented, inaugurating the [[Hellenistic period]]. After [[Wars of the Diadochi|fierce conflict]] amongst themselves, the [[Diadochi|generals that succeeded Alexander and their successors]] founded large personal kingdoms in the areas he had conquered, such as that of the [[Ptolemies]] in [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egypt]] and of the [[Seleucids]] in [[Syria (region)|Syria]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Iranian plateau|Iran]]. The newly founded ''poleis'' of these kingdoms, such as [[Alexandria]] and [[Antioch]], were settled by Greeks as members of a ruling minority. As a result, during the centuries that followed a vernacular form of [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]], known as ''[[Koine Greek|koine]]'', and Greek culture was [[Hellenization|spread]], while the Greeks [[Hellenistic religion|adopted Eastern deities and cults]]. Greek science, technology, and mathematics reached their peak during the Hellenistic period. Aspiring to maintain their autonomy and independence from the [[Antigonid dynasty|Antigonid kings]] of the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], many ''poleis'' of Greece united in ''koina'' or ''[[sympoliteia]]i'' i.e. federations, while after the establishment of economic relations with the East, a stratum of wealthy ''[[Euergetism|euergetai]]'' dominated their internal life.

=== Roman province (146 BC – 4th century AD) ===

[[File:Athen Odeon Herodes Atticus BW 2017-10-09 13-12-44.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Odeon of Herodes Atticus]] in Athens, built in 161 AD]]
In 280 BC [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] campaigned in Italy against the Romans in order to help [[Taranto#History|Tarentum]]. From about 200 BC the [[Ancient Rome|Roman Republic]] became increasingly involved in Greek affairs and engaged in a [[Macedonian Wars|series of wars with Macedon]]. Macedon's defeat at the [[Battle of Pydna]] in 168 BC signalled the end of [[Antigonid dynasty|Antigonid]] power. In 146 BC, Macedonia was annexed as a province by Rome, and the rest of Greece became a Roman protectorate. The process was completed in 27 BC, when emperor [[Augustus]] annexed the rest of Greece and constituted it as the [[senatorial province]] of [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]].

Greek-speaking communities of the Hellenised East were instrumental in the spread of Christianity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and Christianity's early leaders and writers were mostly Greek-speaking, though not from Greece itself. The [[New Testament]] was written in Greek, and some sections attest to the importance of churches in Greece in [[early Christianity]]. Nevertheless, much of Greece clung to paganism, and ancient Greek religious practices were still in vogue in the late 4th century AD, when they were outlawed by the Roman emperor [[Theodosius I]] in 391–392. The last recorded Olympic games were held in 393, and many temples were destroyed or damaged in the century that followed. The closure of the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] Academy of Athens by Emperor Justinian in 529 is considered the end of antiquity, although there is evidence that the academy continued.

=== Medieval period (4th–15th centuries) ===
{{Main|Byzantine Greece|Frankokratia}}
[[File:Map Byzantine Empire 1025-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|The Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire after the death of [[Basil II]] in 1025]]
[[File:Καστροπολιτεια μονεμβασιας.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|View of the medieval fortress city of [[Monemvasia]]]]
The Roman Empire in the east, following the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century, is known as the [[Byzantine Empire]], but called "Kingdom of the Romans" in its own time. With its capital in [[Constantinople]], its language and culture were Greek and its religion was predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christian]].

The Empire's Balkan territories, including Greece, suffered from the dislocation of [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]]; raids by [[Goths]] and [[Huns]] in the 4th and 5th centuries and the [[South Slavs|Slavic]] invasion in the 7th century resulted in a collapse in imperial authority in the Greek [[peninsula]].{{Sfn | Fine | 1991 | pp = 35–36}} The imperial government retained control of only the islands and coastal areas, particularly the populated walled cities such as Athens, Corinth and Thessalonica.{{Sfn | Fine | 1991 | pp = 35–36}}{{Sfn | Fine | 1991 | pp = 63–66}} However, the view that Greece underwent decline, fragmentation and depopulation is considered outdated, as cities show institutional continuity and prosperity between the 4th and 6th centuries. In the early 6th century, Greece had approximately 80 cities according to the [[Synecdemus|Synekdemos]] chronicle, and the 4th to the 7th century is considered one of high prosperity.

Until the 8th century almost all of modern Greece was under the jurisdiction of the [[Holy See]] of [[Rome]]. Byzantine [[Emperor Leo III]] moved the border of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] westward and northward in the 8th century. The Byzantine recovery of lost provinces during the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]] began in the 8th century and most of the Greek peninsula came under imperial control again.{{Sfn|Fine|1991|pp=79–83}} This process was facilitated by a large influx of Greeks from Sicily and Asia Minor to the Greek peninsula, while many Slavs were captured and re-settled in Asia Minor.{{Sfn|Fine|1991|pp=63–66}} During the 11th and 12th centuries the return of stability resulted in the Greek peninsula benefiting from economic growth.

Following the [[Fourth Crusade]] and fall of Constantinople to the "[[Latin Empire|Latins]]" in 1204, mainland Greece was split between the Greek [[Despotate of Epirus#Foundation|Despotate of Epirus]] and [[Kingdom of France|French]] rule (the ''[[Frankokratia]]''). The re-establishment of the imperial capital in Constantinople in 1261 was accompanied by the empire's recovery of much of the Greek peninsula, while the islands remained under Genoese and Venetian control.

In the 14th century much of the Greek peninsula was lost by the Byzantine Empire to the [[Serbs]] and then the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. Constantinople fell to the Ottomans in 1453 and by 1460, Ottoman conquest of mainland Greece was complete.

=== Venetian possessions and Ottoman rule (15th century – 1821) ===
{{Main|Ottoman Greece|Stato da Màr}}
{{See also|Kingdom of Candia|Venetian rule in the Ionian Islands}}During the 15th to early 19th centuries, while much of [[Geography of Greece|mainland Greece]] and the [[Aegean Islands|Aegean islands]] fell under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control, [[Venice]] retained several key territories. Notably, [[Crete]] remained under [[Venetian rule in the Ionian Islands|Venetian rule]] until 1669, and the [[Ionian Islands]] were governed by Venice until 1797. These islands were subsequently ceded to [[First French Empire|French]] and later [[British Empire|British]] control.{{sfn|Clogg|1992|p=10}} While some Greeks in the Ionian islands and [[Constantinople]] lived in prosperity, and Greeks of Constantinople ([[Phanariots]]) achieved power within the Ottoman administration,{{sfn|Clogg|1992|p=23}} much of Greece suffered the economic consequences of Ottoman conquest. Heavy taxes were enforced, and in later years the Ottoman Empire enacted a policy of creation of hereditary estates, effectively turning the rural Greek populations into [[serfdom|serfs]], while the Ottoman conquest had cut Greece off from European historical developments.{{Sfn|Clogg|1992|pages=3}}

The [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] were considered by the Ottoman governments as the ruling authorities of the entire [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] population of the Ottoman Empire, whether ethnically Greek or not. Although the Ottoman state did not force non-Muslims to convert to [[Islam]], Christians faced discrimination. Discrimination, particularly when combined with harsh treatment by local Ottoman authorities, led to conversions to Islam, if only superficially. In the 19th century, many "[[Crypto-Christianity|crypto-Christians]]" returned to their old religious allegiance.{{sfn|Clogg|1992|p=14}}

[[File:White Tower and Beach front.jpg|thumb|The [[White Tower of Thessaloniki]], one of the best-known Ottoman structures remaining in Greece]]

The nature of Ottoman administration of Greece varied, though it was invariably arbitrary and often harsh.{{Sfn|Clogg|1992|p=14}} Some cities had governors appointed by the [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]], while others, like Athens, were self-governed municipalities. Mountainous regions in the interior and many islands remained effectively autonomous from the central Ottoman state for centuries. The 16th and 17th centuries are regarded as a "dark age" in Greek history.{{Sfn|Clogg|1992|page=15}} However, prior to the Greek Revolution of 1821, there had been wars which saw Greeks fight against the Ottomans, such as the Greek participation in the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571,{{sfn|Clogg|1992|p=15}} the [[Morean War]] of 1684–1699, and the [[Russian Empire|Russian]]-instigated [[Orlov revolt]] in 1770. These uprisings were put down by the Ottomans with great bloodshed. Many Greeks were conscripted as Ottoman subjects to serve in the Ottoman army and especially the navy, while the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, responsible for the Orthodox, remained in general loyal to the Empire.

==== Greek War of Independence (1821–1832) ====
{{Main|Greek War of Independence}}
[[File:The sortie of Messologhi by Theodore Vryzakis.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|''The sortie (exodus) of [[Messolonghi]]'', depicting the [[third siege of Missolonghi]], painted by [[Theodoros Vryzakis]]]]
In the 18th century, Greek merchants came to dominate trade within the Ottoman Empire, established communities throughout the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and Europe,{{Sfn|Clogg|1992|pages=21, 23}} and used their wealth to fund educational activities that brought younger generations into contact with Western ideas.{{Sfn|Clogg|1992|page=25, 26, 27}} In the 18th century, an increase in learning during the [[Modern Greek Enlightenment]] led to the emergence among [[Westernization|Westernised]] Greek-speaking [[elite]]s of the [[Greek nationalism|notion of a Greek nation]]. A secret organisation formed in this milieu was the [[Filiki Eteria]], in 1814. They engaged [[traditional society|traditional strata]] of the Greek Orthodox world in their [[liberal nationalism|liberal nationalist]] cause.

The first revolt began on 6 March 1821 in the [[Danubian Principalities]], but was put down by the Ottomans. This spurred the Greeks of the [[Peloponnese]] and on 17 March the [[Maniots]] declared war on the Ottomans. By October 1821 the Greeks had captured [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]]. There were revolts in Crete, [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Central Greece (geographic region)|Central Greece]], which were suppressed. In 1822 and 1824 the Turks and Egyptians ravaged the islands, committing [[Massacres during the Greek Revolution|massacres]]. This galvanised opinion in western Europe in favour of the Greeks. The [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] negotiated with [[Mehmet Ali of Egypt]], who agreed to send his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] with an army, in return for territorial gain. By the end of 1825, most of the Peloponnese was under Egyptian control. Three [[great powers]], [[Bourbon Restoration in France|France]], [[Russian Empire]], and the [[United Kingdom]], each sent a navy. The allied fleet destroyed the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet at the [[Battle of Navarino]], and the Greeks captured Central Greece by 1828. The [[First Hellenic Republic|nascent Greek state]] was recognised under the [[London Protocol (1830)|London Protocol]] in 1830.

====Kingdom of Greece====
{{Main|Kingdom of Greece}}
[[File:Peter von Hess - The Entry of King Othon of Greece in Athens - WGA11387.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|''[[The Entry of King Otto of Greece into Athens]]'', painted by [[Peter von Hess]] in 1839]]

In 1827, [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], was chosen by the [[Third National Assembly at Troezen]] as the first governor of the [[First Hellenic Republic]]. Kapodistrias established state, economic and military institutions. Tensions appeared between him and local interests and, following his assassination in 1831 and the [[London Conference of 1832]], Britain, France and Russia installed Bavarian Prince [[Otto of Greece|Otto von Wittelsbach]] as [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|monarch]]. Otto's reign was [[despotism|despotic]], and in its first 11 years of independence Greece was ruled by a Bavarian oligarchy led by [[Josef Ludwig von Armansperg]] and, later, by Otto himself, as King and Premier. In 1843 an [[3 September 1843 Revolution|uprising]] forced Otto to grant a [[Greek Constitution of 1844|constitution]] and [[Hellenic Parliament|representative assembly]].

Despite the [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]] of Otto's reign, it proved instrumental in developing institutions which are still the bedrock of Greek administration and education. Reforms were taken in education, maritime and postal communications, effective civil administration and the [[legal code]].{{sfn|Great Greek Encyclopedia|page=50–51}} [[Historical revisionism]] took the form of de-[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantinification]] and de-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottomanisation]], in favour of promoting Ancient Greek heritage.{{sfn|Roudometof|2001|pp=101–113}} The capital was moved from [[Nafplio]], where it had been since 1829, to [[Athens]], then a smaller town. The [[Church of Greece]] was established as Greece's [[national church]] and 25 March, the day of [[Annunciation]], was chosen as the anniversary of the [[Greek War of Independence]] to reinforce the link between Greek identity and [[Orthodoxy]].{{sfn|Roudometof|2001|pp=101–113}}

Otto [[23 October 1862 Revolution|was deposed]] in 1862 because of the Bavarian-dominated government, heavy taxation, and a failed attempt to annex Crete from the Ottomans. In 1875 [[parliamentary majority]] as a requirement for government was introduced, curbing the power of the monarchy to appoint [[minority government]]s. Corruption, coupled with increased spending to fund infrastructure like the [[Corinth Canal]], overtaxed the weak economy and forced the declaration of [[Sovereign default|public insolvency]] in 1893.

[[File:Map Greece expansion 1832-1947-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.15 |The territorial evolution of the [[Kingdom of Greece]] from 1832 to 1947]]

Greeks were united, however, in their determination to liberate the [[regions of ancient Greece|Hellenic lands]] under Ottoman rule; the [[Cretan Revolt (1866–1869)]] had raised nationalist fervour. When war broke out between [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russia and the Ottomans in 1877]], Greek sentiment rallied to Russia, but Greece was too poor and concerned about British intervention, to enter the war. Greeks in Crete continued to stage revolts, and in 1897, the Greek government, bowing to popular pressure, declared war on the Ottomans. In the ensuing [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]], the badly trained and equipped Greek army was defeated. Through the intervention of the Great Powers, however, Greece lost little territory, while Crete was established as an [[Cretan State|autonomous state]] under [[Prince George of Greece]]. With state coffers empty, fiscal policy came under [[International Financial Control]]. The government, aiming to quell [[Komitadjis]] and detach the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia|Slavophone peasants of the region]] from [[Bulgarian Macedonians|Bulgarian]] influence, sponsored a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign in Ottoman-ruled [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], known as the [[Macedonian Struggle]], which ended with the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908.

==== Expansion, disaster, and reconstruction ====
{{See also|Greece in the Balkan Wars|Greece during World War I|National Schism|Second Hellenic Republic}}
Amidst dissatisfaction with the seeming inertia and unattainability of [[Megali Idea|national aspirations]], military officers organised a [[Goudi coup|coup]] in 1909 and called on [[Cretan State|Cretan]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], who conveyed a vision of national regeneration. After winning [[Greek legislative election, August 1910|two]] [[Greek legislative election, November 1910|elections]] and becoming prime minister in 1910,{{sfn|Mazower|1992|pp=886, 890–893, 895–900, 904}} Venizelos initiated fiscal, social, and [[Greek Constitution of 1911|constitutional reforms]], reorganised the military, made Greece a member of the [[Balkan League]], and led it through the [[Balkan Wars]]. By 1913, Greece's territory and population had doubled, annexing Crete, [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]. The struggle between [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] and charismatic Venizelos over foreign policy on the eve of the First World War dominated politics and divided the country into [[National Schism|two opposing groups]]. During parts of the war, Greece had two governments: A royalist [[Central Powers|pro-German]] one in [[Athens]] and a [[Venizelism|Venizelist]] pro-[[Triple Entente|Entente]] one in [[Thessaloniki]]. They united in 1917, when Greece entered the war on the side of the Entente.

After the war, Greece attempted expansion into [[Asia Minor]], a region with a large native Greek population, but was defeated in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]], contributing to a flight of [[Ottoman Greeks|Asia Minor Greeks]]. These events overlapped, happening during the [[Greek genocide]] (1914–22), when Ottoman and Turkish officials contributed to the death of several hundred thousand Asia Minor Greeks, along with similar numbers of [[Assyrian genocide|Assyrians]] and a larger number of [[Armenian genocide|Armenians]]. The resultant Greek exodus from Asia Minor was made permanent, and expanded, in an official [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], as part of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] which ended the war. The following era was marked by instability, as over 1.5&nbsp;million propertyless Greek refugees from Turkey (some of whom could not speak Greek) had to be integrated into Greek society. The refugees made a dramatic population boost, as they were more than a quarter of Greece's prior population.

Following the catastrophic events in Asia Minor, the monarchy was abolished [[Greek republic referendum, 1924|via a referendum]] in 1924 and the [[Second Hellenic Republic]] declared. In 1935, a royalist general-turned-politician [[Georgios Kondylis]] took power after a coup and abolished the republic, holding [[Greek monarchy referendum, 1935|a rigged referendum]], after which [[George II of Greece|King George II]] was restored to the throne.

==== Dictatorship, World War II, and reconstruction ====
{{See also|4th of August Regime|Balkans campaign (World War II){{!}}Balkans campaign|Axis occupation of Greece|Hellenic State (1941–1944){{!}}Hellenic State|Greek Civil War}}

An agreement between Prime Minister [[Ioannis Metaxas]] and George II followed in 1936, which installed Metaxas as head of a dictatorship known as the [[4th of August Regime]], inaugurating [[authoritarianism|authoritarian rule]] that would last until 1974. Greece remained on good terms with Britain and was not allied with the [[Axis powers|Axis]].

[[File:Αθηναίοι γιορτάζουν την απελευθέρωση της πόλης τους, Οκτώβριος 1944.jpg|thumb|right|People in [[Athens]] celebrate the liberation from the Axis powers, October 1944. Postwar Greece would soon experience a [[Greek civil war|civil war]] and political polarisation]]

In October 1940, [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] demanded the surrender of Greece, but it [[Ohi Day|refused]], and, in the [[Greco-Italian War]], Greece repelled Italian forces into Albania.{{sfn|Fafalios|Hadjipateras|1995|p=157}} French general [[Charles de Gaulle]] praised the fierceness of the Greek resistance, but the country fell to urgently dispatched [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces during the [[Battle of Greece]]. The Nazis proceeded to administer Athens and Thessaloniki, while other regions were given to Fascist Italy and Bulgaria. Over 100,000 civilians died of starvation during the winter of 1941–42, tens of thousands more died because of reprisals by Nazis and [[Collaboration with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy#Greece|collaborators]], the economy was ruined, and most [[History of the Jews in Greece|Greek Jews]] (tens of thousands) were deported and murdered in Nazi concentration camps.{{sfn|Mazower|2001|p=155}} The [[Greek Resistance]], one of the most effective resistance movements, fought against the Nazis. The German occupiers committed [[German war crimes#Greece|atrocities, mass executions, and wholesale slaughter of civilians and destruction of towns and villages]] in reprisals. Hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost 1 million Greeks left homeless.{{sfn|Mazower|2001|p=155}} The Germans executed around 21,000 Greeks, the Bulgarians 40,000, and the Italians 9,000.<!-- Does this include the 60,000-70,000 Jews mentioned at [[History_of_the_Jews_in_Greece#World_War_II,_Resistance_and_the_Holocaust]] ?-->

Following liberation, Greece annexed the [[Dodecanese Islands]] from Italy and regained [[Western Thrace]] from Bulgaria. The country descended into a [[Greek Civil War|civil war]] between [[Communism|communist]] forces and the anti-communist Greek government, which lasted until 1949, with the latter's victory. The conflict, one of the earliest struggles of the [[Cold War]], resulted in further economic devastation, population displacement and political polarisation for the next thirty years.{{sfn|Mazower|2016|p={{page needed|date=September 2024}}}}

Although post-war was characterised by social strife and marginalisation of the left, Greece experienced [[Greek economic miracle|rapid economic growth]] and recovery, propelled in part by the U.S. [[Marshall Plan]]. In 1952, Greece joined [[NATO]], reinforcing its membership in the [[Western Bloc]] of the Cold War.

[[Constantine II of Greece|King Constantine II]]'s quick acceptance of [[George Papandreou (senior)|George Papandreou]]'s informal resignation as prime minister in 1965 prompted an era of political turbulence that was later called [[Iouliana]], and culminated in a coup in 1967 by the [[Greek junta]], led by [[Georgios Papadopoulos]]. Civil rights were suspended, political repression intensified, and human rights abuses, including torture, were rampant. Economic growth remained rapid before plateauing in 1972. The brutal suppression of the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]] in 1973 set in motion the fall of the regime, resulting in a counter-coup that established brigadier [[Dimitrios Ioannidis]] as the new junta strongman. On 20 July 1974, [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkey invaded the island of Cyprus]] in response to a Greek-backed Cypriot coup, triggering a crisis in Greece that led to the regime's collapse and restoration of democracy through [[Metapolitefsi]].

==== Third Hellenic Republic ====
{{Main|Third Hellenic Republic}}
[[File:Accession of Greece to the European Union.png|thumb|Signing at [[Zappeion]] by [[Constantine Karamanlis]] of the documents for the accession of Greece to the [[European Union|European Communities]] in 1979]]

The former prime minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] was invited back from self-exile and the [[Greek legislative election, 1974|first multiparty elections]] since 1964 were held on the first anniversary of the Polytechnic uprising. A democratic and republican [[Constitution of Greece|constitution]] was promulgated in 1975 following a [[Greek republic referendum, 1974|referendum]] which chose not to restore the monarchy.

Meanwhile, [[Andreas Papandreou]], George Papandreou's son, founded the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) in response to Karamanlis's conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party, with the two political formations dominating government over the next four decades. Greece rejoined NATO in 1980.{{Refn | group = lower-alpha | name="integrated1974" | On 14 August 1974 Greek forces withdrew from the integrated military structure of [[NATO]] in protest at the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus; Greece rejoined NATO in 1980.}} Greece became the tenth member of the [[European Communities]] in 1981, ushering in sustained growth. Investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure, as well as funds from the [[European Union]] and growing revenue from tourism, shipping, and a fast-growing service sector raised the [[standard of living]]. In 1981, [[Andreas Papandreou]] came to power and implemented an [[Social reforms of Andreas Papandreou|ambitious program of social reforms]]. He recognised civil marriage, the dowry was abolished, while expanding access to education and health care. However, he made controversial [[Foreign policy of Andreas Papandreou|foreign policy]] decisions that fueled the rise of [[terrorism in Greece]]. Papandreou's tenure has been associated with corruption (see [[Koskotas scandal|Koskotas]] and [[Yugoslav corn scandal]]s) and the [[1985 Greek constitutional crisis|first constitutional crisis of the new republic]], while [[Economic policies of Andreas Papandreou|his economic policies]] failed to address the persistent [[stagflation]] and chronic budget deficits that exacerbated Greece's economic problems.

The country adopted the euro in 2001 and successfully hosted the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympic Games]] in Athens. In 2010, Greece suffered from the [[Great Recession]] and related [[European sovereign debt crisis]]. Due to the adoption of the euro, Greece could no longer [[Devaluation|devalue]] its currency to regain competitiveness. In the 2012 elections, there was major political change, with new parties emerging from the collapse of the two main parties, PASOK and New Democracy. In 2015, [[Alexis Tsipras]] was elected as prime minister, the first outside the two main parties. The [[Greek government-debt crisis]], and subsequent austerity policies, resulted in social strife. The crisis ended around 2018, with the end of the bailout mechanisms and return of growth.

In 2019, [[Kyriakos Mitsotakis]] became Greece's new prime minister, after his centre-right New Democracy won the [[2019 Greek legislative election|election]]. In 2020, Greece's parliament elected a non-partisan candidate, [[Katerina Sakellaropoulou]], as the first female [[President of Greece]]. In February 2024, Greece became the first Orthodox Christian country to recognise same-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex couples.

In 2023, Greece became a member of the Three Seas Initiative.
