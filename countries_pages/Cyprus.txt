===Prehistoric and ancient period===
{{Main|Prehistoric Cyprus|Ancient history of Cyprus}}

Hunter-gatherers first arrived on Cyprus around 13–12,000 years ago (11,000 to 10,000 BC), based on dating of sites like [[Aetokremnos]] on the south coast and the inland site of Vretsia Roudias. The arrival of the first humans coincides with the extinction of the {{Convert|75|cm|ft|abbr=on}} high [[Cypriot pygmy hippopotamus]] and {{Convert|1|m}} tall [[Cyprus Dwarf Elephant|Cyprus dwarf elephant]], the only large mammals native to the island. [[Neolithic]] farming communities emerged on the island by around 10,500 years ago (8500 BC).

Remains of an eight-month-old cat were discovered buried with a human body at a separate [[Neolithic]] site in Cyprus. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old (7500&nbsp;BC), predating [[ancient Egypt]]ian civilisation and pushing back the [[Domestication of the cat|earliest known feline-human association]] significantly. The remarkably well-preserved Neolithic village of [[Khirokitia]] is a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], dating to approximately 6800&nbsp;BC.

During the Late [[Bronze Age]], from around 1650 BC Cyprus (identified in whole or part as [[Alashiya]] in contemporary texts) became more connected to the wider Mediterranean world driven by the trade in [[copper]] extracted from the Troodos Mountains, which stimulated the development of urbanised settlements across the island, with records suggesting that Cyprus at this time was ruled by "kings" who corresponded with the leaders of other Mediterranean states (like the [[pharaoh]]s of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], as documented in the [[Amarna letters]]). The first recorded name of a Cypriot king is ''Kushmeshusha'', as appears on letters sent to [[Ugarit]] in the 13th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC.

At the end of the Bronze Age, the island experienced two waves of Greek settlement. The first wave consisted of [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greek]] traders, who started visiting Cyprus around 1400&nbsp;BC. A major wave of Greek settlement is believed to have taken place following the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] of Mycenaean Greece from 1100 to 1050&nbsp;BC, with the island's predominantly Greek character dating from this period.  Cyprus occupies an important role in [[Greek mythology]], being the birthplace of [[Aphrodite]] and [[Adonis]], and home to [[Cinyras|King Cinyras]], [[Teucer]] and [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]. Literary evidence suggests an early Phoenician presence at [[Kition]], which was under [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] rule at the beginning of the 10th century BC. Some [[Phoenicia]]n merchants who were believed to come from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] [[colony|colonised]] the area and expanded the political influence of Kition. After c.&nbsp;850&nbsp;BC, the Phoenicians rebuilt and reused the sanctuaries [at the Kathari site].[[File:Kition, Zeus Keraunios.jpg|thumb|upright|Zeus Keraunios, 500–480 BC, Nicosia museum]]

Cyprus is at a strategic location in the Eastern Mediterranean. It was ruled by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] for a century starting in 708&nbsp;BC, before a brief spell under Egyptian rule and eventually [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] rule in 545&nbsp;BC. The Cypriots, led by [[Onesilus]], king of Salamis, joined their fellow Greeks in the [[Ionia]]n cities during the unsuccessful [[Ionian Revolt]] in 499&nbsp;BC against the Achaemenids. The revolt was suppressed, but Cyprus managed to maintain a high degree of autonomy and remained inclined towards the Greek world. 
During the whole period of the Persian rule, there is a continuity in the reign of the Cypriot kings and during their rebellions they were crushed by Persian rulers from Asia Minor, which is an indication that the Cypriots were ruling the island with directly regulated relations with the Great King and there was not a Persian [[satrap]]. The Kingdoms of Cyprus enjoyed special privileges and a semi-autonomous status, but they were still considered vassal subjects of the Great King.

The island was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333&nbsp;BC and Cypriot navy helped Alexander during the [[siege of Tyre (332 BC)]]. The Cypriot fleet was also sent to help [[Amphoterus (admiral)|Amphoterus]]. In addition, Alexander had two Cypriot generals [[Stasander]] and [[Stasanor]] both from the [[Soli, Cyprus|Soli]] and later both became satraps in Alexander's empire.
Following Alexander's death, the [[Partition of Babylon|division of his empire]], and the subsequent [[Wars of the Diadochi]], Cyprus became part of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic empire]] of [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]]. It was during this period that the island was fully [[Hellenization|Hellenised]]. In 58&nbsp;BC Cyprus was acquired by the [[Roman Republic]] and became [[Roman Cyprus]] in 22 BC.

===Middle Ages===
{{Main|Cyprus in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of Cyprus}}
[[File:Nicosia by Giacomo Franco.jpg|thumb|The [[Walls of Nicosia]] were built by the Venetians to defend the city in case of an Ottoman attack.]]
[[File:Kyrenia 01-2017 img11 Castle exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Kyrenia Castle]] was originally built by the Byzantines and enlarged by the Venetians.]]
When the [[Roman Empire]] was divided into Eastern and Western parts in 286, Cyprus became part of the East Roman Empire (also called the [[Byzantine Empire]]); the island would remain part of the empire for some 900 years. Under Byzantine rule, the Greek orientation that had been prominent since antiquity developed the strong Hellenistic-Christian character that continues to be a hallmark of the Greek Cypriot community.

Beginning in 649, Cyprus endured repeated attacks and raids launched by [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. Many were quick raids, but others were large-scale attacks in which many Cypriots were killed and great wealth carried off or destroyed. The city of [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]] was destroyed and never rebuilt. Byzantine control remained stronger in the northern coast, the Arabs exerted more influence in the south. In 688, Emperor [[Justinian II|Justinian&nbsp;II]] and Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] signed a treaty whereby Cyprus would be paying an equal amount of tribute to the Caliphate and tax to the Empire, but would remain politically neutral to both while being retained as a province administered by the Empire. There are no Byzantine churches which survive from this period, and the island entered a period of impoverishment. Full Byzantine rule was restored in 965, when Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros&nbsp;II Phokas]] scored decisive victories on land and sea.

In 1156 [[Raynald of Châtillon]] and [[Thoros II|Thoros II of Armenia]] brutally sacked Cyprus over a period of three weeks, stealing so much plunder and capturing so many of the leading citizens and their families for ransom, that the island took generations to recover. Several Greek priests were mutilated and sent away to Constantinople.

In 1185 [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]], a member of the Byzantine imperial family, took over Cyprus and declared it independent of the Empire. In 1191, during the [[Third Crusade]], [[Richard I of England]] captured the island from Isaac. He used it as a major supply base that was relatively safe from the [[Saracen]]s. A year later Richard sold the island to the [[Knights Templar]], who, following a bloody revolt, in turn sold it to [[Guy of Lusignan]]. His brother and successor [[Aimery of Cyprus|Aimery]] was recognised as [[Kingdom of Cyprus|King of Cyprus]] by [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]].

Following the death in 1473 of [[James II of Cyprus|James&nbsp;II]], the last Lusignan king, the [[Republic of Venice]] assumed control of the island, while the late king's Venetian widow, Queen [[Catherine Cornaro]], reigned as figurehead. Venice formally annexed the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] in 1489, following the abdication of Catherine. The Venetians fortified [[Nicosia]] by building the [[Walls of Nicosia]], and used it as an important commercial hub. Throughout Venetian rule, the [[Ottoman Empire]] frequently raided Cyprus. In 1539 the Ottomans destroyed [[Limassol]] and so fearing the worst, the Venetians also fortified [[Famagusta]] and [[Kyrenia]].

Although the Lusignan French aristocracy remained the dominant social class in Cyprus throughout the medieval period, the former assumption that Greeks were treated only as serfs on the island is no longer considered by academics to be accurate. It is now accepted that the medieval period saw increasing numbers of Greek Cypriots elevated to the upper classes, a growing Greek [[middle class|middle ranks]], and the Lusignan royal household even marrying Greeks. This included King [[John II of Cyprus|John&nbsp;II of Cyprus]] who married [[Helena Palaiologina]].

===Ottoman Cyprus===
{{Main|Ottoman Cyprus}}
[[File:Atlas Ortelius KB PPN369376781-073av-073br.jpg|thumb|left|''Cypri insvlae nova descript. 1573'', Ioannes à Deutecum f[ecit]. "Map of the island of Cyprus, newly drawn by Johannes van Deutecom in 1573."]]
In 1570, a full-scale Ottoman assault with 60,000 troops brought the island under Ottoman control, despite stiff resistance by the inhabitants of Nicosia and Famagusta. Ottoman forces capturing Cyprus [[Cyprus massacre|massacred]] many Greek and Armenian Christian inhabitants. The previous Latin elite were destroyed and the first significant demographic change since antiquity took place with the formation of a Muslim community. Soldiers who fought in the conquest settled on the island and Turkish peasants and craftsmen were brought to the island from [[Anatolia]]. This new community also included banished Anatolian tribes, "undesirable" persons and members of various "troublesome" Muslim sects, as well as a number of new converts on the island.
[[File:Buyuk Han, Nicosia - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Büyük Han]], a [[caravanserai]] in Nicosia, is an example of the surviving Ottoman architecture in Cyprus.]]
The Ottomans abolished the [[feudal]] system previously in place and applied the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]] to Cyprus, under which non-Muslim peoples were governed by their own religious authorities. In a reversal from the days of Latin rule, the head of the [[Church of Cyprus]] was invested as leader of the Greek Cypriot population and acted as mediator between Christian Greek Cypriots and the Ottoman authorities. This status ensured that the Church of Cyprus was in a position to end the [[Catholic Church]]'s constant expansion efforts on the island. Ottoman rule of Cyprus was at times indifferent, at times oppressive, depending on the temperaments of the sultans and local officials.

The ratio of Muslims to Christians fluctuated throughout the period of Ottoman domination. In 1777–78, 47,000 Muslims constituted a majority over the island's 37,000 Christians. By 1872, the population of the island had risen to 144,000, comprising 44,000 Muslims and 100,000 Christians. The Muslim population included numerous [[crypto-Christians]], including the [[Linobambaki]], a crypto-Catholic community that arose due to religious persecution of the Catholic community by the Ottoman authorities; this community would assimilate into the Turkish Cypriot community during British rule.

As soon as the [[Greek War of Independence]] broke out in 1821, several Greek Cypriots left for Greece to join the Greek forces. In response, the Ottoman governor of Cyprus arrested and executed 486 prominent Greek Cypriots, including the Archbishop of Cyprus, [[Kyprianos of Cyprus|Kyprianos]], and four other bishops. In 1828, modern Greece's first president [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] called for union of Cyprus with Greece, and numerous minor uprisings took place. Reaction to Ottoman misrule led to uprisings by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, although none were successful. After centuries of neglect by the Ottoman Empire, the poverty of most of the people and the ever-present tax collectors fuelled Greek nationalism, and by the 20th century the idea of ''[[enosis|union]]'' with newly independent Greece was firmly rooted among Greek Cypriots.

Under Ottoman rule, numeracy, school enrolment and literacy rates were all low. They persisted some time after Ottoman rule ended, and then increased rapidly during the twentieth century.

===British Cyprus===
{{Main|British Cyprus|Modern history of Cyprus|Cyprus Emergency}}
[[File:Hosting the British flag at Nicosia.jpg|thumb|upright|Hoisting the British flag at Nicosia]]

In the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] and the [[Congress of Berlin]], Cyprus was [[Cyprus Convention|leased]] to the [[British Empire]] which de facto took over its administration in 1878 (though, in terms of sovereignty, Cyprus remained a ''[[de jure]]'' Ottoman territory until 5 November 1914, together with [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt and Sudan]]) in exchange for guarantees that Britain would use the island as a base to protect the Ottoman Empire against possible Russian aggression.

[[File:Cypriot demonstration 1930.jpg|thumb|[[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] demonstrations for [[Enosis]] (union with Greece) in 1930]]
The island would serve Britain as a key military base for its colonial routes. By 1906, when the Famagusta harbour was completed, Cyprus was a strategic naval outpost overlooking the [[Suez Canal]], the crucial main route to India which was then Britain's most important overseas possession. Following the outbreak of the [[First World War]] and the decision of the Ottoman Empire to join the war on the side of the [[Central Powers]], on 5 November 1914 the British Empire formally annexed Cyprus and declared the Ottoman ''[[Khedive|Khedivate]]'' of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt and Sudan]] a [[Sultanate of Egypt|''Sultanate'' and British protectorate]].

In October 1915, Britain offered Cyprus to Greece, ruled by King [[Constantine I of Greece]], on the condition that Greece join the war on the side of the British and went to [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]’s assistance, in order to fulfill her Treaty obligations under the [[Greek–Serbian Alliance of 1913|Serbo-Greek pact]] of May 1913. It gave Greece a golden 
“opportunity” in achieving ''[[enosis]]'' with Cyprus. Alternatively it was a
“lost opportunity” when the [[Alexandros Zaimis|Zaimis]] administration declined the British proposal.

In 1923, under the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]], the nascent Turkish republic relinquished any claim to Cyprus, and in 1925 it was declared a British [[crown colony]]. During the [[Second World War]], many Greek and Turkish Cypriots enlisted in the [[Cyprus Regiment]].

The Greek Cypriot population, meanwhile, had become hopeful that the British administration would lead to ''enosis''. The idea of ''enosis'' was historically part of the ''[[Megali Idea]]'', a greater political ambition of a Greek state encompassing the territories with large Greek populations in the former Ottoman Empire, including Cyprus and [[Asia Minor]] with a capital in [[Constantinople]], and was actively pursued by the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]], which had its members educated in Greece. These religious officials, together with Greek military officers and professionals, some of whom still pursued the ''Megali Idea'', would later found the guerrilla organisation [[EOKA]] ''(Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston'' or National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters). The Greek Cypriots viewed the island as historically Greek and believed that union with Greece was a natural right. In the 1950s, the pursuit of ''enosis'' became a part of the Greek national policy.

[[File:Street riot in Nicosia 1956.jpg|thumb|A British soldier facing a crowd of Greek Cypriot demonstrators in Nicosia (1956)]]

Initially, the Turkish Cypriots favoured the continuation of the British rule. However, they were alarmed by the Greek Cypriot calls for ''enosis'', as they saw the union of [[Cretan State|Crete]] with Greece, which led to the exodus of [[Cretan Turks]], as a precedent to be avoided, and they took a pro-partition stance in response to the militant activity of EOKA. The Turkish Cypriots also viewed themselves as a distinct ethnic group of the island and believed in their having a separate right to [[self-determination]] from Greek Cypriots. Meanwhile, in the 1950s, Turkish leader [[Adnan Menderes|Menderes]] considered Cyprus an "extension of Anatolia", rejected the partition of Cyprus along ethnic lines and favoured the annexation of the whole island to Turkey. Nationalistic slogans centred on the idea that "Cyprus is Turkish" and the ruling party declared Cyprus to be a part of the Turkish homeland that was vital to its security. Upon realising that the fact that the Turkish Cypriot population was only 20% of the islanders made annexation unfeasible, the national policy was changed to favour partition. The slogan "Partition or Death" was frequently used in Turkish Cypriot and Turkish protests starting in the late 1950s and continuing throughout the 1960s. Although after the Zürich and London conferences Turkey seemed to accept the existence of the Cypriot state and to distance itself from its policy of favouring the partition of the island, the goal of the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot leaders remained that of creating an independent Turkish state in the northern part of the island.

In January 1950, the Church of Cyprus organised a [[Cypriot enosis referendum, 1950|referendum]] under the supervision of clerics and with no Turkish Cypriot participation, where 96% of the participating Greek Cypriots voted in favour of ''enosis''.{{rp|9}} The Greeks were 80.2% of the total island's population at the time ([[Demographics of Cyprus|census 1946]]). Restricted autonomy under a constitution was proposed by the British administration but eventually rejected. In 1955 the EOKA organisation was founded, seeking union with Greece through armed struggle. At the same time the [[Turkish Resistance Organisation]] (TMT), calling for Taksim, or partition, was established by the Turkish Cypriots as a counterweight. British officials also tolerated the creation of the Turkish underground organisation TMT The Secretary of State for the Colonies in a letter dated 15 July 1958 had advised the Governor of Cyprus not to act against TMT despite its illegal actions so as not to harm British relations with the Turkish government.

During British rule, the future of the island became a matter of disagreement between the two prominent ethnic communities, [[Greek Cypriots]], who made up 77% of the population in 1960, and [[Turkish Cypriots]], who made up 18% of the population. From the 19th century onwards, the Greek Cypriot population pursued ''[[enosis]]'', union with [[Greece]], which became a Greek national policy in the 1950s. The Turkish Cypriot population initially advocated the continuation of the British rule, then demanded the annexation of the island to Turkey, and in the 1950s, together with Turkey, established a policy of ''[[Taksim (politics)|taksim]]'', the partition of Cyprus and the creation of a Turkish polity in the north.[[File:Ethnographic distribution in Cyprus 1960.jpg|thumb|Ethnic map of Cyprus according to the 1960 census]]
Cyprus was [[London and Zürich Agreements|granted independence]] in 1960, following an armed campaign spearheaded by EOKA. As per the [[Zürich and London Agreement]], Cyprus officially attained independence on 16 August 1960, and at the time had a total population of 573,566; of whom 442,138 (77.1%) were Greeks, 104,320 (18.2%) Turks, and 27,108 (4.7%) others. The UK retained the two [[Sovereign Base Areas]] of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]], while government posts and public offices were allocated by ethnic quotas, giving the minority Turkish Cypriots a permanent veto, 30% in parliament and administration, and granting the three mother-states guarantor rights.

However, the division of power as foreseen by the constitution soon resulted in legal impasses and discontent on both sides, and nationalist militants started training again, with the military support of Greece and Turkey respectively. The Greek Cypriot leadership believed that the rights given to Turkish Cypriots under the 1960 constitution were too extensive and designed the [[Akritas plan]], which was aimed at reforming the constitution in favour of Greek Cypriots, persuading the international community about the correctness of the changes and violently subjugating Turkish Cypriots in a few days should they not accept the plan. Tensions were heightened when Cypriot President Archbishop [[Makarios&nbsp;III]] called for [[Zürich and London Agreement#13 Amendments proposed by Makarios III|constitutional changes]], which were rejected by Turkey{{rp|17–20}} and opposed by Turkish Cypriots.

Intercommunal violence [[Bloody Christmas (1963)|erupted]] on 21 December 1963, when two Turkish Cypriots were killed at an incident involving the Greek Cypriot police. The violence resulted in the death of 364&nbsp;Turkish and 174&nbsp;Greek Cypriots, destruction of 109 Turkish Cypriot or mixed villages and displacement of 25,000–30,000 Turkish Cypriots. The crisis resulted in the end of the Turkish Cypriot involvement in the administration and their claiming that it had lost its legitimacy;{{rp|56–59}} the nature of this event is still controversial. In some areas, Greek Cypriots prevented Turkish Cypriots from travelling and entering government buildings, while some Turkish Cypriots willingly withdrew due to the calls of the Turkish Cypriot administration. Turkish Cypriots started living in [[Turkish Cypriot enclaves|enclaves]]. The republic's structure was changed, unilaterally, by Makarios, and Nicosia was divided by the [[Green Line (Cyprus)|Green Line]], with the deployment of [[UNFICYP]] troops.{{rp|56–59}}

In 1964, Turkey threatened to invade Cyprus in response to the continuing [[Cypriot intercommunal violence]], but this was stopped by a strongly worded telegram from the US President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on 5 June, warning that the US would not stand beside Turkey in case of a consequential Soviet invasion of Turkish territory. Meanwhile, by 1964, ''enosis'' was a Greek policy and would not be abandoned; Makarios and the Greek prime minister [[Georgios Papandreou]] agreed that ''enosis'' should be the ultimate aim and King [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine]] wished Cyprus "a speedy union with the mother country". Greece dispatched 10,000 troops to Cyprus to counter a possible Turkish invasion.

The [[Bloody Christmas (1963)|crisis of 1963–64]] had brought further [[Cypriot intercommunal violence|intercommunal violence]] between the two communities, displaced more than 25,000 Turkish Cypriots into [[Turkish Cypriot enclaves|enclaves]]{{rp|56–59}} and brought the end of Turkish Cypriot representation in the republic.

===1974 coup d'état, invasion, and division===
{{Main|1974 Cypriot coup d'état|Turkish invasion of Cyprus}}
[[File:Famagusta-Varosha 2007.JPG|thumb|[[Varosha, Famagusta|Varosha (Maraş)]], a suburb of Famagusta, was abandoned when its inhabitants fled in 1974 and remains under Turkish military control.]]
On 15 July 1974, the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|Greek military junta]] under [[Dimitrios Ioannides]] carried out a [[1974 Cypriot coup d'état|coup d'état]] in Cyprus, to [[Enosis|unite the island with Greece]]. The coup ousted president [[Makarios&nbsp;III]] and replaced him with pro-[[enosis]] nationalist [[Nikos Sampson]]. In response to the coup,{{efn|See:}} five days later, on 20 July 1974, the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish army invaded]] the island, citing a right to intervene to restore the constitutional order from the 1960 [[Treaty of Guarantee (1960)|Treaty of Guarantee]]. This justification has been rejected by the [[United Nations]] and the international community.

The Turkish air force began bombing Greek positions in Cyprus, and hundreds of [[paratroopers]] were dropped in the area between Nicosia and Kyrenia, where well-armed Turkish Cypriot enclaves had been long-established; while off the Kyrenia coast, Turkish troop ships landed 6,000 men as well as tanks, trucks and armoured vehicles.

Three days later, when a ceasefire had been agreed, Turkey had landed 30,000 troops on the island and captured Kyrenia, the corridor linking Kyrenia to Nicosia, and the Turkish Cypriot quarter of Nicosia itself. The junta in [[Athens]], and then the Sampson regime in Cyprus fell from power. In Nicosia, [[Glafkos Clerides]] temporarily assumed the presidency. But after the peace negotiations in [[Geneva]], the Turkish government reinforced their Kyrenia bridgehead and started a second invasion on 14 August. The invasion resulted in [[Morphou]], [[Karpass Peninsula|Karpass]], Famagusta and the [[Mesaoria]] coming under Turkish control.

International pressure led to a ceasefire, and by then 36% of the island had been taken over by the Turks and 180,000 Greek Cypriots had been evicted from their homes in the north. At the same time, around 50,000 Turkish Cypriots were displaced to the north and settled in the properties of the displaced Greek Cypriots. Among a variety of sanctions against Turkey, in mid-1975 the US Congress imposed an arms embargo on Turkey for using US-supplied equipment during the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974. There were 1,534 Greek Cypriots and 502 Turkish Cypriots missing as a result of the fighting from 1963 to 1974.

The Republic of Cyprus has ''[[de jure]]'' [[sovereignty]] over the entire island, including its [[territorial waters]] and [[exclusive economic zone]], with the exception of the Sovereign Base Areas of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]], which remain under the UK's control according to the [[London-Zürich Agreements|London and Zürich Agreements]]. However, the island is ''[[de facto]]'' partitioned into two main parts: the area under the effective control of the Republic of Cyprus, in the south and west and comprising about 59% of the island's area, and the north, administered by the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, covering about 36% of the island's area. Another nearly 4% of the island's area is covered by the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|UN buffer zone]]. The international community considers the northern part of the island to be territory of the Republic of Cyprus occupied by Turkish forces.{{efn|See:}} The occupation is viewed as illegal under international law and amounting to illegal occupation of EU territory since Cyprus became a member of the [[European Union]].

===Post-division===
[[File:Cy-map.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A map showing the division of Cyprus]]

After the restoration of constitutional order and the return of Archbishop [[Makarios&nbsp;III]] to Cyprus in December 1974, Turkish troops remained, occupying the northeastern portion of the island. In 1983, the [[Assembly of the Republic (Northern Cyprus)|Turkish Cypriot parliament]], led by the Turkish Cypriot leader [[Rauf Denktaş]], [[Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|proclaimed]] the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), which is recognised only by Turkey.

The events of the summer of 1974 dominate the [[Cyprus dispute|politics]] on the island, as well as [[Greco-Turkish relations]]. [[Turkish settlers in Northern Cyprus|Turkish settlers]] have been settled in the north with the encouragement of the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot states. The Republic of Cyprus considers their presence a violation of the [[Geneva Convention]],{{rp|56–59}} whilst many Turkish settlers have since severed their ties to Turkey and their second generation considers Cyprus to be their homeland.

The Turkish invasion, the ensuing occupation and the declaration of independence by the TRNC have been condemned by United Nations resolutions, which are reaffirmed by the Security Council every year.

===21st century===
[[File:Close to the buffer zone - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Street in the divided capital of Nicosia]]
Attempts to resolve the Cyprus dispute have continued. In 2004, the [[Annan Plan]], drafted by then UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]], was put to a [[Cypriot Annan Plan referendums, 2004|referendum]] in both Cypriot administrations. 65% of Turkish Cypriots voted in support of the plan and 74% Greek Cypriots voted against the plan, saying that it disproportionately favoured Turkish Cypriots and gave unreasonable influence over the nation to Turkey. In total, 66.7% of the voters [[Cypriot Annan Plan referendum, 2004|rejected the Annan Plan]].

On 1 May 2004 Cyprus joined the [[European Union]], together with nine other countries. Cyprus was accepted into the EU as a whole, although the EU legislation is suspended in Northern Cyprus until a final settlement of the Cyprus problem.

Efforts have been made to enhance freedom of movement between the two sides. In April 2003, Northern Cyprus unilaterally eased checkpoint restrictions, permitting Cypriots to cross between the two sides for the first time in 30 years. In March 2008, a wall that had stood for decades at the boundary between the Republic of Cyprus and the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|UN buffer zone]] was demolished. The wall had cut across [[Ledra Street]] in the heart of Nicosia and was seen as a strong symbol of the island's 32-year division. On 3 April 2008, Ledra Street was reopened in the presence of Greek and Turkish Cypriot officials. The two sides relaunched reunification talks in 2015, but these collapsed in 2017.

The [[European Union]] warned in February 2019 that Cyprus was selling [[Passports of the European Union|EU passports]] to [[Russian oligarch]]s, and thus would allow [[organized crime|organised crime]] syndicates to infiltrate the EU. In 2020, leaked documents revealed a wider range of former and current officials from Afghanistan, China, Dubai, Lebanon, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine and Vietnam who bought a Cypriot citizenship prior to a change of the law in July 2019. Since 2020 Cyprus and Turkey have been [[Cyprus–Turkey maritime zones dispute|engaged in a dispute]] over the extent of their [[exclusive economic zone]]s, ostensibly sparked by oil and gas exploration in the area.

In November 2023, the [[Cyprus Confidential]] data leak published by the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] showed the country's financial network entertaining strong links with Russian oligarchs and high-up figures in the Kremlin, supporting the regime of [[Vladimir Putin]].

In July 2024, on the 50th anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Northern Cyprus, Turkish President Erdoğan rejected a United Nations-endorsed plan for a federal government and supported the idea of having two separate states within Cyprus. Greek Cypriots immediately rejected Erdoğan's two-state proposal, calling it a "non-starter".
