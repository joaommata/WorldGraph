===874–1262: settlement and Commonwealth===
{{see also|Settlement of Iceland|Icelandic Commonwealth|Christianisation of Iceland}}
[[File:Ingolf by Raadsig.jpg|thumb|[[Ingólfr Arnarson]] (modern Icelandic: ''Ingólfur Arnarson''), the first permanent Scandinavian settler]]
According to both {{Lang|is|[[Landnámabók]]}} and {{Lang|is| [[Íslendingabók]]}}, monks known as the [[Papar]] lived in Iceland before Scandinavian settlers arrived, possibly members of a [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]]. An archaeological excavation has revealed the ruins of a cabin in [[Hafnir]] on the [[Southern Peninsula (Iceland)|Reykjanes peninsula]]. [[Carbon dating]] indicates that it was abandoned sometime between 770 and 880. In 2016, archaeologists uncovered a [[longhouse]] in [[Stöðvarfjörður]] that may date to as early as 800.

Swedish Viking explorer [[Garðar Svavarsson]] was the first to circumnavigate Iceland in 870 and establish that it was an island. He stayed during the winter and built a house in [[Húsavík]]. Garðar departed the following summer, but one of his men, [[Náttfari]], decided to stay behind with two slaves. Náttfari settled in what is now known as Náttfaravík, and he and his slaves became the first documented permanent residents of Iceland.

The Norwegian-Norse chieftain [[Ingólfr Arnarson]] built his homestead in present-day [[Reykjavík]] in 874. Ingólfr was followed by many other emigrant settlers, largely Scandinavians and their [[thrall]]s, many of whom were [[Irish people|Irish]] or [[Scottish people|Scottish]]. By 930, most [[arable land]] on the island had been claimed; the [[Althing]], a legislative and judicial assembly was initiated to regulate the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]]. The lack of arable land also served as an impetus to the [[Norse colonization of Greenland|settlement of Greenland]] starting in 986. The period of these early settlements coincided with the [[Medieval Warm Period]], when temperatures were similar to those of the early 20th century. At this time, about 25% of Iceland was covered with forest, compared to 1% in the present day. [[Christianity]] was adopted [[Christianisation of Iceland|by consensus]] around 999–1000, although [[Norse paganism]] persisted among segments of the population for some years afterward.

===Iceland as a possession===
====Middle Ages====
{{see also|Age of the Sturlungs}}
The [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], established in the 10th century, faced internal strife during the [[Age of the Sturlungs]] (c. 1220–1264). This period was marked by violent conflicts among chieftains, notably the Sturlung family, leading to the weakening of the Commonwealth's political structure. The culmination of the struggles resulted in the signing of the Old Covenant ([[Old Covenant (Iceland)|Gamli sáttmáli]]) in 1262–1264, bringing [[History of Iceland|Iceland under Norwegian rule]].

Environmental challenges further impacted [[History of Iceland|medieval Icelandic society]]. Upon settlement, approximately 25–40% of Iceland was forested. However, extensive deforestation occurred as forests were cleared for timber, firewood, and to create grazing land for livestock. This led to significant soil erosion and a decline in arable land, exacerbating the difficulties of sustaining agriculture in Iceland's harsh climate. Agriculture during this period was predominantly pastoral, focusing on livestock such as sheep, cattle, and horses. While early settlers cultivated barley, the cooling climate from the 12th century onwards made grain cultivation increasingly difficult. The [[Little Ice Age]] began around 1300 bringing colder and more unpredictable weather, further shortening growing seasons and making farming more challenging.

The [[Black Death]] reached Iceland in 1402–1404 and again in 1494–1495, with devastating effects. The first outbreak is estimated to have killed 50–60% of the population, while the second resulted in a 30–50% mortality rate. These pandemics significantly reduced the population, leading to social and economic disruptions.

In 1380, [[Olaf II of Denmark]] became King of Norway on his father's death. Denmark and Norway were thus united in personal union and ruled from Denmark; this was further solidified with the formation of the [[Kalmar Union]] in 1397. Through it Iceland, as a Norwegian possession, came to be ruled by Denmark.

====Reformation and the Early Modern period====

Around the middle of the 16th century, as part of the [[Protestant Reformation]], King [[Christian III of Denmark]] began to impose [[Lutheranism]] on all his subjects. [[Jón Arason]], the last Icelandic Catholic bishop, and two of his sons were beheaded in 1550. Iceland then became officially Lutheran, and Lutheranism has since remained the dominant religion.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, Denmark imposed [[Danish–Icelandic Trade Monopoly|harsh trade restrictions]] on Iceland. Natural disasters, including volcanic eruptions and disease, contributed to a decreasing population. In the summer of 1627, [[Barbary Pirates]] committed the events known locally as the [[Turkish Abductions]], in which hundreds of residents were taken into slavery in North Africa and dozens killed; this was the only invasion in Icelandic history to have casualties. The [[1707–08 Iceland smallpox epidemic]] is estimated to have killed a quarter to a third of the population. In 1783 the [[Laki]] volcano erupted, with devastating effects. In the years following the eruption, known as the [[Mist Hardships]] ({{langx|is|Móðuharðindin}}), over half of all livestock in the country died. Around a quarter of the population starved to death in the ensuing [[famine]].

====1814–1918: independence movement====
{{see also|Icelandic independence movement|Fjölnir (journal)}}
After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1814, Denmark-Norway broke up into two separate kingdoms via the [[Treaty of Kiel]], but Iceland remained a Danish dependency. Throughout the 19th century, the country's climate continued to grow colder, resulting in mass emigration to the [[New World]], particularly to the region of [[Gimli, Manitoba]] in Canada, which was sometimes referred to as [[New Iceland]]. About 15,000 people emigrated out of a total population of 70,000.

A national consciousness arose in the first half of the 19th century, inspired by [[Romanticism|romantic]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] ideas from mainland Europe. An Icelandic independence movement took shape in the 1850s under the leadership of [[Jón Sigurðsson]], based on the burgeoning Icelandic nationalism inspired by the ''[[Fjölnismenn]]'' and other Danish-educated Icelandic intellectuals. In 1874, poet and clergyman [[Matthías Jochumsson]] wrote the lyrics of "[[Lofsöngur]]," which became the Icelandic [[national anthem]]. Composer [[Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson]] wrote the music.

In 1874, Denmark granted Iceland a constitution and limited home rule. That was expanded in 1904, and [[Hannes Hafstein]] served as the first [[Minister for Iceland]] in the Danish cabinet.

===1918–1944: independence and the Kingdom of Iceland===
{{see also|Kingdom of Iceland|Invasion of Iceland|Iceland in World War II}}
[[File:HMS Berwick (65).jpg|left|thumb|{{HMS|Berwick|65|6}} led the British [[invasion of Iceland]].]]

The [[Danish–Icelandic Act of Union]], an agreement with Denmark signed on 1 December 1918 and valid for 25&nbsp;years, recognized Iceland as a fully sovereign and independent state in a [[personal union]] with Denmark. The Government of Iceland established an embassy in Copenhagen and requested that Denmark carry out on its behalf certain defence and foreign affairs matters, subject to consultation with the Althing. Danish embassies around the world displayed two coats of arms and two flags: those of the Kingdom of Denmark and those of the [[Kingdom of Iceland]]. Iceland's legal position became comparable to those of countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Nations, such as Canada, whose sovereign is King [[Charles III]].

During World War II, Iceland joined Denmark in asserting neutrality. After the [[German occupation of Denmark]] on 9 April 1940, the Althing replaced the King with a regent and declared that the Icelandic government would take control of its own defence and foreign affairs. A month later, British armed forces conducted [[Operation Fork]], the invasion and occupation of the country, violating Icelandic [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]]. In 1941, the Government of Iceland, friendly to Britain, invited the then-neutral United States to take over its defence so that Britain could use its troops elsewhere.

===1944–present: Republic of Iceland===

On 31 December 1943, the [[Danish–Icelandic Act of Union]] expired after 25 years. Beginning on 20 May 1944, Icelanders voted in a four-day plebiscite on whether to terminate the personal union with Denmark, abolish the monarchy, and establish a republic. The vote was 97% to end the union, and 95% in favor of the new republican constitution. Iceland formally became a republic on 17 June 1944, with [[Sveinn Björnsson]] as its first president.

In 1946, the U.S. Defense Force left Iceland. The nation formally became a member of [[NATO]] on 30 March 1949, amid [[1949 anti-NATO riot in Iceland|domestic controversy and riots]]. On 5 May 1951, a defense agreement was signed with the United States. American troops returned to Iceland as the [[Iceland Defence Force]] and remained throughout the [[Cold War]]. The U.S. withdrew the last of its forces on 30 September 2006.

Iceland prospered during the Second World War. The immediate post-war period was followed by substantial [[economic growth]], driven by the industrialization of the fishing industry and the U.S. [[Marshall Plan]] program, through which Icelanders received the most aid per capita of any European country (at US$209, with war-ravaged [[Netherlands]] a distant second at US$109). [[Vigdís Finnbogadóttir]] assumed Iceland's presidency on 1 August 1980, making her the first elected female head of state in the world.

The 1970s were marked by the [[Cod Wars]], which were several disputes with the United Kingdom over Iceland's extension of its fishing limits to {{convert|200|nmi|km|abbr=on}} offshore. Iceland hosted a [[Reykjavík Summit|summit in Reykjavík in 1986]] between United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] and Soviet Premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], during which they took significant steps towards [[nuclear disarmament]]. A few years later, Iceland became the first country to recognize the independence of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] as they [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|broke away]] from the [[USSR]]. Throughout the 1990s, the country expanded its international role and developed a foreign policy oriented towards humanitarian and peacekeeping causes. To that end, Iceland provided aid and expertise to various NATO-led interventions in [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]], and [[Gulf War|Iraq]].

Iceland joined the [[European Economic Area]] in 1994, after which the economy was greatly diversified and liberalised. International economic relations increased further after 2001 when Iceland's newly deregulated banks began to raise great amounts of [[external debt]], contributing to a 32 percent increase in Iceland's [[gross national income]] between 2002 and 2007.

====Economic boom and crisis====
{{further|2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis|2009 Icelandic financial crisis protests}}
In 2003–2007, after the privatization of the banking sector under the government of [[Davíð Oddsson]], Iceland moved towards having an economy based on international investment banking and financial services. It was quickly becoming one of the most prosperous countries in the world, but was hit hard by a [[2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis|major financial crisis]]. The crisis resulted in the greatest migration from Iceland since 1887, with a net emigration of 5,000 people in 2009.

==== Since 2012 ====

Iceland's economy stabilized under the government of [[Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir]] growing by 1.6% in 2012. The centre-right [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] was returned to power in coalition with the [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]] in the 2013 election. In the following years, Iceland benefited from a surge in tourism as the country became a popular holiday destination. In 2016, Prime Minister [[Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson]] resigned after being implicated in the [[Panama Papers]] scandal. Early elections in 2016 resulted in a right-wing coalition government of the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]], [[Viðreisn]] and [[Bright Future (Iceland)|Bright Future]]. This government fell when Bright Future quit the coalition due to a scandal involving then-Prime Minister [[Bjarni Benediktsson (born 1970)|Bjarni Benediktsson]]'s father's letter of support for a convicted child sex offender. [[2017 Icelandic parliamentary election|Snap elections in October 2017]] brought to power a new coalition consisting of the Independence Party, the Progressive Party, and the [[Left-Green Movement]], headed by [[Katrín Jakobsdóttir]].

After the 2021 parliamentary [[2021 Icelandic parliamentary election|election]], the new government was, just like the previous government, a tri-party coalition of the Independence Party, the Progressive Party, and the Left-Green Movement, headed by Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir. In April 2024, Bjarni Benediktsson of the Independence party succeeded Katrín Jakobsdóttir as prime minister. In November 2024, centre-left [[Social Democratic Alliance]] became the biggest party in a [[2024 Icelandic parliamentary election|snap election]], meaning Social Democratic [[Kristrún Frostadóttir|Kristrun Frostadottir]] became the next Prime Minister of Iceland.
