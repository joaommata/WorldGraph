=== Antiquity ===
{{Main|History of ancient Lebanon}}[[File:Byblos_Libanon_2003.JPG|thumb|[[Byblos]] is believed to have been first occupied between 8800 and 7000 BC and continuously inhabited since 5000 BC, making it among [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world]]. It is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].|left]]

The [[Natufian culture]] was the first to become sedentary at around 12000 BC. 

Evidence of early settlement in Lebanon was found in [[Byblos]], considered among the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously inhabited cities]] in the world.

Lebanon was part of northern [[Canaan]], and consequently became the homeland of Canaanite descendants, the [[Phoenicia]]ns, a seafaring people based in the coastal strip of the northern [[Levant]] who spread across the Mediterranean in the first millennium BC. The most prominent Phoenician cities were [[Byblos]], [[Sidon]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. According to the [[Bible]], King [[Hiram I|Hiram of Tyre]] collaborated closely with [[Solomon]], supplying cedar logs for [[Solomon's Temple]] and sending skilled workers. The [[Canaanite languages|Phoenicians]] are credited with the invention of the [[Phoenician alphabet|oldest verified alphabet]], which subsequently inspired the [[Greek alphabet]] and the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] one thereafter.

In the 9th century BC, [[Phoenician colonies]], including [[Carthage]] in present-day [[Tunisia]] and [[Cádiz]] in present-day [[Spain]], flourished throughout the Mediterranean. Subsequently, foreign powers, starting with the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], imposed tribute and attacked non-compliant cities. The [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] took control in the 6th century BC. The Phoenician city-states were later incorporated into the empire of [[Alexander the Great]] following the [[Siege of Tyre (332 BC)|siege of Tyre in 332 BCE]]. During the frequent [[Roman–Persian Wars]] that lasted for many centuries, the [[Sasanian Empire]] occupied what is now Lebanon from 619 till 629.

=== Middle Ages ===
During the 7th century, [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Muslims conquered Syria]] from the Byzantines, incorporating the region, including modern-day Lebanon, under the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Islamic Caliphate]]. In the era of [[Uthman]]'s caliphate (644–656), Islam gained significant influence in Damascus, led by [[Mu'awiya I|Mu'awiya]], a relative of Uthman, serving as the governor. Mu'awiya sent forces to the coastal region of Lebanon, prompting conversions to Islam among the coastal population. The mountainous areas retained their Christian or other cultural practices. 

After the Islamic conquest, Mediterranean trade declined for three centuries due to conflicts with the Byzantines. The ports of Tyre, Sidon, Beirut, and Tripoli struggled to recover, sustaining small populations under [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] rule. Christians and Jews were often obligated to pay the ''[[jizya]]'', or poll tax levied on non-Muslims. These crusader states made a lasting impact on the region, though their control was limited, and the region returned to full Muslim control after two centuries following the conquest by the Mamluks.

Among the most lasting effects of the Crusades in this region was the contact between the Franks (i.e., the French) and the Maronites. Unlike most other Christian communities in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], who swore allegiance to [[Constantinople]] or other local patriarchs, the Maronites proclaimed allegiance to the Pope in Rome. As such the Franks saw them as Roman Catholic brethren. These initial contacts led to centuries of support for the Maronites from France and Italy, even after the fall of the Crusader states in the region.

=== Ottoman rule ===
{{see also|Mount Lebanon Emirate|Sidon Eyalet|Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate}}

[[File:DeirAlQamar-FakhredinePalace.jpg|thumb|[[Fakhreddine II Palace]], 17th century]]
In 1516, Lebanon became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], with governance administered indirectly through local [[emir]]s. Lebanon's area was organized into provinces: Northern and Southern Mount Lebanon, Tripoli, Baalbek and Beqaa Valley, and [[Jabal Amil]].

In 1590, Druze tribal leader [[Fakhr al-Din II]] succeeded [[Mount Lebanon Emirate#Qurqumaz (1544–1585)|Korkmaz]] in southern Mount Lebanon and quickly asserted his authority as the paramount emir of the Druze in the Shouf region. Eventually, he was appointed [[Sanjak-bey]], overseeing various Ottoman sub-provinces and tax collection. Expanding his influence extensively, he even constructed a fort in [[Palmyra Castle|Palmyra]]. 

This expansion raised concerns for Ottoman Sultan Murad IV, leading to a punitive expedition in 1633. Fakhr al-Din II was captured, imprisoned for two years, and subsequently executed in April 1635, along with one of his sons. Surviving members of his family continued to govern a reduced area under closer Ottoman supervision until the late 17th century. On the death of the [[Ahmad Ma'n|last Maan emir]], various members of the Shihab clan ruled Mount Lebanon until 1830.

While the history of Druze-Christian relations in Lebanon has generally been marked by harmony and peaceful coexistence, there were occasional periods of tension, notably during the [[1860 civil conflict in Mount Lebanon and Damascus|1860 Mount Lebanon civil war]], during which around 10,000 Christians were killed by the Druze. Shortly afterwards, the [[Emirate of Mount Lebanon]], which lasted about 400 years, was replaced by the [[Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate]], as a result of a European-Ottoman treaty called the [[Règlement Organique (Mount Lebanon)|Règlement Organique]]. The ''Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate'' (1861–1918, {{langx|ar|متصرفية جبل لبنان }}; {{langx|tr|Cebel-i Lübnan Mutasarrıflığı}}) was one of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s subdivisions following the [[Tanzimat]] reform. After 1861 there existed an autonomous Mount Lebanon with a Christian [[mutasarrıf]], which had been created as a homeland for the [[Lebanese Maronite Christians|Maronites]] under European diplomatic pressure following the 1860 massacres. The [[Maronite]] [[Catholic]]s and the [[Druze]] founded modern Lebanon in the early eighteenth century, through the ruling and social system known as the "[[Christianity and Druze|Maronite-Druze dualism]]" in Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate.

[[File:Carte du Liban d'apres les reconnaissances de la Brigade Topographique du Corps Expeditionnaire de Syrie en 1860-1861.jpg|thumb|295x295px|An 1862 map drawn by the French expedition of [[Charles-Marie-Napoléon de Beaufort d'Hautpoul|Beaufort d'Hautpoul]], later used as a template for the 1920 borders of [[Greater Lebanon]].]]

The Baalbek and Beqaa Valley and Jabal Amel was ruled intermittently by various Shia feudal families, especially the [[El Assaad Family|Al Ali Alsagheer]] in Jabal Amel that remained in power until 1865 when Ottomans took direct ruling of the region. [[Youssef Bey Karam]], a Lebanese nationalist played an influential role in Lebanon's independence during this era.

Lebanon experienced profound devastation in the [[World War I|First World War]] when the [[Ottoman Army (1861–1922)|Ottoman army]] assumed direct control, disrupting supplies and confiscating animals, ultimately leading to a severe famine.

=== French Mandate ===
Amidst the height of the [[World War I|First World War]], the [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]] of 1916, a secret pact between Britain and France, delineated Lebanon and its surrounding areas as regions open to potential French influence or control. General [[Henri Dentz]], the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] [[High commissioner]] for Syria and Lebanon, played a major role in the independence of the nation. The Vichy authorities in 1941 allowed Germany to move aircraft and supplies through [[Syria]] to [[Iraq]] where they were used against British forces. The United Kingdom, fearing that [[Nazi Germany]] would gain full control of Lebanon and [[Syria]] by pressure on the weak Vichy government, [[Syria–Lebanon campaign|sent its army into Syria and Lebanon]].

After the fighting ended in Lebanon, General [[Charles de Gaulle]] visited the area. Under political pressure from both inside and outside Lebanon, de Gaulle recognized the independence of Lebanon. On 26 November 1941, General [[Georges Catroux]] announced that Lebanon would become independent under the authority of the [[Free French]] government. Elections were held in 1943 and on 8 November 1943 the new Lebanese government unilaterally abolished the mandate. The French reacted by imprisoning the new government. Lebanese nationalists declared a provisional government, and the British diplomatically intervened on their behalf. In the face of intense British pressure and protests by Lebanese nationalists, the French reluctantly released the government officials on 22 November 1943, and accepted the independence of Lebanon.[[File:Beirut's Martyrs' Square during celebrations marking the release by the French of Lebanon's government from Rashayya prison on November 22, 1943, the day of Lebanon's independence. Adib Ibrahim.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Martyrs' Square, Beirut|Martyrs' Square in Beirut]] during celebrations marking the release by the French of Lebanon's government from [[Rashayya prison]] on 22 November 1943]]

=== Independence from Free France ===
Following the end of World War II in Europe the French mandate may be said to have been terminated without any formal action on the part of the [[League of Nations]] or its successor the [[United Nations]]. The mandate was ended by the declaration of the mandatory power, and of the new states themselves, of their independence, followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers, culminating in formal admission to the United Nations. Article 78 of the UN Charter ended the status of tutelage for any member state: "The trusteeship system shall not apply to territories which have become Members of the United Nations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality." So when the UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the [[United Nations Charter]] by the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]], as both Syria and Lebanon were founding member states, the French mandate for both was legally terminated on that date and full independence attained. The last French troops withdrew in December 1946.

Lebanon's unwritten [[National Pact]] of 1943 required that its president be Maronite Christian, its [[Speaker (politics)|speaker of the parliament]] to be a [[Lebanese Shia Muslims|Shia Muslim]], its prime minister be [[Lebanese Sunni Muslims|Sunni Muslim]], and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament and the Deputy Prime Minister be [[Lebanese Greek Orthodox Christians|Greek Orthodox]].

Lebanon's history since independence has been marked by alternating periods of political stability and turmoil interspersed with prosperity built on [[Beirut]]'s position as a regional center for finance and trade.

In May 1948, Lebanon supported neighboring Arab countries in a [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|war against Israel]]. While some irregular forces crossed the border and carried out minor skirmishes against Israel, it was without the support of the Lebanese government, and Lebanese troops did not officially invade.{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=524}} Lebanon agreed to support the forces with covering artillery fire, armored cars, volunteers and logistical support.{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=259}} On 5–6 June 1948, the Lebanese army – led by the then [[Ministry of National Defense (Lebanon)|Minister of National Defense]], [[Majid Arslan|Emir Majid Arslan]] – captured [[Al-Malkiyya]]. This was Lebanon's only success in the war.{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=260}}
[[File:General Fouad Chehab.png|thumb|230x230px|Under [[Fouad Chehab]], Lebanon experienced economic growth and sectarian harmony]]
100,000 [[Palestinians in Lebanon|Palestinians]] fled to Lebanon because of the war. Israel [[Palestinian right of return|did not permit their return]] after the cease-fire. As of 2017, between 174,000 and 450,000 Palestinian refugees live in Lebanon with about half in refugee camps (although these are often decades old and resemble neighborhoods). Often Palestinians are legally barred from owning property or performing certain occupations. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], Palestinian refugees in Lebanon live in "appalling social and economic conditions."

In 1958, during the last months of President [[Camille Chamoun]]'s term, [[1958 Lebanon crisis|an insurrection]] broke out, instigated by Lebanese Muslims who wanted to make Lebanon a member of the [[United Arab Republic]]. Chamoun requested assistance, and 5,000 [[United States Marines]] were briefly dispatched to Beirut on 15 July. After the crisis, a new government was formed, led by the popular former general [[Fouad Chehab]].

Until the early 1970s, Lebanon was dubbed "the Switzerland of the Middle East" for its unique status as both a snow-capped holiday destination and secure banking hub for [[Gulf Arab]]s. Beirut was also nicknamed "the Paris of the Middle East."

=== Civil War and occupation ===
{{Main|Lebanese Civil War|Syrian occupation of Lebanon|Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon}}[[File:Civil war Lebanon map 1983a.gif|thumb|Map showing power balance in Lebanon, 1983: {{legend|#008000|controlled by [[Syria]]}}{{legend|#ff00ff|controlled by Christian groups}}{{legend|#ffff00|controlled by Israel}}{{legend|#0080ff|controlled by the UN}}|left]]With the [[Black September in Jordan|defeat]] of the [[PLO|Palestine Liberation Organization]] in [[Jordan]], many Palestinian militants relocated to Lebanon in 1970 and increased their [[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon|armed campaign]] against Israel. The relocation also led to sectarian tensions between Palestinians versus the Maronites and other Lebanese factions. In 1975, following increasing tensions, largely boosted by [[Fatahland|Palestinian militant presence]] in the south, a full-scale civil war broke out in Lebanon. The war pitted a coalition of Christian groups against the joint forces of the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization|PLO]], left-wing Druze and Muslim militias. In October 1976 the [[Arab League]] agreed to establish a predominantly Syrian [[Arab Deterrent Force]], which was charged with restoring calm.  [[File:Green Line, Beirut 1982.jpg|thumb|The [[Green Line (Lebanon)|Green Line]] that separated west and east Beirut, 1982|left]]PLO attacks from Lebanon into Israel in 1977 and 1978 escalated tensions between two countries. On 11 March 1978, Fatah militants in northern Israel, hijacked two passenger buses, that killed 37 Israelis before being killed in a firefight with Israeli forces. Israel [[Operation Litani|invaded]] Lebanon four days later and occupied most of the area south of the [[Litani River]]. The [[UN Security Council|UNSC]] passed the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 425|Resolution 425]] calling for immediate Israeli withdrawal and creating the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon|U.N Interim Force in Lebanon]] (UNIFIL), charged with attempting to establish peace. Israeli forces withdrew later in 1978, but retained control of the southern region by managing a {{convert|12|mi|km|0|adj=mid|-wide|order=flip}} security zone along the border. These positions were held by the [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA), a Christian militia under the leadership of Major [[Saad Haddad]] backed by Israel. The Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]], compared the plight of the Christian minority in southern Lebanon (then about 5% of the population in SLA territory) to that of European Jews during World War II. 

The PLO routinely [[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon|attacked]] Israel during the period of the cease-fire, with over 270 documented attacks. People in Galilee regularly had to leave their homes during these shellings. Documents captured in PLO headquarters after the invasion showed they had come from Lebanon. PLO leader [[Yasser Arafat]] refused to condemn these attacks on the grounds that the cease-fire was only relevant to Lebanon. In April 1980 the killing of two UNIFIL soldiers and the injuring of a third by the South Lebanon Army, near [[At Tiri]], in the buffer zone led to a [[At Tiri incident|military conflict]]. On 17 July 1981, Israeli aircraft bombed multi-story apartment buildings in Beirut that contained offices of PLO associated groups. The Lebanese delegate to the United Nations Security Council claimed that 300 civilians had been killed and 800 wounded. The bombing led to worldwide condemnation, and a temporary embargo on the export of U.S. aircraft to Israel. 

In August 1981, defense minister [[Ariel Sharon]] began to draw up plans to attack PLO military infrastructure in West Beirut, where PLO headquarters and command bunkers were located. In 1982, [[PLO in Lebanon|PLO]] attacks from Lebanon on Israel led to [[1982 Lebanon War|an Israeli invasion]], aiming to support Lebanese forces in driving out the PLO. A [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|multinational force]] of American, French and Italian contingents (joined in 1983 by a British contingent) were deployed in Beirut after [[Siege of Beirut|the Israeli siege of the city]], to supervise the evacuation of the PLO. The civil war re-emerged in September 1982 after the assassination of President [[Bachir Gemayel]], an Israeli ally, and subsequent fighting. During this time a number of sectarian massacres occurred, such as in [[Sabra and Shatila massacre|Sabra and Shatila]], and in [[War of the Camps|several refugee camps]]. The multinational force was withdrawn in the spring of 1984, following [[1983 Beirut barracks bombings|a devastating bombing attack]] during the previous year.

During the early 1980s, [[Hezbollah]], a Shiite Islamist militant group and political party, came into existence through the efforts of Shiite clerics who were [[Hezbollah–Iran relations|financially supported and trained by Iran]]. Arising in the aftermath of the 1982 war and drawing inspiration from the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution in Iran]], Hezbollah actively engaged in combat against Israel as well as [[suicide attack]]s, [[car bomb]]ings and assassinations. Their objectives encompassed eliminating Israel, fighting for the Shia cause in the civil war, ending Western presence in Lebanon, and establishing a Shiite [[Khomeinism|Khomeinist]] [[Islamic state]].

In the late 1980s, as [[Amine Gemayel]]'s second term as president drew to an end, the Lebanese [[Lebanese pound|pound]] collapsed. At the end of 1987 US$1 was worth £L500. This meant the legal minimum wage was worth just $17 a month. Most goods in shops were priced in dollars. A [[Save the Children]] director estimated that 200,000–300,000 children were in need of assistance and were living almost entirely on bread, which was subsidized by the government. Those who could relied on foreign assistance. Hezbollah was receiving about $3–5 million a month from [[Iran]]. In September 1988, the Parliament failed to elect a successor to President Gemayel as a result of differences between the Christians, Muslims, and Syrians. The Arab League Summit of May 1989 led to the formation of a Saudi–Moroccan–Algerian committee to solve the crisis. 

On 16 September 1989 the committee issued a peace plan which was accepted by all. A ceasefire was established, the ports and airports were re-opened and refugees began to return. Nearly a million civilians were displaced by the war, and some never returned. Parts of Lebanon were left in ruins. The agreement has still not been implemented in full and Lebanon's political system continues to be divided along sectarian lines. 

Conflict between Israel and Lebanese militants continued, leading to a series of violent events and clashes including the [[Qana massacre]]. In May 2000, Israeli forces fully withdrew from Lebanon. Since then, 25 May is regarded by the Lebanese as the [[Resistance and Liberation Day (Lebanon)|Liberation Day]].[[File:Cedar_Revolution_Demonstrators.jpg|thumb|Demonstrations in Lebanon triggered by the assassination of Rafik Hariri on 14 February 2005]]On 14 February 2005, former Prime Minister [[Rafic Hariri]] was assassinated in a [[car bomb]] explosion. Leaders of the [[March 14 Alliance]] accused [[Syria]] of the attack, while Syria and the [[March 8 Alliance]] claimed that Israel was behind the assassination. It marked the beginning of a series of assassinations that resulted in the death of many prominent Lebanese figures and triggered the [[Cedar Revolution|demonstrations]] which demanded the withdrawal of the Syrian troops from Lebanon and the establishment of an international commission to investigate the assassination. Under the pressure from the West, Syria began withdrew from Lebanon by 26 April. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1595|UNSC Resolution 1595]] called for an investigation into the assassination. The [[United Nations International Independent Investigation Commission|UN International Independent Investigation Commission]] published preliminary findings on 20 October 2005 in the [[Mehlis report]], which cited indications that the assassination was organized by Syrian and Lebanese intelligence services.

=== Post-war revolution and spillover of the Syrian conflict ===
{{main|Syrian civil war spillover in Lebanon|2011 Lebanese protests|17 October Revolution}}
On 12 July 2006, [[Hezbollah]] launched a series of rocket attacks and [[2006 Hezbollah cross-border raid|raids]] into Israeli territory, where they killed three Israeli soldiers and captured two others. Israel responded with [[airstrike]]s and [[artillery]] fire on targets in Lebanon, and a ground invasion of [[southern Lebanon]], resulting in the [[2006 Lebanon War]]. The conflict was officially ended by the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|UNSC Resolution 1701]] on 14 August 2006, which ordered a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, and the disarmament of Hezbollah. Some 1,191 Lebanese and 160 Israelis were [[Casualties of the 2006 Lebanon War|killed]] in the conflict. Beirut's southern suburb was heavily damaged by Israeli airstrikes.

In 2007, the [[Nahr al-Bared]] refugee camp became the center of the [[2007 Lebanon conflict]] between the Lebanese Army and [[Fatah al-Islam]]. At least 169 soldiers, 287 insurgents and 47 civilians were killed in the battle. Funds for the reconstruction of the area have been slow to materialize. Between 2006 and 2008, [[2006–2008 Lebanese political protests|a series of protests]] led by groups opposed to the pro-Western Prime Minister [[Fouad Siniora]] demanded the creation of a national unity government, over which the mostly Shia opposition groups would have veto power. When [[Émile Lahoud]]'s presidential term ended in October 2007, the opposition refused to vote for a successor unless a power-sharing deal was reached, leaving Lebanon without a president.

On 7 May 2008, [[Hezbollah]] and [[Amal Movement|Amal]] forces, sparked by a government declaration that Hezbollah's communications network was illegal, seized western [[Beirut]], the most important Sunni center in Lebanon, leading to an [[2008 Lebanon conflict|intrastate military conflict]]. The Lebanese government denounced the violence as a coup attempt. At least 62 people died in the resulting clashes between pro-government and opposition militias. [[Michel Suleiman]] became president and a national unity government was established, granting a veto to the opposition.
[[File:Shatila_-_street_view_(3).jpg|thumb|Over 20,000 [[Syrians in Lebanon|Syrian]] and [[Palestinian refugees]] live in the [[Shatila refugee camp]] on the outskirts of Beirut.]]
In early January 2011, the [[Lebanese government of November 2009|national unity government]] collapsed due to growing tensions stemming from the [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon]], which was expected to indict Hezbollah members for the Hariri assassination. The parliament elected [[Najib Mikati]], the candidate for the Hezbollah-led [[March 8 Alliance]], Prime Minister of Lebanon, making him responsible for forming a new government. Hezbollah leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]] later accused Israel of assassinating Hariri. A report leaked by the [[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)|Al-Akhbar]] newspaper in November 2010 stated that Hezbollah had drafted plans for a violent takeover of the country in case the Special Tribunal for Lebanon issued an indictment against its members.

In 2012, the [[Syrian civil war]] threatened to spill over in Lebanon, causing [[Syrian civil war spillover in Lebanon|incidents of sectarian violence]] and armed clashes between [[Lebanese Sunni Muslims|Sunnis]] and [[Alawites in Lebanon|Alawites]] in Tripoli. According to [[UNHCR]], the number of [[Refugees of the Syrian civil war|Syrian refugees]] in Lebanon increased from around 250,000 in early 2013 to 1,000,000 in late 2014. In 2013, The [[Lebanese Forces Party]], the [[Kataeb Party]] and the [[Free Patriotic Movement]] voiced concerns that the country's sectarian based political system is being undermined by the influx of Syrian refugees. On 6 May 2015, [[UNHCR]] suspended registration of Syrian refugees at the request of the Lebanese government. In February 2016, the Lebanese government signed the Lebanon Compact, granting a minimum of €400 million of support for refugees and vulnerable Lebanese citizens. As of October 2016, the government estimated that the country hosts 1.5 million Syrians.

=== National crisis (2019–present) ===
{{Main|17 October Revolution|Lebanese liquidity crisis}}
[[File:-i---i- (49140926886).jpg|thumb|The [[Second Arab Spring|2019 protests]] were non-sectarian, crossing the Sunni–Shia Muslim / Christian sociological and religious divide.]]
On 17 October 2019, the first of a series of mass civil demonstrations erupted; they were initially triggered by planned taxes on gasoline, tobacco and online phone calls such as through [[WhatsApp]], but quickly expanded into a country-wide condemnation of [[sectarian]] rule, a [[Lebanese liquidity crisis|stagnant economy and liquidity crisis]], unemployment, endemic corruption in the public sector, and failures from the government to provide basic services such as electricity, water and sanitation.
[[File:WomenLine RiadElSolh 19Nov2019.jpg|thumb|Women protesters forming a line between riot police and protesters in Riad el Solh, [[Beirut]]; 19 November 2019]]
As a result of the protests, Lebanon entered a political crisis, with Prime Minister [[Saad Hariri]] tendering his resignation and echoing protestors' demands for a government of independent specialists. Other politicians targeted by the protests have remained in power. On 19 December 2019, former Minister of Education [[Hassan Diab]] was designated the next prime minister and tasked with forming a new cabinet. Protests and acts of [[civil disobedience]] have since continued, with protesters denouncing and condemning the designation of Diab as prime minister. Lebanon is suffering the worst [[Lebanese liquidity crisis|economic crisis]] in decades. Lebanon is the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to see its inflation rate exceed 50% for 30 consecutive days, according to Steve H. Hanke, professor of applied economics at the Johns Hopkins University. On 4 August 2020, [[2020 Beirut explosion|an explosion at the port of Beirut]], Lebanon's main port, destroyed the surrounding areas, killing over 200 people, and injuring thousands more. The cause of the explosion was later determined to be 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been unsafely stored, and accidentally set on fire that Tuesday afternoon. Protests resumed within days following the explosion, which resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister Hassan Diab and his [[Cabinet of Hassan Diab|cabinet]] on 10 August 2020, nonetheless continuing to stay in office in a [[Caretaker government|caretaker capacity]]. Demonstrations continued into 2021 with Lebanese blocking the roads with burned tires protesting against the poverty and the economic crisis.

On 11 March 2021 the [[Ministry of Energy and Water (Lebanon)|caretaker minister of energy]] [[Raymond Ghajar]] warned that Lebanon was threatened with "total darkness" at the end of March if no money was secured to buy fuel for power stations. In August 2021, a [[2021 Akkar explosion|large fuel explosion in northern Lebanon]] killed 28 people.  September saw the formation of a [[Third Cabinet of Najib Mikati|new cabinet]] led by former prime minister [[Najib Mikati]]. On 9 October 2021, the entire nation lost power for 24 hours after its two main power stations ran out of power due to the currency and fuel shortage. Days later, [[2021 Beirut clashes|sectarian violence in Beirut]] killed a number of people in the deadliest clashes in the country since 2008. By January 2022, [[BBC News]] reported that the crisis in Lebanon had deepened further, with the value of the [[Lebanese pound]] plummeting and a [[2022 Lebanese general election|scheduled general election expected to be delayed indefinitely]]. The postponement of parliamentary elections was said to prolong the political deadlock in the country. The [[European Parliament]] called Lebanon's present situation a 'man-made disaster caused by a handful of men across the political class'.

In May 2022, Lebanon held its first [[2022 Lebanese general election|election]] since a painful economic crisis dragged it to the brink of becoming a [[failed state]]. Lebanon's crisis has been so severe that more than 80 percent of the population is now considered poor by the [[United Nations]]. In the election the Shia Muslim [[Hezbollah]] movement (and its allies) lost their parliamentary majority. Hezbollah did not lose any of its seats, but its allies lost seats. Hezbollah's ally, President [[Michel Aoun]]'s [[Free Patriotic Movement]], was no longer the biggest Christian party after the election. A rival Christian party, the [[Lebanese Forces]] led by [[Samir Geagea]], became the largest Christian-based party in parliament. The Sunni [[Future Movement]], led by former prime minister [[Saad Hariri]], did not participate in the election, leaving a political vacuum for other Sunni politicians to fill. The Lebanese crisis became so severe that multiple boats left the coast holding migrants in a desperate run from the country. Many proved unsuccessful and fatal. In April 2022, 6 people died and around 50 people were rescued after an overloaded boat sunk in [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]]. And on 22 September, at least 94 people were killed when a boat carrying migrants from Lebanon capsized off Syria's coast. 9 people survived. Many were declared missing and some were found either dead or injured. Dead bodies were sent to nearby hospitals. 40 people are still missing as of 24 September. On 1 February 2023, the [[Banque du Liban|central bank]] of Lebanon devalued the [[Lebanese pound]] by 90% amid the ongoing [[financial crisis]]. This was the first time Lebanon had devalued its official exchange rate in 25 years. As of 2023, Lebanon is considered to have become a [[failed state]], suffering from chronic  poverty, economic mismanagement and a banking collapse.

The [[Gaza war]] sparked a [[Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present)|renewed Israel–Hezbollah conflict]]. Hezbollah has said it will not stop attacking Israel until Israel ceases its attacks in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]. Starting with the Israeli [[2024 Lebanon pager explosions|explosion of Lebanese pagers and walkie talkies]] in September 2024, the conflict escalated severely, with the [[September 2024 Lebanon strikes|23 September 2024 Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon]] killing at least 558 people, and sparking a mass exodus from southern Lebanon. On 27 September 2024, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was [[2024 Hezbollah headquarters strike|killed]] in an Israeli airstrike. On 1 October 2024, [[2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon|Lebanon was invaded by Israel]] with the objective of destroying infrastructure belonging to Hezbollah in the south of the country. In November 2024, a [[2024 Israel–Lebanon ceasefire agreement|ceasefire deal]] was signed between Israel and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah to end 13 months of conflict. According to the agreement, Hezbollah was given 60 days to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon and Israeli forces were obliged to withdraw from the area over the same period. [[Fall of the Assad regime|The fall of Assad's Baathist regime]] in Syria was  another blow to its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, which was already weakened because of Israeli military actions. The Syrian regime change in December 2024 was said to start a new chapter in Lebanese politics. In January 2025, [[Joseph Aoun]], the Lebanese army commander, was elected Lebanese 14th [[President of Lebanon|president]] after a two-year vacancy. In February 2025, Prime Minister [[Nawaf Salam]], former president of the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), formed a new government of 24 ministers after two-year caretaker cabinet. On 26 February 2025,  Lebanon's government of  Nawaf Salam won a confidence vote in parliament.
